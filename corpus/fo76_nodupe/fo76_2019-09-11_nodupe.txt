Yup, just re-color the Bog Wanderer mask

Junkies plasma caster with a 'the nailer' for backup

Would love to see them going commando...
---
Haha yea funny thing about this is that I stopped playing a week before the Unstoppable Monster was in the survival quest.
---
More for them, but a bit simpler overall to implement. I have done a few maps for simple things like this before and it really isnt a lot of work once the enums and properties are in place.
---
Even something as simple as a photo album that people could walk up to and prompt.
---
Whitesprings gets me every time. Whitesprings is death. Thanks so much!!!

Taquitos a la Scorched

Probably a limb damage or 33 vats effect causing magic damage.
---
I’ve had ppl message me after visiting that day things like nice camp bro or how’d you get that
---
Brilliant idea. Thanks!!
---
A traveling phototron? Like a protectron but a mobile processor...
---
This is pretty close to what I have, I would need to log on to double check but it gives you an idea and I know you said no mutations but I was just flushing out what I had done.

---
So, they’ll say something nice tomorrow then.  Got it.
---
Yeah my armor sucks most of the time, currently just wearing a skeleton costume... that should help.. lol
---
You probably got 15 magic weapons and didn't even know it though.
---
This should help out a ton. Thank you so much!!
---
IN THE GRIM DARKNESS OF THE FAR FUTURE, THERE ARE ONLY **NERFS**
---
Yeah I'm planning on getting mutations but I need to get some syrims first but I'm focusing on armor mods rn
---
I don’t recall a ‘Bomb Drop Event’ on the roadmap. Got a link?
---
I use handmades and fixers. Bloodied explosive lvc, bloodied ffr lvc, AA ffr, furious ffr, and vampires ffr. All work exceedingly well.
---
Whats happening to rifleman? Most everyone runs commando instead anyway. Why nerf it
---
So many higher level players have been so kind. Even throwing me great modded weapons when I had zero guns and ammo.
---
The iron brawler build type. I can't think of much outside of say, nukashine, since it doubles unarmed damage. Twisted muscles and either unstable isotope or electrically charged for mutations, as well as speed demon and marsupial, combined with the kinetic dynamo chest, high mobility is incredible with any form or melee, and is kinda needed for power armor.
---
The Quad gamma gun I use to hunt wanted players. I named it the Martian Manhunter.
---
Thanks pal, this helps a ton!
---
The prohibition on secondary accounts has to do with online/competitive games. It has nothing to do with mules or otherwise. As long as you aren't cheating, duping, hacking, grieving, or otherwise violating the code of conduct, youre fine. The context is in relation to competitive gaming and bans "unsportsmanlike conduct such as the use of secondary accounts." 
---
It was taken out of context and now the reddits are full of doomscrollers.
---
Deal, Gt: Lindbloom826
---
Huntersville to Wes Tek to Radio Array and hop
---
I remember this struggle all too well when I was lower level ...
---
The way this game is designed, junk is found in places you'd expect it. Military ammo bags are a good source, so check military bases, outposts, etc. 
---
If you're on PC I can show you some places to find it.
---
The extra mobility is being covered by mods and perks but the mutations I'm still trying to figure out
---
A collectatron set to junk can help.  as far as things to scrap you're looking for a military duct tape and ammo bags.  I think some moal miners have a piece of their garb on them as well but I can't remember if that's correct.  Honestly with my robot searching all the time I get most of it that way.
---
After reading most of these recent comments I’ve realized that it’s definitely a plus to be at a higher level. I just achieved so much more much faster in Fallout 4 so I was I expecting the same. Thanks!!
---
Or trying to fix the nuke code issues so they can gloat about it a little for filler material.
---
[removed]
---
it sure would make trading easier. just screenshot your inventory of stuff to trade and put it in a frame.
---
I got into a fight with two of those level 50 scorchbeasts yesterday, several level 68 scorched and a bunch of robots near The Thorn, killed everything but one scorchbeast who flew off as fast as it could. I think that particular one was probably a mutated chicken.
---
Ah well, I guess that makes sense lol. Unfortunately I’m limited to ps4.
---
[bomb drop event is in the fall with one wasteland](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/)
---
There are still a zillion presents out there. I found a bag full of booze and mounted head plans today outside the Pick.
---
Awesome! I’ll definitely look into that and thanks for naming some pieces to look out for :)
---
Depending on where you are in the game, a nice easy run through Camp McClintock can net you about 4-6 ammo bags but Fort Defiance definitely offers more but takes a little more time and may not be suitable at lower levels
---
I play for two or three hours today, did it four times. And I logged off when another nuke was being launched.
---
So, not really.
---
Equip the fireworks and fire away.
---
Yeah thats similar to my build at the time of typing this
---
Bloodied Gauss mini
---
The loot pool is polluted with so much trash. I've been spending all my scrip trying to craft one useful armor piece and it's all mutant slayers.
---
Idk, we did 2 yesterday and 1 so far tonight...
---
On PC
---
This post made me double check the date to make sure it wasn't already October. This pandemic has me not only losing my mind, but also my days.
---
SBQ and Earle already do this. Assassin's and Sentinels/Cavalier already does this. Power Armor already does this. Emergency Protocols already does this. Dodgy, Blocker, Serendipity, Lone Wanderer, Empath and Grounded already do this.
---
Do you want like 99% damage reduction or something?
---
[deleted]
---
To add onto this
---
Not through the atom store
---
You can also get some if you do the circuit of the brotherhood outposts in the bog. Ultimately though you will want to attend queen fights if they happen on your server so you can get repair kits, which save you from having to hunt ballistics fiber.
---
Thanks for all of the information! I had a feeling some of those were "one time only" but I couldn't find anything definitive so I appreciate all of the input. Anymore that come to mind please add and thanks again!
---
I mean, I'll take it off your hands &gt;\_&gt;
---
At night time go to dyer chemical and look in the creek next to it they should spawn there..they will glow green
---
I am going to go counter to many here and say three things:
---
1. Stop repairing so often.
---
2. Unless it is a really useful legendary, scrip or scrap the armor when it breaks rather than repairing it.
---
3. Take part in some scorched earths and waste all the ammo you have on the queen - 1 thousand damage is generally at most about 500 shots. Then you will get repair kits - they're mostly not useful at higher levels, but are really awesome at lower levels.
---
Doing these steps will allow you to naturally build your stockpile of ballistic fibre and remove a bit of the grind frustration.
---
Why is this a complaint? I hate posts like these, they only "dumb down" the game for the most unecessary and stupid reasons ever. What do you even have to say about all the other grindy games where items could take weeks if not months to get, people should stop being whinny ffs
---
I’ve tried that to no avail :(
---
I am not positive but I thought Grahm sold this occasionally.

---
'grats and a nice drop!
---
Super, out of this world impressive!
---
Your right! I didn’t even think about that bro
---
Not sure then they spawn there all the time for me
---
I bet that’s a fun one. Hungry little fellow I bet.
---
Any high base damage weapon is gonna be hit a lot less.
---
I never use explosive shotguns as for me it seems that the explosions bug out my damage and I end up sometimes doing absolutely nothing
---
So the only known/verified/guaranteed spawn is during the mission where you first craft them. Anytime someone on the server is doing that mission they spawn in the river near dyer chemical.  Normally people just suggest server hopping as once the player in the mission flushes the chemicals they just show up and persist for some period of time for everyone, however given the large drop off of players after the season ended (which I imagine is only exacerbated with the inability to launch nukes) it’s might take a while to find a server where they’ve popped
---
There are people who say that they also spawn during the “Queen of the Swamp” event, however I have never seen them during the few times I’ve done that event so ymmv
---
It was the plus 50 limb damage I think!
---
Loan wanderer, caps for trash! lol
---
Ah, yes. Many thanks, yes.
---
Still on?
---
I’ve gotten a spare for my heavy critter build (heavy gunner + crits). Figure in low level zones I’ll just use it to do deal with trash, even in one wasteland.
---
What PA are you going to use and are you on xbox? If you are on xbox I may be able to hook you up. I have mods and I own a lot of the PA plans.
---
That’s what I’m saying! And I realized that the plus 50 limb damage is on the non explosive, should I just use the TS?
---
Well those one idiots did show up at Area 51
---
Just added you
---
Yes add me my GT is cozyxhugo
---
I'm using the X-01 power armor and I'm on Xbox. However I can buy plans at the white spring bunker, thanks though
---
Holy crap this idea is so played out, we’ve been asking for it since day one.
---
I had a guy tell me "you could sell that gun for like 2000 caps". That's funny, because no one has bought it in the last two weeks at 500 caps..
---
More like any tse was the rage back then
---
Haha! When that happens I pretend the enemy has serendipity equipped. It's only fair I suppose.
---
This roll is underrated.  I use a 2* version of this and with zero perk cards boosting my damage will one-shot all whitespring ghouls.  If they are glowing, all you need is rank 3 glow sight.  If you jump around with marsupial and vats everything and get faster reload from scattershot or firework mines, you will have a great time.  Consider donning blocker's armor to further increase your vats usage as well.
---
No no we need more floors. Wallpapers have gotten it good.
---
Then they nerfed shotguns
---
Yea... Nah... If a MFer can make a gun with a single part from every weapon in the game and one shot the entire server and make my cat jump this opens a pandora's box of griefing and abuse. Maybe private modded servers in the future.
---
My first experience was taking the workshop at the junkyard, I thought it was like Fallout 4, got the usual attack and another player came and helped, I sent a team invite he joined me and gave me some cranberry cobbler (which spoiled because I hadn't figured things out yet) and a legendary axe. I know what you mean about chat, my laptop doesn't run 76 very well so I sometimes play World of Warships on it. Now, there isn't really a 'chat' that I've figured out, similar to 76, except a voice speaks what the icon is. This guy was spamming that the whole match until he got sunk, best thing that happened that game.
---
This jet pack is crazy!! Thank you Rammadeus for the help!
---
The lore you are claiming was retconned was misinterpreted from the Fallout Bible, which is not canon.
---
I just remember the baby rage of when the nerf was coming and people were crying that it'd forever ruin the game and that players would drop off massively and then it pretty much amounts to nothing.
---
Not dissimilar to what's happening now with the damage nerfs.
---
I just got a bffr handmade from her today! I want to thank everyone for the grind so we can get this sale !
---
Ymmv?
---
This is true in order to just continue. Just going to have to do the other stuff I mentioned at some point and hopefully can get the inoculation to work without jumping through hoops.  Hopefully that gets fixed on Tuesday though.
---
What's the 1000 damage threshold?
---
Junikes FFR flamer. Very effective in monongah mine. I couldnt imagine using and explosive version like people do, the fire is what makes it for me and it's plenty powerful.
---
Kinda agree here.   It's accuracy is crap even with long barrels and the best recoil.   I much prefer combat shotguns whether I choose to make them automatic or not.  I have a bloodied double barrel which is fun at times,  but it's really too slow for multiple enemies when they come at you in hordes.   But if you enjoy it, have at it!
---
Try that shotgun in vats on torso and it might be better.
---
I though dirt==dirt.  What about my bramble farm?!
---
This but any vendor. I was close to done with processing scrip and someone decides to attack me because they couldn't wait the 3 seconds when they got there.
---
Just walked off for a toilet break and made some tea. They got the hint.
---
Alright.
---
One way I found to get my friends list was to log into another game with Beth login ie. Eso, fallout 4, or login using the Beth app on your phone but make sure to login via playstation account, seems like it's a security key,token issue simulator to the unable to login glitch, had the same problem after the last update on PS4, also go to ps4 system menu and try the redownload licenses, may work for you but at least it's a couple things to try
---
They're probably just blocking you so you can't see them. So if you're clearing servers you're just not liked at all.
---
Yeah i got rid of my explosive shotgun loong ago. Plus as shotguns are short range using the explosive effect will probably hurt you more than your enemy
---
Thanks! This did eventually work, but it did take a while. The explanation of why the solution works was really helpful too!
---
In our hearts,he's dead.
---
TBH we don't get to fight any Enclave, Free States, Responders or Fire Breathers.
---
Heck, you need to deliberately drop reputation with Settlers and Raiders to get them to aggro you at all.
---
My pleasure
---
Great.  Spread the word if you see the same thing.
---
Ah, right. I haven’t heard anything concrete yet. We’ll probably have an ITV that gives more details soon. Perhaps even tomorrow.
---
If spirit Halloween is already open, they can start dropping Halloween
---
I'm curious whether it could be timing related. I've gone to Dyer Chemical during the time when Heart of the Swamp was an active event and strangler blooms have been present... but when I attended Heart of the Swamp and then stopped by Dyer Chemical afterward, I didn't see very many.
---
"your mileage may vary". It means essentially your experience may be different to someone elses
---
The problem is that with this, PC players can fill their photo folder with inappropriate images and put them up
---
Oh yes, you have the case of the brendas. Control alt delete.
---
It'll take me forever to rank the cards up, but I'm definitely taking advantage of them to make respeccing easier.
---
Ppl will tell you it's false, but personally this is how i do. I'm even trying to make a video about it right now but the Youtube app keep crashing when i try to edit my videos. ( I have no Pc )
---
Wait for the "Heart of the Swamp" event. As soon as you see it poping in the left corner of your screen...head to "Dyer Chimical"...you should see a bunch to your right near the lil river.
---
Sometime they do not spawn, but most of the time they do !
---
The mounted plans drop in the atlas plans, I’ve gotten a few and LOTS of booze (which OEs me so much even being a foodie build.)
---
You also get some of the more common ones from the Stings And Things quest.
---
The inconsistencies you are referencing are from the Fallout Bible, which is not canon. The lore in question was misinterpreted by wiki editors and the source clearly does not even conflict with 76.
---
I forgot to mention, if you havent switched to automatic weapons, like the combat or laser rifle with appropriate mods, your damage output is more limited in that set of levels.
---
Oh and tap grahm for his plans!!!! Totally forgot about that.  You also get nifty plans as rewards for outfits, backpacks, flags, etc.
---
They removed it because they feel having PVP almost no one cares about is more important than letting us not spawn under a cliff when going to a camp. Griefers will use the mats to kill people so we can't have nice things.
---
Because people trapped there spawn point
---
Maybe cuz it would make death trap camps too easy.
---
That's Nuclear Winter
---
"Thisisthewardenseemssomeofourprisonershave escaped" seems exactly how it was typed.
---
If they couldn't communicate with LH, how were they able to communicate with Appalachia?
---
The plot thickens.
---
I have no idea what you are talking about, but I do know it has nothing to do with my post.
---
Its been like that since release sadly. Its my favorite outfit in game and I cant really use it.
---
Yeah I haven't heard anything from any Source yet but just a funny idea having the bomb drop event on the day the bombs dropped
---
Lol
---
Been a bug since launch I believe, they still count as an outfit and replace all your armor
---
Everyone was saying AA is the new thing, but how did that work out!?!  I’m starting to hear the same thing again, but Bloodied will still be king and TSE will make a come back!  I’ll knock the dust off the TSE HM!
---
That is the amount of damage you need to do to the Scorchbeast Queen to be able to loot her body upon her death.
---
You get:  
---
2 guaranteed legendary weapons (1 for event completion, one from her body)  
---
4(I think) stable fluxes  
---
Repair Kits  
---
Other random loot  
---
Treasury Notes  
---
Worth 500 bullets any day of the week
---
There's good and bad to be had with this game. I do think the good outweighs the bad, and tbh I feel like this game has great character, locations, items, weapons, the sort. That's what keeps me playing, the personality and soul of Fallout's universe/lore. Now that we got an MMO version of it, I haven't been this hooked to an MMO since WoW, long long ago.
---
Psa: if you happen to have any extra lunchboxes, they stack xp to 100 percent. Get herbivore or carnivore for one of the 25 percent food buffs, any unyielding you can just for the set, intellect buffs, strange in numbers and herd mentality mutation, some berry mentats with chem fiend perk, and you'll get crazy xp boost (on a public building team)
---
Was that when he brought her ice. Team then threw it out the back door?
---
I had no idea there was a percentage of damage needed.
---
Oh cos it meat week, meat week Grahm love week of meat. 
---
Meat sweet, meat treat, Grahm gonna eat da meat. 
---
who gonna eat da meat? Grahm gonna eat da meat. who gonna eat da meat, humans gonna eat da meat. who not gonna eat the meat.. CHALLY! 
---
Oh cos its meat week, meat week, hmmm hmmm hm hm hm
---
I'm saying that the damage reduction you're asking for is already present on top of DR/ER values. Reworking DR/ER to do the same will make players unkillable.
---
If you don't know what I'm talking about, try out any of the things I listed.
---
Too funny, I did the chainsaw ⛓ massacre guy last year, with a flaming chainsaw, and the  hooded mask, it worked well scaring the piss out of new players 😬 😖😱  chasing after them all over the place. 
---
I just hope they fix the issues with the Halloween 🎃 event at white springs, this year. 
---
Additionally, they should do a best camp, and costume pictures on Facebook, for some atoms ⚛ rewards. 1st place gets 1500 Atoms 2nd place gets 1000, 3rd place gets 500, and runners up gets 250. And maybe a free cosmetic rewards. I know Bethesda it is comming out of your bottom line, but be kind and unwind a little. 
---
I wish you, and everyone all the best! 🙂
---
a lot of people did drop the game. I used to jump servers a lot back then and I clearly remember seeing a lot of empty worlds following the nerf.
---
White knight perk, you cant get it till level 39, maybe get a couple levels of it, it reduces the ballistic requirements for repair and makes your armor last longer.
---
I switched to the highest level (25?) that didn't require ballistic for several levels 35-39 because i couldn't keep enough materials to repair.
---
Pretty sure the hooded rags have done that since fallout 4.
---
Even though I have some great Bloodied guns, my TSE lmg is still my favorite weapon in game.
---
I’m not asking for a reduction.
---
So when you see the attack notice you can fight back immediately? 
---
I thought you might have to disable pacifist first.
---
AA is remaining a multiplicative effect, so it's a buffs of sorts. at least compared to everything else getting nerfed.
---
how it stacks against the nerfed perks still remains to be seen, but yeah. bloodied will remain the highest dps, rightfully so.
---
Great ty
---
Gotcha thanks for your input I appreciate it
---
Why are you so upset about a fruit machine currency? 
---
Why do people bother taking crap to a vendor for 1400 caps each day? A worthless currency.
---
Why do people stop playing, when they have enough fruit machine tokens for tomorrow? 
---
Who knows...maybe Bethseda likes us when we get upset at limits?
---
Is dyer chemical the only place they spawn?
---
To any and all wonder they were kind enough to let me play and it was very impressive though not thr hardest but hey it only 2 minutes. A solid A+ from me. Good job love these kind of things.
---
I have no clue what that means, but I’ll take it to heart. Lol
---
The only wallpaper I want is a true matt black so I can set up my fancy little lights in a dark room instead of eternal brightness - even in a sealed brick room it's perma twilight.
---
While I'm waiting I'll take new ceilings, there's exactly zero options for these - default or...default.
---
Hell yeah I use vats a lot! I didn’t know it counted a head as a limb!
---
Thx 👽💚
---
What you are describing in your post is already in the game under the name "damage reduction".
---
It reduces incoming damage by a set % before it is reduced further by your DR/ER.
---
A full power armor set reduces incoming damage by 42%, before it gets reduced again by DR.
---
Running Emergency Protocols will reduced the damage by another 50%. Dodgy grants 30%, Lone Wanderer 20%.
---
Df = Di × 0.58 × 0.50 × 0.70 × 0.80
---
If Di = 100 damage, then Df = 16.24 damage
---
They *can*. They *could*. Modders did in Fallout 4.
---
They probably won't, though.
---
My motion tracking missile launcher. It’s fire and forget and you can do last air bender style shots. And if you ask for missiles people usually just give them away.
---
I like helping new players.  I like to think I'm the Johnny Appleseed of Marsupial, I've probably given away thousands of them.  But some players expect that I'm there to give them anything they want and lots of it.
---
I recently helped a player by giving them a decent 3 star weapon, stims, serums, and bullets.  Then he sends me a message requesting a QE weapon.  I'm busy with the colossus and the messages keep coming.  'Are you there?'  'Can I have a QE weapon?'  'Can I have an E handmade?'  'Do you have steel?'  'Hello'.  'I need bullets'  'I need an explosive weapon'
---
First off, quality weapons  and armor rarely drop.  Don't ask for a god roll weapon because I'm lucky if one drops every 6 months.  I'm not gonna give one away to someone I just met.  I have 900 levels in the game and I have three mules weighed down by good weapons and armor and I've earned every one.
---
Second, get a headset so I don't have to continually interrupt my play to read your messages and type out replies.  It ruins the game for me.
---
Third, show some patience.  I may be too busy to help you or I may not wish to help you.
---
Finally, realize that I want to help you enjoy the game but I'm not here to solve all your problems.  Don't run by all the dead enemies and junk and then ask for steel or stims.  This game is more than just colossus' and scorch queens and you have to do the quests and work to get the resources you need.
---
We need Halloween wallpaper ☹️
---
That’s gotta be worth a ton
---
There is some disagreement about the exact number, but most agree it is \*somewhere\* around 1000.
---
Yep, was about to write the same thing.  They could implement this for your own personal display purposes, with every visitor to your CAMP just seeing a default image, but there's no way they could ever let you show them to other players.  It's begging for abuse.
---
Oswald the Outrageous comes to mind
---
No problem, I run vats rifleman and I can often cripple a leg in 1 to 2 shots, but know that at level 99, assultrons still eat me if they get the jump on me.
---
Something like warframes coloration system would be beautiful...
---
Anyone think full SS with the new rad perk will be viable in nuke zones ? I have sub 10rad/sec with ss and radshield now
---
Yes. You missed out just like I missed out.
---
Right
---
I ran 2x back to back tonight already (90 minutes playtime).  I played 4.5 hours yesterday and hopped servers maybe 10x and never saw one. Not even the blast radius from en expired ACP.
---
Yup. So many were  warned about this all over social media.
---
Seeing as how the purveyor should be a close to end game vendor. I agree the pool for weapons should not include a large amount of the junk she does. Or mayne have us beable to pock the weapon but not the effects? This way atleast we can get a weapon we want...may not be the effects....butd rather that then a nocturnal rolling pin
---
I think this with full ss will be very close to nuke zone proof . This and ammo are my first 2
---
Damage is reduced by different percents based on how high the incoming damage is. It is not a set percent. That is what I want changed. The current system favors higher damage attacks because they are less affected by damage reductions. I am saying make it work the way you are describing because it doesn’t work that way now.
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
Congrats! Many more to come. Our sequence now is Earl first and SBQ all tbe way for max legendary runs
---
If anything you are too late, you should have xmas decorations up 2 weeks before halloween.
---
I've never realised that you can sell them to npcs when they are bundled , thanks a bunch for that
---
Many of them had to be claimed in 2-3 days, sorry.
---
I believe you can only max at +15 special points from legendary perks unless that's been changed in the past two weeks. Meaning you can only have 3 +5 stats and anything else above that doesn't work.
---
They're obviously using aimbot.
---
Run baby run
---
😂😂
---
Power armor and the rad suit/stealth suit have a hidden value that reduces rads taken by a percentage, I can't remember the exact value but I remember its insanely high making it functionally more than anything else can hope to get.
---
Just wait till tuesday, swapping even more specials around will just hurt you on perk coins. Pick up a few legendary perks for what your old build needs.
---
How do you mean? The skin itself never shows the core out of it. Just looks like hes putting a core on top of another normally when no core is present to start with.
---
My pumpkin 10mm and bats minigun/AR would like to speak to you.
---
I stand corrected
---
Not npc’s, players. And it makes a casual players day to come across one of them at a fair price
---
Just did a nuke 2 hours ago on alpha solo,  code worked
---
It's a bigger glass canon build than bloodied and bloodied stacks better than berserker. I feel a 100% damage or even more as increase is totally fair.
---
Sorry, that's communist talk
---
 How dare you expect handouts from the US government?
---
For real though, heck yes.
---
Yes and no, see nukacrypt.com for more info
---
Upvote for the phrase "Jet Addled Skank", I'm so stealing that for my Nuka-Ska band.
---
It never shows the core when worn it shows it when outside the armor though
---
Yes that is "damage/energy/radiation/etc Resistance", which calculates off of that Df value I listed above.
---
I think it should work like you suggest too, but it would also put these perks in a situation where they need to be pulled from the game.
---
This was public knowledge from the get-go
---
Only happened once too me
---
Im always in first person, ill have to change my view and see what it looks like.
---
Ammo factory first!

Now I've bought everything I want with caps and script I can actually play the game instead of farming for caps and ammo crafting materials.
---
Don't forget that after the cookout ends you need to jump against Chally's butt, and then try to land inside the Brahmin butt and then jump again.
---
If you get it right it launches you 40 feet into the air.  Last year it would kill you on the fall, but for some reason you teleport back to the ground instead now.  Still fun though.
---
For some it will be the new ultracite calibrated shocks.
---
Explosive resistance would help but I have a feeling this gun would still shred. Back before adrenaline was broken I got it to over 700 damage. I was one-shotting everyone with uncharged shots. It didn't even require good aim, I was just shooting the floor near people.
---
No Tesla loss of frames on PC. I do get loss of frames down to 15-25fps once in a while but not using the Tesla.
---
980 + i7 on SSD
---
Not true.  There is no guarantee 3* in my experience.  Having Earle give me a suppressors pipe revolver 1*, and the ACP clear give me a troubleshooters leather arm 1* just this morning.
---
I've had multiple runs with just 1 or 2 * drop.
---
Even the daily weapon crate from Ally I've seen reported as a guaranteed 3*, I've had mutiple 1*.
---
The thing is, I'm the guy that the universe screws with RnG for the sake of the Average.  For everyone thats only seen 3*'s, im the guy who never gets them.  Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
For anecdotal evidence, when I play DnD with friends, it's agreed that I get a minimum of +5 to every D20 roll, because I rarely naturally roll over 10.
---
In WoW, I did a fair amount of weekly content regularly during Legion, I didn't get my 1st Legendary drop till after 7.2.
---
In Final Fantasy 11, theres a rare spawn monster called Cargo Crab Colin, its had a 20% chance of dropping a low level R/Ex 1h sword called Nadrs.  I killed him over 300 times in the decade I played that game before it finally dropped.  But I lost claim to dozens who got the drop on the 1st kill.
---
Now, this isn't a pity party, I'm just saying that if theres a 99% chance the event drops 3*, I'm the law of averages that gets the 1%
---
If you dupe, hack, cheat, grief others, or use racist slurs your account gets banned; that's the gist. You cannot claim older accounts are immune to this. It will not hold up in court, yes, even German courts.
---
I literally picked up a plastic pumpkin bucket and put it on my Thanksgiving display last night. Already looked at my CAMP and started the decoration planning.
---
Come on Beth. As much as I RESENT the ESO experience, your furniture packs and holiday events were kinda cool and implementing even half of it would go a long way for us wastelanders.
---
You do not have the right to cheat or be racist.
---
And don't forget to do Path to Enlightenment when it pops up for an extra boost on top of everything else!
---
[Yeah, I got the daughter in the clinic, gettin' cured off the Wild Turkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKncYRJQRC8)
---
Poor mans gold is just as good to me. 😁thank you.
---
Such a good game, even underrated if you ask me.
---
Can't wait for its sequel.
---
Lever action rifle and a .308 sniper rifle. 
---
The sniper rifle because a hunting rifle was the first weapon I found when I started and so I decided to use rifles for the entire game
---
Lever action rifle because it’s better for head to head combat than the sniper, but is still a rifle. It’s also just really fucking good
---
4 characters total with 1000 scrip each gone... I feel you.
---
Oh man how funny it would be running away from mutants and if you didn’t run in the same direction your ally splits off with the ass end and you’re just a horse head hahahah
---
has this been fixed yet? if not it's an absolute joke
---
The bear arms + mods too.
---
If people aren’t set up on gear I usually recommend 2 star but... with the sale you can scrip a 3* for 40 so even if it’s crap you only really loose 10 scrip
---
The limb damage effect does no additional dmg. Its misleading. Limb dmg actually has a greater chance to cripple when you target limbs. What is causing the dmg increase is actually a weird bug that increases the damage dealt when all the dmg from multiple hits comes in a very short time and in a very concentrated spot. For shotguns this happens when using vats because all the pellets hit at the same time. I suggest targeting the torso because 1) robots weak spot is torso not head and 2) more pellets will hit the torso and so theoretically more magic dmg.
---
Railway rifles are basically the only way for me to do damage, I love them.  Choo choo~
---
It's the same bug as the Nuka cola lamp, and the raider &amp; settler cola lamps. They just randomly stop working.
---
I see someone didn't appreciate the assassins pipe pistol.
---
Always three star, always
---
have you put a PA Chassis down?
---
I have explored all places, finished all Wastelanders quests, done all events over so many times... the Nuke's were its only saving grace with people since the Legendary Battle Pass isn't here. Don't know what else to play that is in similar genre or fashion. :(
---
Guess wait till this Tuesday.
---
I am going to set the scrip limit to 50k. I am going to watch legendary items in player vendors,drop to 5 caps for a 3 star. &lt;==== does that sound bad? Im a new player, I thought you endgamers used gold bullion... Sorry If I'm wrong.
---
Nice!
---
I completely agree, I call it constructive criticism! 3800hrs in and I say my peice from time to time. I don't dislike this game, I  love it, but sometimes things have to be said, and no hard feelings to you or anyone for that matter. I call it venting, or de-stressing, especially after forking out over $500 + CAD to see this game stay alive. 
---
On another note 📝 I do wish you all the best! 🙂
---
Get out of your power armor.
---
I am 😀
---
Love my Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet with extra swing speed. Lovelovelove
---
I had to upgrade my video card. Add in a dozen lunchbox effects and I was dogging.
---
If you get 2 of a pre-fix you do not want, stop rolling!  Try again later.
---
Sick pad friendo!
---
 ...  * *Preston intensifies* *
---
I dropped it in frustration over the damn friends list bugs on Xbox live. We tried every fix imaginable and just couldn’t get everyone on everyone’s “76 friends list” despite having zero issues with every other game. Was frustrating as hell. Eliminated the primary reason we wanted to do 1st.
---
For her or all enemies?
---
With the sale, 3 star.
---
Mischief night but it runs on the hour, it’s an hour long and you do the same thing you did last year but your start at vault 76 and there’s cars and ghouls and behemoths all the way to the whitesprings
---
LOL I feel ya there.
---
I had everything but the wendigo totem and plushie.. I bought the plushie plan for 200 caps... then got it rewarded the very next  event. Then 2-3 events later I finally got the wendigo totem plan. I felt so accomplished that I finally got them both naturally, even though I already had them learned from purchases LOL
---
Only got 1 helmet though in all of them.
---
It really depends on what you want to achieve .  If you dont have good gear , buying 2 stars can be a great way of getting a better chance to something,
---
If you - on the other hand - want or want to trade for the best gear in the game go for 3 stars.
---
Also , what fed76 doesnt  tell you is that most traders with high-end gear doesnt want 2 stars at all .  So you cant trade multiple 2 stars for a perfect 3 star when you want to upgrade .   That strategy almost never works.
---
Hahahah, only if they play one of these sounds when that happens.  
---
https://youtu.be/UOC1vhYWZNQ
---
I kind of wonder is there any 3rd star effect I can't bear to be without - not that I can think of any off the top of my head.
---
For me looking good, just add important mutation - adrenaline reaction and buy/get bloodied weapon
---
Been waiting for weeks for it
---
Uh, then they'd issue you a refund? Lol, what would you take them to court for?
---

---
Nerd rage
---
Yeah your right went down in 2 shots in the torso! If it’s not the limb damage why do you think my TSE isn’t as good?
---
I don’t. I always thought fallout 4 was barren and there wasn’t enough civilization, until I realized that you were supposed to be the one rebuilding civilization with your settlements. Way too much work for nothing. I build one up and use it as my base and ignore the minutemen for the rest of the game
---
A few suggestions. With unyielding you dint need as much in intelligence so I boosted luck to give you more mutations and agility for a bit of stealth or more ap fro sprinting. Mutations added include adrenal reaction which is most have for bloodied, bird bones for agility (ap for sprinting or sneaking) talons for unarmed damage (you have iron fists) and scaly skin (more survivability). 
---
Have makeshift warrior and weapon fixing perk available  to swap on when needed and then put away. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1a35bb&amp;d=s50s92sf2ss2si0se2sj0p10el2eo0ej4eu0cm2ir2am2au0a00a42aa0la2lt2l71i11lu2ar0ao0&amp;m=1c24f8gh6i&amp;am=18253b-18--1827-182931&amp;wp=w1&amp;wm=1i2130
---
Also you could swap out ironclad for more agility. I would.
---
What I mean is for this weekend remove the 150 scrip limit on the machines. Gold bullion items are not on sale this weekend; legendary items that you get with scrip are
---
&gt; Then you will get repair kits
---
This is the only proper answer here. I wasted ballistic fiber repairing armor maybe 2 times before realizing I could just use these kits every time I need to repair my armor.
---
Use Dodgy under Agility. Instead of taking HP when you get hit it takes AP until your AP is all gone. I use this on all my builds.
---
There's a wall, you have to hit them back, just go into pacifist and forget about it. The point is to have fun . And if it's not an even playing field then don't worry about doing it. You can think it's worthless because you can't do it well. There's adventure mode pvp communities trust me.
---
we're neighbours.
---
Congratulations !!!
---
Lol I asked what the point was. Not if it was a thing.
---
Thanks
---
My pleasure...glad you found it useful 👍🏻
---
Bloodied 50 cal - only one star but do the job. In range of heavy weapons choice is quite simple ;)
---
Next to the wayward. You get a lot of traffic and vendors sell pretty good. New players will always go there and at least once a week anyone buying billion will stop by. I’ve had great success. The only downside is occasionally it make take 2 or 10 tries to load into a world. It’s a popular location.
---
A bit hidden and sometimes fast travel puts you inside the cliffside
---
Do you have some acceptable rolls already? Then three stars. If you haven’t got anything good yet, probably two. This applies to weapons. Armor, three stars every time
---
biggest problem i see is that it would probably make the game lag or glitch when someone joins server because all of their photos would need to be synced in otherwise only you would see your own photos
---
3rd time answering, it's fun for some people, if it doesn't float your boat then don't worry about it
---
Well I don't really do social media so rip
---
See...that is an interesting suggestion to the golden bullion issue. 👍
---
They should do that 😂
---
And the next day.
---
Oh you like meat do youuuu?
---
You can move your camp device (in the build menu) after initially placing it to have some control over the spawn in spot, I don't spawn in the cliff, I spawn in under the overhang by the silver ore.
---
I'm excited for a new season because I actually enjoy doing them, but most of the rewards are kind of dull imo. There are lots of cool camp objects that I'm eager to unlock though.
---
Two stars if you don’t have **any** good guns.  Three stars if you have passable guns and want to try for great ones.
---
Dooooooo it so that my god rolled Berserker weapons will have value
---
Has to be on the queen.
---
I just throw a grenade and instantly go into VATS and explode it while its infront of me with a paddle ball
---
mate my first ever run at acp I spent most of my time looking at the ground because if I dared to look up my frames would be absolutely decimated by tesla's it was an absolute joke. It needs fixed now, it completely ruins some events
---
That is a possibility
---
I mean people will still try to pvp, message, fast travel and everything if they want to. Just "brushing it off" isn't an answer. I was asking why its even a thing. Like I dont understand it and I feel if they wanted to pvp the other mode survival should just be brought back for it. No reason everyone should have to deal with those people. If you can't agree you're a part of the problem.
---
Fallout 76 and elite dangerous - two very dangerous choices... How to play fallout? If you had a long break maybe the best idea will be to create a new character and start all over with westlanders dlc - really good experience
---
Level appropriate legendary on successful completion, as well as treasury note, and unique to the event plans. 
---
I got a few weapons I kept.
---
Also, Grahm has several unique plans of his own.
---
I say ditch gladiator perks, go purely unarmed (its the best melee anyway) and get blocker. will surely help your survivability
---
I rolled 700 on 3* with one character, landed 4 god rolls. 🤙
---
I NEED Halloween stuff!! Roll out the old stuff I missed but give us lots of new stuff - edible items like drinks and candies that give us cool temporary - maybe even cosmetic - effects... Scary things for our camps, trick r treat stations around the wasteland we can click on to get a buff (or debuff - there's the trick!)... And a million times yes to the jack-o'-lantern power armor skin. I would spend so many Atoms, I love Halloween lol
---
Someone was offering a 3:1 trade including legacies and a BE Fixer for this weapon earlier on Bodega76
---
What are the odds you are on PS4?
---
Yeah, you get more than one shot out of the cores.
---
I have a hay maze in my CAMP that I would absolutely tear down for more Halloween CAMP items, Bethesda pls
---
I did that when wastelanders first came out ! The quest hooked me for a while but I felt so weak when I saw that enemies like the snallygaster kill me easily, so I had to quit for a while , I tried to get back now but I have the same server issue I’ve had before so I’m playing ED now 🤡
---
No issues on Xbox ;)
---
Depends on your level, your current gear and what really need for your character, but I used to only roll 3 star during sales and 2 stars all other times when I was still in need of "serviceable" gear and only tried for 3 stars after that when I could afford to look for "perfect" or "God tier" rolls after that. After Wastelanders I only buy Legendary Modules. The odds of getting anything good from the Puryear are just too awful when you can roll modules on the exact armor/weapon that you pick.
---
Use Mr Messanger routes for trick or treating
---
Coolio.
---
I’m curious, what were they?
---
I plan on doing this too except I’m mixing it with heavy guns. Seems cool as long as you don’t do unarmed by itself
---
I would say three star only
---
But when you reverse the mentality it becomes "oh! That gun is so pricey, it MUST be good!"
---
That's a useless website. Don't take anything it tells you seriously.
---
As for the 3rd star, reduced weight and less AP cost are generally considered to be 'god roll' contenders. Also +1 STR for melee weapons.
---
Weight reduction is a good effect on literally anything
---
That is a secondary character,  not a whole new account. 👍
---
Yeah that makes sense. Good luck with that
---
This would ruin the point of player vendors and also be extremely pay to win, even for the atomic shops standards
---
So much porn in game. It'll never happen.
---
sorry about that , my bad, I've been doing that 😅
---
Agree. All +DR/ER perks are redundant. Blocker, Dodgy are much more effective.
---
Makeshift Warrior is likewise unnecessary. Once your weapons are upgraded, there's no reason to have it. The weapons are all extremely slow to break and cheap to repair.
---
I got lucky once and obtained the plans. Honestly, I’d say yes.
---
It’s an extremely rare drop, few people do the event and the item itself... heals 20% for you and a couple people nearby, and only has the notable ingredient of a single super stim (and some junk). It can’t even heal NPCs, meaning friendly fire is better.
---
And worse? It’s a plan needed for a tadpole badge. 50 bullion, rank 2 from settlers. Bear arm plan and mods from raiders at the same rank.
---
I was looking forward to this sale. It was the only reward I was excited for and it turns out I'm out of town for the whole thing  :'(
---
Best start believing in social media, your on one! Sorry couldn't resist lol.
---
Elite is really addictive, fallout as well. Maybe stay with elite if you have a good time? Is pointless to force yourself to play something... Personally I left elite, not so much to do, specially when I reach two elite and only one (grindy one) left. 
---
In fallout is very similar, not so much to do but I have a two characters and that's give me variety. Also really often I do some kind of challenges like clear west Tek with black powder pistol and stay undetected etc.
---
I got a Bloodied +50 Crit damage 15% faster reload Fixer from her today after spending 1k scrip.
---
Nah, GB rewards are limited while legendary rolls are infinite.
---
You'll run out of things to buy very quickly.
---
See I was also around during that time early February 2019 and the drop wasn't even noticeable. There was certainly a drop off a few weeks later. You know what also happened a few weeks later - Anthem was released.
---
But sure, if it makes you feel better that it was the TSE nerf, you go right ahead bud.
---
True
---
Bug. They know and don't care.
---
I have one.  I'll sell it to you.
---
Too tired to stay up till 4am so we'll have to trade another time
---
They always wait too long to release holiday content. If I’m going to decorate my camp and dress accordingly I’d like to celebrate for more than a week.
---
Thanks a lot for that info
---
The VATS bug is brutal
---
I updated the wiki with the correct information. Go there.
---
I guess you could say that the judgement of Arktos Pharma is... polar!
---
Get it? Since the mascot is a polar bear? And it’s a weapon, which could be seen as delivering judgement?
---
... I’ll see myself out.
---
ALL OF THAT
---
All of them.  My opinion is if you're trying to get something for yourself, go 2 star.  If you're trying to sell it, go 3
---
Magic effect is a bug that causes a large increase in Damage dealt. Certain legendary effects on shotguns and weapons over 200 fire rate cause this effect. Limb damage is one of those legendary effects that is bugged.
---
"fruit machine currency" What? What even lol
---
Paddle ball, commie whacker, protest sign, alien blaster, power armor unarmed punching and broadsider.
---
They're gag weapons.
---
Yeah it is ! I mostly courier and delivery jobs though haha , give me the chance to chat and play at the same time , my main goal is to get away from eso , as far as I could because it really is time consuming, the bad way of it , is spent about 120 hours on it the past 2 weeks , so I’m trying to play another game to get used to play eso for short time , then I’ll rebalance my schedule , haha wow ! That’s tough ! I bet you had so many points on agility! I never used black powder weapons for that one specific reason we all know ... S L O W ! Like how did you manage to do it ?
---
Been happening to me since the release of the game, usually I get a scorchbeast queen or rare legendary creature disappear or be able to not loot even after hitting it multiple times
---
Get stuck with garbage players in an important event that your doing work in
---
Yeah same boat as you
---
Had a whole bunch launch when I was on a few hours ago, seems they're at least working to some extent
---
Dont worry I'm sure they'll bring it back around to stay in the atom shop for a month after it gets bundled up to sell when the bos dlc drops sometime next year
---
Sweet 
---
I only have 400 caps.  I just made it to level 44.  I had to restart everything over.
---
They said the collectron will be back next Tuesday.
---
Giving bad guys the old rusty knuckle.
---
I created a new character and only played them to the Dyer chemical quest, right up to flushing the river, and then just never finished it. Anytime I log in with that character, they are in bloom for me to farm. Now I just use that character for Strangler Blooms and as a mule. It was a bit of a time sink, but I consider it well worth it.
---
What’s your username?
---
I mean, they technically do so your not wrong
---
Im looking to get the plans as well. How much are you wanting for them?
---
I had pretty decent luck with her today
---
Vampire faster fire rate Gatling plasma. But only for the Queen or Earl bc the spin up for regular mobs just drives me crazy. Just got a tse Gatling plasma like 5 mins before I had to log out for the day so we'll see tomorrow how she does. If it's crazy op with my heavy gun PA build I'm gonna name her Felicia, "Oh a big enemy! Bye Felicia!!"
---
I'm sorry you had to restart, but I can't sell it to you for 400 caps, I'm sorry
---
Just go into pacifist man, most of us don't even harass players, those are griefers your talking about. There's no problem I'm apart of I'm just playing the game and occasionally pvping with people who actually want to.
---
Are they shooting? Don’t they do that when they break?
---
Oddly enough no matter where I put my camp I always spawn under that overhang
---
Bloodied and unyielding doing the job. I have around 900 hours in fallout, not many things left to do ;-) 
---
Always I'm between fallout, division, elite and Diablo
---
DbD managed it
---
Haha right on what's a better resource for pricing?
---
Good to know!!! Thanks
---
No, that would be awesome tho
---
No, the event is already ignored enough.
---
Im so freakin jealous.  I rolled 1000 and got 2 worTVh 5k cap resales
---
that's not my experience. but I'm certain neither of us can prove nor disprove it, so whatever.
---
That would effectively make every 3 star legendary cost 10 scrip unless you wanna keep it, that's nuts.
---
Fort defiance, pick up the military amp bag things and you’ll get a decent amount
---
Oh snap didn't even know that thanks :D
---
Hey man I'm on PC ... Sorry
---
Will the Wastelanders story hit a checkpoint with the inoculated and meeting rose? Will there be a point when I know I need to do those? Or will it just glitch it up if I try the quests without that first.
---
I never even thought of that, now I have to do a bunch of research.
---
no worries man!
---
That's weird, I moved mine a little past the lead extractor towards the cliff side up against the rock ?outcrop? opposite where the overhang is, haven't spawned in the cliff since.
---
I'm looking forward to having challenges to complete again.
---
Nice !! I only have like 70 hours on fallout haha , I haven’t even gotten to level 50 , but I’ve done 20/60 of the achievements though , so that counts as something XD . Hopefully I can jump in again
---
Two words: 'Follow Through'
---
With the way damage changes, you are going to want a sneaky type with max follow through at the queen and at earl.
---
Heavies should take 'take one for the team'
---
Combined as debuffs on the target, they'll be how queen killing happens efficiently
---
Build a wall of any material other than the normal wood ones. Apply your wallpaper then change it to wood. For some reason you can’t directly apply wallpaper to normal wood walls
---
Yes, your SPECIAL maxes at 15 for each one. If you put to 6 of your stats to 10 each, the max level legendary SPECIAL perks can bring them up to 15. This can give you 30 extra points to play with, allowing you to max out 5 of your stats (instead of 3) at 15.

This just happened to me on xbox, did you get it fixed?
---
Can I get a link plz
---
But remember that it costs 1 perk coin to *remove* a legendary perk card
---
Nope, haven't heard of that happening to anyone else either 😕 weird
---
I mean if I slap a Wendigo for minimal damage... Do I get loot?
---
It’s been long enough for me to say... ain’t nobody got time fo dat
---
I use Telsa with no performance issues with Line.
---
My PC build is over 5 years old.
---
However against Earle I'm in a slide show with my .50 cal
---
*knock knock* Can I borrow a cup of sugar? It can be irradiated, I’m not picky.
---
Happened earlier to me as well as FO1st not working for scrapbox and tent. After shutting the game down a few times it worked it's way out and went back to normal and the points came back. Give it some time
---
That acid node is always built on. The under water one?
---
Game just start when you get around 100+ levels, finally you going to have unlocked more of interesting perks - maybe is a good idea for you to get at least 50 extra lev?
---
At half the scrip cost go for broke!  Roll three stars.  If you get a two star gun with awesome rolls you will kick yourself for not rolling three.  Years from now you will look back and be filled with regret at what could have been!
---
Will do ty
---
I would make room for Stranger in Numbers, 1 point charisma perk. It boots your positive mutations by 25% while on a team.
---
So you agree if you want to pvp you should go to a mode for pvp. And you agree that griefing is basically what I'm addressing. Because I'm not complaining that other people fight each other when they want to in adventure.
---
The unspeakable trading sub
---
Love when this happens at a vending machine
---
Market? Yeah but I'm not gonna go ask for every weapon, need a database
---
Maybe glue them back together
---
This has happened to me twice. I take my sweet time. The guys doing it were like at least 100 levels higher than me. Super pathetic lol
---
I sell cheap diffusers for that
---
 I'm not really used to Adrenaline, so i tried what you said and it didn't work. I was thinking i did it wrong so i tried a different way: in game -&gt; games Add a game, i chose add the 76.exe from the main folder, then launched it through Adrenaline and...

 It worked, i just want to know if it's the correct way to add a game profile in Adrenaline ? 
---
 Aniway big thanks you rock!
---
Ah damnit you beat me to it
---
Idk about that pie but the moldy food still in there 😍
---
Well now that it's beyond 69 you can go back and upvote him.  Help him get to 420 now.
---
Yes it is fixed
---
There will be a nerf on the next patch but that hasn't happened yet
---
Y'all getting porn in 76?
---
Nah I make people straight up log out by the dozens
---
Its already done did homie!
---
Leveling up is a little slow process for me , I don’t know why though, but I can try ! When the game servers let me log in lol
---
I got a B 25/25 LMG ... Way cool right?
---
Now imagine if I had only rolled two stars.
---
If you could upload pictures from your photo folder, people would be putting porn in game.

Yea just realized if i unselect Berserkers the fixer 
---
The numbers go back to normal
---
I like that they have an event where you blow up cars and cause as ton of server lag as possible but having double walls is a big no-no.
---
Yep I'll be doing that for sure
---
I told myself I would only complete the entire Legendary Run for the heck of it, but Armor Ace looks so tempting. Count me as excited for sure.
---
Xbox? I can hand over quite a bit to help you out until you get a steady supply through enemies and locations.
---
This was a solid idea.  Super Mutants are top tier xp per kill it seems.  With all the buffs I'm getting over 300 per kill.  I did several circuits of Huntersville, West Tek, and Radio Array, with any juicy events in between before a hop and it was extremely efficient.
---
That’s cruel. But you know what’s even better? Dealing the final blow just as they’re about to die. Then when they die they can’t get back in.
---
For the record, they usually cost 10,000 caps.
---
5k-12k
---
True true
---
Really bcuz the guy on this server sold one for 250.  But I was too late.
---
SBQ (and Scorchbeasts in general): Bloodied Prime 50cal - makes quick work (also have a bloodied LMG for when it needs to be quicker - but ammo’s pricey)
---
Earle: Vampire’s Explosive Minigun - never die
---
Everyday out and about: AA/reduced VATS Prime auto 10mm - mows down most everything, cheap ammo, gun fu is fun
---
Power Armor Stands *drool*
---
10k for a that is steep
---
Yes, really.
---
Season ended
---
The season is over my friend. It ended 2 days ago on the 8th.
---
Oh yeah, for sure. There are some days where I have to server hop several times before I'm about to place h camp. It's no secret.
---
Hold on the guy is in another reddit room I’ll get him in here.

---
This would be my recommendation without changing SPECIAL.  personally, I would drop intelligence to 5 (enough for any crafting skills).  I personally run a 3 perception at minimum to make sure that I can use level 3 lockpicking.  More agility or luck would allow adrenaline or more action boy/girl and additional levels of bloody mess to be applied, but I would prioritize surviving over squeezing out more damage.
---
For strength, I would focus on one weapon at a time and take blocker to reduce the melee damage.  If you choose to do one/two handed, I would do level 1 of each of the three cards (as you had with one handed in your current build).
---
For Endurance, I personally like having adamantium skeleton at level 3 so that I don't have to worry about limb damage.  I would also take ghoulish, as this really helps when fighting ghouls (so that you only really have to worry about the radiation damage).
---
For Charisma, if solo, I would take lone wanderer.  If in a group, I would take team medic (so that born survivor will help your team) and strange in numbers, as most people seem to be mutated.
---
I also tweaked the mutations a bit.  Speed demon, marsupial, and bird bones really help with closing in on targets with melee.  Beyond that, you would want the melee and unarmed damage boosting mutations.  I found I did better without scaly skin (lets dodgy proc more) and healing factor (makes the stim packs more effective, but requires checking yourself between fights).  Grounded is nice, but I use some energy weapons as backup, so I took this one off.
---
For legendary weapons, I would prioritize having increased swing speed, then bloodied with increased swing speed.  Most enemies should die in one hit, so the increased swing speed will let you take groups down faster than a bloodied weapon without it.
---
Finally, for armor, I would have all unyielding pieces, then try to have one or two poison damage resistance.
---
The plans drop at less than 5% from a very rare event that costs 3000 caps to start.
---
It's pretty affordable really. Sell 280 purified water a day for 1400 caps and you'll have it in a week
---
Ahh. Okay. I'm just a noob barely lvl. 35. I just came back to the game like 4 days ago. The daily challenges were making it fun again.
---
It has a low drop rate, hence its high value.
---
No worries, a new season starts on the 15th!
---
Hmm no need to give me math bro 
---
It’s not that serious.  And I thought it was an 80% drop rate.  Can I post YouTube links here....  my buddy did a vid on this.
---
Get it done before Tuesday!
---
If they can do this without impacting server performance, sure. That'd be awesome.
---
How did you not run out of camp budget? 👍👍
---
I miss interesting settlements with interesting characters in single player fallouts. 
---
But Building in multiplayer is much better epxerience for me. Selling stuff and having visits in your camp gives you more motivation than building just because. 
---
I spend 1200hs building in F4, but since 76 i will never touch it again
---
Wallpaper would be cool..but not as cool
---
This would be abused super fast because its ez to drop any photo into the fo76 screenshots folder and then you get people showing naked photos of there cats and dogs and noone wants to see that.
---
Harpoons with fletchettes, plasma guns with splitters, shotguns, Teslas with shotgun barrel or ffr with a bugged primary, and explosive smg with scorched killer mod and the right primary, or any high cycle rate heavy weapon with the right 1st/2nd legendary effect.
---
There's a LOT of magical weaponry out there, the research will be worth it.  But when in doubt, test it.
---
Yea we’ll see, I’ve been hedging with junkies so hopefully that survives
---
Those events have become extremely boring. Just a paid turkey hunt where they let the birds out of the cages. What's the point? Lameness. Lameness is the point.
---
&gt; And I thought it was an 80% drop rate.
---
No, that would be the fedora.
---
Vendors sell bulk ballistic fiber. Also, Fort Defiance and using the White Knight and Fix It Good perks. Keep in mind that Luck affects durability of found items and Intelligence for crafted items.
---
The first thing I consistently wore was the halloween skeleton costume. I grab the skull mask everytime at the pumpkin house, and prolly have one too many at all times
---
Maybe it’s because it’s trash. The good rewards are too rare to justify the ammo and effort. Then there’s the fact it’s not triggerable.
---
Nice i dig it. bit over zealous with mounted heads in that one room tho haha
---
I have a similar issue on PC; I noticed it yesterday and it's really dull. I set up two and it didn't make a difference 😢
---
I got forty 2* weapons with my 1k scrip, so at 15 a pop I'm set to hit my limit for the next 4 days. Yay?
---
I think rolling for unarmed melee is probably the worse out of everything.
---
Sounds like you've been flirting with DR. Berserker gf doesn't approve.
---
That’s what’s up
---
F. I feel you man spent 3k and got the same haul
---
No, but it's the highest concentration that I've found
---
Thanks! I’ll add you as soon as I can. I have a funeral tomorrow so I won’t be on until later in the day.
---
I always felt they took away too much from the world itself, in Fallout 3 you are constantly finding new pockets of civilization while in Fallout 4 you find empty places you could build up to be. I would have rather had a few settlements with proper NPCs instead of 30 with nameless braindead AI.
---
This is the way, commit one character to starting, but *not quite finishing* the quest
---
If Im not mistaken the junkies and bloodied are getting the same Nerf as everything so they will overall reduce the same way. 
---
Ill be here if needed if you want to just test a few out though. I dont mind letting you run a few through to test them out and see what the diff is.
---
Had all of my additional emotes deselected earlier, leaving me with just the defaults. Had to reselect them in the Atom Shop.
---
Thanks I got two from cfly4852 on steam he was selling two for 150 a piece.
---
I sell the other one for 12k
---
Thanks for the info
---
My top 3 favorite weapons:
---
The instigating light machine gun with a shotgun tesla rifle and a dual-bar flamer chainsaw.
---
The LMG can tear apart anything especially if you have sneak damage... and the ammo of course. While .308 is a little more hard to come by, it's definitely worth grinding for or crafting it. 
---
However, the shotgun tesla rifle is best at clearing packs or hordes of enemies. I usually use it when I'm doing events and there are ghoul hordes or wolf packs, these types of scenarios. Fusions cells are easy to make and the fact that they can be used for the tesla rifle make a large pool of ammo that I don't have to store or sell. 
---
The dual-bar flamer chainsaw is insanely good. While the stock chainsaw is ... Y'know... Adding the flamer effect makes it able to take down lvl 65+ glowing ones and anything else that you'll come across.
---
Berserker commando commando
---
Good to hear
---
I have an explosive zealot one you can have if you like.  Xbox
---
Thanks for the info fam I just bought two from a guy named cfly4852 on steam for 150 a piece.  I’m going to sell the other for 12k.   Good lookin out.
---
Ghoul horde event.
---
Ghouls do not run but shamble at a slightly faster than walking pace,  not threatening enough?   There's never just one,  each group of ghouls is no less than 15 strong and will pursue you until either you or they die.
---
It’s spring down here in the Antipodes (allegedly, that wind is very cold today)
---
No shit Sherlock. Anyone could still edit these files on the hard drive and makes the game think it come from the prosnap camera.
---
true, she gave me a i/25/25 pipe pistol :(
---
As pointed out above, if you want to trade or sell anything, roll three stars. A perfectly good two star isn't worth nearly as much as a three with a useless third to another player.
---
I’m on Xbox
---
Anyone selling them for that cheap either duped them or acquired them from a duper. The fair market value is between 8-12k, normally.
---
I have been hoping for this since last year! I feel like it could actually work in PvP as well. I want a true glass cannon build instead of Bloodied which isn’t really a cannon at all..
---
I really hope this happens...
---
👍
---
The TSE pumps were great snipers.. such a range and accuracy, they were brilliant.
---
I didn’t know u can dupe items on this game and I’ll be sellin this one for 12k for sure
---
There have been a few times where my emote wheel would quickly turn into my favorites wheel when I opened it, so I couldn't do emotes. I don't usually do emotes so I couldn't tell you how long it lasted but it was at least for the entire play session.
---
This was on PS4, and it hasn't happened to me in a while (as far as I know).
---
I’d you’re on PC then duping is much more prevalent. It’s also a violation of the ToS and people have been banned for it in the past.
---
This is the company you chose to support
---
Building in FO76. 100% better!
---
I have like 20 of these pies.
---
And yet so many people are complaining about it.  *shrug*
---
Honestly I think they should have left them open for a week or two each, but I understand why they wanted to limit them.
---
That's a great drop. Strike now if you are trading since unarmed gets hammered in the upcoming nerf on the 15th.
---
This is gold. Cant tell you how many times i capture a awesome landscape pic and wanna share it. 
---
Note: is there a sub for in game pics?
---
Its Spring in Australia!
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
Mothman wallpaper my dude
---
Yep, still an issue. Its good that bethesda doesnt even care and refuses to fix it. I would expect nothing less from the famed group of idiots.
---
ah 😳well i apologize then
---
Weird kink but ok
---
It might have to do. I have that one but I want something more Halloween-y
---
The only one who would see it is the player.  Server load for something like that being visible for ever player on the server (Should they pop by) would be ludicrous.
---
No worries you can message me anytime. I don’t remember anything about deleting a saved game? They offered to unlink it and relink right after the port forwarding institutions.
---
It is *right* under build limit. 
---
I think it just looks bigger than it really is because it's spread out across 4 buildings on top and at the bottom of the cliff.
---
I used to have that camp too. I just stick to lead now as acid is quite simple to farm.
---
I love this idea.  First thing that came to mind for me was a power armor skin that makes the shoulders higher and doesn't include a turnable head, so your character would be looking out a slot at the top of the torso, which would appear headless.
---
It's kitschy!
---
Hell no. Find a team to run with,watch/read some project paradise guides on YouTube and Reddit and grind it out just like the rest of us had to. 
---
If you don't have a team then use the lfg options on console, put up a post on reddit or find the project paradise groups on FB. 
---
I've started grinding out PP again because some of our newer team mates haven't done it before but I don't do it on public servers anymore. It doesn't bother me when randoms rock up, I only get annoyed when I go onto area chat to try and explain what people need to do to successfully complete the event and they all turn around and do the opposite and then bitch to me in DMs about how the event failed or a friendly died. 
---
It's not that hard of an event to do with 4 people. You just need a bit of patiences, friendly fire, at least 1 person on a mic who knows what they are doing and good coordination. 
---
Saying all that, it would be great if they could bring back the option to trigger it ourselves but keep it as a server wide public event notification like the imposter. I'd also happily drop 2k a pop to buy swipe cards to activate the event as well.
---
This!  I've been trying to complete this quest for over a month and there's no marker and I have the achievements for all of the items.  finally I stumble upon this telling me I have to talk to the stupid robot.  I wish they would have put a question marker on him or made his tape one of the required ones or something because it was totally not an intuitive process.  But thank you for leading me down the right direction so I can finally cross this quest off of my list.
---
Cool man thanks!
---
Sounds about right. I got a junkies vats crit less vats cost lever action my first roll and then straight garbage for the next 2k script. Should have stopped at that first roll
---
Where else could I acquire some
---
Sale?
---
F
---
Wow the first server was a nice one. Lots of lvc and vats33 and a few ffr
---
AA = Junkies
---
I rolled 18 times, nothing even close to viable. Will stick with buying modules with my scrip.
---
A load of BS, stop spewing misconceptions.
---
Can I have the AAE25V Combat Rifle &amp; Q1015R Pump Shotgun? 
---
I'll be your best friend.
---
I got a quad assault rifle with exploding bullets 2 * and an awesome two shot combat rifle faster fire rate 2* very lucky so far I’ll try again around 1 am
---
I will take it, username here and on fo76  are the same.  Hit me up, I will pay full fair price.
---
Maybe my TSE lever action will be taken down from the wall with the update 🙂
---
AA1025 and aae25 combat rifles are pretty damn nice guns.
---
Some of those rolls aren’t actually that bad at all. The furious and AA explosive combat rifles both sound really sweet, and the quad pump action with that 15% faster reload makes for a very nice combo.
---
Its all the ash piles and bodies. Really, the game should juat introduce consolidated area loot, you know, anything a mob drops, can be picked up from another nearby mob. It will keep the first pile and any after, the loot will just go to the first pile and the others will despawn. 
---
Its annoying as hell trying to loot the bodies as it is
---
Best way to play junkies is to not have a build based around chems. Make a full health shotgun build, get addicted to 5 chems, and have fun. Btw that shotgun is extra magic in vats. You will be one shooting everything.
---
5 Addictions. That's it.
---
There's a few possible spawns at gulper lagoon, and just down the road from delano Grange, and down the hill from the medical supply, possibly elsewhere. But nowhere near the amount of spawns as the creek behind the chemical plant
---
You may not need it or think it's junk but if reasonably priced others can greatly benefit. An alt would also benefit.    
---
For me, I HATE Zealot, Stalker, Hunter, and Ghoul Slayer. I loathe Bloody and Unyielding gear and builds. I don't have room but if I had all that I'd junk those 4 types and try to sell the rest for at least a couple of days. If not, they get scripted.
---
Power fists. Don't even need to be legendary. They look really cool
---
Are there any 5 i should do specifically or does it not matter?
---
I'm ready if you are
---
She's one of those grandmas who are behind the times. She means well, but gets you stuff you don't really want.
---
very good idea
---
Yeah double scrip limit during 50% off sale doesn't seem too bad
---
Spent 1000 and got one good piece of armor, but not as good as the current one I have. Still got hope for my junkies handmade though.
---
Why use diffusers rather than team medic, other than for pioneer scout badge.
---
With the garbage code mess they would need to redo everything to make it work with Super Duper.
---
Agreed, we must be permited to introduce the wasteland to the one true god.
---
Behold!
---
Gaze upon the divine glory of Goatse!
---
Tremble as it's image burns into your mind!
---
I generally agree unless the person doing the smacking is the owner of the camp. Sometimes I arrive to a server and start trying to refill a vending machine but almost immediately a group of people appear and want to shop. There have been a few times when the person on the other end of that experience began whacking me because they wanted to finish putting everything for sale before I started shopping...
---
See you next Tuesday
---
This cheap go for the 3 star.    
---
My main had over 900 script. I got a couple of armor pieces but no rifles. I scripted most of what was left.    
---
My alt had 150 to which I think 3 armor pieces b/c it was wearing regular modded leather armor. I need a better shotgun and found one for 2000 caps at a player vendor that does over 200+.    
---
It depends on what that char needs or if you're going to sell it. I wish we could at least pick the class of armor and weapons.
---
The building was fun. With the right mods, you could literally build a fully furnished living house with accomodation for all your companions and friends. Even used some mod to scale up a piece of medieval looking power armour to look like a massive monument. Think i still have the blueprint for it lol
---
Assuming youre guns based. Alcohol, Mentats, Daddy-o, Psycho, Day Tripper. I have an alt thats a Junkies build and i use those. They dont mess with perception at all so you should be good.
---
There are a few times when I have to log off immediately. Otherwise, I wait it out which isn't long. I will never use a workbench at a player's home again. In one day, I got stuck in that perma workbench animation with sliding around. You have to log off the server and back in to fix it.
---
I'm not sure off the top of my head.but usually I stay away from the ones that give debuffs I dont like..IE negative strength or agility. I think I had day tripper mentats and dont remember the rest.good thing is once addicted they wont be removed unless you use a addictall
---
Sounds good. Looks like i'll be making trips to some chem dealers then
---
Man, i just wish they did proper pvp modes instead of battle royale, tdm, ctf, ffa
---
News flash, you dont have to be a dick.
---
Any military fort. Forward bases have them but they are in the higher level zones of which you can go but at that level your going to face challenges. Camp Venture and Fort Defiance. If someone picks it up you're out of luck. You can find them sitting out in the open and in containers so thoroughly pick through the area.
---
r/fallout76settlements is good :D
---
Your tag is even Arktos Pharma. Do you right their Dad jokes? :D
---
We should be able to put it on the outside as well. Other chars don't automatically have things other than the crappy shanty town walls.
---
Will having any -strength effects nullify some of my perks or will it just reduce my carry weight?
---
I pulse mine so they dont turn to ash, If you do it slow enough they just fall over.
---
It'll cost you a perk coin to swap out a legendary perk. That can become expensive.
---
I’ve mostly gotten junk. I still have 300 scrip. The best I got was a bloodied compound bow 50 limb damage +1 agility. I’ve gotten some better drops from enemies tonight then I did from purveyor. If only I didn’t have a daily limit to scrip. I’ve switched servers 4 times. The last one was when I got the bloodied now then it was a hunters sub machine gun and hunters pipe pistol. Ugh this event is going to kil some of us lol
---
They're cryptids.
---
The 2nd character is my alt.  Before teams became a thing I would run the game in 2 windows, and team up my 2 characters for the strange in numbers perk.  Also it was great having more stash space.
---
Then they added teams.
---
Then they added FO1st.
---
On Xbox tonight if I die and hit respawn it will bring me back to screen like I respawned but I can’t move and respawn button is back at bottom I have to fast travel further away where it costs me caps. I’ve never had this bug and it’s done it to every server I’ve been on. I’ve had the other respawn bug before but not this one. Something is messed up
---
How much is it getting nerfed? Are the other melee weapons still good to go?
---
... Yeah...
---
Though it’s mostly because I also have a legendary three star bear fist with Polar Judgement as its name. It’s not nearly as good as yours, but it is weightless which works for having a fun role playing weapon.
---
There's an early quest which nets you a legendary but you can choose what class of weapon it is from. If you've done it you already know. These weapons can last till 50 or you can wait until after 50 so any quests which net gear will mostly give you level 45 or 50 gear.
---
Friends Welcome! I love wholesome players. Great job!
---
I'm not OP I just liked your joke haha. But you guys both sounds like you have some cool Bear Arms :)
---
Depends on what you want. However rolling for 3\* at the cost of 2\* and still being able to get 80% of that cost back for me is well worth it. Really depends on whether or not you find much value in that last star's effects.
---
I prefer a Stealth Sniper in most games as far as playstyle.    
---
My main has a 3 star Legendary Explosive Lever Gun. I use a 3star Combat Rifle for most. I have  2 star level 50 Fixer for lower mobs and a modded 1 star legendary axe for weak things and to save ammo.
---
Crashing the servers from ammofactories and duping?
---
I think of unarmed non-PA as being a pretty easy build. One of my characters is unarmed / stealth &amp; she does super high damage. It's extremely relaxing to never have to grind for materials to make ammo. When you barely use ammo at all, you also make an easy profit by just selling all the ammo you get. Sometimes it is really satisfying to just get your claw right up in their entrails and see your weapon covered in blood.   
---
But I don't think I've ever seen anyone intentionally using only their fists while in PA so that idea amuses me quite a bit. I did accidentally use a meat hook while in PA once but I'm pretty sure that was a bug.
---
How does one make beautiful grids on Reddit like that
---
I would be thankful for 200
---
Which silo? I launched one a few hours ago from bravo. Nothing went wrong.
---
At your level ...50 plus with a decent build it really shouldn't affect it much but a couple pounds of carry weight or similar.if you already have - addictions you dont like just look for the ones you do like.once you have 5 or so chems saved  of each redo your addictions if it bugs you u know.
---
Do it anyway! I have one of those and it’s great. Sure you’re more vulnerable but you can stealth forever.
---
Ahh, I see i misinterpreted it that it could push you over cap to max 20 of a special, up to 15 points of stats from legendary perks. The way you said it makes it much less appealing, but I still may take +5 charisma, since my build already maxes strength and intelligence (I just wanted MORE!). Oh well, thanks for clearing things up for me.

---
I use an explosive 10mm.
---
few rounds into the pack tags them all fast and easy. I get about 1200-1500XP per pack too.
---
One I did yesterday full of teslas and other crap, yet I still managed to farm 230 weapons out of it... meaning I hit about that many mobs with my trusty 10mm explosive in the midst of all the mayhem weapons. 
---
For those on PC, you can mod the meat piles into something else. I have big glowing balloons. They stick above all the ash, goo, stick out of pond water and tall grass.
---
I found I was able to get at least 40-50 MORE meat piles from Line in the Sand after changing my meat piles into the balloons. That's literally how much those stupid ash/goo piles cover up that you can't get to.
---
What are the god rolls for most weapons anyway?
---
Cool, thank you. Im going to make a new character and work on it like this.
---
I got addicted too all chems just to see what it was like before popping an addictol and my damage somehow went down at some point and my shotgun had a 500 round, unreloadable mag. Was very confused
---
Xbox has been weird the last few days for me. Today when I drank or ate my meters wouldn't go up until I exited the pip boy and yesterday everything that had a holdable action (like laying on a bed) just said transfer.
---
Good lord...what are you like half horse??
---
Lmao
---
3\* Instigating Plasma Rifle with VATS crit +50% and 25% less VATS AP cost.
---
I absolutely love the aesthetic of a plasma rifleman, but with projectile travel time and no silencer it's definitely at a disadvantage to other rifles.
---
Currently using an Anti Armor The Fixer with +250 DR when reloading and +33% VATS hit chance in commando.
---
This guide to returning might help a bit - [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Ok, just checked afyer putting it on, following an event, and after fast traveling a few times. It always looks like a fusion core is in it for me.
---
I'm not a fan of co-op.  
---
My main has a good mix of rifle damage and a lot of aid items. When someone is down I race over to get them back into the fight.  
---
I'm glad they make it so teams don't have to be close to get benefits.
---
Twice the let down.
---
I'm re-scripping them, selling the rest at scrip price (sold a bunch that way, 50-100 caps per star).
---
yep
---
The 500 round mag glitch is nice to have at times.its triggered by unloading I high mag gun and switching to your secondary very quickly..something like that.on another note just pick 5 addictions you can live with anything over it wont help any!
---
You've suffered enough friend.
---
Appreciate it man,
---
I have a je mini I’ve been hanging onto. I’ll give you a crazy deal if ya like.  I don’t need the weight

HEY YOU GOT ANYMORE OF THAT PSYCHO I'm sick... scratches neck*

I had been looking for a decent explosive lmg..and well I got one.beserkers explosive I threw it right back in the scrip bin

The mag glitch would be nice if I wasnt pathetically low on shells lmao

Did you say "NUTS!" when it disconnected? Maybe you have some kind of precognition when it comes to nuts.

That's why I love this community!
---
The worst is assholes attacking you at your own vendor while you're trying to restock.
---
I’ve seen this a couple times, Bethesda likes to do this but I don’t know or remember how to fix sorry
---
I have qe and be of all shotguns and I never use them.
---
I was just thinking about this today, like maybe they couldve made it so that if you travel to the Rusty Pick and trade for scrip directly there isnt a limit, but if you use the train station scripters then same limit bc of convenience. Like we’re literally at her base of operations thats covered in scrip, she could hand appraise and pay us on the spot
---
*shoots a Psychotats*
---
Not for you! How about two 5.56 rounds? *draws JE handmade*
---
3 star on my level 20 1 star weapons 3 star armor. So far nothing but script on my main
---
Well damn.
---
Also A+ ign, my dude.
---
I got a bunker door on my trailer and house and even have a door on top of it so double door locks lol
---
I feel like this subreddit more than most has so many posts that are 70% nonsense
---
need to kill some for a quest? Bottom of the Wiki page lists where a bunch can be found:

I just googled " Fallout 76 season 2" 😂
---
Sorry dude, just got home. No worries, another time
---
Damn. I'll get ahold of ps support tomorrow I guess
---
If you're implying me
---
How so? All I asked was a question I've noticed the Communist revolutionary option doesn't give guns anymore
---
Vampire Tesla rifle.   Yes, I am mindful about the lag in full public events.   But I can solo line in the sand without needing a stimpak. 
---
Also reduced weight Vampire's gatling plasma.   Awesome against scorchbeasts.
---
What version
---
... And it seems the dad jokes have taken my sight.
---
And yes, good pun. Unfortunately, Dr. Lux is a PA rifleman.
---
You have to do it on the PC.  Mobile is limited to what you can post.  On PC click the ... on the formatting bar and then click the table icon on the far right. You can choose how many columns and rows you want.
---
I have it on my ultracite PA. Xbox.
---
Throw away the gatling plasma first and grab the 50 caliber B25 machine gun. Emergency protocols to the PA. All perks are for damage. Don't forget to shoot mobs and use stimpaks.
---
Thats odd i have it on my xo1 on xbox also
---
Oh no the nocturnal rolling pins got cheaper, the economy is ruined
---
What a great idea.
---
It's under Services, not Subscriptions
---
Have you tried e-Bay?
---
I was filling my machine once and had the old bashing bastard show up. I assume it was a dude because of how fast he got aggressive and annoying. I decided to empty both machines until he left. He looked in the first vendor and started hitting me again. I was actually loling in my living room. Good times.
---
Sounds about right for AMD graphics cards, their drivers are often glitchy.
---
Make sure you have the latest video drivers directly from AMD's website for your card, do a full uninstall/reboot/reinstall of the latest drivers.
---
Which launcher did you use/buy from... Bethesda or Steam?
---
70 3 star guns, 1 slightly useful bloodied explosive 50 cal.
---
Modules are a better deal.
---
It would seem so.
---
Nice...
---
No, often times gun bashing someone is enough to make them hopping servers. This playerbase is afraid of its own shadow
---
I feel like you’d mostly get Chinese swords and drag grenades I don’t know about guns but if so it would be rare enough to not make it worth
---
AAE25, FE, AA1025 aren’t too bad
---
You're the fucking best. This has been killing me ever since I figured it out.
---
I dont think I put it on my x01 as I made it for someone else. Ill try it out to test how it looks. Give it to a lowbie following.
---
Try making a ticket with Bethesda too
---
On my tank/melee hybrid bloody build...found off a loot.  3* Bloody, power attack 40 percent plus one strength on a mole Miner gauntlet. Perfect weapon for this build. non vats running attacks.
---
Increase to 200% and you have the new bloodied. Same build, slap a berserker weapon and level 1 armor. I doubt it will ever happen but I would like to see it
---
Also, you’re better off running 2* not 3*. Double the chances of something good, and most of the time the 3rd effect on 3 stars are terrible
---
Scripted the 3 heaviest things, sold what I could at a train station vendor and the remaining are in my store at 50C per star. Oh, I also destroyed a couple that aren't sellable.
---
How many weapons do you carry?  I would take out martial artist, replace with blocker. Choose when you're using one handed, and when you're using bare handed, and swap iron fist accordingly, use those points to finish out gladiator.
---
Do your weapons break often? Fix it good should be passive (swapped out), probably the same with makeshift warrior. Reduce intelligence to 5, take 2 more makeshift warrior , so you have rank 3 need rage and rank 2 ms/w to help with weapon degradation (which shouldn't be too bad if you have rank 3 weapon artisan). Take those 4 points and invest them in either agility, to make you more stealthy, or perception, to make you more vats-y. Also try rolling some ss armor, that's done op stuff right there
---
Yeah thats all it ever gives 
---
Back about a month? Or two ago when it first came out it gave handmades which I was happy for because I wanted to learn HM Plans
---
Now I've started a new character and when I place it all I get are broken swords
---
Why would ibget rid of the hat plasma it can do hundreds of damage per bullet if its ultracite
---
Look at this guy, only carrying around 250lbs of stuff.
---
I personally dont want 10 soulless maniquens hanging around my base *but that's your world as I see it* hheehehhehebebehe
---
I have the same roll but pump shotgun. I’ve used mine now for 30 levels. Two shot mythic level 81 death claw today with no shotgun oriented perks. Only difference is mine also has a “magic” effect so it stays useful for longer in the fight. But still not bad
---
I have 5 Gb of 76 photos on my hard drive, I feel ya.
---
According to a post I've read, the charisma gain from the legendary perk doesn't contribute to perk sharing. This might have been fixed by now, but an alternate way of dealing with it could be to get any of the other legendary special perks, then respec those you gained from the perk in to charisma.
---
Bloodied, +1 limb damage lever rifle. Hits at around 4000 max with adrenalin etc.. uses very little ammo, durable and great range. 
---
It's okay in a boss fight because DPS doesn't compare to something with a higher rate of fire, but it'll one-shot 95 pct of creatures and with only one point into crit savvy, every third shot is a critical.
---
Is that character level 15 yet?
---
I personally look for camps near overseers house, foundation, and crater to do some shopping and save money on travel while doing dailies 
---
My own personal camp is near top of world.   It’s central close to allot of good farming spots and has tons of nuke cards flights to farm
---
What, I already have the hat plasma I need the perks to help it even more
---
As far as weapons you also get the best return if the roll ends up being crap; 40 scrip back for spending 50 as opposed to 15 back on spending 25
---
Lol stands still with melee weapon draw* (obviosly unyealding sentinels armor) come on man it dont gotta be this way crouches to stealth field*
---
Just spent 4k....nothin
---
Level 40 
---
I bought a lvl 35 AAE Handmade from a vendor but it wasn't modded
---
I think he/she is referring to the Steel Dawn questline, not the Season 2 rewards/One Wasteland.
---
Thanks 😊 I’ll check it
---
It's rare.  Grahm has them sometimes and they are a rare spawn in random cranberry bog locations.  When meat week returns you'll have a good chance of finding them on Grahm.
---
If ya got one let me borrow it to pvp you haha
---
There aren't specific set prices for anything in vendors.  Just visit people's camps and get a general idea.
---
Been looking forever. Was hoping to have them before the discount took effect. I heard they show up down in watoga sometimes but no luck.
---
Those damn drag grenades.. I dropped one by accident on myself and bam, I had on a Green Sequin dress, a wig and some oversize pearls.
---
with the one wasteland patch 22 on tuesday 14th.  
---
  
---
edit: tuesday is the 15th ;)
---
September 15
---
*activates stealth boy, pounds a Berry Mentats, switches to JE laser and gets in BoS III T-60 Emergency Protocoled power armor*
---
Oh ok thanks!
---
 So can we get a way to transfer items between characters on the same account without the need for using a secondary account then? Cause the game pretty much forces this on you to some extent...
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals is a good place to share that.
---
That's some great RNG there where you hit the same prefix twice in a row, multiple times. I hit the same weapons(Revolutionary Sword) twice in a row today on a couple of my rolls.
---
I do! Bows are great if you're a stealth character because they are very quiet. 
---
If you're on PS4 and the stats are better than my current bloodied bow, I may be able to help you find it a loving new home ;) PSN xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero)
---
How much are ya sellin for?? I love the look of it and the functional flashlight w/o the need for power armor is a bonus.
---
Lighten up, Francis...
---
I guess what I meant to say is what are things going for.
---
someone got his trick or treat bag stolen by some bigger boys huh
---
You hopped servers 10 times in 4 hours? Dude, that's the problem. Give the server some time. Check player levels, etc. There are some frenzied servers which are a blast. Like, two ACP, two Queens and one Encryptid in less than an hour.
---
What version of the xbox are you using
---
Afaik those are both on the horizons. They’ve been data mined.
---
I haven't had any issues with Line in the Sand, but Radiation Rumble, finally experience it with somebody using a Tesla, it was bad, very bad.  I had so much trouble trying to put Ore in the storage unit.
---
that would be awesome! ps4?
---
Add 8 foot tall Rad Turkeys.
---
I've spoken to story manager about this and am informed this fix isn't the case
---
Lmfao
---
“Please, shut up about Halloween” -FTFY...
---
I’d hate to know that my life is so miserable that I get worked up by something that you can easily ignore. It’s literally as simple as scrolling a little further down the page.
---
1 - plasma has less accuracy when shooting
---
2 - SBQ has explosion protect
---
3 - the mechanics of the game are built in such a way that the more damage the shot deals, the less role armor plays. Plasma with a splitter deals less damage from each hit, so the boss's armor absorbs more damage
---
This. He had them every time I checked his planventory.
---
They are lazy Halloween enthusiasts. Ghouls rolling up to a Halloween party saying they are a zombie this year.
---
Hey, buddy!  Now just wait one fucking minute.  Don't you DARE compare us obese Americans with those Holloween freaks......
---
I don’t get it. Why is this game so tight on events? 
---
Most mmorpgs have almost month long events for anything they can use to add new cosmetics or event only items? 
---
I haven’t played through many events but from what I’ve noticed barely anything that resembles an event lasts longer than a week.
---
And yet here you are 🤷‍♀️
---
* I had to fast travel twice here, wonder why!
---
The Halloween decorations went up about a week ago at my camp. Stopped by the Pumpkin House to get pumpkins for my Halloween themed Sheedy Shack. Busted out the Pirate outfit and got the Ally in the White Rabbit Head and white tux. We're ready for all the boys and ghoul's to show up for Halloween.
---
Wtf is verdant season anyways?  How am I like level 355 and still done know?
---
LOL!  Nice.
---
True story:  A guy who I know has one of those mechanics toolboxes with the silky smooth roller type drawer slides.  His top drawer was filled with all kinds of heavy shit like impact tools and grinders.  That drawer was open a few inches and my friend had on some baggy sweat pants.  He reached to get something on the shelf above the toolbox and somehow his nuts fell into the drawer and it rolled shut *with his nuts still in it.* When I say shut, I mean totally closed.. there was a gap about 1/4 inch and thats it.  His face turned purple and he almost fainted. He had to go to the doctor to have his nuts examined LOL.  A couple days later when the swelling went down and the purple subsided.. he was back to normal.  How the hell anyone can slam their own nuts in a toolbox drawer IDK but your story reminded me of that haha.
---
I always do that, but it doesn't always work like that.  I probably tested with 10-15 different fast travels and found the spot I was happy with, but after building everything up, I found that I was spawning in different spots than I tested with (nothing built in those spots).  
---
Took me a bit to find a spot where I could move the camp module where I'd was happy with the spawns again, but I still spawn where I don't want 50% of the time.  I just made sure to make a visitor friendly path to the main part in case they spawn in the wrong spot.  Not much else I could do.
---
Add PSN xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero) and send me a message reminding me... I have one which I haven't listed in my vending machine yet &amp; you can have it for 1k. I do need to get rid of it asap cuz it's taking up space in my stash but I can hang on to it for a little bit ;)
---
Oh yeah, no you're right u/burliercupid53 ! Thank you.
---
It's for season 3, nothing changed in that regard 
---
A quick 13minutes video here u/JoeyAKangaroo of a recent interview concerning patch 22 and 23 (  for this last they say it's the season 3 update ): https://youtu.be/g8UG_b7JsBk
---
It worths the watch.
---
ok i am on now
---
Are you the villain from Costume Quest?
---
I really don’t understand the type of person you have to be to do that shit.
---
sent  sinistrmark is my psn
---
Someones mommy didnt love them enough... or maybe daddy loved them too much...
---
Good luck
---
Current one is an S, previously was using an original Xbox, but that one died a couple months ago. I never really looked through third person on my previous xbox though.
---
Usually, stupid teens.
---
Well, there's not going to be a set price list anywhere.  Use the search function and look for the specific items you want to sell.  Learn to use keywords in your searches.
---
You've right... "scrap" give ballistic fiber but "BoS Supplies" give also it + ammo and weapon... So I will change AGAIN lol
---
I never had ballistic fiber with "BoS Supplies" but I change my protectro only few days ago so... we will see.
---
Im using an original xbox one maybe it cant take it anymore? Its slowed so much since the game came out i cant wait for the series x
---
Me too, I will be getting one of those shortly. Careful with your original. Mine died after 7 years of solid use and took 2 months to get a new one from microsoft.
---
Xbox:(.  Sorry brotato
---
Did they get you an upgraded one
---
Im honestly a little concerned about Halloween this year because the roadmap lists Fasnacht, Meat Week AND Holiday Scorched but strangely omits Mischief Night. Oversight, or has Halloween been cancelled this year?
---
I made 27,000 caps today. (I've been on/off most of the day).
---
Between events, selling my daily 1400, and finally figuring out how to flip thing properly, selling any ammo I find and don't use, pricing things properly, etc, etc, etc...  yes... I actually made about 27,000 caps today!
---
You don't need high level players to buy things. You just need to price things appropriately, and have things of interest to players.
---
The stuff I sell the most are food plans, people collect all the various Teas, I sell a ton of those. It was only within this past week that I finally started selling ammo. I sell all the popular stuff that I'm not using myself. Every time I am out and collect stuff, and stop back by my camp, I refill the ammo with whatever I am carrying. People buy a TON of ammo, power cores and stuff like that.
---
Low level legendary weapons you can sell for about 50caps per star if it's junk. People buy them just to turn them into Scrip so they don't have to go out and find stuff themselves. If you find a decent low level legendary weapon, go ahead and put a decent price on it, make it reasonable... 300-500 or whatever. This way other low level players like yourself will be able to afford it. I sell a lot of fully upgraded 1-star low level weapons for new players in one of my vending machines at a low price go give them some good gear. They sell quickly.
---
Using Fed76.com, you can find stuff for super low prices, figure out it's value using that site, then flip it for more. I made at least half of my caps today just doing that. Use this site to figure out the value of your low level legendaries too. I generally take the quick-sale price, then sell it for half of that (unless it's some god-roll high demand item). Stuff has been selling within minutes of me putting it in my machines all day long today.
---
I've also been idling a lot today as I've been researching some of this stuff, so I sit in a chair in my camp, tab over to Reddit or other places and just browse the web while people stop by and buy stuff. I jump into events when they pop up, then come back and idle in my char some more.
---
I don't do this all the time, today was an extreme case for sure... but it's just to show what's possible if you put some effort into it.... and by effort, i mean really not much at all. Lots of vendor hopping and such.
---
Also helpful is leveling up the perk cards for Can Do, Pharma Farma and Scrounger (scrouger would be my first pick of these 3). They let you gain a LOT more stuff while out walking around clicking on everything. Especially the ammo, which you can then sell in your vendor between trips to and from various places.
---
As far as ammo goes. price it all at 1cap per round of whatever. I price cores at 1/2 the default rate. I can't keep stuff in stock.... meaning I'm making a steady stream of caps!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hope some of my story from today is of use to you...  I'm thinking of adding a blog article about this subject (and fast XP) to my website soon...
---
I want a pumpkin chunker like I saw on YT.  I could give those big green dicks in the parking lot of Westek hell with one of those.
---
They? Mine was well out of warranty. I had to buy an S, luckily my daughter was ok with me borrowing hers in the mean time.
---
There were characters worth of stuff people unloaded when they quit. It was Christmas for a fortnight as insane damage was only thing keeping some players from rage quitting over instability
---
I found them in a LVL 3 safe before, specifically the one inside of Appalachain Antiques, but it was a fluke. But you can find random weapon plans in those safes, fairly regular. I've found radium rifle and gatling laser plans in them a few times, too.
---
I've scripped multiple explosive shotguns cause why would you keep them?
---
Same issue here. Managed to get it to work by going back to the main menu -&gt; play -&gt; should spawn you outside the hospital -&gt; go in, run to the lab -&gt; install T-fuse first -&gt; analyze blood sample. 
---
Apparently it takes almost anywhere from 5-8 tries. I managed to make it work the first try. Test it out and let me know!
---
by God what is with you people with the whole "I did a shitty grind so everyone else should suffer too"
---
regardless of the game a shitty grind is still a shitty grind
---
This.
---
Just pick a spot where non-aggro mobs spawn or nothing at all spawns.
---
I haven't had turrets in my past few camps and never had anything at all spawn near them. The previous one I had was full of friendly mobs. I constantly had radstags, bevers, frogs, rabbits, foxes, lightning bugs...all the friendly critters, spawn in my living room LOL.
---
Straight up fists.  No perks.  Nothing to mod.  Come get some.
---
I like the spiked eggnog idea, but I want the side effect of drinking it to be massive farting.
---
none of this will ever happen because NW doesn't have any fallout 1st advantages so no money for bethsht
---
I legit go back to Fallout 4 just for the settlements
---
I came across a camp selling missiles and mini nukes for over 100 caps.  I did a SMH and then I went into my inventory and realized, I had several missiles and mini nukes I didn't know I had.  Dropped them all in front of the machine along with the "Formal complaint" letter.  The owner probably didn't get it, but I was trying to make a point that they're so worthless, I'm gonna give them to him.
---
YES PLEASE BETHESDA LISTEN TO THIS PERSON!
---
He sees me he totally sees me ... pounds 2 nuka cola quantums and starts running away jetpacking eradicly* not my junk flux :,(
---
Don't use it man.  It's a complete waste.
---
I think your dreams of a one handed melee build better be put on hold unless something changes from what is on the PTS.
---
Yeah...I’ve moved it everywhere and no go
---
I sell pumpkin and baseball grenades all the time.  It's the first thing I do after seeing Jack.  But Floaters can't even be dropped (only destroyed).  
---
To echo iypike, Floaters are so trash, not even the trash can wants them.
---
This.  It procs once and then bugs out.
---
No weapons.  Just the pure fury of naked fists.  No perks.  No mods.  No mercy.
---
Locks come in levels 1-3:
---
To pick a level 3 lock you need the picklock, master picklock and expert picklock cards equipped. To pick a level 2 lock you can have any combination of them as long as 2 are equipped.
---
I call this [the Kitchen Sink build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=aa51aaa&amp;d=x43x63x73x83x93xa3sg2sq0s31sr1sx2s82sy0pd0pk1pl1pg0ph1pi1pp2p00pj0eh1eu0ee2eo2cr0ir2ip2id2ib4i10a72a12a04a32ao0lt2li2ls2l71la2lk0&amp;w=an2ar2&amp;n=The%20Kitchen%20Sink); why settle for one thing when you can be EVERYTHING?
---
It's a power armor heavy weapons tank bloodied VATS rifleman stealth commando build. Muahahahaha.
---
Levels 0-3 technically
---
Fingers crossed.
---
Give me Xmas scorched, but in sheets.
---
Wait is this a thing?
---
So what you’re saying is, whenever I unlock the master picklock perk, I have to equip all 3 of the picklock perks to have it work? Or no? I was looking into it and people say the cards stack up also
---
I did this a few weeks ago at the top of the world. I realized like 2 hours later but I was on the same server so I went back to check, nope someone took it. I was so sad. It took me 58 tries at 14 luck.
---
Telling people to stop spamming about something borderline irrelevant isn't getting worked up, that's your own projection on OP. This sub gets clogged up with useless garbage often enough without adding another topic to that list
---
*follows the jet pack flames and shoots you the fuck down*
---
Shouldn’t have done that. Crouching breaks Berry Mentats for some reason, and now you is deader than my doorbell. Tracking jet pack flames isn’t hard.
---
Geez man, those rolls really do suck.  Condolences.
---
The Reeper 5419
---
It depends on the level of lock.
---
Level 1 lock you only need 1 of the picklock cards equipped, dosn't matter which one.
---
Level 2 lock you need 2 separate picklock cards equipped.
---
Level 3 lock you need the 3 individual cards equipped
---
One mans trash is another mans treasure, there’s always someone looking for that niche weapon.

You on Xbox?

Emergency Protocols, Max heavy gunner, adrenaline, adrenal reaction, nerd rage, lone wanderer, blocker, stabilized, bloody mess and a partridge in a pear tree.
---
Server hop reset the Steel you can buy
---
Hairstyles and tattoos, gentlemen. Hairstyles and tattoos!
---
That's one thing I love about the Communist Collectron.  The Revolutionary option finds frag grenades and blood packs.  So I can make nuka grenades and plenty of stimpacks.  Not that I ever had a problem finding frags, but I'm so happy I don't have to farm ticks anymore.
---
I'd be extremely appreciative of that!
---
No halloween begins at the end of august till early novem
---
Servers hoping resets the 5 amount limit!? No wayyyy! 🤣. What a frikin relief. Thanks buddy!
---
Underrated reply tbh
---
I sell acid for 5c, it goes quick. I used to sell screws for 7c and couldn’t keep up, until ACP, now I’m back to 5c for screws.
---
I tried to sell gears and springs, and couldn’t move them. I also sell steel for 1c each.
---
Flux I don’t sell - I sell the serums for 400c each.
---
Anti-Armor ‘Splosive 50cal, Bloodied Plasma Caster, Bloodied Weight Reduced Tenderizer, and a Quad Magic Double Barrel. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I'd recommend blocker. it's pretty useful even if you're sneaking. use all 3 commando perks and pick between ground pounder or concentrated fire depending on whether you're using vats or free aiming.
---
having tenderizer and suppressor maxed is a waste. can't really recommend suppressor, either. use lone wanderer or your preffered team-based perk(s) instead.
---
your agi tree is missing escape artist and a single adrenaline. evasive is fine, but not really needed. you can replace it if need be.
---
FLC is kinda useless depending on your gear. crit savvy is much, much better. better crits too, if you can make the room. you don't have serendipity, which is a no-no. ricochet works similarly if you want an extra layer of protection. and tormentor to varying degrees I guess, assuming you want to cripple things.
---
I just rolled 1000 more and got garbage though. 😅
---
Nice
---
Thank you :D
---
Too bad night is super short.
---
It also just... doesn't do anything.
---
I remember when it was 5 player influx affects prices I love the economy of 76 its kinda interesting
---
When does the new season start?
---
I'm not so sure I've seen this gun do a ass ton of damage to her and I don't have the requirements to trade for a 50 cal
---
Gas mask + Medical goggles &amp; Hunters longcoat for the longest time.
---
The explosive perks are pretty dumb, I’m surprised they kept them. They don’t do much damage if they even work at all.
---
Radtornado.  Radhurricane.
---
*Nuclear Wildfire.*
---
It's how i did my strangler armor, you're welcome :p
---
In advance the PA set effect is not crazy, looks pretty good on a lot of skins tho
---
When they nerfed TSE and then came a shotgun nerf, I quit the game for 6 months.  Basically that nerf rendered 50% of my weapons useless.  I came back and re-specced for bloodied. Now they are nerfing everything again, hitting bloodied builds especially hard.  At least this time the nerf seems manageable.
---
I thought Adrenaline was bugged?
---
Still relevant, stuck still
---
it's been fixed as far as I know.
---
Nothing different here. I went with 2 star ranged today and 1000scrip. THat's 40 guns.
---
I got 2 that were any good. One I kept for myself, the other may go up for sale (god roll 2 star popular combo I don't use).
---
Should be able to roll 6 a day until the sale ends.
---
Seems about par for the course to me.
---
Put ghouls in costumes and have legendary ones that drop Halloween pails, but with it's own new loot table, and give us new Halloween and horror themed camp items and stuff. 
---
Yes, I'm basically asking them to rehash the present and miner pails idea, but if we could get new stuff out of it, and if they upped the spawn rates, it could be cool?
---
Edit: and have some of the NPCs dress up for Halloween for like a week or so. How cool would it be to walk into the Wayward and see  Duchess dressed like a pirate or something?
---
How much is unstoppable monster worth?
---
Same answer + search function
---
It’ll take a week to scrip all of my Stalkers melee weapons though. 😭
---
If it does anything, I've yet to figure out what.
---
For the love of all that is holy, differents pipboy lights !
---
epiklybeasty
---
It's fixed
---
Got a Bloodied Bear Arm , 40% Faster swing speed &amp; +1 STR...no better roll than that. Earle dropped it for me.
---
 Grim Reaper outfit with a Scythe anyone? 
---
I have been asking for a Scythe for years now.
---
Oh they do that in my camp often but i move and let them, like "all yours, buy whatever the worst things are left, if u can't wait to see some new, probably better stuff" is their call
---
Right?
---
It means you don't buy anything for 4 levels and then buy whatever is listed when you reach that point.
---
Do you mean the purveyor sale when you mean discount? You don't need the plan to get legendary super sledges from her. All of the vanilla weapons are in her loot pool
---
under-ground? still under-whelming ... damn.
---
If you haven't noticed the whole game is basically Halloween themed and decorated.  After all, the bombs dropped an 8 day week before.  Just be thankful they didn't drop on Feb. 6th.
---
Ahhhh the ol' One Man Nut Slap.
---
I can sympathise.
---
RIP OP's nut.
---
Nothing I wanted for myself.  But a few decent things.  I put everything in my shop.  I'll roll again tomorrow when I get room for more scrip.  I definitely wish the limit was higher.  150 a day isn't enough.
---
I mean Beth can't make ladders dont be surprised
---
If there is a daily limit on how many caps, scrip and bullion you can earn a day, there shouldn’t be a limit to how much you can have. Let us stockpile that shit.
---
If they buffed it they would have to fix it so you couldn't get legendary armor effects while wearing broken legendary armor.
---
Yes....
---
Ya I have the Pestilence Skin it would look awesome with that, it's like the only reason I want it haha
---
I used to farm and sell them on a regular basis. They are easy to find when you know what to look for, the problem is that a third of them time they aren't there at all.
---
Start on the west bank between the two bridges by the chemical plant. Go at night, server hop if you need to and equip green thumb. Head south with a rifle that has a scope equipped, stop every few paces and look slowly for little green glowing things that look like the fireflies at the lighthouse. Several are tough to see from all angles and it is easy to miss them so do a complete visual sweep each time you stop and you will eventually start finding them. I think my record was 6 or 8 (with green thumb 12-16.) 
---
I think there are only 1 or 2 between the bridges, the bulk are just south of the southern bridge. Go slow but stay on the west bank.
---
Look at those downvotes. Too bad there's not an active NW reddit.
---
Same comments.
---
Try to stay around 20-25K caps if you're worried about maxing out.
---
Don't sell stuff if  you're maxed out. 
---
Lock your vendors up behind a wall with no door. Remove wall when you're ready to sell again.
---
I've been keeping myself around 15-20K. I don't have anything costing more than 2K for sale. if 15K seems low, I don't want to pay more than 15K for any one thing so it's a good limit for me.
---
Today I made 27,000 caps without maxing anything out.
---
I though you had to know the plan to get drops. I’ve never had a super sledge drop and I’ve tried plenty of times. If that’s the case good to know.
---
Project Paradise should be a trigger-able event once again.
---
Conversely, don't fall asleep at the fucking vendor. There's really no reason it should take you more than a minute to do your thing.
---
Nope closest picture ever in the run thing looked like the globe but was the size of a softball fml I grinded to 100 for that not really it was the firplace door I grinded for
---
Not for vanilla weapons. The only weapons that require plans are the fixer, sheepsquatch club/staff, tenderizer and gold bullion plans. Generally, if the weapon was available when the game launched, it's in the loot pool
---
What's a beefy schwarma handmade?
---
My best guess would be late October since Patch 22 comes on the 15th this month (Tuesday) so my best guess here: October 20th or 27th since both are on a Tuesday is the best guess for Patch 23/Steel Dawn.
---
I wish we had bigger holiday events all year tbh, but Halloween at the *least* should be bigger based on the timing of the apocalypse being days before
---
I think it depends on the weapon, build and preference of the person.
---
I know that for a fixer, most would consider Bloodied or Junkies, with either 33 vats, explosive, or 25 faster fire as second star and 25 lower AP or 15 faster reload as third to be a god roll.

I did the next best thing... small letters on my front door pointing to my website and my 76 fully edited gallery on there.
---
Would be cool to have it pull the PNGs from your photo folder... of course probably only you could see it due to security and other liability issues, so it's probably why they dont/wont do it.
---
I'm going to assume Season 3 itself will have Brotherhood of Steel themed items (Since Season 3 itself will be mid November if I'm correct) while Fractured Steel itself comes available late December/early January. 
---
Hard to tell honestly.
---
Very exciting. Going to have to hold back on swapping all of the ones in the house. Just getting one initially.
---
Lol so I just have terrible luck. Not sure I feel better. Thank you for that info. I generally just play alone and keep to myself but join events when I can. I rarely look for outside info and just try to learn on my own but really just want a leg super sledge and been looking for way to long. Ty for The info.
---
Especially not worth it when we get perk loadouts this fall/winter.
---
I think it's the pipe revolver and the pipe bolt action that you can double dip perks with.  The auto pistols don't work.  AFAIK it still works with the others, but I am not using it currently so I'm not 100% sure.
---
Public teams are accessed by clicking the chain link in the social menu.  It allows you to team up with random people.  You can also form your own team and play alone while still receiving some perks for being on a team.
---
Legendary shotguns are OP in vats if they are stalkers, instigating or junkies OR have the perks 50% limb damage, +33 Vats Hit Chance or Bashing damage.  OR you can have a piece of armor with "Less damage while blocking" and any shotgun is OP in VATS.
---
I would like Berserker to give twice the damage (like permanent instigating) but armor should unequip itself when broken. Otherwise, it's bloodied 2.
---
Bloodied/Explosive/Faster Movement Speed While Aiming.
---
Did not know this. Thought it was just the 20hr timer like the vendors or something from when I picked it up.
---
Explains why I can loot whitespring and other large sites over and over... since I probably picked that many items up at the end of each run...
---
The s has less storage but is just as strong and only costs 400
---
That's hilarious. 
---
I love it when things like that happen.
---
I got quite a few good rolls. Mostly stuff either I or an alt can use.
---
I was using a bolt action and was still getting only 160 damage with a two shot. I remember being able to hit for 1k (with sneak crits) and now it does basically nothing. Could be a bug maybe.
---
Edit: [my build](https://imgur.com/a/tfN9Mzy)
---
sstill not fixed... just happened now on pc.
---
I'd you're getting 2 to 3 levels a day,  spending 2 levels a week to cradt ammo isn't that bad. Of course I'd rather just get Ammo Factory on a mule or just farm ammo at ACP
---
Someone started that with me yesterday at the Molemama's scrip machine. I stayed on it for a minute, and then when I was done, found him on the other side of the building and lead him back to the machine, at which point I started using it again just to prevent them from it. Though I am up there in levels where unloaded a clip might have a more fun outcome, it was still gratifying.
---
LOL. Why we have all the finest things to offer you good sir.. step right up!
---
Pleas fix the super sledgehammer bug. If I swing from left to right I fully expect to hit everything within a 2ft radius from left to right. Also fix the hit box distance for the feral gouls I’ve been hit from 2-3ft away while I can only hit them if I’m literally breathing down their backs
---

---
Lmao I love it that you just came back from Beta and it's the thing you still noticed, and chose to bring to Reddit. Yes that is still around. Pipe revolvers and bolt actions benefit from both pistol and rifle perks, if you have a rifle stock equipped.
---
Two shot is nerfed into oblivion, compared to the 2nd bullet for 100% damage from back then.
---
Itll come sooner or later.

I just started today and looking for people to play with gt is: Garrzira

I would personally go with something more like this [build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f433fe&amp;d=s01l71lt2lu2p02pg2ph2pp2a72ar1an2ir2cu2eu0pi2ao0a30a04la2eh2lk2&amp;m=5c2fb&amp;am=182536-182536-182136-182136-182536&amp;wp=w6&amp;wm=142535). But it is a personal choice. If you don't like spamming/holding down your crit button, then you can move points from LCK and Critical Savvy to STR and use Blocker instead for more defence. But generally a bloodied stealth character with unyielding armors is so good at sneaking (high agility makes even the sneak perk unnecessary) that you don't need defence that much, as nobody will see you coming.
---
I would wait until the legendary perks launch in few days. As they will make building your character so much easier and better with those legendary perks that add specials.
---
EDIT: Just for example this will be my sneak commando when those legendary perks hit. I have calculated that i have (or *should* have) enough perk coins to make [this build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f358aa&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2pp2p02ir2a72an2ao0lu2lt2l71la2s01eu0ic4eh2ce0c62sg2a04cu2xm3a32x83x73x51x43x60lk2lv0ib4&amp;w=c72&amp;m=051c29fe8b3&amp;am=18-18-18-18-18&amp;wp=w6w6&amp;wm=142535-142835&amp;n=Legendary%20Commando).
---
When I was asking about the shotguns I was more asking if they changed the way it did damage. The problem with it was each individual shot from it applied the legendary effect. So instead if you had something that added 20 plasma damage, it would add 20 plasma per shot. So it would be more like 100 damage. It’s a problem with the game engine and I was wondering if they finally fixed it or if they just tweaked something else.
---
It’s dependent on the buyer, but generally, all scrap sells for under 5caps a unit. For your specific junk, I’ve had success  with lead:3caps per unit, copper:2 caps per unit, acid:3 caps per unit, springs: 3 caps per unit, screws: 2 caps per unit. Flux sells for between 100-150 caps per. Hope this helps
---
What's your platform?
---
Edit: I see you said "xbox help". If you were on PC I was gonna give you a sledge. Good luck with your search though!
---
Why is everyone's Halloween idea super immersion breaking? You all literally complain about that every other day lol
---
You can expect the mannequins for displaying outfits/armors and the power armor displays on the atom shop in the near future.
---
Added you
---
You should be able to hit for more than 160 with sneak headshots even without any perk cards, so yeah something isn't right.  It may be a visual bug with the damage indicator since two shot divides the damage into two.  Possibly you are getting twice what is shown on the damage numbers or if you are at range you might be missing with the second projectile.  Two shot is notoriously bad for accuracy.
---
What part of this game in competitive? There aren't leaderboards in NW, so anyone with a  high level could have gotten it from being a bush wookie or NW killer.
---
How the hell do you get down voted for having 20 pies?
---
Like is it okay to have one but anymore than that is just greedy?  I don't get it.
---
What Zdtfx says is perfect. I don't run with any lockpick on. When I come across anything that requires it, I just unequip Commando and put the three lockpick cards on. Pick the lock, and reverse the process. It is kind of a pain, so I don't lockpick often.
---
No idea my man. Simps living their simp lives.

Alcohol , Daddy-O , Daytripper , Mentats &amp; Psycho are working good for me last 3 months since becoming a full time Junkie

I love that statement, "My whole life revolves around halloween." Me too!
---
Cry more
---
One wasteland?
---
If you have any of the legendary effects that I listed, all projectiles do full card damage and each projectile counts as a seperate explosion if explosive.
---
Normal shotguns do not do this any more.  They nerfed shotguns a long time ago to not exhibit the behavior you are referencing.
---
Same here. I wish there was some way to truly request to make sure it they do it better this year.
---
At this point some people are just nitpicking stuff to bitch, seriously...
---
I've been saying this since beta!!! We need it, and increase the photo limit!
---
I agree with the mule for ammo production, it's actually quite brilliant, but grinding to max out 6 leggy perms is going to take too long to just be throwing points away unequipping them. I really don't understand why (other than to make our grind longer) Beth decided we should pay to swap them out.
---
Out of 5k script (5 level 50+ characters) I got one decent weapon, I think.  B2525 Plasma pistol/rifle. I've never used plasma and have no idea if they're good.
---
Yea I've given up with the purveyor I just farm a Colossus problem since you only get decent to really good stuff. The last 10 times I done it I gotten 6 bloodied gun no they where not amazing but to get consistent bloodied gear from the same event is goo enough to farm in my book. The purveyor just gives me nocturnal or hunters garbage like no thanks.
---
I got three bloodied with 500 scrip spent: minigun, combat shotgun, and light machine gun. I’ve decided I’m going to go buy a lottery ticket following these developments.
---
I concur.  This is a better overall build.
---
Did the relink thing... One of my friends said he could see me online... Now to wait for someone to be in a private world so I see if I don't get booted
---
NOICE! From looking at the pictures I bet the snapping to get everything right with the roofs was probably really tedious. But damn son this looks epic!
---
I saw camp turrets were something like lvl 45 now, have no idea what that means for performance though.
---
I thank you for the award apparently it either identifies you as a reasonable person or you are interesting I am completely confused I will look into it deeper I’m enjoying this program immensely and look forward learning more about it I must say some of you have me laughing my as$ off
---
My son got it a couple months ago it was around 60ish gigs. It took forever to download, and the reason we upgraded our internet and wifi lol
---
https://imgur.com/a/tfN9Mzy 
---
That’s what I’m working with. I remember this thing one shot fucking everything. Now it takes two headshots to kill a scorched. With 3.75x damage. I dunno what’s up.
---
This.  I forgot about needing to apply a rifle stock.
---
Yes it is always satisfying lol
---
What is it now? 50%? Cause it feels a lot lower.
---
Best I can do is 500caps
---
Judging solely by the card damage shown, you should be seeing at least 800 damage from sneak headshots if you hit with both projectiles.  If you aren't hitting for that or more, something is definitely wrong.  No idea why though.
---
...and now I'm obsessed with finding this. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
---
Aw I didn't even know there was a cap I'm a little sad now :-( I just started playing not long ago
---
I always have about 6 on my vendor.
---
I think its 50, its super annoying, pretty much stopped taking pics in game when i hit it the first time.
---
Hold onto that if you are unarmed. I suspect starting patch 22 on the 15th you will \_need\_ to power attack enemies more often in melee than you do on live.
---
Very. Can’t move forward in the storyline. This is 30D since an update. When is this patch happening?
---
I spent over 5500 and got nothing good
---
If someone does that to me I just kill them no questions asked.
---
Currently legendaries can only have three effects max, so three stars. If you see more you have discovered a hacked weapon. Use at your own risk.
---
Fuck me I had this as well
---
Turned on my cheap ass mic (I have a usb mic, 60 quid, i use for recording but sis borrowing it, my cheap mic is the earphones one) and said "yo, I'm restocking gimme a sec"
---
I wonder why there needs to be a limit if it's stored offline?
---
Probably has to do with not playing since beta. Probably bugged my character in all sorts of ways. Really sucks. Thought they would’ve fixed lots of these bugs by now. It’s been like a whole 2 years. Oh well.
---
I know, thanks.
---
It has 5 stars but 2 are grayed out. Never used hacks. Anything like that would be due to a bug.
---
If Pacifist is enabled, you can't engage PvP and vice versa but you can still hit them just without the prompt
---
When it shows a new perk card, or cards, it means you hit a level that unlocks a new perk that you're interested in. If you are planning on taking multiple ranks of that perk it will show up again, as many times as you're planning to take it. When multiple cards are shown it means multiple cards were unlocked by your level, and you can pick any of them and still be on track, the exact order is up to you. 
---
You'll often hit periods where you're unlocking perk cards faster than you can rank them up, so that "+1 from previous level" counter starts counting up to keep track of how many levels it will take you to catch up. If you then hit a stretch where none of the cards you're interested in are being unlocked, it won't show any new cards, and the "previous level" counter will start counting down, indicating that you ranked up one of the cards you'd already hit the level requirement for. If the counter hits zero it will say "no card on this level", which means you've run out of cards to unlock and should wait a level or more before selecting anything.
---
In practice the math is a bit off since you start out with a perk point in every stat but don't get to pick a perk for any of them, so it might take longer than what they say to unlock everything. Or it might take less if you get lucky and get some of the cards you need from perk packs. The roadmap is mostly useful for telling you which perks to keep an eye out for at each level.
---
Double the chance of more crap to unload later on.
---
Thx 👽💚 and it was definitely challenging 
---
😅 unfortunately I'm going off the cuff interior layout/design Soo walls haven't been added yet (separating the rooms)...
---
😥 my trusty flamethrower ganna get some good use next couple days.

I’d take 2 BFFR fixers and 200 pounds of crap over 1 BFFR fixer and 100 pounds of crap
---
This!
---
Nowhere did I say anything about robot vendors
---
Ok thanks. That was less than I was expecting but might be doable.
---
Is modules 50% off also?
---
So you harass people who refuse to engage in pvp with you? You realize the problem is you right?
---
Don't grab the dicks erecting tiny nazi flags!
---
I got a mediocre bloodied and vampire handmade, and what made me happy the most: Two magic weapons (i think) A B3390wr Minigun and a Vampire gatling laser with bashing dmg.
---
Nice. It was really boring when absolutely everyone ran two shot explosive shotguns. Glad they fixed that.
---
Right with the updates I've endured I thought it would be bigger
---
We’ve heard this one before, haven’t we lads!
---
Maybe if they made them interior only? Like if you go into an instanced area they'd be with you like the Overseer is for a few quests. I dunno, but the mental image of eight Gary's running around the Earle fight all screaming their names is pretty entertaining.
---
Same here, since I finished the other one I have only been checking in every few days.  Although at times it seemed to be a bit of a pain to keep up, it definitely gave you more reason to login every day.
---
My personal bsc build. Does about 325 a shot to the queen. https://pasteboard.co/JqxgOUd.png
---
I didn't see that, are for real, legit stands in there somewhere?
---
So with the eggnog, there should be random effects. Some positive, some negative. That way it’s kind of a gamble and it would be more interesting
---
20% I believe, or 25. It splits the damage between two bullets, so each bullet only does about 60% damage.
---
Some pointers:
---
* When you see multiple cards on a single line, it means that those cards from your build are available to you at that level and you have a choice to make as to which card you want to allocate.  Multiple cards are listed left to right in S.P.E.C.I.A.L order but you can choose which you want to prioritise.
---
* When you see 'X from prev lvl' it means you will have had cards listed that you could not allocate before and now you can allocate them.
---
* When you see 'no card on this level' it means you have no outstanding cards in your build to allocate at that level.
---
Certain skills only become available at certain levels.
---
For example: At L16 Martial Artist becomes available.  You have to allocate all your outstanding perk points (so from 14 and 15) to be able to pick that card.   The card will not be visible to choose until then.
---
If you are not sure where to allocate a point (when it says 'no card on this lvl') look at the number allocation to the left and follow it down and allocate the points to match your build at a higher level.  You still have to pick a perk card, but you can choose a utility or filler card. 
---
For example: L34 (10,2,x,x,x,x,x) and then L35 (11,3,x,x,x,x,x): That would be 2 points allocated but for only one level.  You should have allocated the points earlier.
---
Hope the above helps a bit.
---
I cant say ive have ever lagged from that stuff. Eveyone talks about it but ive never seen it even the the SH PA. However I do use a BE plasma gat but I let people shoot and I shoot in burst
---
This is Bethesda. Do you expect that to be fixed?
---
Haha nice! I always wanted to make something crazy like this but knowing how much a pain in the ass it is to build a decent looking normal house base I would loose my shit real quick trying to attempt this so A+ for you sir!
---
Expect a lot more is the name of this game hun
---
there are worse porns than nazi flags and what I am telling is really BAD
---
I absolutely love the idea of stockings that other players can fill
---
Nicely written. I need to get writing about 76 on my blog site soon. I do a lot of writing about another game on my site, and their Reddit community is super toxic. It was a shocking change tiptoeing into here for the first time and taking a peek, then realizing ....EVERYONE is friendly.... kind of like in game. I love this community!
---
If this was on xb1 that was me. I thought that with all the garbage everyone is getting from the purveyor, someone could use something good out of there.
---
You can only get the rest once you learn the previous one.
---
I hope not because I couldn’t find a data for 3 months until last night I found one and turned it in and got the knight plan and read it right away.
---
Yup, and plain atom store ones. But the season ones are fancy and armor ace themed.
---
No &amp; yes
---
Idk if you realize this but the 25% less VATS cost on your combat rifle makes VATS free with the right mods due to a bug that's been there since launch. The AAE25 Combat Rifle is an incredibly good weapon
---
Do as big name stores do; Start 1-2 months early and keep them around for another 6 afterwards.
---
Well... you put my camp, which is in the same location to shame. Take my upvote.
---
Yeah i Expeted 90+ gigs
---
I have adrenaline maxed should I not of done that. Sorry been playing since beta but only started using guns and messing with perks about four months ago. I changed whole build around and I maxed adrenaline out. Is it a waste to do that
---
Yes. There are Strangler Pods in a few other places, but only the ones up and down the river near Dyer Chemical can turn into Strangler Blooms. [Here is a picture](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/605475929468305413/667559420191965224/Cx0JiS4.png) of the datamined locations.
---
I used to run one of those also and loved everything about it.
---
what mod needs to be added?
---
with coal
---
According to their recent behaviors, recommand to save any useful resources(caps, rare junk for ammos, repairing and crafing, legendary modole/script) before the update. I feel that Beths are retrieving and will decrease income of most general access that we have gotten used to, maybe, MAYBE because of new sources that the upcoming update brings.
---
Bethesda already has a mechanism in place to do regular sale. Not for the new stuff. They'd actually have to do work if they wanted to do that. You know what Bethesda is like with doing work...
---
Are you using a headset that connects through the controller (Xbox)? I had a similar issue where the audio would be corrupted on PC if used my headset connected through controller. Used normal PC headset and no more issues.
---
This sounds like malware. Sorry but I've never heard this game glitch that badly and start playing what sounds like ads.
---
I remember when All Rise was the strongest weapon. High level players used it to terrify low levels around Flatwoods.
---
In my experience not many players sell flux, 100-150 caps is a fair price but I've bought it at 250 and was happy to get it. It's heavy though so if you're swimming in it, price to sell.
---
I've been wondering what to do with mine. I'd like to craft and sell underarmors, I unlocked the plans for shielded casual early on and would have been happy for the intelligence boost while leveling up but couldn't find the flux. It looks like the other shielded plans are a lot more difficult to come by though.

This Christmas instead of nuking each other's camps we can just give people coal
---
not necessarily. it's more like, adrenaline is fine at 1 or 5 and anything in between. most of the time you could probably use those 4 points elsewhere, though.
---
I am on PS4, can give free samples to players under level 50. If you are over fifty, then, be a man and do the grinding. Andreslamantis.
---
That's what got me into the game originally! I was hesitant at first from all the publicity but after trying it myself I enjoy it and the community is a big part of that.
---
"Arguably the best build in the game" bloodied heavies beg to differ.
---
As a new player who only joined the game towards the end of the last season, I can't wait. I think the BoS bunker looks the most exciting to me.
---
just wait duh
---
Yeah but careful, your character is quite weak. I know it's fun killing things while being hidden but it makes you really vulnerable in certain situations. 
---
Personally, as the game meta is about to really focus on teamwork, i rather go for a commando build like this ( https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1dd853d&amp;d=ek1eo1ee1lu2l71lt2sg0ir2pg2ph2pi2ic1la2pp2eh1l11es2eg0c13ce0cm2p00a01a30&amp;w=a12c61c72at1lm2au2iq2ik0if2&amp;m=51c24fb3&amp;am=182138-182138-182138-18253a-18253a ).
---
Here the goal is to take advantage of Unyielding armor set to patch our weaknesses as we put alot of point in Endurance. Im optimising it right now ( this character is lvl 69 right now ) and it goes already pretty well. I may change a few things, but at this point it a question of preference. I'm just still not sure if i wanna keep "Dodgy". It's just that right now i can vats everything (adds) non-stop and i still don't know how hard it can effect my ap.
---
But what i'm trying to say is you may wanna look for more health. With a decent dmg resistance. I even may switch "Dodgy" for "Evasive" as an Unyielding set can give me 15+ more Agility points.
---
[Edit:] I just added "concentrated fire" rank one. I mean it's a must lol
---
[Edit 2:] I hope you understand here that the the point is to have as much health as possible for when you are at 20% health. Drugs and Food will help here to patch some other weaknesses (or simply improove your dps) and increase your health.
---
I’m curious how much they go for?
---
Damn I guess back to the drawing board. I have switched it around and still need to stop hoarding so much so I can lower my strength numbers down. Everything else I have set to almost perfect. Have 9 strength 14 perception 4 endurance 1 charisma 3 intelligence 15 agility and luck is 10 I think: but I might move those points to different perks in agility. Thanks for info. Right now I can get around 200+ damage to queen.
---
I just want to have rose as a companion
---
Oh that i thought you meant the x01 thatsthe enclave advanced you saw its animal design is a dead ringer for enclave pa
---
All clothes did that on Fallout 4. Only underarmor was wearable with armor pieces. 
---
I guess Cricket was ready for it 24/7.
---
Most of the super rare ones are trade only still, meaning no caps, but item trades
---
Perhaps an 3\* Assassin's Rolling Pin was exactly what I was hoping for?
---
They all suck so why?
---
Tell grandma to get with the times before I get her kneecaps
---
What if Jetpack would be separate piece similar to backpack and behave the same way? Could be equipped only when you are in PA and be disabled when you are outside of PA. This would mean that Jetpack couldnt be crafted or modified on power armor station and different crafting station would be used instead. Not sure if this would fix the problem regarding modding system because I am not aware what is exactly the issue.
---
Or PS4 I’ll hop on right now
---
This new death grips album sounds fire
---
I’m 64 can I make an argument for why I can’t grind :(
---
Once you've learned a BOS PA paint plan, that plan no longer drops from the quest and the next plan becomes unlocked for dropping. So if you want to farm the knight plan in order to sell it, then don't learn it. If, OTOH, you simply want to learn all the plans, then learn them as soon as you get them in order to unlock the next plan in the series.
---
BOS PA paint plans have roughly a 4.5% chance to drop, so you'll be doing this for a while...
---
idk how to even use them
---
I'd happily spend 40 mins walking back to camp rather than dump those excess glass shards I don't need...
---
Oh bud, you have no idea ;)
---
It is not bug it is combination of mods effects some mods have %5 less vats ap and automatic have %50 less vats ap . Before you will be able to do it %99 but they cap it at some point
---
I actually had a dream about this last nigh. And when they released the data mined mannequins they were the size of a bobble head and everyone was pissed haha
---
Bro if you’re already level 300 why are you complaining about the amount of perk points you get before the patch even drops zzz
---
This happened to me earlier. I just went to the help screen from the main menu, clicked on an item to view in the atomic shop, and everything loaded in fine after that. Fallout 1st also started working again.
---
And i tought i had a bad day with mumbles, F for your tragedy
---
Perk coins. Read the post before commenting.
---
👀👀👀
---
Is "I don't use Gauss weapons and/or secret service armor" a valid enough reply for you?
---
Fragile isn’t really an issue. Until things are changed so people can’t be in permanent stealth, any argument of being a glass canon is laughable.
---
Once that is fixed? Berserker should have an equal multiplier to Bloodied, certainly.
---
I’m imagining me (lvl 448) running around in lvl 1 legendary sneak gear with a commando build. And I thought a bloodied build is a glass cannon. That build would take the cake for risk vs reward.
---
That. I'm level 386 and I can still get almost a full level out of line in the sand without xp buffs
---
Out of curiosity what is the last plan to learn?
---
I figure i've probably had it by now as I have not had a plan drop for a while, but i've never actively farmed this quest, and only turned in tech data when i've stumbled across it - so maybe i'm missing out.
---
I used to think like this but honestly when you play this game long enough you see it all.i take no offense to the flogging at vendors. Or angry emotes. Most of the time I just back out because I know I’m slow and these other guys/gals got SBQs to BBQ so whatever. 
---
Let them have the machine and I’ll wait. I gotta remember to put hard bargain on anyway.
---
I myself have been called away from the game only to come back and realize that I was in a dialogue with a vendor.
---
I’ve also heard myself being beaten and realized it ( so you know, it does work). Especially if you are multi-tasking while working from home during the day. The sound brings my focus back. And I’m like oh crap I blocked somebody.
---
And yes, I have fallen asleep while restocking my vendor.
---
So don’t assume negative intent, it’s people like me who give these players reasons to behave like this. 
---
So please, punch and emote away, sometimes just walking around me briskly is eNough. I’ll probably hear you. Just don’t explosive bait my ass.
---
I’m level 120 and I have no real clue ok I’m just doing things out here, I’m commenting to keep track of this thread
---
I feel like an immersive Halloween celebration in game would be... no celebration at all. Who cares about holidays when you're trying to survive in the apocalypse?  
---
Besides, it seems plausible to me that when the bombs dropped some people could have been wearing their costumes at parties and such.
---
Good for you. You don't use them, so Legendary Modules are useless to you and this 50% discount to everything else benifits you. 
---
I don't need anything but Legendary Modules from the purveyor so this sale is meaningless.
---
All the plans from Project Paradise should be obtainable in some other way. Including Bear Arm and its mod plans, which can't even have a  chance to drop until you already know Bear Arm...
---
We all know the dwellers in vault 94 were nudists who didn't believe in vaultsuits
---
Here's one for [plans](https://fed76.info/plans/). They also have one on that site for legendaries. It's not 100%, but should give you a reasonable idea. 
---
Welcome back!!
---
Sometimes you can fly, sometimes you just shart.
---
I don't care about extra loot or anything, just a small cosmetic change to make the game more festive
---
I'm using this week to farm materials needed to make ammo, since I was low.
---
Berserkers are not wearing unyielding unless they literały want to die from any single kind of attack. This wouldn't be bloodied 2.
---
Aren't you meant to sell off all the shitty perks you got along the way too?
---
Fuck I can't wait to clean my list out. I have like 4x max'd out Lead Belly...... *Just....Why?*
---
Yeah that’s what I meant chief, it don’t matter- the 50 coins was the answer to the respec problem, if you’ve respecced over 50 points worth then consider seeking support for ur chronic indecision
---
Until noon eastern standard US time.
---
I have been playing since release. 2300 hours in. Over 600 levels with low INT, which means slowly leveling up. Did the event many times.
---
I got the plans last week. But vending machines usually have diffusers for sale. The same with pemmican. Just play the game and it will come.
---
If you have to ask its time
---
but was he TRULY Outrageous?
---
Easiest way is probably to follow the market sub , with time you pretty much learn to say what is worth keeping , selling and so on . Even the worst looking weapons /armors can be of value to some players that collect a certain type of prefix/type.
---
Its pretty easy to sell large amounts of scrip weapons to players , 20 caps / scrip so a 3\* weapon nets you 800 caps , that is if you dont need to scrip em yourself.
---
There's these vendor perks you can get under the charisma line, you can get that maxed out easy and if you don't use drugs just sell them to the vendors... become a drug dealer too; players really love drugs in this game and....well it's going to get tougher because the more you fast travel, you will more to pay travel around as you level up. I would recommend using the wiki to look for things you want or some guides.
---
I must have spent 1.3k caps on just the plans for brick building set when I was level 20 and started again from 0 and at lvl 30 I am now back at 700 something I think. Also when you get the chance, set up a vendor at your camp and sell things people actually want. Like fusion cores, ammo, drugs, legendaries, etc. My fusion cores sell pretty quickly even the low ones.
---
Make sure to stock up on caps though because at some point fast traveling for quests is going to cost more than what you get from completing a quest. The vendor perk definitely is valuable; because you can vendor guns from cheap shot scorched who drop them.
---
Legendary perks doesn't meant to be fully ranked and used at day one they give 50 free legendary perk points because lots of people don't get perk cards from perk packs they open and blah blah not because they want people to rank up so they can be happy
---
And yet they win the costume contest EVERY YEAR
---
But to max out all 6 slots takes 1,800 perk coins. 50 is a drop in the bucket and hardly a reward for having a character at lvl 402.
---
I can only assume that because the only time I see it pop up, it's in the forest, it's meant for low level characters.
---
I just got rid of all my turrets.  And now I barely get attacked.  Although the Communist Collectron did invite some of his Liberator friends over for a party that got out of hand this evening.
---
It's mutual PVP just ignore and restock.
---
Have you tried deleting the game INI files?
---
It's entirely possible that one of them has been corrupted or screwed up for whatever reason.
---
/documents/my games/fallout 76
---
You're looking for fallout76.ini, fallout76prefs.ini and maybe fallout76custom.ini
---
Back them up, delete them, start the game and let it regenerate them for you. 
---
Might fix it.
---
With the amount of perks I have saved up, and probably a lot of other people too, I and they can scrap all of cards, even the equipped ones, and still have more than enough to rebuild our characters. I haven’t done the math, but I imagine I can get a few hundred coins and level up at least two cards once each.
---
Sure people do Project Paradise! I do PP every time it pops; its my favorite event! My group always knows whenever they see it that its time to head to Arktos. :) I also sell Diffusers in my vendor. 
---
Its a great event really; lots of xp for SCORE if you get your buffs (like Tasty Squirrel Stew, then add in some Berry Mentats and Cranberry Relish and lunchboxes! Don’t forget to take a snooze at your camp too for Well Rested.) PLUS you end up with so much meat to sell. Its an all around good time. :)
---
I'm not researching through a bunch of random threads, maybe for a super valuable god roll but no, I need to be able to look up value of a dozen legendaries at a time. If someone has a more reliable database than fed that would be great, but it's worked pretty well so far.
---
I got it a couple of days ago after a year off and I had a 70gb update
---
Sorry if that sounded like bragging. Didn’t mean for it to come off that way.
---
I fought 5 mole rats and one wolf over the course of 7 minutes. I know it is supposed to be a low level event vut one of the first things you have to do is go fight 5 level 5 scorched's at the same time. The enemies also barely aggro you in this event. Like I understand it's Baby's First Event but there's others like hunting 3 legendary wolves that are in packs of 5. It's just not challenging nor rewarding enough at the cost of time.
---
They do, because the synergy between adrenal reaction, nerd rage, dodgy, serendipity, ricochet and 30 agility points coming from 5 unyielding pieces turns you into a surprisingly durable killing machine. 
---
I did it for 20-25 levels. Berserker DCG. Total beast at half health.
---
The point of the post is that 50 coins is next to nothing when it takes 1,800 coins to max out all 6 slots. A perk coin reward for higher levels would make more sense then lvl 50 as the cutoff, sport.
---
Oh ok. 9am for me damn I think I missed a day then, couldn't play until this evening
---
Using a regular pc headset, wireless. I wanna say a relatively recent razer but i can't remember which one.
---
Bloodied, Junkies and Anti armor are weapons you should sell, if it has explosive rounds or ffr its very good. 3rd perks like Less vats cost make it a God roll then. 
---
Assassins, Bolstering, Unyielding and Vanguard are armors you should sell. If it got Sentinel, Cavalry or sneak it is very good. 2nd perks like ap regen make it a God roll then.
---
Three star nocturnal death claw gauntlet
---
Malware? Idk how I've never heard of a game getting affected like malware like this. but this problem occurred back when i had this on the bethesda launcher and on the steam launcher across many installs so idk.
---
And I’m not trying to be maxed out at day one. Just a suitable reward for higher level players is all. 1,800 coins to max out all 6 slots leaves PLENTY of room for such a reward.
---
Elder
---
Yeah, if you wear a broken stealth armor you’ll still have its effects without  being penalized which is pretty good
---
Hadn't heard of that one, might as well give it a try now.
---
The helmet light works on the Secret Service Helmet. Provides the perfect amount of light in the perfect position imo.
---
What a great story.
---
You meant to say "**auto**complete" I guess...
---
TSE combat shotgun is still a great VATS sniping machine if you mod it correctly
---
That sucks. She could have at least bought you dinner first before she fucked you. 
---
I guess that is how it is sometimes with these beautiful women...
---
The scrip limit needs to be increased in general. Period.
---
The loot pool is polluted with so much trash that literally no one needs that it's genuinely insulting to have a scrip limit of 150 a day. 200 if you count what you can get from public events.
---
I wish they'd change this stupid system to work a bit more like the gold press machines. Give us scrip notes and allow us to turn in a set amount. Still stupid but it has the mandatory limitation Bethesda uses for everything.
---
Next Tuesday with the release of update 22.
---
I had a guy be afk at his vendor with the weapons.. he spawned, I saw the camp appear and as a trainer boi myself I go there and the dude goes into his vendor and like 40 mins later he disappears  away with his camp
---
Yeah, but being at lvl 400 means you'll be close to finishing them anyway.
---
Sounds about right. It takes 1,800 to max all 6 slots though. I want to clean out my duplicates as well. Either way it’s an atrocious grind so a better perk coin reward would be appreciated.
---
Definitely only swords.
---
The raider collectron gets guns.
---
Dude, we're in a post-loyalty era. No one cares about loyalty. All you are to Bethesda is a vehicle for revenue.
---
Also we got that "reward" with the mountain scout outfit. 
---
Are you also going to ask for a reward for those that have not broken their Fallout 1st subscription streak since its launch? How about a reward for the $500 and over club for those loyal customers who have kept the light on and the game running for the rest of us freeloaders?
---
smh
---
Damn
---
Why 12k? You literally just said that 10k was too steep for you. So to turn around and sell a spare for 12k reeks of hypocrisy.
---
This is basically what I've been doing for a long while without realizing it.  
---
Just to add, for melee, faster swing speed, 40% damage with power attack. With +1 str makes it a god roll
---
No, you're right, I did it once and that was enough for me. Didn't even play it with my secondary character😆
---
Oof, ow my ears, yea no that didn't work unfortunately. But it did regen them.
---
Even without a broken stealth suit if you’re loaded up on the stealth perks you’re really sneaky. As long as you aren’t wearing armor! Maybe I’m old school but I berserker commando, if you take my meaning :)
---
It's 4 minutes... Why not show up to the event 3 mins 50 seconds later?
---
Until the super nerf anyway.
---
Not even close. You need to do some research on the perk coin system. To max out all 6 slots requires a character with a level in the several thousand.
---
Basicly A grand exchange from runescape would change lives
---
Also in relation to what is heard it is always different but it does always sound like something just horribly altered ingame, like my go toos are usually placing some super mutant voices or even the radio sometimes. But idk if I'd go as far enough to say its out of game audio.
---
1800÷3.6 = 500, so like 600 MAX.
---
I meant ps4
---
Watch angry turtles legendary perks tested part 4
---
Looks like all those perks are garbage though
---
Hey now, have you considered donating those excess glass to the brotherhood of steel? Hey fight everyday to protect people in the wasteland and they could really use that extra glass to make wine bottles (to go with all that cork they recently received). 
---
So do your part, citizen, and donate your scrap. The brotherhood will be here soon....
---
oh boy yes, let me show my nudemod screenshots!
---
Thanks those are really great points. Very constructive. I think you have single-handedly solved this problem and all problems, keep up the good work!
---
I’d use either in a pinch.
---
If it is that would should I do to start to deal with it?
---
yup, just sell it to angry house wives who need to use it against their husbands...
---
Agreed.  Kinda disappointing that West Virginia's biggest real-life mystery is in the game, but there's no storyline to ring you in.   But it was the one that I found most fascinating.  Especially when my wife told me the other day that she found a documentary on TV about the Mothman.  She's like "hey, there's a show about your Mothman." (She doesn't play, she only knows what I tell her.)
---
I was really exited for "hack and slash" thinking it would be some sort of area effect cleave ability. But it's just another explosion effect like the other exploding perks, just triggered on vats melee. Might still pick it up but it no longer interests me as much. "Taking one for the team" and "what rads" are going to be a pretty much yes for me and maybe "retribution" after it is mathed out some more.
---
I hope to contract you in the near future, it would be a blessing.
---
Just follow the meta. Bloodied, Junkies, AA, Vampiric are all decent keeps, Instigating situationally so and the rest for the most part can go. Unyielding, Bolstering and Vanguards for armour with situationally Troubleshooters as well to help out with Encrypted and silo runs.
---
That should cover you for about 80%-90% of the keep pile. The rest are pretty much scrip on site, with some exceptions.
---
Wrong. Watch any video on YouTube about the perk coin system from players on the PTS. I would suggest Angry Turtle.
---
Event can despawn if not activated in time. I tried doing that once and server was like "okay, no ome shpwing up"
---
I just dumped another 2k at murmrgh’s, same thing. Ghoul slayers, troubleshooters, suppressors. Not a single piece that I would ever use. Not surprised though, during ‘sale’ it has always been worse than normal days, for obvious reasons. I have too much scrips on mules they can barely walk lol, that’s why I decided to dump scrips even though I knew it’s gonna be totally bad.
---
As a bloodied build, yes I couldn’t agree more. Walking around with low health but 700 DR is much better than walking around at full health with no armor. Berseker’s needs to give a bigger damage bonus than bloodied for this reason.
---
Also I have run the game over speakers and just blasted the whole damn household with this aids so its not these specific headphones.
---
This is a must!!!
---
WHY THE IS THE MOST INNOCENT ALLY IN THE GAME
---
It's like 600 now. They've lowed the cost and doubled the coins.
---
Also I'm level 385 and will be able to max 3 card. The only one I truly want to max is taking one for the team. I don't even know all the cards I'll pick yet since they're so lack luster
---
Make that alt your main then, that’s some amazing luck you’ve got there. Based on the ‘seed’ theory your alt probably has a very good seed and will keep getting certain prefixes.
---
She just dropped me an instigating swing speed deathclaw gauntlet and I am content.
---
Double the junk management wahoo oh yeah 160 pounds of 3 star junk that's for sure not legacy and 20 of it im keeping somehow darn it
---
This is part of why dupers are so popular
---
I've left ACP at least 5 times because some idiot is just spamming a Automatic Tesla on all the Wendigos and it just kills my frames. Worst part is when they're doing it and still not killing anything lol
---
System?
---
Oh God i hate it! The buggers and ash piles in the end too. But the worst, someone crashed ACP the other day, super slow and broken, that was a long and painful event, after that i said fucl&lt; it I'm not doing it anymore, what a waste
---
True. And why B2525 fixers are everywhere.
---
Yo dog I heard you like caps. Caps on how much caps you can have. Caps on how much you can sell. Caps on your scrips. Hell we even got caps on your notes dog.
---
Run a pc cleanup or something. I really don't know what could fuck up this bad. I'm sure you've already reinstalled but if you haven't you should definitely do that.
---
Xbox!
---
I use [FED76](https://fed76.info/pricing/?item=None&amp;effects=None) to check usually, I think its prices are a bit high but it's pretty good at telling you whether something is scrip or a keeper until you develop a feel for it. Always fun when it tells you something is priceless lol.
---
Bethesda already has current sale code done. They'd actually need to put in the effort to code in a sale for the other stuff, even if they wanted it.
---
You know what Bethesda is like when it comes to putting effort into work...
---
These reasons here. I like the idea in theory but I don't see Bethesda trying to solve these issues - they re far too much work
---
You haven't experienced a full auto Tesla rifle on a huge group of enemies then lmao It makes the game unplayable
---
A beefsquatch what?
---
So let's look at a 100 levels if you didn't open any packs or use any cards just as a base. 100 level ups= 200 coins. 25 per card packs 4 cards per pack, that's another 100 cards so another 200 coins.
---
That's 400 coins per 100 levels, or 100 coins per 25 levels. So by level 600 you'd have a solid 1800 coins.
---
Level 386 and I did the math the other day. I've got 944 coins coming my way even leaving a fair amount of cards to play with
---
Instigating too on high damage per shot weapons - super sledges, gauss rifles, lever actions, etc.
---
Damn, I've got a couple guitar sword plans, but PS4
---
Sorry m8
---
Best thing I got was a two shot xplosive +1agi short gatling gun. (For sale,xbox)
---
Can you give me a link? I just watched a video this week talking about lowering the amount down to 1,800 and giving 50 coins to level 50 players. I want Perception, Agility, Luck, Taking One for the Team, Follow Through &amp; Power Armor Reboot maxed out.
---
I have seen it empty alot in the past week or two.  It was empty 3 instances this afternoon and I got one from another. It sure seems like they changed the drop rate.
---
Her favorite thing to give me  seems to be harpoon guns, cannons, or  rolling pins, and usually for buffs its bashing damage or  something like reduced weight.  Ooohhhh thanks jackals!   I bet she gets shot a lot.
---
Xbox and ill buy it for 6k cus i feel the struggle and have the cards for it homes for anything slightly likable are easy to find on redit fr also a lil advise redit trading is amazing go get your junkies explosive gatplas for all that good scrip you have stored up and aint using
---
Either way, can anyone link the lore to why we have corpse plants in Appalachia?
---
Proclaim it to inflame it
---
Ditch All Rise - that weapon is a crock of shit. Scrip or keep it, I don’t care. But get literally *any* Bloodied two handed weapon. Run Ricochet for the enemies that like shooting at you. Run Blocker for the ones that prefer to smack you in the face. Dodgy is a must have. Serendipity does **NOT** work in power armor. Put Emergency Protocols on your PA chest piece.
---
Given hack and slash is a percentage chance trigger, you're much better off with a quick attacking weapon than a specific effect. 
---
Also Intigating is useless against any enemy hit with the explosion blast. It'd be counter-productive.
---
It's just math. They've changed it to give you 2 coins per perk. Lowered the cost down to 50, 100, 150, so 300 to max a card
---
I did the math for you in another comment
---
Mannequins and PA display confirmed and coming soon friend.
---
B-Bloodied 
---
E-Explosive 
---
FMSWA-Faster Movement Speed While Aiming
---
Also, spring bundle gives you trees for all 4 seasons
---
Thanks. Might be able to handle that.
---
Ive been wanting this forever. And I also wish we could have more photo saves than we do.
---
And dont forget your towel
---
 Sounds like you've been selling yourself short... You deserve nice things you're a good person and it's ok to reward yourself with the very best. You've earned it... after all you're the one who stopped the scorched plague.
---
LOL Fed76...
---
Saying that their prices are a bit high is being very kind to them :)
---
No the main game. Search simulation theory on here. I'm not saying it's 100% but it makes alot of sense from the Devs point of view.
---
I wasn’t sure where to start either, but have found the fed76 site useful to at least get me started on the resale path.
---
https://fed76.info/pricing
---
I’ve seen people comment that they think fed76 prices are high, but I’ve had pretty good luck using the high end of the range with some of the more valuable items, but the less valuable items have ended up being reduced to the quick sale price cause I’m constantly fighting a weight problem. I can carry 520 lbs after eating a ribeye steak, 550 with whiskey, and carry probably 50 or more weapons at a time and generally have 20 or more weapons for sale at a time.
---
You can exchange walls from different build kits? I thought it was just changing from walls, windows, or doors within the same kit?
---
Have you checked your Windows sound settings? The important one here is the audio/sound output device.
---
Check if it's set to the correct one. (Soundblaster/Realtek/Speakers/Headphone/Headset/whatever)
---
If there are multiple devices check each of them in game. Note that you need to restart the game everytime you select a diffrerent output device as changing it mid gaming mutes the whole thing.
---
Also, some codec packs can screw up some games. Not sure how or why but if you've got a bunch of codec packs installed try removing them.
---
It's also worth a shot to simply reinstall your audio drivers via the device manager.
---
I spent 2000 scrip on two characters and the only good weapon I got was a BE Combat shotgun. It bothers me because I’m mainly hoping for a BE heavy weapon but my luck is bad when it comes to which weapon the effect will be applied. Now I have a JE shotgun and a BE shotgun.
---
The issue is having the jetpack, as a torso mod, add a new mod slot for the paintjob of the jetpack. Having the paint job selected, then removing the jetpack for another torso mod, puts that paint job mod in limbo. It can cause problems after many repetitions.
---
Yep.  If I see that my defend mission is against radscorpions, I just let it roll to "Reclaim" and hope that they actually showed up.  And too often, they don't.
---
And every time I pull it out I get the: oh this a$$ hats got a tesla, hear we go and REALLY. i get i caused lag im sorry ok its all i got captain im sorry I bought the dumbest legacy it was 5k caps and it recks both FPS and NPC's like a boss
---
There's only one thing I have my eye on. I _neeeeeeeeeeed_ a better jetpack
---
The  unlimited thing you could build I think I miss the most, I wish they could make it bigger or chance some of the walue of some items, I like to display some of my items but it takes so much space so I really felt like I needed to reduce that. Also having crops... This one is just annoying. It takes to much space.
---
Wait you can get In the building that quick?!?!?
---
Try it with a wired headset.
---
I'm pretty happy with the black Captain Cosmos jetpack. It's a lot more unique looking than all the others.
---
I bought a legacy tesla 5k it destroys both NPC's and FPS I LOVE USING IT hate the lag
---
Funny thing is the damage output got silently nerfed right after release because you did like a billion damage then again that was because of a glitch so was it really a nerf? I don’t know all I know is that 1+2 = 3 and 3+2 =Disneyland
---
I bought my diffusers at a greatly inflated price from a vendor. It seems like a fair reward for people who do Project Paradise.
---
I just updated it again to add clarity.
---
I'm sorry but you will need to make a new character and play the item transfer game in order to get more bloom.
---
I had this happen and they were there for at least 20 minutes. I finally had 2 people show up at my camp and message me, so I fast traveled home, and kept hitting the guy with a baseball bat until i had pushed him out of the camp boundary. Amazingly, it worked. But then he got pissy, came back and killed me. 🤷‍♂️
---
I dont understand what you are complaining about : 
---
First, you can roll the gold bullion weapons with the discount if you are after Gauss shotgun or minigun. And doing so, still have some great alternatives such as Combat shotgun or Minigun/LMG/50cal...
---
Secondly, yes, with modules, you can roll a 1 star or 2 star, but you are guaranted to roll the item you want, meaning that youll need to spend less scrip to get the weapon of the type you want with the prefixes you want, in the long run.
---
So yes, IMO, its perfectly balanced to not discount the modules. And thats even without taking the armors into consideration. All you have to do is décide if you orefer to get a weapon of on type or one category, and.its perfectly fine that it costs less the wider the pool is.
---
I agree, I debated upgrading mine, but the one thats coming in the new season has me super excited. I dont want to spoil it for those who are shielding their eyes until Tuesday, but its super unique.
---
This is when I open up my inventory and see how many random grenades and mines I've randomly picked up. Perfect use for them to tag enemies
---
I have gotten a handmade from one once but other than Chinese officer swords that’s all you can get
---
I'm on ps4 and came across someone's camp that had a couple hundred of each ammo for free and some other stuff for free or cheap. I thought hey thats pretty cool, ive always left my lead extraxtor open in case someone needs some.
---
trade
---
Thanks, got it already, good to know I don't need to worry about farming that quest.
---
Ah, yes. An elegant weapon for a more civilized age.
---
#
---
Exactly what I was coming here to say haha. There are plenty of fantastic heavy weapons outside of the gauss mini
---
Splash the dmg off the ground instead of directly on the queen because she has Insane explosive resistances
---
I came back after weeks of not playing and the first thing I rolled was a VE minigun while on purveyors sale I was surprised as hell because I’ve never gotten anything good from mama
---
I have an instigating/swing speed super sledge and a junkies/swing speed/strength bone hammer on that character. With martial artist they swing pretty fast, and 30% or 40% chance at that character's level is high enough that I'm not worried about getting it to proc. I've been surrounded by a dozen wendigos in that event. If the damage of the explosion is a high percentage of the damage you're dealing then the instigating super sledge might be the way to go. I haven't run ACP with that character yet so I don't know if he can one-shot those wendigos.
---
In games with crowd control, the AOE abilities are usually balanced by having a lower damage per attack than single target abilities. I'm really hoping Hack and Slash does full damage and is balanced by having a 50% chance to occur, if not it's lame, just makes my instigating sledge not work on anything.
---
Also tse was nerfed a long time ago the "second shot" can only deal half damage so half those pellets hit markers are rong you may notice you shoot it 2/3s the health is gone then it jumps up to about half this is the game loading your nerfed damage after it already showed your damage numbers it was "to powerful" this litteraly changed the Metta to bloody when i started playing
---
Nope
---
I just want the daily ops and to hang with Vernon dodge
---
I watched it, he seemed to like that perk. The explosion killed multiple high level ghouls with one proc. The video was pretty devoid of hard numbers though so it didn't really answer any of my questions.
---
You can keep mutant armor and usenjunkie weapon, no anti synergy there, even tho vanguard would be the best
---
Do you realize that you could go allmost infinite ?
---
The Halloween event was so boring last year...I love Halloween and it sucked that the event they did just felt...slapped together.
---
No lie a shotgun build is viable for 1smaking anything I've done it
---
I just wish they’d make the scrip prices better. 5/15/30 would make more sense for weapons and you wouldn’t get screwed over because of their ridiculous cap. 
---
Imagine being able to scrap 5 3* legendary weapons instead of the shit systems that’s in place now.
---
I just mean you have a higher chance of getting something decent
---
I'm not sure that damage is calculated as being proportional to the weapon being used. That's not the sense that I got while watching Angry Turtle's video on Hack &amp; Slash.
---
You really should check out Angry Turtle's video and see for yourself.
---
I was collecting data for a friend. He doesn't seem to understand that power armor has a hidden damage reduction that normal armor doesn't, so I wanted hard data to prove it. I've only test the 2 types, but basically any full set of power armor provides more radiation protection than the best regular armor combined with max level What Rads. Since the number of legendary perk slots are so limited, that legendary card should equal or beat power armor.
---
This.  This is BASIC MATH PEOPLE. Do you need to go back to 3rd grade to learn division?
---
You know you can get one of those from the Main Storyline right?
---
Not with +1 Strength
---
Ooo, I'd love a ghoul hunter challenge to go with it. Maybe ghouls wearing some of the costumes already in the game with a chance of a legendary ghoul wearing a rare/new mask or costume that he drops as a reward?
---
Thats riiiight... in that case excellent roll
---
I thought this to until I server hopped and discovered it. Only one arm piece to go and I have a full set. Looking forward to rocking a full set.
---
Meh, I have blown 1900 scrip using 2 characters and I was not disappointed. I got 2 characters overloaded with heavy, useless weapons, which is exactly what I expected. Did you expect to get something useful? Lol!
---
Even just doubling it would be better.
---
If they could change the sell prices of 3* legendary weapons to 30 scrip as well would be a huge QoL change. I hate having to hold on to odd 2* weapons just so I can consistently hit the scrip limit.
---
There is some NPC dialogue that refers to The Pitt I believe.
---
If I remember correctly, demolition experts affects TSE weapons.
---
Only problem.. legendary bodies go flying.. kill and loot the legendary first then mash everyone else
---
Yeah I think someone/thing somewhere mentions the BOS crossed thru Pittsburgh to get to/from Appalachia, seeing as there’s already content for it in the universe (they could even reuse fallout 3 assets xd) i wouldn’t be surprised if we explore more PA shit later in the game
---
They need to leave some in the atomic shop full-time.  Like maybe the bundle with different colors.
---
Heck ya. I'm pretty excited!
---
Definitely not.  It was always an end game reward only.
---
I love how sure he is of himself as well haha. Do some research he says lol
---
bloody mess. tenderizer. demo expert is kind of a waste.
---
other than that, go bloodied. or maybe just switch your tse for a junkie's version.
---
You can still pass intelligence dialogue checks by SPECIAL boosts- i have 3 intelligence (-1 from marsupial so effectively 2) but my unyielding gear makes it so I still get the stat check bonus caps for Intel 8+ during the raider vacuum tube repair daily
---
Go to the menu section on the sub and the discord is there
---
Do some research, *tells ms to watch a video I already have that agrees with my stance.*  I mean, it's math.  1.8 perk cards per level.  3.6 coins per level.  1800÷3.6 = 500.
---
Let others settle for decent... I can tell that you're worthy of godly powers. Sure it's more of a grind. But killing a bunch of legendary creatures on your own terms is honestly the funnest grind in game atm.
---
Thanks, man.
---
There's probably one for data mining but I don't know it haha. I'm not so hip with the discord
---
I never rolled the tenderizer plans, so I'm looking forward to a 2nd shot at those.  I'm not looking forward to Prime meat events, though.  So many of those were a disappointment.
---
If you have already have a decent weapon or two for your build, I would roll 3\*. If you are newer, and struggling to find the weapon/build you want you might want to maximize your chances with 2\*'s.
---
I mean, I already have a BE15R gatling plasma so...
---
What do you think the Ally is?
---
No comment from him now that we've given him the math all laid out nice and simple lol
---
Hi Int is good for XP gain so it's good that it's high.
---
Aside from that though, your build is grossly inefficient.
---
ALL the endurance cards are dead weight. If you're doing your job properly, you never need the DR from Ironclad.
---
Likewise Strength is dead weight too.
---
Lone Wanderer isn't meta anymore because of public teams. You're better off leveraging bonus Int or Event XP from public teams and they often share cards that could be of use. You're better off shifting those perks to action boy/girl. Also added agility also means more action points for vats.
---
Sandman is too situational to be worth keeping.
---
You're much better off stripping all of the perks from endurance and strength, convert over from rifleman to commando and put all the spare specials and perks into luck to get solid perk cards like bloodied mess (flat 15% damage boost to ALL weapons), crit savvy (more crits), blocker (that's a better defensive perk than any that you have), fireproof (if SB sonic attacks bother you).
---
Your goal should be to be able to kill everything so fast that they barely have the chance to get a shot off at you. You could lean into this idea hard and go bloodied but with a lot of the above changes, you'll still do reasonably well.
---
Oh shit didn't know that thanks dude
---
Ok cool thanks
---
Not Junkie related, but I found the durability on my explosive pump action is very low to the point I don’t really rely on it, and I actually prefer non-explosive versions. 
---
So if it’s going to be a primary weapon then Weapon Artisan to over repair it and Gunsmith to slow down deterioration could be useful.
---
It is very effective while it lasts though !
---
Take Bloody Mess for a start, take gunsmith down to a 2 star card or so and swap in Demolition Expert 5 star.  Repairing your guns every now and then isn't the end of the world, especially if you swap in the perk to repair to 200% when you do the repairs.  Take hacker perks off and only swap them in when you are actually needing to hack something.  99.9% of the time you're actually playing the game, you won't be hacking anything, so those are wasted just sitting there in your perks all the time.    
---
Also, get rid of lone wanderer and swap in some team perks.  Always join a public team because there's literally no reason not to since they put in public teams.  On top of this, take strange in numbers and get the Herd Mentality mutation.  You're actively doing yourself a disservice by playing "solo".  Remember, you can still "play solo" even if you're actively in a team and reaping all the benefits of being in the team.
---
“holy shit wait until the end of september you are so fucking annoying”
---
So you’re saying that’s not getting worked up huh?
---
🙄🙄
---
Yes and there are separare discords for both. Goto the reddit discord and ask them for a link to the data mining one when you get there.
---
I know for a fact it did when I was running TSE, but that was winter of 2018. So I don’t know if they changed it or not.
---
But if they didn’t, your high Intelligence will help with it.
---
Yeah, the couple that lives in the cabin next to the front gate of Foundation. I think it’s Derek, Elsie, and Davie.
---
Wait for next meat weak for the meat hook. Graham sells it
---
Reallocate 6pts from intelligence to luck. All you need is gunsmith. You can swap the others out when you need them. Charisma only 3pts. Use tenderizer and travel agent/lone wanderer 2. If you got a maxed out backpack your strength could be a 2. 
---
So: S-2 P-15 E-6 C-3 I-5 A-7 L-14
---
Yes.
---
They didn't not my gun now does 167 damage it was at 150 but I could only afford to get three star demo expert
---
See your true power has already started to emerge. Embrace that power... let is wash over you. Seek out the tools to relinquish your foes.
---
We'll build a wall of legendary perks... and make ZachyChann013 pay for it!
---
Since you're using a TS weapon, equip a piece of armour that has the effect "reduce damage while blocking by 15%".
---
How high are you right now?
---
Ones you can edit, rather than build from scratch
---
Or you could just... kill them.  Take legendary special perks and get all the qol or max damage or duel class
---
[7]
---
I watched it, he tested it with a meathook and it was meh, then with a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet and it killed multiple high level ghouls in one shot, so the damage seems to be proportional. I haven't been able to make out any of the damage numbers on the AOE effected ghouls though so I have no idea what the percentage is.
---
I did find [this](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/005D29C0) on nukacrypt, it doesn't say anything in there about the damage or effect applied by the explosion, but it's got a big force and a respectable radius (about 12 feet.).
---
The way the new additive math works, coupled with tougher enemies, means that single shot sniper rifles can no longer do headshot kills reliably, even with a maximum damage build.
---
Commando was always better DPS, but Rifleman had efficiency and huge single shot capability going for it in the past.  Outside of stealth unarmed, it was the only build capable of killing a sheepsquatch with one hit.
---
Because slow, high damage weapons were benefitting most from multiplicative damage, they were hit the hardest.  With greatly reduced single shot damage and a slow rate of fire, Rifleman just isn’t viable for late game play anymore.  All single shot weapons, including bows and revolvers, just aren’t effective anymore.
---
Ofc.
---
7 ounces of marijuana, 7 lines of cocaine?  You have to be more specific.
---
I don't really ever block hell im never close enough to block attacks
---
Im newer, I dont know what everything does and I try and read everything. It takes me more than a minute to get through vendors. Especially when someone has 30 weapon/armor pieces up
---
Including yourself if its explosive
---
It’s ravioli
---
Don't waste your time looting those scorched. There's no crafting table nearby to scrap. Just forget it. Not worth 25 minutes.
---
Since your weapon fires multiple projectiles, it'll make your weapon "magic". You only need one piece of armour with that effect to make your weapon magic.
---
I now. I’m just saying that shotguns with explosive rounds might not be reliable as damage may not register.
---
Pee
---
The torso gives X2 as well, for x4
---
They're in the bottom of the stair section.
---
Using the blueprint trick (stack two high then blueprint) allows you to place them anywhere, meaning you can do some cool stuff with them.
---
What does that mean?
---
No, all PA gets free 42% damage reduction. Add emergency protocols and the DR difference is redundant.
---
The T65 is a honeypot. It's no better than the rest because npcs don't hit anywhere near hard enough.
---
I paid for a year and was notified that my subscription was no longer valid :\\
---
What I do, is I put everything I'm not using in my vendor, and every day that something doesn't sell, I use that for scrip. Right now, junkies, bloodied, anti armor are the big deals. Instigating and furious, depends on their weapon type. Smaller niche legendaries, like berserker and quad (I personally like quad). Don't underestimate the value of major and minor modifiers though. Faster fire rate/ swing speed or explosive are top tier, though vats crit and limb damage are quite good majors. 90% reduced weight and reduce AP cost are good minors, as well as +1 strength on melee weapons. Rare/ gimmicky items like Grognak axes and sheepsquatch weapons are valuable to some, but not if they have b.s. legendary effects. One more thing: if I go to your camp, and I see fed 76 anywhere, I'm not even gonna bother looking. I don't know where they get their prices, but it sure the hell ain't supply and demand.
---
For a YouTube vid probably
---
The Pitt ought to be an Appalachian version of the Glowing Sea, tbh.
---
This was literally the biggest selling point of the game.
---
The best youtube video on magic weapons is by angry turtle. Watch that, it'll explain a lot.
---
sure thing. GT: Narrator2511
---
He's a commando/slugger, full time power armor. The melee one-shots most things but I'd like to not have to click on each and every single enemy one at a time. It feels silly when I'm being mobbed by scorched at a fissure site, etc., compared to games that have proper AOE attacks. Up until now this game has been missing effective AOE, and there's finally a real use for it in ACP, this sounds like it could be effective.
---
Scale with owner in accordance to region.
---
My old 76 community did it all of the time to each other for hahas. Was a badge of honor to be nuked. We could leave before it dropped but we took it on the chin.
---
But as said, as much of a pain in the butt it is, leave the server when it happens. Don't give someone the satisfaction.
---
I expected at least 1... I know The Fixer plan yet didn't even see a shitty Fixer. Yet I got 3 M79s and 3 Missile Launchers.
---
Crack
---
"AA"?
---
Good for Vamp Shotguns or crippling
---
I just love how everyone loses their shit and *has to be Max level* immediately when something new drops. Seriously settle down.
---
Much appreciated response :D
---
My prices don’t seem to be too far off of yours, the only differences are that I price my lead and acid at 4 caps, and 5-6 caps for screws, depending on how often ACP is popping that session.
---
I’ve only been flipping scrap for about a week now, but I’ve definitely noticed that I can barely keep my lead, screws, and acid stocked. I’ve converted to a full on merchant play style and it’s been a welcomed breath of fresh air.
---
I got like two tse weapons, three fixers, a couple explosive weapons i don't mind my 1150 scrip buy honestly.
---
It was me and my gf playing, we were crafting. Neither of us noticed till the last second.
---
I got a new console the other day and I lost all my photos. So when I get some new cool shots this would be cool! Haha
---
It's because finally someone has the guts to make a good hoagie.
---
Wow much charitable great post to show how nice player  gib karma and award pls reddit
---
A Piss-basted crackoli hoagie.  I wonder if using Nukashine as an input during the piss production process would change the result.
---
Today I was at a camp that advertised fed 76, had a3 star bloodied handmade. Ok, let's have a look: +33% vats accuracy? Well, I'm already pretty accurate in vats, but okay. Third star: +50 damage resistance when aiming? Wait. If I'm in vats, I'm not aiming, and if I'm aiming I'm not in vats. These effects contradict each other. Essentially, it's a 2 star weapon. Further, it's 2 stars, I don't really need. The cost? 17k! No thanks.
---
Davie is a bitch. I can't stand that kid.
---
Literally, has the guts.  Which may imply a sausage-type ingredient?
---
I got a nocturnal pipe wrench
---
I’m not sure exactly how profitable selling underarmor would be, given the material spent to craft and mod them.
---
I’ve been sitting on 4-5 different underarmors at fire sale prices for a couple of days now as well.
---
I know that I scoop up cobalt and violet flux anytime someone is selling it for 200 caps or less though. I’m just too lazy to fire off a nuke and spend the time collecting that crafting mats to stabilize them. That and all of my time is dedicated to strip mining Appalachia of all it’s lead, copper, and screws 😂😂
---
Ooh yeah! I wish those were a little more high lighted. I had an instigating dragon once and the thing was a beast
---
InnaIglooEh
---
I love weapons like that i just use them just to use ammo and to make the game more interesting to me at least. If you don't want it I'll fimd something to trade.
---
When is this?
---
Man, best I can do is 10 caps, bet you feeling REAL dumb right now huh?
---
My husband and I build separately.
---
I think walking into a camp and seeing some idiot has put a swastika up on the wall would be grounds for nuking the spot immediately lol
---
&gt; hitting bloodied builds especially hard
---
Considering just how badly bloodied outclasses everything else, I'd say this is perfectly justified.
---
I don't think Bethesda expected players to deliberately stay at low health when they added gear and perks that boost your stats and damage at low health.
---
Personally I would have left the bloodied legendary effect alone, and instead attached some really *compelling* reasons to try and stay above 30% health, as well as change radiation so it reduces maximum health, rather than current health.
---
So I guess you’d say that Earle... *Screwed your prices*
---
Eh? Eh?
---
Ok. I’ll shut the door on my way out.
---
Yo that depends, nazis are abhorrent but there is some freaky porn out there. Somebody would probably end up mixing the two and you'd get some GOATSE photoshopped with a battleflag poking out or something.
---
I joined PC after playing PS4. It’s smoother but otherwise similar. Only difference is more cheaters on NW and more duping evident in vendors
---
Just be careful when doing this. I personally have placed my CAMP next to the wayward and placed some ammo, food, and aid items for free. 9/10 times it is a level 100+ that comes in and buys everything. It has started to make me angry and bitter to the point where I do not want to offer anything for free anymore.
---
Don't allow yourself to become bitter when some asshole comes and buys everything when they clearly do not need it. That is my advice to you.
---
I am really starting to hate human beings.
---
It’s a part of the game. Not a part I like tho. If you need materials and are on PS4 I’ll hook you up.
---
The nearest scrap bench is inside Fort Defiance itself. Head inside, round the corner into the elevator, and up to either level 3 or 4.
---
If I need the steel, that's what I do. If I need the caps however (all the combat rifles and shotguns sell for a decent amount), Big Bend Tunnel East is just a stone's throw away, and almost always has a vendor stationed there (unless somebody has just done Riding Shotgun, in which case they'll be at the other end of the tunnel).
---
FYI If you scrap your plants that need repair, you get one of the fruit/veg back and can replant it.
---
I am on ps4. But I am back up and running. Just pissed and venting lol.
---
Nothing wrong with goatse. Have some respect for the dead.
---
See, you learn something new everyday in this game..
---
A few things, still got a few days to pull
---
My best thing was a quad, vats crits, and reload speed fixer.
---
I get that, and thanks for the warning! I'll keep more of an eye out for people, but it hasn't happened to me yet. 
---
It's crappy, though, that it's happened to you. Why can't we help people without asshats ruining it?
---
I get jealous when I see these posts about couple gamers, my mrs won't play with me, well fallout. She likes racing and kids games lol.
---
Anyway on to the topic, I do know a couple who build their's together in the mire, East of that red rocket near Harpers Ferry. They chose that place as it didn't often get attacked. His Mrs was the trader for both of them, where as he was the farmer and ass kicker. I used to take them masses of junk, in return for aid items, Stims, chems, etc. They don't play anymore though... 😢 On that note I hope this helps.
---
Wow, well done. Best thing I got was a hunters lever rifle
---
Pretty sure it's in the next couple of days
---
Couldn’t find you on Xbox, add me @cozyxhugo
---
Maybe I’m in the minority, but I’m not buying anything. I already have my god tier guns on my five characters and all I need is SS god tier armour. So...........
---
haha  
---
you can do a lot worse, if he insist on attacking ... hes triggering pvp completely, that include his base
---
&gt;  I doubt is feasible
---
They literally did this for Skyrim during their game jam.
---
Double drops from plants in the specified zone, afaik.
---
Yeah completely understandable but at the same time when that nerf comes out everything's getting effected so we might have a new meta gun that everyone's after so its more like prepping for the apocalypse thats likely to come lol
---
It took a bit of convincing to get my gf to play. She loves bethesda games but HATED 76 until i showed her my camp. She’ll dabble in other activities but she’s primarily interested in the building aspect of the game. Maybe show your mrs more of that? 
---
Thanks for the info too! I’ll go scout it out
---
Because no matter what people will always bitch about the game. Too fast, too slow, caps on gold and bullion, too easy...blah blah blah. Bethesda could give everyone a legacy titanium tipped explosive quad barrel bloodied whatever and they would still bitch and moan. Some people are never happy and can’t think of actually just playing them game and getting what you get and making the beat of it. 🙄
---
Gt rammadeus. Going to work but will be online in 11 hours or so
---
Best I got by far was a b limb rw dcg
---
Gt rammadeus. Be on in 11 hours.
---
I miss actual towns and settlements with stories and actual people from Fallout 1, 2, 3 and NV, yes. 
---
Honestly, I don't miss anything from 4, 76 is a step up in virtually every area. The overarching story is better, the writing is better, it sticks to the lore of the originals a lot more faithfully, the world is more interesting, there's no obnoxious voiced protagonist, actual skill checks are back, it's actually somewhat of an RPG again where builds actually matter, newer gun designs make sense thematically, there's now two actual proper towns and likely more to come etc.
---
The only thing that 4 really done better than the prior four titles was graphics and gunplay, and 76 does both of those as well, if not better, than 4
---
It rarely happens (at least for what I've seen playing on the PS4), but some people do it for different reasons. Like if they feel your prices are too high, or if you're using a mic and it annoyed them, or if they decide they like your camping spot and want to have it. (That happened to me. Some guy came up to me and started to threaten to nuke my camp. Waited until he launched the nuke and left the server so he wasted his time/keycard.) It's part of the "fun" of being forced to share a space with people.
---
That's genius
---
Lol 😆. Spelling not my strongest skill if you could not tell. Curse you grammarly
---
Fucking love Halloween I can't wait
---
After scraping 150 I’m selling all legs to train vendor or give them low levels
---
My stash weight is max 650 always
---
I’m sure you are super sneaky in your power armour......
---
I have a TSE tesla. People get pissed at line in the sand but oh man it's good XP.
---
We build separately for fast travel reasons. 
---
There are a couple good spots near the crashed plane in the Mire.
---
It's not perfectly ideal for his build though, so everything is garbage. /s
---
Thats awesome. I have also noticed an increase in the amountof good fixers being given out lately these are just 2 i got last week off of events:

Happy hunting

Anti Armor.
---
That aint bad for going to town with earl
---
For me the nocturnal ones are the worst and they're always the ones you get
---
600 scrip and I got a bloodied Explosive plus one Agility lever action and the rest is trash.
---
Honestly? No, he was a pretty reasonable dude.
---
Dragon Quest Builders 2 let you do this and it was amazing.
---
However, on PC you can edit those screenshots. So it would be fairly easy to "share" illegal stuff on walls.
---
Hang tight, its been addressed on the PTS apparently.
---
Dont forget the stalkers melee weapons! Gotta love that 100% vats accuracy, it's so worth the extra AP! /s
---
Yeah. Nazi flags porn.
---
How about juicy holotapes?

Depends on your internet but maybe 7 hours max.
---
IFFR fixer. ISS deathclaw gauntlet.
---
I can give you 5 Medic's Laser Pistols in exchange
---
Maybe not because I've used them a few times and never knew what people were talking about till I was there when someone else used one.
---
What is AA?
---
Nice :)
---
It used to work in fo4 where berserkers was +100% dmg and two shot gave +100% dmg as well but then 76 comes and two shot stays the same(for a little bit) but berserkers was nerfed to 50% its a little rediculous that i have to run berserkers and bloodied at the same time to even hit the 200 dmg marker and even then im loosing out on 45% dmg with bloodied and even then nerd rage gives +40 dmg resist on a rank 3 card but you can only reduce that to +20 with addictions but yet still bloodied is carring the wrong build.
---
Man I got a stalker shovel once LOL I wish I could have picked it up and hit that miner right across the head with it!
---
I get it. Very crappy but these are all relics of a time when Bethesda thought PvP would be a thing in 76.
---
It's like the wild west compared to console, legendary rings, hats, clothes and power armour, minguns that fire nukes... enjoy :-)
---
Really? That would be good
---
It's a Bethesda game, the glitches are features by this point
---
In theory (because this is Bethesda after all) it wouldn't be hard to modify the system to save a copy of every image captured through the in-game camera system to their servers and only allow you to pick from them. Since the game servers are running on Bethesda's hardware they should be able to capture screenshots on their end completely bypassing client systems.
---
You might have to use one of those tire irons or baseball bats she might give you.
---
Nope! Bethesda have stealth nerfed the collectron because they made it free.
---
What also pissed me off is earlier that day I go to someones house and because the game loads so weird I got stuck inside some dudes locked room. Well I just unlocked it and of course that gave me a dumb 10 caps bounty and some dude later comes up and shoots me in the head while im cooking...Just wasnt my day...
---
5k scrip spent. 2 bloodied assaultron heads in a row. couple of heavies with 25% FFR. junkies bow. nothing i reckon worth more than 20k
---
wait until after tuesday
---
20 hours
---
Yup. Sadly that's very typical of Fed76.
---
I don’t think they can reuse assets. Wouldn’t they need to update the art style to match the current one to not make it look jarring?
---
there's a junk pile near some water in the mire. Most tranquil there. Then there's the waterfall in the mire. people build some interesting camps down the cliff face.
---
Awesome thanks for the advice. Also handy for finding my own perfect legendary!
---
Me 2. Rolling for 3* armour. Get nothing scrap the 6 pieces I roll for 150 and get 144 scrip back.
---
&gt; The photos would need to be uploaded to some server to be downloaded
---
All they would need to do is pass the camera settings used for capturing the image to the server and let the server create its own image to match yours, and then only allow you to pick from the images it has in its own collection.
---
Anti-armor.
---
That's insane, forgive my ignorance!
---
Makes sense if u ply together to build in seperate areas and if I both have  first put one tent at the purveyor and one somewhere away from the camps and purveyor. That way u have free travel points across the map if teamed up
---
Thanks for the advice. I wasn't even aware fed76 was a thing until I got replies. I just want to be helpful lol
---
Yeah, I guess "Oswald the Pretty Reasonable Dude" just isn't as marketable
---
Why couldn’t the sale include Legendary Modules too?
---
You had me with 
---
" I'm not your dad. Probably"🤣
---
K cool. I help the community not hurt it so if you need anything HMU
---
With the internet in my area 5-6 days without having to deal with data caps.
---
Still searching for my instigating lever action. I mean ANY legendary lever would be nice that this point. There's not a lot my sniper build achieves with my 23rd bone club
---
Bloodied will still be the damage king, it just won't be so massively superior when stacked with loads of buffs
---
Thanks for the tips. I do need the scrip but also want to be helpful. Hence trying to find what is of most use to others :)
---
If I am not mistaken the limit only applies for the console versions (and is actually a limit set by MS /Sony, not the game itself), on PC you can take/save as many as your hard drive can hold.
---
All I want is an explosive combat shotgun, and I'm not even sure the explosive will be as effective as I think it will be
---
Nothing you can do to prepare for the damage change. Everything is staying at the same rank its currently at, just with less space between
---
For legendary perks just think about which ones you want
---
People complain about the grind, but keep playing because of it.
---
We heard this about caps.
---
We heard this about scrip.
---
We heard this about bullion. 
---
Without the grind, people complain about "lack of endgame" and stop logging in.
---
Worst part is the best ingredient is not rewarded to the participant but everyone else in whole server instead. It’s the ingredient for super stimpaks
---
Especially in the entertainment industry
---
RNG is a cruel mistress.
---
Gun does extra damage due to a bug server side, basically game thinks you are doing more damage than you are
---
Just dont get the explosive perks theyre kinda bad
---
Don't get sucked in by the AA hype. It might creep closer to junkies in terms of performance but on average, the current meta remains largely the same in terms of legendary rankings.
---
I think I got about 2 from 4000 scrip.  I seemed to get a lot of broadsiders, which is horrible for my inventory weight.   RNG is a horrible mistress.
---
I’ve actually been going back to the LMG lately.  The DPS is excellent and it has no wind up.
---
sadly true but I pulled a two shit explosive lever action does 130 damage no perks
---
I run the ult gat laser a lot. Super ammo efficient and great damage. Have also just started using the 50cal again
---
Have jffr of all ballistic heavys as well as flamers and ult gats. So I like to mix it up. They are all great weapons though
---
A sledge is actually great because you can put a puncturing mod on it.  Anything that will ignore armor will help tremendously at end game.
---
It did end, they are having a one week cool down before season 2 launches
---
The limits in this game are a massive turnoff for me.
---
Yeah, I always keep coming back to the 50cal.  It looks great, feels great and does everything pretty well.
---
I think that section does refer to online *or* competitive games in general. Because it is the only place where the use of exploits is stated to be forbidden, so if it was specific to competitive modes only, then duping would be legal in adventure mode as long as it does not rely on third party software (which is banned in another paragraph). But secondary accounts are also deemed unacceptable specifically in the context of unsportsmanlike behavior, such as burner accounts used by dupers or hackers.
---
So is something replacing it then?
---
Thank you.
---
Yeah. Season 2. Armour ace
---
The legendary Run? Yeah the Armor Ace event starts sept. 15. New gameboard with new rewards
---
Dont hold me to it, it is Bethesda. There is every chance they will break it again or fuck something else up in the process.
---
100% yes!
---
Yeah a since every % is base weapon damage now, and bloodied is 80%... (at nerd rage health)
---
For example, an automatic handmade has a base damage of like 30 (give or take) a bloodied handmade will net you about 24 more damage than a work bench crafted handmade . 9 more than a junkies.
---
This is negligible when stacked with the other bonuses from cards adrenal reaction etc, 
---
The weapon meta is going to change. Probably to vampire weapons since they allow you to stay alive easier.
---
Unyielding will likely still be king, and running low health will stay. Maybe people will carry multiple weapons (one bloodied, one vampire or something) but it doesn't seem worth it since the bonus is so small.
---
One thing is for certain, you can expect the most gigantic whine-fest the forums and subreddit has ever seen. Get your popcorn ready.
---
Oh I won't believe it till I see it lol. But it's good to have a little hope
---
After finding the Tenderizer plan in a player vendor the other day, I spent 1000 scrip on 3 and 2-star Melee weapons to try and get a Legendary one but... nada.
---
This is disappointing.
---
I came across two instigating lever actions earlier to day at a player's camp, one of which was instigating/fire rate/aiming DR. They were both listed for 30k caps though, which I think either means "I am showing off" or "trade me your godrolls".
---
Nothing like a ice cold Nuka cola to wash down one of Sunny's famous hoagie's.
---
Seriously I'm fecking now and I'm imagining a post nuclear war commercial at the foundation about drinking a good old fashioned Nuka cola after eating a famous footlong from Sunny's.
---
cool, thanks for the update i was beginning to wonder, i like the legendary run but have only just got past chapter one so felt a little seen off to be honest, but if something is coming to replace it that's encouraging news.
---
Yeah, I stopped playing before I finished it up and had to spend a couple atoms to catch all the rewards the day before it ended. Sounds like they are making it a bit easier this season. Which will be nice. But as long as you play pretty regularly and take advantage of the double SCORE weekends you should be able to finish the next season no problem! Good luck buddy!
---
Yes, Halloween stuff near the beginning of the month would mean more people have the chance to get the Halloween stuff from the atom shop and therefore make Bethesda more money, I don’t see why not
---
Honestly, I've never changed my BoS Collectron from whatever it defaults to after I first placed it. Didn't know it could be changed! But I'm getting everything all at once, ballistic, super stims, ammo etc
---
Yeah but they addressed that unarmed weapons accidentally got an extra nerf so it shouldn't be as bad as it is in the pts.
---
dont know what you all argue about, im very happy with my Z2525 db shotty!  
---
not....cunt.
---
I find it funny when people complain about not being allowed to one shot bosses
---
I live in Philadelphia and I think it'd be a prime location for a future Fallout game...especially considering not just the history here but the fact that Bethesda seems to love the eastern US.
---
However...isn't it stated in Fallout lore that Philly took a direct hit from a nuke and was completely annihilated?
---
It's spelled scrip
---
Hack and Slash is a very good perk. Not really an explosive but area damage.
---
Don't forget about Project Beanstalk too lol
---
My faith has been restored spent 700 last night and got absolutely fuck all decent it's now just sitting in my storage waiting to be scripted again 🙄
---
Yup..got this at Mamma's last night when I was scripting some of the crap I got..at around the 20 second mark a player started with explosive rounds and Nade's..I just carried on..I had no junk on me so WTF ..just let him burn up his ammo until I was finished...asshat!
---
Are you a Vats user, you use it let's say 80% in your whole game time?
---
You forgot to take your armour off, that's now in your boots :-)
---
She still had the last laugh :-)
---
You don't need to wait for the event he sells it anyway you just have to find him walking around in game. 
---
I found him when I was headed to the line in the sand event yesterday.
---
I haven't done the event cause the robots scare me. Overpowered bitches, but, after taking Earle on twice and winning, I think I can do it
---
Fallout 76 absolutely HATES bluetooth headsets. Unfortunatly I dont believe there is anything that can be done to help you. This is one of those things that has always been there and no amount of complaining has ever resulted in Beth even talking about many of these things let alone committing to a fix.  
---
The only way to solve this issue is to use it in a wired configuration. It sucks, but you either learn to work around Fallout 76's bugs or you live with them.
---
Just a little heads up - don't buy (and learn) plans from other players unless you know already all plans 'below'.
---
The order they drop from forgotten knowledge is:
---
Knight - Knight Sergeant - Knight Captain - Officer - Paladin - Elder
---
That ones fine im talking like far flung fireworks
---
VATs user when commando, non VATs when Heavy
---
Ha that would be some awesome fan created content
---
When do you obtain a bloodied sledge in the main questline?
---
Or are you referring to all rise?
---
Nice, then you might add to your uny pieces something with AP refresh, it will make the whole difference in the world, and in luck I am.using 1 four leaf clover as well
---
Take out strong back and use bandolier. Remove extra strength
---
Only useful endurance perks are Rejuvenated, Radicool, and Revenant. You’d only need maximum 3-4 points in END. (Swap out radicool for revenant in boss fights)
---
Take out lone wanderer and travel agent, join public team. Get strange in numbers and tenderizer. Get mutations
---
Take out mister sandman and use Sneak. Move points into AGI if you plan to keep mister sandman (Action boy/girl is more useful).
---
Use the points removed from above and invest in luck, get bloodied mess and class freak. Any extras add better criticals and critical savy.
---
Sneak rifleman/commando sync very well with bloodied+unyielding build. 
---
Only use rifles that has silencer. 
---
Sniper rifle, level action, handmade and Fixer are best for rifleman. (Ranked least to best)
---
Assault rifle, handmade and Fixer are best for commando. (Least to best)
---
I just ignore it, and 60% of events.
---
Almost every build you make in there will work for this strat that I use:  
---
Just go in order when levelling. If more than one card shows up on a line, then just get the first one for that level and then the second, third, or more when moving on to the next level. By the time you get to the end you should be 99% set up properly. Then its just 3-4 levels to fix whatever didnt line up.
---
I got 3 broadsiders. In. A. Row. I got 5 in total.  Fml
---
It doesn't trigger pvp, no traps do
---
Actually they may have made it so rad emitters don't even hurt other players, but I don't know for certain
---
I have a full set of Uny AP refresh but non with SS for now ;) Four leaf clover will be my choice when I play shotgun
---
Submachine gun is useless. I’d argue a non-sneak 10mm submachine gun is more powerful than that.
---
No worries mate, happy to help. I'll try again haha. Yeh that place is just east of the red rocket I mentioned, its near the river, anywhere along that really. I've found the mire pretty good for camps as there are less chances of attack in quite a few places. Plus it's my favorite region, followed by the bog. Right at the bottom of the Cranberry Bog is my second favorite place as there you don't get attacked much either. Anyway, have a good weekend mate and more importantly have fun! 👍
---
As the other two pointed out pc is just more fun
---
Nice one, g l man, cool built, I will add legendary endurance though for that chem perk, it is useful in solo sbq or earl
---
Everything scales to the player.  Doesn't matter if it's a workshop or anything else.
---
Some regions have minimums and maximum levels though.
---
So that lvl 10 in the bog might get lvl 25 enemies.  A nearby lvl 100 will perceive those exact enemies as lvl 100 emenies.
---
A lvl 400 in the forest might get a lvl 50.  a lvl 10 in that same area will perceive those exact enemies as lvl 10.
---
Not enough legendary slot sadly, and follow through/taking one for the team too OP for not taking them (in regards of the nerf, these perks still multiplicative). I hope Beth add slots in the future
---
All of the projection lamps are like this, sometimes they work, sometimes they dont.
---
Do the vendors work yet?
---
Did you found if: taking one for the team will work like this: create a public team on my pvt server with only myself and the random hits I am receiving from enemies while on sneak will activate it? Because if it is working like this I am inclined to take it, I am.more solo player though
---
I have both and my laser rifle is with me at all times and for the queen and Earle there are better choices
---
Yeah vendors work
---
No, no. I mean porn worse than dick pics. I'm not saying porn is worse than Nazis.
---
Also: nice pun (get a grip).
---
I always wished there was ways for others to visit my settlements on fo4
---
I looked through all the season rewards and there aren’t any power armor stands.
---
You aren't doing it solo are you
---
At least most of the time
---
Came here to say this. I got one from the ski lodge (Sunny Pines or whatever) yesterday, then saw the empty machine at the Pick shortly after. I always go for pie when Murmghmmem disappoints. I go for pie a lot.
---
That would be good for the players and allow people to get the full value of the sale...  Can't have that
---
Honestly they should’ve held the game for like another year before releasing it to fix all the bugs and glitches.
---
Post on xbox lfg page. You'll get plenty of help
---
Pipe weapons are the bane of my existence. I feel as though every time she gives me a pipe weapon she doesnt put it in my inventory but instead places it firmly in my ass
---
Wastelanders "The Elusive Crane" gotta choose it from the dispensers
---
I'm looking forward to the Fallout 2 style bunker, the new handmade skin and the commie gear
---
Who on earth downvotes this comment lol
---
No i’m not, i just did it and has 4 players over lvl 100
---
You get a warning a nukes been launched. Check. If your camp is in the circle. Log out and switch servers
---
Lol.  Not holding my breath on that one.
---
Tends to be a server issue with most bugs, before tying anything else I load into a new server and try It then.
---
Ah.
---
You do know those are randomizes legendary weapons of the specified type, right?
---
If that happens usually you can fast travel to the same camp for free and u get spawned in a slightly different spot. I’m forever spawning in under the floor or stuck in a wall.
---
I honestly have no idea how it plays out because I had completed the main quest close to a year before wastelanders.  Its going to tell you when you need to do those things though for sure.
---
Doesn't work solo in public team. But everyone benefit of the damage increase cause it is a debuff on the mob. And it stacks with follow through in a strange way : one stealth commando with follow through and one tank guy with taking one for the team give for everyone +150% damage ! Totally OP. Look at the video of Angry Turtle who had tested them
---
I did, my decontamination shower is still gone
---
Do you have energy resist foods? 
---
Troubleshooters gear? 
---
A decent damage weapon?
---
I did, my stuff is still gone
---
While I would never attack anyone over this, it drives me insane when someone takes 5min to decide whether to buy the 1* nocturnal rolling pin and two dozen witch hats
---
Bloodied never did that gliched (magic) weapons did that
---
Here is the link to the datamining Discord:

Here: https://discord.gg/8GNHxpC
---
150 % for max rank in both perks. Not 40 % + 40 %, weird but that's cool
---
They already double the point values. This is the system we’re getting.
---
No doubt it has been scrapped, I mean the next time you come across a problem with it try reloading. 
---
I dont think you get any flux back from scrapping it though. If you are on ps4 and need materials I can donate the flux.
---
Nice one, cheers.
---
I got 4 shovels; Hunter, Zealot's, Mutant's. Then one hour or so later I got perfect roll from SBQ BSS 90.
---
Nice one.  I still don’t have the plan, so won’t get that as a purveyor drop.
---
Yeah.. no they arnt
---
2handed always gives out a bloodied swing speed sledge
---
Yeah i do, not trouble shooters gear nor food but i have a vampire rifle which helps
---
Nah, I play on Xbox, thanks for the offer though
---
You weren't informed of the latest "emergency bowel evacuation protocols" built into the Secret Service armor?
---
Anyone willing to give me stable flux, I’ll pay 125 caps per piece on Xbox

Nice. LMG is a terrific roll.
---
See you in the blast zone, everyday. Fluorescent flux is your new forever grind :)
---
I have traded so many good weapons for flux just to keep my greedy monster LMG fed.
---
Are you on the market place? If so flux can be purchased on there for 150-200 caps each. You'll probably find someone who will give you them for free.
---
So are you having problems with the towers, the robots or the boss itself?
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah but I’m new to redit so I can’t figure out how to post on it
---
Haha all
---
I'll send you the format you need to post it in a private message.
---
Buff the damage effect range similar to Bloodied, and make Weightless armor count as unarmored for Berserker calculations too. Makes both Berserker and Weightless more useful, and gives people some more synergy effects to strive for.
---
Cool thanks
---
Yes, but If you choose to fire all at once your arm will have a 50% chance to get crippled;)
---
May I recommend one do oil and one do acid? You may end up thanking me if you sell fuel :)
---
Honestly ESO support is really good. Never had a problem with it. 76 just seems like a shit show all around, huh
---
Had a sound problem discussion not so [long ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i9qkq1/audio_not_working_could_someone_please_help/g1l2df1/), the guy solved the problem in the end by moving the sound folders out of FO76 data and let the game regenerate them by verifiying integrity. Although he had problems with voices only it is maybe worth a try in your case too.
---
I'd prefer a mail items to my mules feature. And if this gets implemented, I hope we get a sign that reads "insert opinion here" with an arrow that I can point towards my bear-proof trashcan. :P
---
I'm visually impared and sometimes need a couple of minutes, to browse goodies/make sure I sell the right things. Not everyone who is slow is afk, I'm usualy in the middle of just trying to make sure I don't scrip my best gear when i get smacked around like it's the only station in the waste.
---
in the same grind bud. Been actively chasing it since April.
---
I just got and learn't knight captain 2 days ago. I do at least 4 technical data hand ins a play session. Finding technical data to hand in is not an issue anymore.
---
Well the general plan is that three players each take a tower to lower the boss shields, while everyone else provides cover fire
---
When the boss drops it's shields you'll have a small amount of time to inflict damage, afterwards you rinse and repeat 
---
The towers and most of the enemy attacks do energy damage so that's why energy resist foods are so useful
---
What's a far flung firework?
---
I was thinking this before. With all the glitches that happen I have some great pictures I need to hang
---
Hitting bloodied especially hard? Except those bloodied are still the best. The only exception is maybe fighting Earl, in this case AA works better.
---
Did you join the PTS? Anytime I switch from steam to the Bethesda launcher it’ll unselect my emotes and tent skins.
---
I’ll bet you a box of ammo that the ITV will be a reminder about p22 going live on Tuesday, season 2 and the Purveyor sale.  Nothing new.  The following week might announce that the PTS opens for p23.
---
"TSE"?
---
I would personally be a bit happier if the machine at least had 160 scrip in it, so I could just sell four 3-stars, instead of having to look for other legendary items just to get that remaining 30 scrip.
---
Or, at the very least, I'd like to be able to sell a 3-star and get those remaining 30 scrip instead of the 40.
---
It would also be nice if the items had a more logical scrip value setup. I know that you can get 15, 30 and so on by combining a bunch of armor pieces, but I feel like it could be a bit better. Something like 40, 20, 10 for weapons, and maybe like 30 15 5 for armors (with the purchase values at the vendor adjusted accordingly if need be.) The 3 9 24 -system is annoying.
---
I got anti armor plasma gun with damage increase while aiming and +1 P. Turned it into flamer, going to be epic robot slapper 😹
---
I think you meant a complaint to Murmrgh*. We have all been there but technically you got unlucky at half the price.
---
Venturing a guess, I’ll say it’s a random nuke zone with a randomized 3 star boss.  Some sort of tougher deathclaw, mirelurk queen, etc.
---
I’m probably completely off base and it’ll be a pumpkin tossing contest at the Pumpkin House with modified Fat Men.
---
What was that sonny? Speak up! All you kids go around mumblin' these days...
---
I'm on PC, so I can't directly help you, but;
---
\- There are three areas. You can fill up to 75 units of food in each one. 
---
\- The game then spawns a friendly creature for each environment. For each 25 unit of food in the respective environment, the level and threat of the friendly creature increases.
---
\- You then need to defend each creature from each wave, and the Legendary end creature. 
---
So all in all, you need a huge commitment over three areas (necessitating three informal groups of players) to get a chance at the maximum reward. Most players simply go for one area, sometimes two. I don't think I've ever seen all three creatures survive, let alone all at max contribution.
---
And I still can't get my hands on one. 😢
---
I quit around that time, actually. The game was a piece of shit, but at least the enemies werent bullet sponges.
---
Never reloaded the game since, browsing through this sub and I dont regret it.
---
I'm up to 3 perfectly preserved pies so far, everytime I brag about it to my friend whose been playing since release and doesn't have even 1 yet he just shrugs it off like it doesn't matter. 
---
He'll rue the day!
---
This reminds me of that Fairy Odd Parents episode where they all had those pumpkin transformer costumes
---
Basically my Fallout 1st Subscription is gone. Renewal is not until the 14th of the month(possibly 13th). PlayStation wallet is fine to cover the next month when renewal strikes.
---
The game is okay to play, but when select the Atomic Shop from the main menu, there is no store options, just the animated background and music.
---
I can find no mention of any problem on the official Twitter or on the operational game page on the official Bethesda site. The game status is 'operational'.
---
So for now I'm locked out of my server option and have no Survival Tent or Scrapbox that I can fill. I would think this all relates to there being no loading of the Atomic Shop within my game. I've tried all the usual turn off, power out stuff.
---
Can any Bethesda employees who post on this sub-reddit help please ?
---
Were you getting atoms added to your account? This has happened to people who reported to beth that they were recieving atoms to their account, doubling  over and over, beth wiped their atoms and removed access to fo1st, the atom shop and the legendary run board.
---
God damnit this fucker is deaf, I SAID THAT THE SETTLER WANDER ID THE MOST INNOCENT ALLY GRAMPs
---
Here have a reward for an excellent suggestion
---
Personally LOVE TSE shotguns.
---
We 2 man Earle, shotguns only. I use TSE combat, buddy with TSE Pump.

Aligned long barrel so 72 range. Ultracite ammo. If not in PA, just armor mod yourself for explosion damage, so you take none. Besides damage cards, run full skeet shooter in perception, and crit cards in Luck. You can actually see Crits chip away boss health. Get Earle near death. Last 10 minutes of ACP we leave Earle alone to farm wendigos. Kill him with a minute or 2 to go.
---
If tired of weapon will make you a good offer on gun. Player in our regular group is keen to get one.
---
Seems like Miss RNG is more likely to give you somethig you don't need at all sometimes \^\^  
---
I only wanted Rifles / Shotguns and got none ..but 3 MGs in a row and some Missile Launchers.
---
If you can get 12k for an AA/E/25 pipe pistol, congratulations.
---
If that’s true, that’s news to me. I’ve played through that mission four times, but I did always chose different machines.
---
I mean, I'm fine with that, I've got stimpaks to spare.
---
Greenhouse building set!!!
---
Dont even got a clue how I'll integrate that into my camp but still want it.  XD
---
Maybe builds glass labyrinth at he airport.
---
Normally the driver recognizes the games by itself.  It doesn't happen with fo76 ... You did well.
---
You are welcome!
---
commando fires faster and therefor kills faster. unless you want to play it as rifleman, why not, you should put a automatic reciever, aligned long barrel, forceful stock and swift magazine for lowest vast cost.  
---
useful perks are all 3 commando rank 3, tank killer rank 3 and concentrated fire rank 3 (=15 per).  
---
bloody mess 3 from luck is always nice. also, id suggest to keep 5 str points for bandolier 2 and blocker 3. agility depends on your other equip. if you have 5 armor pieces with higher ap restore you dont need action boy on 3 otherwise you should take it. if you plan to go for sneak build, add sneak 3 and covert operative 3. also, have adrenaline on 1 at least. i like gun fu very much, rank 1 is enough here. and every vats user should use grim reapers sprint 3 from luck in my opinion. rest depends if you go bloody or full health and your choice of quality of life perks.

No this is KAREN. I only complain to MANAGEMENT!

So we won't talk about ward? Ok then

I agree, at level 50+ I want to be rewarded
---
No, my Atoms have been the same since I got this month's sub Atoms last renewal(I currently have 2130). Last purchase was the Commie Safe. Nothing was added, bar 40 from one in-game challenge I completed just before buying the safe. 
---
Access to The Legendary Run is still there, but I had already completed it a few weeks ago. Strangely, The Shop was also showing the 'free' item icon on the main menu, even though I got the BoS Bot, emote and workbench skin already.
---
Build ur camp ( or fallout first tent) at a random assault spawn, usually at least 1 sheepsquatch there during a day with heavy travel, and their fur is ballistic fiber.
---
That or upgrade to a full secret service set and never bother with ballistic fibers again.
---
Sale is meaningless... to you, not to a lot of other players.
---
Need the black and red wallpapers!
---
I think I have never seen a comment from you regarding this bug.  u/Valseek u/Ladydevann can you update us?
---
Most of the rendering takes place on the client side, if not all, so they'd still need to upload something.  Could it be verified as legitimate? On PS4, sure, on PC, nah there's too many very clever and mischievous players on PC.  Still if there's a way to get Atoms from you I'm sure Beth will find a way :)
---
No no we need more ceilings.  Floors have gotten it good.
---
That one at least gives 3 buffout on completion. Those can be sold or turned into psychobuff or buff tats, both of which are relatively useful chems.
---
The seeds have two uses (and not the stamen you’re don’t get rewarded if you do it):
---
Juice (+ 10 max ap), which is relatively useless for the tedium of acquiring the seeds.
---
Tick Blood Tequila Margarita - turn one vintage tequila into 3 in exchange for losing the hunger gain on melee hit effect. The vintage drink itself requires pure crimson flux or Biv rewarding it to obtain. While it basically is the vampire effect in drink form, it isn’t worth the cost when that flux has other and better uses.
---
AND WHOEVER IS DOWNVOTING ME, IM GOING TO MANAGEMENT AND GETTING MY UPVOTE OR WHATEVER ITS CALLED BACK!
---
any military /BOS places. so fort defiance, forward stations, the miltary camps etc
---
Hmm, best thing then is submit a ticket and hope they can help you.
---
I have the bundle its just the large power armor station I'm afraid
---
Servers don't render graphics
---
They dont stick to the walls so well tho.
---
Bloody mess lvl3 is a must in every build
---
Ma'am, this is a Wendy's.
---
Agree, I basically just go there nowadays to pick flowers for Formula P,  ant meat &amp; some xp...love taking out the sentry bot ✌️
---
I get that, my point isn't removing it for other players, my point is how hard can it possibly be to half the price of Legendary Modules too so the sale is relevant to all of us.
---
Something seems wrong with FO1st on xbox.  The atomic shop and legendary run has the loading circle, and the private world is locked.  Haven't tried public world.  Restarting xbox snd trying again.  
---
Edit:  the long reatart of xbox fixed the issue, then game crashed as private world was loading.  Loaded game again and private world is still working.  Game loaded, and I am in the private world.
---
Not really... Actually, when I go back to 4 I miss being able to build camps pretty much anywhere. (I know there’s a mod for that, should get it...) I want to build my own little hideouts, and maybe a bigger settlement or two, but in the future I’d rather see more established towns instead of places I have to build and populate with generic NPCs.
---
It's Chase and the Paw Patrol.
---
Not to mention that gauss shotgun and gauss minigun arent the best alternatives in their respective catégory.
---
Combat shotgun is far better than gauss because of range bug and gauss not working in VATS (meaning magic is useless) and do crappy damage if not charged since the fix.
---
And as an heavy gun, gauss shotgun isnt better than many many alternatives, magic or not.
---
Sure but, there aren't alternate fire modes in FO76.   Otherwise yeah that would be great.  Also like an old-time brass tube telescopic sight for the dragon.
---
During these purveyor sale events they should remove the arbitrary scrip limit. Now *that* would be an event.
---
I’m constantly at the dumb caps that I couldn’t even claim the cap or scrip rewards from the legendary run.
---
Bloodied faster swing speed cultists dagger feels best with my characters brown nurses outfit and plague doctor mask.
---
Goes great with my Silent Hill camp. Not nearly as much damage as the bloodied Death Claw Gauntlet no, but man with the mele swing perks it usually gets in like 3 hits at the speed of one.
---
Man I don't know a single person that would even bother taking those haha
---
I think I might have one, but I won't be able to check for a few hours. 
---
RemindMe! 6 hours
---
WELL I WANT EXTRA SPRINKLES FOR FREE FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS ON MY TOXIC GOO AND MY UPVOTE BACK OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT AS COMPENSATION!
---
It’s a great weapon for backup and if you ever decide to create Pistol build character believe me this gun will come very handy. Uses almost 0 ap on vats shots and disintegrates almost everything. It’s definitely worth 12k. Ps. I have pistol build character and as a backup weapon i use Suppressors Explosive with Vats crit fill pipe pistol. Savage weapon.
---
Nah, I'm on xbox.
---
Thanks for the reply folks, but it seems at the second time of powering down and power out on the console, my access is all back on.
---
A strange one indeed as I simply had no Atomic Shop at all and it must have stopped my 1st  subscription engaging. I've never experienced this before. Had tried logging in and out with all three characters, shutting the game down and the above but one more power cycle has done it.
---
Awesome thanks, I saw someone somewhere suggesting the B2515 is better suited to commando rather than rifleman? I couldn't find the thread again though sadly
---
Yeah, that thing should be magic. I rolled a vampire gatling laser as well. But with bashing dmg.
---
Well being that it is on sale you are only out 10 script since you can get 40 of the 50 back that you spent.
---
50??  I have 1,468 photos, 14.8GB
---
I will take your word as I am not interested in the gun that you can get for bullion and I personally use melee weapons. LoL
---
There are servers out there with dedicated graphics hardware for the purpose of running graphics intensive VMs. Just as an example search for Microsoft Azure Windows Virtual Desktop. It's completely possible to configure a cloud system for nearly any purpose you want including gaming if you really wanted to. It's part of why Stadia is able to exist.
---
Halloween it's still the time the bomb dropped so it would be also a memorial period.
---
Hi there. That's exactly what I experienced when I logged on an hour ago.
---
Public was fine, so could at least play. Not ideal though when your plan for the day was to boost the Scrapbox materials on your low-level characters... 🤔
---
Like I just posted, a second power off and power out(ten seconds), actually solved it all. The old Help Desk to the rescue...😄
---
It’s not winter everywhere on the planet and they do have the second run ready, and I for one am happy to get a weeks break from the grind.
---
Your thoughts make sense to me.     
---
I'm running a hybrid who can do heavy weapons, commando and power fist.   I can do both sneak and power armor.  It's just how I enjoy playing; I need to change things up occasionally more than I need to have the most powerful build I can make.   I'll be taking Ammo Factory, Funky Duds, Sizzling Style and Follow Through.  For the other two, probably the Agility and Intelligence SPECIAL perks because there are so many more cards in those categories I'd like to equip but currently can't.  
---
I'm getting Ammo Factory to help supply primed weapons.
---
Had similar issue few days ago on PC and I have annual subscription.
---
Game restart solved that for me as it does to many other unannounced features of the game.
---
Gratz (?)
---
Been happening on Xbone too. Just close out of the game completely and restart your console. Should be good to go after that.
---
No I won’t grind like you have. I bought the plans from another player vendor who had the plans. Thank god there’s people out there that are real mvps
---
Man just wanted his last badge :(
---
It's 50% of the time, even if it's sunny outside. The game has half day of night bonus. Ladydevann clarified it when Wastelanders came out.
---
I think maybe you didn't read my comment very thoroughly. I don't one shot enemies. I couldn't if I wanted to for most of them, because I play a full health rifle build. You also don't seem to get what an analogy is. I'm not saying anyone is demanding I play with pipe pistols, just that people wan't the play this game their own way.
---
But sure, go ahead and be angry. I'm sure your angry comments will convince everyone to play as virtuous and generous people. In the mean time I'm going to continue focusing on the positives about this game as I think I'll be happier for it.
---
Have a good day.
---
Today I decided vantage was a good camp local. I decided I would see how far I could build over the cliff. I managed to make a pretty large platform that is dangling over cliff. This leads to many players spawning into the cliff side or to fall to their deaths or be crippled. Recently I had 3 players one of which was my friend standing on the platform and in fallout 76 fashion I froze, crashed and my camp vanished. Lets just say thr laughs from my friends mic were priceless as all of them plummeted to their demise simultaneously.
---
Cheers for replying. An actual 'power out' did it.
---
Nothing prevents them from running their own copies of the client. In fact they did just that back when it was in beta as could be seen by the devs running around in the environment with the players.
---
No worries mate.
---
My first discount weapon yesterday was a 2 shot, explosive LMG. Thats probably the best thing I've had off of her in 181 levels.
---
Because I would just stock up more Legendary Modules in my stash xDDDD
---
Weird stuff. But then it wouldn't be Fallout, or Bethesda if we didn't have the odd, unseen glitches.
---
My first experience with the Shop disappearing, at least it's solved now.
---
Hopefully the thread highlights an issue and helps one or two others today.
---
🎶Have you seen the accident outsiiide 🎶 seven people took a ride 🎶 six bachelors and their bride 🎶.  lol sorry I am channeling Jim Morrison by saying, we all have been screwed once or twice.

I never ever would consider berserker anything hardly worth the carry weight for scrips.
---
I can confirm they are all english players.
---
Not to  mention that he is complaining about that during a sale, but like 90+% of the time, you roll of a bigger pool at the same cost as buying modules.
---
I dont even see why to complain... If you want a Gauss shotgun or minigun, just buy modules everyday
---
Real MVP
---
Unfortunately we at ACCC cannot handle this return, you will need to take it up with rngesus, he’s located at the end of the Bethesda corruptions corridor on the left, thank you.
---
There was a brahmin in your yard. Took care of her for you.
---
Weightless armor should work for berserkers too!
---
Nope, you can't have more scrip. Will unbalance our mobile game.
---
You get a 2 minute warning. Why not just log out or switch servers?
---
Yeah I always pick the AFK option. You not gonna use this vendor. Ever.
---
Just got one today. Its a nice gun!
---
Yeah I actually had to hang up my Tesla rifle after finally seeing the damage it does one violent nights area became a pixelated mess by the jukebox
---
Look at the vids of Andry Turtle : he says that Max HP boost is better than better resistance. But the problemwith Max HP food for me is when the buff disappear it's often insta-death for bloodied build
---
i made a bloodied build with 12 endurance and generally speaking, i like to use somewhat high endurance, the reason you dont see it all that often is that a lot of bloodied builds are stealth builds as well so they focus on not getting hit anyways.
---
if you want to do a bloodied tank build the extra healthpool can be beneficial but you sacrifice perk points.
---
Endurance doesnt have a lot of great perks so you miss out on some good stuff for the benefit of a few more HP
---
long story short for most players the sacrifice of high endurance over other stats outweighs the benefits
---
that beeing said, you can do it and it does give you some benefit
---
looking at your build for example, adding in richochet, dodgy and maxing out blocker would allready probably increase your survivability more then a few extra HP
---
Bravo Sir..! 
---
::hat doffed::
---
You batted him out of your property. I guess that's why he got pissy XD
---
Not me, I'm all grinded out.  Until some new story content comes in, I'm out.  I've got other games to play.
---
No more sneaking. Kick down the mother fucking door and blow shit up.
---
I main a pa heavy and love it, you can mix your game play up by using different heavys. It's awesome
---
Also have a level 110 bloodied stealth who is neat. But not nearly as fun and my pa heavy
---
Because some people are never happy.  I’m amused at the “I sAvEd 250 scriP And got nOthiN gud!!!” posts.
---
Ice cream machine broken, thank.
---
Ya rads should be something to avoid not use as a build stacking manager I used to hate bloodied build till I stacked my def above 650 with serendipity and dodgy. Still any energy weapons, poison, or radiation mean almost certain death. However I have yet to find a high damage build without being below 20% health as nerd rage does a great job boosting all attack stats.
---
When I first started playing the game and this happened to me I was shocked
---
GT: Walrus Parkour. If you have time to trade some time? I would be happy.
---
Twice the chances to roll each day how is that useless.
---
there are a lot of personal preferences around. in the end, it doesnt even matter much, especially at the beginning. just get used to the bloody playstyle, you will have a lot of time to find out what suits you best. in fact, all you need is a weapon with the bloody effect. im level 230ish and still use a 2* b33 handmade, cant afford or find anything better and it works perfectly fine.
---
Pepperidge for sure remembers.
---
Plague doctors, and leech jars as backpacks or...giant leeches to fight
---
Or to flip it around, if I as a berserker take something like blood sacrifice (since it kind of plays into the whole ethos of being a nut with no armor), do I also get the DR applied to my character upon revival, or is it only for my teammates (who are probably not running berserker themselves). If it only applies to teammates and not the person with the perk, then it might be fun assuming you aren't playing with other weirdos :)
---
I always look around the map find a few low levels and travel to them...drop what I want to give them..let them take what they need from the bag...if anything is left I pick it up and go to the next low level till I'm rid of what I'm giving away...that way I know that my ammo weapons ECT. Are going to the players I was intending on the stuff going to.
---
What if it's a Train Station type vendor and you're after your 1400 caps in a oner after a run ?
---
Takes more than a minute to go through the Weapons, Apparel and Aid  inventory and sell the guff.
---
Wait so why not stop paying until the issues resolved instead of funding the people that are giving you an issue? Just stop paying for fo1st instead of doubling down.
---
I’ve yet to have this issue with my private worlds but I’d rather stop paying for a subscription service that’s only giving me a 3rd of what I’m paying for.
---
And 2 meters socially distanced too 😂
---
Nothing spectacular yet, only two things that I'll be keeping so far. First is an Anti-Armour 10mm pistol, which I might make automatic and see how it does. If nothing else it's light to carry. The other is an Executioner's +25% fire rate -25% VATS cost fixer. It's obviously not a god roll, but I think I can get some use out of it alongside my Instigating lever rifle.
---
That’s sort of like not buying tomato sauce or toilet paper when it’s buy one get one free.  You’re stretching your scrip twice as far with this sale and doubling your odds.
---
Maybe after fissure prime gets nuked, it temporarily expands, creating fissures jetting out, maybe after all three nukes spawn, damaging surrounding buildings and increased scorched spawns. Maybe at prime it can create a new dungeon which is massive and stretches through the bog, It can have alot of scorched in, alot of scorchbeast spawns, maybe a scorchbeast king
---
I apologize if this is far fetched but I absolutely love geography and ADORE natural hazards and disasters and man made ones aswell like Chernobyl and Fukushima ect
---
I hated every single tse shotgunner i have ever met. Always stacking that with chinese stealth And pvping workshops. And literally nothing you can do. They can all eat magma.
---
What about a rad barrel? Just ask in this sub or the trading sub if someone could build you a few rad barrels in your camp. Less budget costs no repair costs because the emitter will break after 2 uses and you are 100 % safe that nobody will get any rads from them. Except they activate them per hand.
---
Every build is being hitted because it isn't a nerf, being honest, they didn't change values (I think) they just change the way bonus dmg is calculated. So now every build do less damage. A broken build will be a more noticable change.
---
It's an auto rifle
---
Two shot esplosive
---
\-5 range rules
---
This. If Angry Turtle is right, Blood Sacrifice has a 5 minute cooldown on top of how weak its effects are to begin with. This is so not worth taking.
---
But yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if it does screw over Berserker builds.
---
I'd add onto your ideas by integrating something that's woefully underused in the game, airborne hazards.  Seriously, outside select parts of the Ash Heap and bog masks are just fashion.  But what if there were "events" that created small scale clouds like radstorms that move across each region and which could be negated by wearing a mask if you were unable or unwilling to flee?
---
1) Strangler Season: The Strangler plants of the Mire are blooming, releasing clouds of radioactive pollen throughout the region.  Heightened levels of Strangler pollen have caused widespread infection of the local fauna and has attracted swarms of feeding insects.
---
2) Sundew Season: The Sundew groves of the Cranberry Bog are blooming, releasing clouds of radioactive pollen throughout the region.  Heightened levels of Sundew pollen are having an aphrodisiac effect on Scorchbeasts in the region resulting in increased activity and have attracted swarms of feeding (floaters/mirelurks/etc)
---
Similar ideas could be applied to other regions without the plants part.  In the Ash Heap you have tectonic activity releasing clouds of gasses so toxic it forces groups of Mole Miners to the surface.  Tectonic activity in the Toxic valley releasing gasses that attract creatures like Snallygasters, Floaters etc.
---
Two-Shoot Explosive
---
Yeah, probably the better way to do it, cheers.
---
Paw patrol! Paw patrol.
---
If I ever pass a low level player I'll often drop my tent, get some weapons out and drop it all for them. Gotta help the new guys, right?
---
Thanks. But I just meant that it is possible to get good stuff. I was a negative skeptical too but this just boosted my confidence  a bit.
---
I'll wait until the legendary perks drop, I want those more than I want to respec. And with the highler lvl of the mobs I can then more easily earn more lvl and points to respec.
---
imho respecing now is a waste of perkpoints.
---
I had to put my favorite gun in the game away because of this...a QUAD FFR TESLA...I've used this gun for ever...but the new end game event has made me to  stop using it...only thing I use it for now is the BULLING BIG BAD PVP wanna be...I wait till they shoot me try to instigate PVP...I take down passive mode light them up then leave server...easy 50 caps
---
Absent readers should also note that FED76 just released their 2.0 algorithm. Now it gives you a typical vendor selling  price range as well as a price for direct player trading. Definitely a step in the right direction I’d say.
---
I got instigating + strength powerfist on first go. Then 19 others of crap. 😂. Dunno what to do with them.
---
It scales with commando perks
---
Fucking hammering that upvote button. Ah, that turns it off the second time. Bugger. Okay, have a carefully pressed upvote.
---
I'd love to link saved clips to our Bethsoft account and have them play out on TVs too.
---
I have honestly been starting project paradise by myself. Usually if you build it they will come. Took me a few rando lasers from assualtrons up on scaffolds to figure out the layout. But after that I usually only need one animal at level 3 to complete solo. Pro tip, friendly fire and shishkabob heals your animals when you attack them.
---
Just bought the plan from a vendor for 4999, had never seen the plan in any other vendor machine so i jumped! Now my account is low to 5000 caps and my machines are loaded but no one buys...
---
They can't forget to add “Plan: Empty Pumpkin Rack”. I don't think anyone got this plan.
---
I don’t think it would be a bad thing to set a timer that automatically kicks a player out of a trade/vend menu after one minute of inactivity.
---
I guess you could still put a weight or rubber band on a button to be a troll, so maybe a three minute timer before you get automatically booted and need to jump back in.  I could easily clear the full 1400 daily caps in that time, even if it were all outfits.
---
I agree.   That and Christmas both.  Both start gearing up way too soon.
---
You people are just annoying crybabies. You get to buy 20 guns for 50 and scrip them for 40. That's almost 20 free rolls. And you still bitch about it. Pathetic.
---
The chances to get the same base weapon three times in a row aren't anywhere near as low as one might think. Sure, the total drop pool for 3\* ranged weapons has more than 100.000 possibilities, but there are only around 50 base weapons or so, so three in a row is something like a 1:2500 chance. Given the number of people who are currently trading with - and cursing about - Mama Murmur, that's gotta happen pretty much all the time.
---
Still sucks, though, unless it's one of the few weapons that are in demand.
---
I also would like to see a discount on legendary modules as well as vault steel. If it's a purveyor sale, then EVERYTHING should be on sale at the purveyor. She only sells a few things anyway, and most of the weapon and armor rolls are garbage. I gave up on those and started focusing on legendary modules and vault steel as soon as I noticed that they were available. I know that they SS armor and gauss weapons are still subject to the RNG, but at least you're getting the type of weapon or armor that you want.
---
You can, but if you keep playing this shitfest of a game, it's not going to be come better. And it won't go well for future bethesda titles either. Starfield is going to be a shitfest, and ES6 ... well, let's not talk about that.
---
What was your original build, and what were the ones you tried?
---
They patched it on the PTS a couple weeks back and unarmed is still a shadow of its former self.  Double digit damage vs SBQ and no more one shot kills on high level enemies.  If you love melee, slugger and power armor is a much safer route.
---
Also, it seems Sunny has them on sale pretty often.
---
Had the same problem on PC last night. Went into a public server for a bit then switched characters and was back in business. Your first clue will be the Atomic Shop not loading.
---
Hey it just dawned on me...when did they get rid of the grenade perk card??? The one where explovises deal more radius damage...
---
That’s why I made different characters. One heavy gunner crit build, a full-frontal no-VATS revolver, and a melee tank. It’s good to cycle. 
---
Though it’s quite frustrating that I won’t get access to all legendary perk slots right away. That does actually piss me off.
---
I had a tse handmade and it was my baby, then they got nerfed, then I gave it to my ex for her only to leave me it’s ok tho, murmghh got me a replacement
---
Of course it is possible, just not plausible. Too much pool, too much RNG.
---
Oh interesting!  My camp gets attacked very rarely indeed and it's near a bloatfly spawn, do you think that's why?  I've always wondered why it seems immune!
---
It’s a nice weapon, but that sounds like a very motivated buyer.  The value of unarmed weapons are already dropping significantly because of the damage recalculation.
---
Here's an excellent [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/innic4/how_rare_is_project_paradise_backpack/g48l1at/) on something to do to make the event easier, with no respawning robots and the animals healing between events. I had no idea about that before seeing this post.
---
If in doubt, fill whichever feeding trough everybody else is filling, and then follow the highest-level animal around to keep it protected and don't worry about the others. You won't get the best rewards like that, (I'm not sure if certain plans even drop with only one animal alive,) but you should at least finish the event.
---
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE ICE CREAM MACHINE IS BROKEN! THATS WHAT CRYOLATORS ARE FOR! DO I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING AROUND HERE JUST TO GET SOME SERVICE!
---
I actually can't complain this time. First roll was a TSE Fixer and my last one was an AAE LMG.
---
i dont, for the same reasons i dont like NPCs in FO76: dumb bots getting stuck on stairs and furniture; repetetive senseless babbling; just animated puppets with no life...
---
No, it is not a valid enough reply. It is a lame reply. The purveyor only sells a few things, so everything should be on sale. That would make the sale worth it for those of us that spent the time grinding for reputation and bullion for plans.
---
And what about a shoulder/neck flashlight so you can still have light with nice cloths.
---
Nothing like taking two digits off an attack vs a boss.  1400 on Monday, 40 on Tuesday.
---
Now till the 14
---
I quit for 6 months because of it. My character was level 150ish and at the time I didn't want to respec.
---
I lost 3000 atoms and couldn’t get them back
---
The challenges give me something to do, but none of the season 2 rewards really jumped out at me as must have.  The planters look cool, but I’m assuming they’ll be fussier to use than bare ground or garden plots.
---
Pipe pistol? U mean berserkers rolling pin!?!?!
---
She gave me an explosive fixer once.  I may as well just give all the legendaries I find to friends now, my luck is done till 2076
---
My quad explosive lever action and my AAE LMG have been my every day uses for months. Love em
---
lol, enjoy playing something else then :) ? Last I checked it wasn't mandatory, so your saying you only play just for the seasonal rewards, the content does nothing for you? As far as the bugs the whole season's thing is still new I'm sure it will have issues hopefully not as much as the first season though.
---
Me personally, there are a couple of things I see that I want.
---
If you're looking to trade you're in the wrong place. Trading is not allowed here

If you're looking for advice though that's different. If you're in pvp you definitely want a matching set of sent ass. Matching or not that is your best bet for pvp. Heavy leather will be your best armour type though since a lot of pvper use energy weapons and that grants the higher er in game
---
You can still earn XP from your team mates and get some free caps for fast travel, lol.
---
I started leveling a new character this week so for fun I've dumped a bunch of scrip on him. The amount of great low level gear I've gotten from mumbles is insane. Both my other characters were well over level 50 when mumbles was added so I never used her at low level then. But I've gotten way better weapons in the last week on my low level then I have on both my other's combined.
---
I’d love a planting pool for cranberries and tarberries, and possibly an enclosed pen to raise small animals for meat.  Squirrel Stew and Cranberry Relish are basically the only two things my characters eat nowadays.  Int boosts are also key, so may as well throw in brain fungus planters.
---
No more Legacy weapons?  I just get powder rifles, guns, launchers. I just throw them away or pass it on to a low level to get scrips going.
---
Wrong sub, hoss.
---
Wrong sub
---
It's seems to be the best decision you could make right now. From what I saw about the coming patch and the daily ops, stealth is no longer viable (at least during the daily ops). I'm going to think about to switch over from melee to heavy gunner.
---
I was doing that as well in the beginning. Later on I got a nicely rolled Junkies Auto-Grenade launcher, so nowadays I just roll into Line in the Sand with that and about 30-40 nades. Does enough damage to tag but not kill the groups.
---
I guess you should just check out what suits you better.
---
My husband and I build completely separately since the very beginning - cheaper fast travel and more possibilities to meet rare encounters are nice for sure, but honestly we're just not really the builder's types.
---
For roleplay reasons we live on the Savage Divide, my circus trailers are just above the Freak Shop, his camp  has a nice view for the Converted Munition Factory. 
---
I saw lot of couples living in the Forest (Flatwoods, Bolton Greens, north of the map, crashed airplane) some in the Savage Divide (close to Top of The World or Lucky Hole Mine), one or two in the Mire so I guess you just have to check out what kind of view you both like...and change it when it starts to be boring ;)
---
And I have to confess...I was not really sure if I want to play with my husband too - I love heavy/auto weapons, he loved to snipe, so I was afraid one of us is gonna be bored to death. Well, none of us did, he started loving .50cal, I learnt not to kill everything on sight ;)
---
I noticed many guys assume girls are playing Fallout only for building aspect of this game - I know there's a lot of women simply loving building settlements (and that's great btw, I saw so many masterpieces out there in the wasteland), but there's many of us who just appreciate a good killing spree. Or are fans of that exact franchise. Or like RPGs of any kind. Or love to PvP. Or many other reasons.
---
So if you want to convince your wife to play with you, show her everything Fallout could offer - for one day give her some time for gathering resources and building a perfect settlement, but for another, get her wasted on nukashine and friendly PvP using silly weapons (Cursed Shovels work as a charm, that sound is more than perfect!), maybe check out one or two side quests (I highly recommend not using fast travel during those, it's going to be easier to sink in the mood) or just go and wreck havock - there's so many ways to play this game, I bet she's gonna love one of them. Anyways, fingers crossed and good luck!
---
Yes, we have them where I work, you're not wrong.  If there's a way to charge enough Atoms for each upload to cover the costs and development, maybe they'll find a way, we can hope..
---
This and tripple EXP, we deserve it. Or RIOT
---
Agreed, focusing on resisting damage taken or avoiding altogether outweighs that extra 50 hit points you can get from life giver.
---
I'm leveling my 3rd character and it's amazing how many times I have to jump on mike and tell someone I don't need anything.
---
I saw this happen at my CAMP once, someone was shopping in one of my vendors and another dude just started wailing on him... So as soon as the guy shopping moved I logged. 
---
Not as cool as killing but that dude wasted caps to travel to a shop he just got denied and I had some awesome bloodied weapons at the time due to a build swap
---
Attack me while I'm using a vendor/vending machine, and guess what happens?
---
You just *guaranteed* that you're not going to be using that vendor/vending machine for the next 5 minutes, as I'll literally just get up and fetch myself a biscuit.
---
Or just live with crippled arms. 
---
Here comes Captain Hooks
---
You got auto deleted. But I gave you advice on what to use. No need to be rude
---
Yeah but this why the Unyielding armor set is interesting here. It gives you back what you would miss if you would go with a Bolstering armor set. For sure, in some case v.a.t.s will cost you a lil more ammo, but if you know how to farm your ammo ( and plus the Ammo factory legendary perk soon )...it's absolutly not and will absolutly not be an issue.
---
And endurance can also allow you to use drugs more efficiently. I mean at the end of the day, if you can manage to have a high health pool (for a high 20% health ) and use drugs on top of that...you're build just send junkie builds to the hospital, in pve.
---
All you need is enough time to pop your diluted stimpaks.
---
And beside dog ribs (+5 endurance) i'm not really farming food right now. I have no space for "Good with Salt". I will start to jump into it more seriously when i have the backpack refrigarated mod. As it can be stacked with the Good with Salt perk card, i'm assuming this refrigarated mod is really good. Anyway no matter what, i'll have to deal with it.
---
Ricochet isn't bad, but from my experience it isn't enough constant to worth 3 special points, in my opinion. I also plan to test Dodgy but i'm a lil affraid it happens to be to much for my action point pool. I already use it on my PA bloodied heavy gunner build. I'm lucky i'm already tanky...
---
But i'm definitly planning to test all this, i mean i gotta try.
---
You actually get a lot of good stuff if you start with 5000 scrip and maintain the 150 limit all four days across five characters.  It’s a total of 8000 scrip or 160 three star weapons.
---
What perks did you take ? love to see your build :)
---
Love the mod! The tool performs quickly with minimal lag when exporting even extremely large inventories, and I can’t wait to see what’s added next. Also, a question for players more experienced with web formats: what would the easiest way to compare between multiple inventory exports?
---
Currently, I’m trying Notepad++ with the *compare* plugin
---
I think you'll be better off moving points out of END and using Legendary Endurance instead. Survivability isn't often an issue for stealth Commandos, but it'll help for the anti-stealth Daily Ops. Plus there aren't a lot of good options for legendary perks for stealth Commandos, so the slot should be available for most.
---
I recently tried something similar with my new PA melee build, and as much as it needs survivability while drawing aggro, I found putting points into Agility and Luck more effective. Agility lets me sprint and VATS for days, Luck gives me numerous options that enhance my survivability and damage output.
---
However, there were 2 big reasons I lowered END on this tanky character: how little the Nerd Rage!/Emergency Protocols threshold was boosted and Lifegiver stealing my rads every time I load into a server. I was looking at only about 20 extra HP for missing out on other perks. Lifegiver also kept stealing my rads and giving me illusory HP that went away as soon as and only when I took damage, effectively kicking me out of NR!/EP range with the same amount of HP. Lifegiver can suck it.
---
Yeh my main is a Bloodied Stealth Commando, my secondary was a half assed PA build that I left to gather dust, started playing with it recently and put some thought and effort into the build and by far my favorite build atm.
---
Thank you, i'll definitely go take a look to Angry turtle tutorials 👍
---
This is why I'm grinding levels hard for both my main builds. 👍
---
Why would you take out the survival elements out of a game centered around survival? Am I missing something? Do you guys want to make this even less challenging? There is already no penalty for dying really you just spawn back in in 15 seconds to finish the job you failed to do in one life. If anything they need to make the game harder or at least make a nerf server for all the weenies who cant hack it in an apocalypse RPG. Personally dying should make your armor and weapons lose durability, lose caps, or even better drop all your items for others to loot if you die outside events. That will wash all the bloodies off the map and the need to use whats supposed to be a hinderance as a bonus and using rads to keep your heath low.
---
You can certainly 'tag' non-boss creatures and get xp when they're killed.  
---
They still have to be killed though for you to get the xp
---
This is very true.  I played normally, doing reputation quests once a day, turning in 200 worth of notes, and I got everything I could use long ago.  I’ve even built a fully modded T-65 suit just to spend bullion.
---
I’m only interested in the mannequins and the green house building set
---
All a pretty interesting idea imo and curious how it will all work. Just 1 small thing you mentioned stuck out that might disappoint you once you get it: the refrigerated backpack specifically says it doesn't stack with the good with salt perk...
---
I have a bloodied build with 15 end. Not a stealth build, a tanky rapid fire, take no hostages, kick down the door, what was that, hell yeah sir build. Then I have a purely stealth bloodied build and a Junkies PA build.
---
Thats another era, we pvp’ed with explo shotguns... my BE double barrel just destroyed shit up lol
---
Then neeeeerf... neeeeeerf and bye bye fun
---
Can't play your video but it sounds like an intermittent issue I have with the game thinking my mic is on when it's not and feeding back the game sound. I too play with a controller which of course has 2 audio devices if it's a 360 pad. Have you ever used a mic? Once the game 'fixes' on a real working mic it stops the issue for me. It is def related to phantom input from an inactive audio input device though. Maybe share the video as private on YouTube?
---
That's my best guess without hearing it.
---
My PC sends me death threats after I join one of these.
---
But don't the machines only have a limit of like 150 per day? So that's 20 guns for 50, and scrip three of them for 40 then have to sell the rest for a pittance in caps.
---
If it were the way you said, then I'm sure nobody would be complaining.
---
Its because im forgetting to repair and one time I repaired in inventory, and accidently dropped it and i lost it. I dont remember why, crashed or couldnt find stash or other picked it up maybe. But its a perk thats in the game. It doesnt feel good wanting to use a perk, but shame on me for not googling the shit out of whats meta but thought this game worked as intended after 2,5 years of release. Thats all.  If its that amazing fpr most players, maybe not.  Im tired of swapping cards too.  I just wanted to use that card for whatever reason I have. And its bugged and doesnt work. Sorry for sounding negative, but I really just wanted the card to work, not tips for what cards to use.
---
It's not killing the playerbase with the void, it's rather stop forcing the playerbase to play NW for score points hiatus.
---
Nobody is broadcasting 😂
---
Magazines, bobbleheads, and cap stashes only have a chance to spawn. The more players that pass thru an area, the more the game rolls chances of them spawning.
---
Usually on a private server i never find mags bobbles or cap stashes but will switch to public and have them spawn in
---
Heavy gunner here - taking Ammo Factory, Taking One for the Team, Master Infiltrator and 3 Legendary SPECIAL perks.
---
Master Infiltrator is there for both convenience and the fact it's 6 perks in one, and since Perception is my dump stat (got it at 1), it's great. None of the PA oriented legendary perks are appealing to me. 30% unreliable dice roll to not die in a suit that's already hard to die in to begin with, a useless increase to PA sprint duration and a useless fusion core recharge perk (which are already plentiful) -  with a great, if situational, hidden side effect of health regeneration/immortality to energy attacks.
---
Use thru hiker like the rest of us. We want the game to be harder not easier.
---
I'm well aware of the passive PA damage reduction and other effects like mods. I been playing this game since launch and have 2500+ hours on this. But please, go test it. The difference is there. And it's very noticeable. Especially on bloodied builds where you will be at very low healths all the time and the damage you take affects you more than on full health builds.
---
Also, the whole armor rating has dimishing returns (atleast as we have known it) was pretty much debunked couple days ago and seems it is just a thing people have been parroting all these months with nothing to back it up, or atleast understanding what it actually means. This seems to be especially true with power armors. I suggest you read the whole post and the comment section.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ipkny3/armor\_rating\_diminishing\_returns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ipkny3/armor_rating_diminishing_returns/)
---
Yea i'm aware of it...but i'm assuming  that if it doesn't stack with it it's because it's already op. It must worth a Good with Salt rank 3 or something like that if you know what i mean. Anyway i'll make a lil more research about it.
---
there are some pretty good endurance/hp buff out there.  
---
you can run at 15 without putting point in endurance SPECIAL.
---
Ah i see, how not surprising
---
tbh, i found more magazines in the last 2 weeks than in the 2 months before that. dont think something got changed here, you might just be very unlucky right now.
---
I still have my TSE double barrel. That and pretty much any other shotgun could take out 10 ghouls at once XD
---
I took a different path to the same goal. Started an alt and leveled it to around 100. Run around in PA at all times littering the land with empty ammo shells.
---
There's your problem, this sub doesn't have anything good to say about the game ever. I'm a new player and I love this game, but since coming to the sub, I've felt weirdly put off a bit from it.
---
this is actually a feature in subnautica, I like it , so it would be nice to see digital picture frames in Fallout 76
---
Nah, building in 76 is orders of magnitude worse, but the reasons for building are better
---
There seems to be a server-based semi-random attribute..some people report it tends to give you the sames attributes. Go to a server tries once , if you get an attribute you want , go full scale , if not change server.
---
That soubds a lot like some of the players ive met to be fair
---
out of 10 rolls, i got 4 10mm submachine guns, two of them medic, in a row. rng can be cruel...
---
There is a gutsy inside of Meg's that sells grenades for gold bullion.
---
Oh yeah, I forgot that you have to spend all your available time in the game every day and have absolutely nothing else to do so the idea of not grinding legendaries for several days scares you so much.
---
And how do you know someone is trolling, when it's unironically the best gun to use on events with hordes?
---
Thanks. Playing on another language, have to guess those acronyms all the time
---
Okay thanks
---
Thank you
---
Agreed I think those two will be more situational. I'm just really looking forward to the legendary perks now. especially if they bring across from the PTS, it taking less coins to level up, getting two perk coins per card, and getting 50 coins for hitting level 50
---
been saving for purveyor save for a month. I was at 1000 scrip limit. Spent it all and got virtually zero useable items, neither weapon nor armor. Now i can turn them back in in the next weeks because of 150 scrip sell limit. The game was rigged from the start.
---
thank God you were here to sully a nice post
---
I love it!I was looking for that guy!The impatient one that slaps you in the back with his rifle...nice
---
In the command wing of vault 79 on the wall there are 3 silo names and small screens with words on them
---
How much you looking for? They're pretty hard to find
---
Don't know if you've watch angry turtles reviews, but electrical absorption also heals you from energy attacks (excluding laser turrets for some reason). Makes you invincible against assaultrons. But yeah if that's not intended then all the pa perks pretty much suck.
---
Though a data miner on another post did say it was coded that way
---
I never knew how bad I wanted this until now.
---
At least all the good guns will hold their value for the most part
---
I think it’s mainly because you can get every good perk in the Endurance stat with like 7-8 points.  I’d argue that Lifegiver isn’t worth four perk points, but Endurance is pretty dry on essential perks.  As a bloody player, I’d rather have Aquaboy just to completely eliminate rad intake from rivers and standing water.
---
The interesting thing about food is that it heals over time.  If you’re doing something like soloing Encryptid, you’re still using basically all 500 points of healing even if you have a 50 hp limit.  The HoT effect is overriding DoT, allowing you to focus exclusively on DPS until the buff wears off.  Depending on your build and gear, you may only need 1-2 scorchbeast steaks or Nuka Quantum to put down the impostor.
---
Playing casually, strong health buffs are wasted.  In certain situations they can be almost essential.
---
What platform?
---
He had us in the first half ngl
---
The mask hasn't been in the vendor for a long time now. It has a slim chance to drop from events in the savage divide I believe
---
It helps if your luck is high, take some chems and have unyeilding armor before you go and see her
---
It's always some wanker in power armor with a permanently drawn mini gun, isn't it?
---
Xbox
---
Yeah I was lost the 1st few times i did this one.3 habitat's 3 feeders in the middle.1st start the event -big computer-then try and fill the feeder. If it's just me I stick to ome habitat and try and get the most feed I can.after that protect the friendly animal that spawns.the more feed the tougher the friendly. It's tough but with a decent team it gets easy
---
You must be a great laugh at parties...
---
Magic guns don’t one shot either
---
Perfectly Spoiled Food.
---
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it!!
---
I'm not sure how true that is for the purveyor. I have 3 luck and was using no chems, and using Vanguards.
---
I spent 2000 and the best one I got was a V2515 Handmade.
---
Or when inactive fissures open up temporarily
---
I and several friends have had this very issue multiple times, having support unlink our accounts for some reason fixes the social menu bugs for a time... It isn't a permanent fix as the fault is with their service.
---
dam that hurts, i’ll try the events i guess thanks for the tip!
---
Why because i said thay you cant wait until end of september to start spaming? Gonna cry? Gonna piss and shit?
---
Like you replying me.
---
Not sure why youre getting down voted. Stealth doesnt work in daily ops due to the enemies have piercing gaze its the same situation as primal cut events. Its a fact.
---
Is definitely true but what's a couple of chems to find out 👍
---
Lmao the pool..there gotta be more than just random madness.i rolled 5 1 star handmades yesterday on 260 scrip on my low level alt.lvl21 but I spent 400 on my main not a single HM?I'm happy for my alt.but meh
---
Haha. And Derek sounds like such a fucking idiot. I can't stand when he talks. Pretty sure his accent doesn't sound like he's from Pittsburgh at all.
---
Well, we didn’t get eggs for the chicken coop, so I’m afraid the odds are pretty small. Did Wastelanders bring any new recipes?
---
Nah, I'm good.  Thanks for the offer, though.
---
Didnt knew, maybe i have to much free healthcare to understand it
---
2 ghoul slayer gamma guns on same character
---
Maybe
---
Today.
---
They say it was delayed.
---
Nice lol
---
100% accuracy?  I might make that work...misses every 1st shot
---
I would buy from the purveyor if I got a fixer plan to begin with. I have probably done the imposter sheepsquatch about 30 times now and still haven’t gotten it
---
But the way most, if not all the users express those complaints is exageratted. They alwaya paint it like the end of the world instead of being calm and civil
---
The death of TSE caused a large, amount of players to quit the game, this nerf will do the same.
---
Don't overlook the humble pipe pistol, slap on an auto receiver, a rifle stock, and a drum magazine. You have a great commando weapon with a high DPS that can vats for days and is cheap to use for events. Many people put .38 rounds in their venders for 0 caps.
---
Of 3 most affected stats:
---
Either running 3 shotguns or 4 heavies (bear arms, bandolier, 3 heavy damage perks, travelling pharmacy. also have each heavy damage card at 2 points, so then i add blocker/pain train for giggles on low enemies or lock &amp; load). When running melee / shotguns I swop out accordingly.
---
Intelligence for batteries included, demolition (have cards at 3 and 5 points), stabilised of course, Nerd rage or Power user depending on weapon.
---
Perception at 4. Just for options. For 1 concentrated fire if wanted, glow sight, skeet shooter, refractor for silo runs, or 3 commando cards at 1 each plus concentrated fire if i feel like packing reduced weight ultracite plasma rifle as backup.
---
I am working on getting away from energy weapons completely though. With power user, repair bobbleheads it's just a matter of fusion core weight juggling to not need or maybe just have batteries included at 1 point.
---
All my available time? I come on once a day if that for about an hour and still max out legendary scrip without even trying. You really seem to have no idea how this game plays. Do you even own it?
---
Huh. TIL. Thanks for the clarification.
---
If you have exemples, i'm open. It would be already great if the damn endurance points on armors and underarmors would increase the the health...
---
For now, i rather use drugs to improove my dps by 25% for 7-8 minutes.
---
Ah Ok.
---
thanks
---
That cripples the damage permenantly. I tested this with mine, now it can't beat 2 damage with maxed out shotgun perks, even after restoring it.
---
All my friends and I got it. It was a little rare but a few of us got extras to share
---
It might become highly useful in the upcoming update with Expeditions
---
In the words of the president "It is what it is"
---
You have some good ideas here, but I'm never going to get behind any "team required: events in a Fallout game.
---
I rolled a Medics combat rifle and than a ghouls slayers pipe revolver. At that point i stopped and bought 10 modules,  server hopped and bought 8 more. 
---
I said screw that i have all the weapons i need, just going to keep rolling SS armor. Maybe someday modules will be part of the sale.
---
They are not. Take it from a guy that farmed Radical masks. The legendary affixes are static.
---
“You can build anywhere” - Todd Howard, 2018
---
It's true; berserker is just incorrect to use. Even if you've got a chameleon mutation and berserker weapon, there's no situation where running without armor is better; because your alpha strike isn't enough to take out enemies before you get smeared into paste. 
---
 The "correct" build for alpha strikes from stealth is four pieces of unyielding armor and one piece of chameleon armor. It's kinda boring that there's no point in experimenting further.
---
I thought it was on the bethesda homepage for both ESO and FO76. Getting free upgrade when its available
---
Yeah, the Armor Ace stands were datamined, but are not included in the run itself. It might be a reward related to the coming BoS questlines or Daily Ops, but they might also have removed them to keep Armor Stands as Atom Shop exclusives.
---
I never see anyone using unarmed, why nerf it even more??
---
The new season is coming with Legendary Perks, One Wasteland level scaling, and Daily Ops. Not sure about any story content released with the Daily Ops, but anyways
---
If you are trying to place your whole house down, it probably won’t work.  Now you know why you see a single platform with stairs attached and a floating house, the single platform base can be placed anywhere.
---
Because it’s not just ‘you’re camp’ when it’s a public server. Beth tried to match you up with a nice, comfortable connection, but sometimes it’s just not meant to be. Just saying, it’s probably a popular location so it’s worth the wait if you’re getting something out of the camp in the first place.
---
Add me: GT: LawrenceAndHenr 
---
I solo several daily
---
Pretty sure they took them out of season rewards. They'll likely be Atom store items during the upcoming season instead. That or community event completion rewards.
---
That's it. But hey I don't care about downvotes haha
---
Yes you can and I'm not disputing that at all. My issue is every time I go back to the menu to go eat or drink in RL and then come back, I have to keep logging out straight away because someone is in the spot I've chose. 6 logouts and finding a 'new' session in the last half hour. I reckon it keeps putting me back in the same one over and over
---
Yeah, the whole concept of a 'bloodied build' either in FO4 or FO76 wasn't something that had even *occurred* to me until I heard people talking about it online. Until I started playing FO76 and hit the forums, I always regarded the Bloodied effect and associated armours as just being a handy buff to have if you're taking a pounding, but nothing more. 
---
I still won't make a bloodied build, though. I get frustrated if even part of my health bar is red let alone almost all of it...
---
That's what I said. But ask yourself two questions: a) do you really want to level up a perk for an effect that may or may not be intended and can vanish overnight? b) how often do you actually fight enemies with energy based attacks, and how many of them are actually lethal enough to warrant that perk? Assaultrons and Sheepsquatch, and...that's pretty much it?
---
There are already some. Project Paradise, ACP (soloing is possible, but come on), that one where you play music to lure a boss, etc
---
It's not true at all
---
There is a load of content that solos can easily complete, and with the team system, all they would have to do is add a 'end game zone' team and it would be easy to give it a try though it might be difficult with no communication. That was kinda the point though, it would be a nice carrot on a stick. Areas and enemies that are not easy to overcome adds character to a game and a certain mystique that atm, is sorely lacking.
---
I’ve got into the rhythm of coming on in the morning before work to see what the purveyor has for me, then fast travel and get my gold bullion for the day and don’t play it till the following morning, the main issues are even with fallout 1st, there’s nowhere to stash all the script worthy weapons so I can’t play it until I’ve got rid of most of them over the period of a week, it’s a joke the way it is now, I have over 50 weapons, can’t get rid of, I have over 490 treasury notes, also can’t get rid of. 
---
So many people like me are drowning in useless clutter like a post apocalyptic hoarder
---
It’s an economy. If not regulated and monitored, it would render itself invaluable. That is why we see the Atlas event (resource sink/purge) or bullion (cap sink). It’s just an effort to keep inflation of user prices posing a threat to the really ‘big guys’...Beth
---
&gt;lol, enjoy playing something else then :) ?
---
if i would act like that i had nothing to play anymore, or even have a reason to live at all if i would take this advice in my real life. what is this for a mindset at all? shouldn't we make every negative fuckup they create on purpose public and let others be aware of such kind? if everyone would ignore everything that bugs them nothing will ever change and these company's could screw with us even more...   
---
i'm not the type of guy who is stuck with his head in the dirt trying to ignore everything someone is screwing with me.  if you are ok, but wtf what are you thinking giving someone such an "advice"?
---
It's also no excuse for game-breaking bugs that something is new. ever heard of play-testing? stuff like test-servers or internal tests? 
---
also, ofc nothing of the said content is mandatory. nothing at a game should be in the first place. but why adding content for "everyone" when no one is supposed to get it done without wasting his life for three months straight or buying the last twenty-ish ranks, because that's what it is supposed to be - everything is psychological set to get players buying atoms, like rising numbers or project that would be remaining unfinished.
---
finally, let me guess what the things you want are: the BoS Bunker, Greenhouse Set and anything else on the last 10 ranks? well, read the previous paragraph about psychological manipulation. At least i bet it's not the Nukashine, Rad-X or Stimpaks which are available to buy for 1,5€/$.
---
When I go to the purveyor, I always take a swipe at the pie.  Last night I got it on the first try.  I went to grab it and there were around 20 ultracite cores already in it.  I was like... bonus.
---
I did get one Anti Armor Explosive Vats something The Fixer so that was the only bright side. The issue I have with the sale is this will take me days to get rid of the shit I dont need even after flicking off the 3 heaviest to my low level character to grind.
---
Exploring, events, socialization, role-playing, camp building.
---
I almost never even think about script limits. It just seems weird to me that so many people act like scrip is literally the only reason to ever play.
---
......fuck.  IDT I tried anything else.  I think I just blanketed soup as a whole.  I'll try em all today.  Thanks!

Something to do with the green build area being too close to someone else's or a 'named' location. I've got a huge water purifier I need to fit in water and loads of crops, so that I can eat and drink every 10 fucking minutes. My character should be a right fat fuck considering the game clock on the pipboy is pretty slow.
---
no cap?! 🤔 you sonofabitch i'm in.
---
So bad game design, but the worst is they won't hear a word about it. But in the end I don't care The Purveyor is almost comparable to a hoax 99.999% is trash. You'll be pretty d luck if you get that 0.001 item this decade.
---
The brotherhood are facists bigots who discriminate against super mutants and ghouls...
---
Join the enclave instead!!! We fucking hate everyone!
---
If I had to guess, slim to none
---
I never really thought about this. My berserkers builds are mostly solo toons anyways, but I do occasionally play them on a team. I really hope this isn't going to be a problem.
---
&gt;50% is way to low to compensate loosing all our armor.
---
I agree, either allow weightless armours to not affect the damage buff or increase the max damage Berserker's can do.
---
Some of the most enjoyable and challenging gameplay I'm having in Fallout 76 is with a Berserkers build, but it needs some love.
---
With max STR and max PER I have the option of choosing 1-handed, 2-handed, heavy, sniper, commando, bows and shotguns. Adding Sneak with Legendary Perks as well, so this is gonna be tight  
---
\[edit\] Looking at the option of adding Pistols and Auto Pistols if I can get the AGI high enough as well
---
I get why the forest rivers are popular. Serves me right for trying to be smart and become self sufficient in the game I guess. Note to self: Become a raider, not a farmer!
---
You don't have to log off if you get stuck in the animation. I've had that happen a couple of times. I can't remember exactly what I did to fix it (its been a while) but I've never had to log off to fix it. It was something simple like reloading, fast travel, accessing map or pipboy. Animation stopped and I was back to normal.
---
I see, I miss understood.  That sucks, just find a more remote spot, not too close to a train station ect..I only have it happen every few weeks and only once.
---
Is that meant to be Pittsburgh?? I thought it was like a fucked out Yooper northern Michigan voice....
---
Bethesda are not known for reversing anything they do in the way of buffs or nerfs.
---
lol yep.  I have a weight problem now
---
There's no real goal for anything after the whole "make your own fun". Scrip at least allows you the chance to get something good
---
Ok i see, i see, really interesting. Well let's say you need a solid "Good with Salt " rank 3 tho or you really need to know how to manage this type of food.
---
But the thing is that i'm also tired to instantly die from poison or AOE's. I think that this is something a lot of bloodied build players seem to ignore.
---
For sure a high 20% health bloodied build may not be able to pull as much dps than Bloodied build who stacks gun fu and Adrenaline or play sneaky for those one shots. But in a place like in a Scorched Earth Event &amp; Colosal problem, from what i saw, this bloodied build seem to potentialy be the one who will be able to protect and revive those optimised builds. This is why i wanna keep pushing this build further, I have a great feeling about this type of build. We shouldn't ignore it in my opinion.
---
I love heavy as a base build..
---
It gives so much flexibility..
---
Shotgunner tick
---
Unarmed tick
---
2 handed pa melee tick
---
Full health tick
---
Bloodied tick
---
Energy Heavy weapons tick
---
I’m sure I’ve missed some!
---
I sell most plans really cheap and I think i have it for 10-15 caps
---
Building around Daily Ops only is not very viable though. It's way better to have Earle, SBQ or farming route as source of build inspiration. Or, of course, whatever you think is fun.
---
Perfect 5 out of 7
---
When you doing it?
---
I built the in dirt water purifier and I have 10, and 50 some crops, I would not use the in water purifiers because it really opens up your possibilities and I feel the little ones make water faster(only hold 2)you just have to check them more often.
---
Well, he CLAIMS to be from Pittsburgh, so that's why I think it sounds ridiculous.  He says something like "Oh, I'm all da way from out der in Pittsburgh way" or some stupid sounding shit like that. 😆
---
They sleep on everything, kind of how they have slept on this game it’s entire life cycle
---
ESO and Doom Eternal, nothing about Fallout 76. [https://bethesda.net/en/article/3cP83OCJszhZnUes1gxwL8/bethesda-next-gen-console-upgrades](https://bethesda.net/en/article/3cP83OCJszhZnUes1gxwL8/bethesda-next-gen-console-upgrades)
---
Yep agree with energy weapons and cores, I think I have over 100 of each and 50 ultracite plasma .. 
---
Thinking of focusing on explosive shotguns, unarmed with a side of explosive AA 50 cal ..
---
Our group has 3 camps in close proximity to each other just west Watoga, Loaction is on top of the cliffs near a lake. Great views of Watoga, the bog and you can see to the blast zone at fissure prime. Camps are near enough so can be seen from, and easily walked to even when over encumbered, each other
---
Grandma? . . . She's 23.
---
700 hours in and do the events everytime they pop up. Still haven't gotten it. Good luck on your journey.
---
This makes sense as Nerd Rage is percentage based, which exceeds any Defense/Resistance attribute. Higher Endurance as OP mentions, may help you survive the Food buff running out, although it should definitely set you to 1 HP instead of killing you when it runs out
---
Who misses choices from f01-nv?
---
Feel like buying the plans for the water purifier was a shit investment now. I'll look out for that plan and move away from the rivers when I can. Thanks for the tip dude.
---
Because rhey were bragging about it.  Wasn’t hard to figure out.
---
I have 1494 treasury notes and put the  assassin’s fatman and nocturnal missile launchers in the pie lottery machine.  Even if nobody wins the lottery they can have the consolation prizes.  Lol
---
I tried yesterday afternoon and mine was still bugged so unless they’ve changed something in the last 12 hours I’d be inclined to say yes
---
This would be nice. One of my berserkers builds is a straight up martyr by design so it could be useful. I think the best way to keep these perks from affecting our builds is to change the effect to damage mitigation instead of adding a set amount of DR. But i doubt they'll change it seeing how were less then a week from release.
---
What is the bug anyway?
---
The server seed shit is true.
---
I bought heaps in my private server and it's always trash. It's like Beth assigned me a 50Cal and Tesla only allotment. With plenty of Ultracite laser pistols. 
---
I try once in a public after learning Fixer plans recently, and I get Instigating with aim damage and reload speed.
---
Definitely don't spend it all in the same place.
---
Legendary special will allow for respects with little to no point swapping. Recommend maxing if possible
---
1000 scrip straight armor rolls best I got was a combat assassins ap water breathing piece .
---
I had a version of it yesterday where **1 MOLERAT SPAWNED**. That was it... 
---
Does the Forest Jumpsuit drop from that event? I've seen lists of events for the Forest Jumpsuit and I don't think I've seen Death Blossoms on it.
---
Tato Salad from Meat Week gives +125 Max HP if you're Herbivore with Strange in Numbers. There are others that gives up to +5 END, but I fail to recollect which ones. Go into cooking and scroll through your unlocked recipes, you'll see all the buffs on the left and bottom sides.
---
The one I have is that one the word wall where it should say incomplete or in progress it just says both overlayed on top of each other so no nuclear codes work. Just looks like gibberish. Wasted a card yesterday just to make sure.
---
Damn is the event live? How long will it last? 
---
(Is there an official site were I can see this kind of stuff?)
---
I'm in England should be able to get on after 5pm 
---
Can add me tho if you want im always doing events 
---
And don't mind helping others out, I'm hearing this sheepsquatch event tho has broke the mold lol
---
And yet my extended family on the wife's side hails from Northern Michigan and sound *exactly* as dopey.... Well not all of them but you get my drift.
---
*We're-a goin as fast as Ward needs!*
---
I seem to end up playing with the same people repeatedly and have noticed when trying to hop servers, it's just the same two or three it keeps putting me back into. I now use the Xbox LFG menu to randomly join a player who hopefully is in another region. Thankfully never experienced lag from playing on a sever in a sub optimal location.
---
Yup that's what I was thinking but except the fact is it's not gonna be all green rad storms due to the steel mill pollution clouds mixed in with Radioactive sludge
---
Only 4 more day until Tesla fix, but sadly also the Lines in The Sand fix (from what rumors I've heard anyways)
---
I was thinking the left top side of the map acros the river, a spaceship crashes and takes over that zone, including strange infected flora, ofc there would also need to be varios versions of alien enemys, there would be bos events to cros the river, take back alien controlled points, and push em back al the way to their ship in multiple chained events after eachother, with a instanced dungeon inside the ship only available when their pusbed back, or in reverse, defend retaken points from alien counter attack, also the zone would have other locations, events,... Not tied to the main push back/defend events, on the right side of the river could also be some smaller lower lvl events helping patrolling bos squads to burn out/ control the infectious flore that crosses the river... Somethin like that...
---
I think I got the small purifier plan from taking over workshops in the (starting) forrest area.  Been awhile lvl 200 now.
---
Do you really only play the game to gamble? 
---
A lot of us played before scrip was even a thing.
---
Thank you so much  :) the only information I could find was for the one released in May!
---
Glad I saved up
---
Nicely done. I passed one of those on the way to Morgantown. I'm still around there so I'll give that a go. Thanks
---
I like the idea of aliens in an endgame area.
---
It's pretty f'd up of them. They outline a code of conduct for users (section 2.3) and claim that griefing and harassment in game is not allowed. than in the next paragraph they say that they will not tolerate 'naming and shaming', which they describe as someone who has been griefed or harassed....victimizing their harasser by exposing their breach of the code of conduct.
---
I had this yesterday on PC I just closed game and launcher and a re start worked for me.
---
If i come across a low lvl player with a vendor. I usually buy all their stuff and then give it back too them. And drop some extra items and legends in there for good measure. Best of luck to new players. 
---
My GT: WALRUS PARKOUR. At Xbox. If enyone need armor or weapons I can craft it to you for free.
---
I plan on sitting on them till the sales over and put some on sale but even though they were all 3* the perks just all looked ass.
---
Some servers seemto be bugged and some not. Check enclave bunker before proceeding to the silo.
---
Free.
---
Stealth will still be viable. People are massively overreacting. Like anything, adjustments will need to be made here and there, be it perks and gear as the situation requires.
---
Your forgot to list one
---
\-Playing the game 🙄😒
---
You get more caps and legendary loot
---
Cant w8 for my outfits get stolen from my mannequins
---
Thanks. If you on later it would really help
---
No, you get a good build dumbass. An amazing build will turn even the shittiest weapon in the game into a serviceable one. And even if you have a BE15 laser rifle, if you don’t have the build you will not be able to PvP effectively.
---
Have fun!
---
I played since the beta dude, once you make it past a certain point there's just nothing really left to do. Ignore half the map due to weak mobs, kill the random legendary for awful loot, do the same events over, and over, and over again. Scrip at least gives the end game of trying to attain something interesting, or just allowing you to trade in general.
---
Not a shit investment at all, you don’t need huge amounts of water for it either!
---
Yeah I've seen a few semi-recognisable names over the last week too. That's a good idea right there, think I may have to try that too.
---
Mine reloads at 100 sometimes. Ridiculous
---
Perhaps the bog wanderer mask with mechanics outfit and a machete could be cool. Just wish the bog wanderer mask had the option to change the color to white.
---
What console are you on, do you need anything? I can craft a rifle at your level that should do about 100 damage and ammo for it as well as armour and shit too
---
Bonus from unyielding is so op most will stick to bloodied. It's not like you die often for playing as low health build
---
Wow, you go all out! Top marks, friend
---
That 2 shot faster fire rate must be wild
---
Agreed
---
Tldr would be nice.......I'm good with PC's but not reading all that too much filler......
---
Let me just go max my caps out for the day once again, and then have yet another thing I pretty much can't do due to cap limits. Kill the random legendary mob for garbage loot, or kill the bullet sponge one for the same result
---
I’d settle for making it 160 ffs. Turning in 3 3* and not enough to turn in the 4th fat man I got is maddening.
---
Savage Divide events, and Messenger events (anywhere)
---
It’s a damage change, not a bloodied nerf.
---
Just take your time man. You are just a level 12, we have all been there and trust me, waiting on a loading screen is not a big thing. What are you on? If it’s Xbox, I would be glad to give you some ammo, gear, supplies to make your life easier. Camp location or waiting isn’t a bad thing, soon enough you will see how wonderful most of us in the community are. I wouldn’t even worry about a specific camp location is at this point because TRUST ME, it will be better to change.
---
Think the only way to 'fix' it is to reduce the animations effect it has. It is quite spectacular, but is prob whats causing the problems, particularly with more players in the mix and their effects having to be rendered as well.
---
I miss using mine too.
---
If you're a yank do it when you want, the rest of the world dont give a toss.
---
Bloodied will still do more damage than junkies, what makes you think that will change?
---
I'm only level 12 so I've not invested in perks that improve thirst or hunger yet. I've been going for the damage output so far as the weapons available to me are about as weak as a pensioner's hips 🤣
---
Cool. I'll be on after work today. I'll add you.
---
I can relate to that
---
So you can build ‘anywhere’ - except any of the  marked locations, event locations, anywhere designated a no-camp zone and anywhere where somebody else has already built?
---
I didn't have to log off. I went to the main menu and then back in and it was fine. I couldn't access pipboy.
---
Then make an alt
---
The economy's already suffering for that same reason ironically.
---
How did he give you caps?
---
Welcome to ‘capitalism’.
---
Everything will be staying in its current place for damage. Just with less room between.
---
He told me to sell him a bullet for a 10000 caps
---
shooo. that alone is worth blowing 1000 scrip. great roll. nice one.
---
I'm on Xbox. Currently running around with a hunting rifle, 10mm pistol and combat knife.
---
Take my upvote
---
With legendary Perks you can.
---
The spots I’ve checked in the past still seem to have magazines in the usual places.
---
They will nerf EVERYTHING and bloodied will still be on top.
---
Just to redo everything I already done due to there not being anything left to do in a live service game? No thank you I rather just enjoy what I obtained, and continue to have more to do overall
---
People who play bloodied won't change their build. Atleast not because of the new way damage calculations (nerfs affects ALL damage, not just bloodied) are handled. Bloodied is still way above the rest, even with the changes. And still continues to kill enemies as fast as it ever did. Killing an enemy with 1 or 2 bullets more takes only a fraction of second longer. And with the new legendary ammo perk the increased need for ammo is more than negligible. Also the bonuses from unyielding are too good to pass.
---
EDIT: Anti armor is apparently now so close to junkies in damage that i could see it become more popular prefix. And it also doesn't have the negatives junkies have. Remains to be seen if this will continue to be so in the future or if bethesda does something about it.
---
Doing the side quest is only helpful if you are trying for the backpack skin as it's the only way to get that. While it does heal the friendly animal and get rid of the bots, it also makes the friendly aggressive which can cause the event to fail really easily if it aggros on the alpha. Without doing the side quest it just runs away from everything. You're better off clearing out the robots before starting the event and then if the friendly needs healing you can use friendly fire and a shiskebab.
---
Best drop I got so far is a Hunters Explosive Fire-Rate single action revolver. I've spent 1200 scrip, so far.
---
These hours are not the most active ones with Europe being at work and the US is going to bed, which may lead you to be put in the same server several times. If you have someone on friends list, try joining their server instead. Also, you might be camping in a popular spot, as mentioned by others, which may cause the spot to be taken even when you do find a new server.
---
I can't understand why people keep talking like the damage nerf will only affect bloodied builds... it will affect every single build, isn't hard to understand lol
---
And you are willing to redo all them scrip/gold farming? You are literally asking for an endless grind!
---
Explosive weapons damage. Including all launchers, gauss shotgun and grenades. 
---
Frog legs is only annoying when someone is using a grenade launcher in my opinion.
---
My issue is tracking them. I’m usually good at it, it’s just frustrating when they suddenly gain the power of flight.
---
I nuke people’s camps when they overcharge in their vending machines. Ran into a guy once who was selling 5mm rounds at 10 caps each. Turned his camp into dust. Stood on the rubble dancing while he raged at me. So rewarding.
---
“coding wise i don’t think it would be too hard”
---
LOL.  Said everyone with an idea who isn’t a developer ever.
---
I would suspect there are all kinds of security or storage space issues involved with this one and i’m not in any way aware of the source code behind this project.
---
Frog legs is boring in there and unnecessary to me.
---
Why didn't you log out before the nuke hit?
---
Leveling isn't really the problem for me, it's the lack of stealth perks and silencers at the moment. As soon as I get a shot off I get swamped with ghouls. Hence why I made a farm so that I can constantly heal the damage being done to me. I like that the perks can be swapped in and out, bit the old level system suited my play style a lot more. Also this ghillie suit unlock doesn't seem to help either. Is that purely cosmetic?
---
Lack of more maps
---
The mask itself isn’t, but the plan to make it is.
---
Yeah, I'm running a commando build but don't play atm since I only have played during the challenges (on level 84 BTW)
---
TSE 10mm submachine guns is where it was really at.
---
But I didn’t earn it? Oh wait, I get it 😉
---
Doesn't really matter to me either way I still get to play the game on PS5
---
I was in an internal structure at the time, and since my camp is not in a normal nuke zone, I didn't look to see where the nuke was going until after it dropped.
---
I hear you on all that excess scrip weight..but damn aa exp fixer!sounds like a win for sure!
---
good. had it at rad rumble. sent player a message and he was cool. didn't know, and switched weapons. sent me a message after thnks for heads up. now he understood why people were thumbs downing him at other events.
---
surely after a minute they can realise it's lagging the game.
---
Always check.
---
Ok
---
That's why I keep a gamma gun in my pocket. No need to deactivate pacified mode but can still damage a player.
---
Dude you have so much time before it hits, I’m sorry but this ones on you, if you were afk in a chair somewhere on a public server holding a banjo it’s again on you. If you were in a building looting or whatever, heard the warning and didn’t care to check where it was that’s again on you. Like at anytime during the countdown you simply log out, what’s better is by logging out you just wasted their time and resources. Instead you ignored the endless warnings the game gives you of impending doom, then came to Reddit to cry about something that’s not an issue. Cmon man, do better 👍
---
yeah I looked and couldn't see nowt
---
thats what i do.
---
There's more to achieve however if you're interested in min maxing, resetting doesn't add anything at all. Most live service games end up adding some "endless grind" anyhow
---
Thanks to the sheer number of Damage Reduction perks I have I can just kick in the back door any time I want. It’s just more ammo efficient to sneak.
---
Jeez, I hope not. I always just walk on in to people's camps and have a look around
---
agreed. BUT when you see it's causing lag put the damn thing away. Instead you ruin the event for everyone, yourself included.
---
How do you max if you spent them points respecing before the legendaries dropped?
---
We are going to be weeks into season two and people are still going to be asking when it starts
---
https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs
---
It can be quite a bit of fun...especially solo.
---
Nerf is quite drastic tho. Especially if you were playing as low health sneak rifle/unarmed build. If you were one of those min/maxers, you will be disappointed. Other builds not so much
---
Which one do you use?
---
I've went to the purveyor with 32 luck and 1k scrip and still didn't get anything worth keeping. I call BS.
---
If that's a bug, it's a bug that's been there since the feature was added to the game
---
I lost a ton of ammo to the assaultron head weapon bug way back and support said there was zero they could do to help me.
---
Find the most horrendous "on hold" music and play it through your mic just so they get picture.
---
yes it's not players fault the weapon is breaking the game. 
---
BUT it is their stupid fault to keep using it when you see it''s causing unplayable lag for everyone
---
Yeah, that's the one 😆 Sounds like Henry Ford trying to sell his Model T's way back
---
all i want is better draw distance tbf, but it's not that noticeable unless you're sniping
---
I also have 900+ hours in game, I don’t even think about scrip. Sounds like you just like gambling. What did you do before the purveyor to have fun? Do that.
---
Just please close the door when you head out.
---
Cry me a river this game isnt soposed to be rainbows and butterflies guy
---
I was the same way, trust me. It takes time to adjust and even then it’s a mess having to swap cards in and out. But hopefully soon (patch 22 I think) we will be able to have perk loadouts and the hassle will be negated. Yes, you are going to be taken out by ghouls early on. Soon you will learn the only consequence of dying in 76 is dropping junk that you can retrieve if you want to. You will not lose anything like your guns, armor and such. Just follow the story and try not to let the game upset you.
---
You mean clickbating titles? Which are againts sub rules.
---
Endless grind won't help you get any closer to achieving your goals ever. I suggest you spend more time in trading than actually playing if you are looking to min/max
---
Great for cleaning rooms using 38 ammo as a commando or rifleman. But 12K? Naaah.
---
Use is as way of being an effective killer with cheap rounds. That's all.
---
You're supposed to check people their camps out lol, just close the door when you leave!
---
Be on in aboot 6 1/2 hours. Send me a message on xbone and I'll reply or invite then. Gt is rammadeus
---
If you don't want to check where the nuke's targeted and you don't want to risk a nuke, build in the no-nuke zone.
---
So what, you're expected to stop what you're doing and log out because some jackass wants to grief you? It's a dumb mechanic and shouldn't exist in the game. What if you were doing something time sensitive? Like any one of the boss fights? You're just supposed to take it on the chin and count your losses? No. It's dumb.
---
Explosive breaks the Furious bonus as the splash damage from the explosion resets it!
---
How do you craft legendary weapons? Srd
---
And yes, anything you purchase with IRL money is cosmetic, that is one of the only things that keeps mmo alive, there isn’t a clear way to pay to win but unfortunately that leads the way for dupers and such but whatever. Just take your time and enjoy the game
---
You just picked the worst one out of the 3 to praise. Nice. Two Shot is absolute rubbish.
---
Where is your camp?
---
I didn't say it was a guarantee now did I
---
Some weapons can be crafted using Legendary Modules which will give the weapon 1-3 stars. These are usually the Gold Bullion weapons.
---
Gt is rammadeus. Send me a message on the xbone so I remember
---
Cool. Will do
---
Question is who gets the better drops, the first customer using a cold RNG or the last using a hot RNG. Maybe the middle where the RNG is warm? 
---
Just wondering if the server gets more use (hot) will the drops be better?
---
I just flash the "hello" emote. I have yet to be attacked while wandering into a random camp.
---
Don’t give them anything else to break!
---
Same as the old free jukebox unfortunately
---
You actually get some purifier plans just from the main quest
---
I’ve come to the conclusion that many of you are just slow readers.  And or shop like my wife, looking at all 30 items in the vending machine.  I admit it’s hard for me to patient sometimes but I usually am cool.  It does blow my mind how long it takes some of you to go through a machine.  If you tie up a machine for longer than I have patience for at the moment I just move on.
---
I got a junkies compound bow and a junkies 10mm pistol that was an upgrade. 
---
Lots of bows this time around.
---
I did get an anti armor 25ffr 25 less vats .44 that was cool. Kind of an upgraded somerset special.
---
Do you know what they all are?
---
For your first point, I’m personally not hoarding food and waiting for someone to launch a nuke or start Encryptid.  I farm strong food to do the event.  It doesn’t sit around long enough to need Good With Salt.  Do Encryptid, do SBQ, do ACP, repeat until empty.  I don’t even bother with Cranberry Relish.  I have 8 gourds at home, so I make it in batches of four.  It won’t go bad in that time.
---
I agree that many bloody builds are poorly designed for defense.  I think it’s because a lot of players are just willing to copy a build without really thinking about the choices made or doing their own research.  V94 taught me the value of survivability and varied defense, so I wear two legendary poison resist effects, and I’m using Fireproof until the Legendary fire resistance perk is available.  I also use Blocker, Dodgy and Serendipity, just in case.  I don’t use Gun Fu, so Dodgy takes the place of that.  I switch between a dense torso normally, or asbestos lining for fighting Earle.
---
Survivability is there if you build well, leave weight reduction cards out and know the ins and outs of the game.  High HP is an interesting solution, but I feel confident that stacking percentage based defensive cards and Quantum/Cola Nut are less expensive perk wise and outperform raw HP.
---
I don’t discourage you, because I figured out what worked for getting the most out of my perk choices on my own.  You might find something unique or interesting that hasn’t been discovered by the overall player base yet.  Who knows?  We need more players willing to experiment and figure things out on their own.  Followers don’t innovate or educate themselves.
---
It would be cool if you could teleport to a type of North Pole. A bad effect could be seeing evil elves in random places that attack. Or everyone turns into evil elves with red eyes for five minutes or so.
---
That's what I plan in doing. I'm going to get the ammo legendary perk and then shore up my weak attributes with the SPECIAL legendary perks. Maybe the poison resist legendary. The other legendary perks just don't seem worth it.
---
I’m new to FO76 (just started Sunday),  What is scrip?
---
I agree! It sure would save the nuke cards!
---
Well they wasn’t there when I first walked in I was just checking things out and something started attacking me so I turned the camera around and there they were
---
Got you! Was wondering how he managed it.
---
There’s three like at foundation. Ae-Ri is inside the raised station chunk up the stairs after you enter. She’s the sunny equivalent that has the bow plans. There’s a dude standing outside the one shack straight in from the spawn point. He’s got a clipboard. He’s Sunny in the smaller section of trailer. The last one isa chick by the stage with the instruments behind the bar. She’s the food Sunny. 
---
The other guy is talking about Samuel at foundations equivalent. They’re the bullion vendors.
---
If you like your camps close together the dry lake bed near new gad is good. It's flat and it's centrally located.
---
Haaaa you got me there lol
---
I’m just looking forward to having something to do daily again like the new ops and that BoS bunker is perfect for my BoS themed CAMP. I’m mostly excited for the legendaries perks. I grinded to level 300 during this season and have so many duplicate perk cards I just want to clear up so I don’t have to scroll through so many just to switch things out.
---
I've now managed to get in and have it still placed. I'm along the river, halfway between Morgantown and the route 89 marker to the south of town. No doubt that'll change again tho when I log out and have some lunch shortly.
---
This would rather make it poor's man bloodied or pseudo bloodied, which deals same  damage (if we use your suggestion) but being ess tanky than bloodied. Definitely not bloodied 2.
---
It’s like Black Friday.
---
Nah, only thing left in this game that even remotely gives a raider sorta feeling. Pick the locks of someones camp, pick the lock on their ammo maker, loot it and then go wait until someone comes to kill you for the 5 caps. Good price for the ammo you just got. Potentially.
---
That said, i very rarely do this :D If ever. Main thing i'm trying to say is.. You do you. Play how you like. If you are not abusing bugs, cheating, exploiting, breaking the rules of the game etc then it's all good.
---
Nah. They can reuse Fallout 3 assets for those of us who played it for a bit of nostalgia!
---
I have 26 lol
---
It's a PVP mechanic that still somehow exists in a non-pvp game mode. It just doesn't make sense to be there.
---
I'm clearing out all the responder stuff around the airport at the moment. Seems like a responder kind of reward, or at least I hope so.
---
Level up, and have quests to do. Too high a level for it to matter anymore, and quests are nonexistent now besides the same events. I wish more meaningful content was added at a faster pace but that's impossible especially now, gambling mechanics are so commonplace in live service that it's expected that the end game is about grinding.
---
The hackers in the pc version, it's fine on console.
---
Ps4?  I m selling one for 5k caps
---
Lol I can’t do that to people especially with how I’m struggling to get resources so I can imagine how bad it would suck to have someone do that to you I mean more power to you if you can do it I just can’t which is weird bc I always go the evil route in the single player fallout games
---
This isn't entirely true. When broken, you lose your rad resistance to water. Outside of water, it's fine. I run berserker with a busted stealth armor, you'd think it's not bad but the convenience of swimming/walking across water is great, It saves so much time. Gotta opt for the long route though.
---
The hackers aren’t around at the moment, but yeah. I don’t get how it hasn’t been taken care of yet.
---
The game is designed for people to be nosy. That's what you're supposed to do.
---
That's also the reason why you can't just browse somebody's vendor inventory from the map screen (even though it would be trivial for them to implement this). Bethesda *wants* you to go to each camp in person, so you can see all the atom shop stuff they've purchased, and see all the creative things they've done with that stuff, (y'know, so hopefully you'll be persuaded to purchase something from there yourself).
---
You've got to have top tier stuff to trade nowadays it feels like.
---
Why are so many people overeacting like this? From what we know as of now, the damage nerf will be negligeable and it will affect everything, just slightly bridging the gap between builds and prefixes. Stop freaking out like that, we're gonna try it for ourselves shortly and we will be able to draw our conclusions.
---
Yeah, sneak only really shines when you need to DPS a lot, or when being aggroed is dangerous (mostly to bloodied builds) e.g. at Earle
---
From what I heard its the same accounts doing it, cheating in the normal mode gets you banned, even being gifted cheated things, but cheating in the competitive mode is perfectly allowed it seems.
---
Guy dropped me around 30 2 stars yesterday. People selling 3 stars for 25caps. Gotta love a sale.
---
Gamer tag? I will come shopping
---
Well that’s what I thought I just wanted to make sure  lol
---
Eso is getting a next gen upgrade, the best we can hope for is backwards compatability!
---
Yeah, that's the plan. I have a Quad Explosive 10mm Pistol I would love to make viable. Tuesday can't come soon enough
---
Why not just start again on a second character slot and have both?  You can play whatever style you’re in the mood for and not waste all those perk cards you’ll desperately miss in a couple days.
---
You scrap legendary weapons/armor for a currency to buy legendary weapons/armor.
---
And you’re recommending insanity why would you do the exact same thing you did for 100 hours. this games been out for 2 years and the lack of content is sad
---
I stand there, empty 30 rounds into his head, chug a Nuka Orange or Quantum while I’m reloading and mag dump him again. 9/10 I can tank his flaming spit. Where I shoot from, he can’t melee or stomp on me.
---
Don't down vote the man because he's right!
---
Oh I get your point right now. I thought your suggestion had problem with that but after you explained the problem I don't see issue in your or my suggestion since jetpack would be it's own item (not tied to torso mod).
---
\[Grass\]
---
bAllowCreateGrass=0  
---
Add this to your Fallout76Custom.cfg (or create one) inside your documents/mygames/fallout76 folder and all Grass is gone, nice side effect is a gain of 10-20fps depending on which area you are.  
---
I wouldn't wait for a fix for anything, since it could take forever.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that lol. So many nerfs have left me disoriented  😅
---
Oh!  I guess I’m far from that - the best weapon I’ve found is a shotgun!  Do you by any chance know what the stars mean (on the gun stats)?
---
Why? He talks to himself so much that it leaves very little to be said.
---
You can always do something else with your life lol
---
My 2* TSE Handmade was my first good weapon way back when I was below level 100.  A level 200 gave it to me!  I used and loved gun for a long time.  Yeah, I was sleeping with it.  It’s still in inventory and use it every now and then when I want to spray and pray.  I still say the nerf was too much making it worthless.  Mine is named Garage, Inc.
---
The main reason for my camp is to show it off and collect all the thumbs up and hearts. Heck on my pirate ship I build viewing platforms so you can take lots of pictures.
---
The only advice I can give for It's a Trap is this: wait and look around to see where the scorchbeast might be. It often spawns far away and engages in battle with other stuff. When you locate it, don't kill it, because it won't count. You have to patiently lure it in range, wait for the quest marker to change and then kill it. When in the Mire, it usually spawns down the cliff, so it may take some effort to lure it.
---
And the nerfs are only going to get worse! Rifleman, pistol and melee are just unusable in the PTS and soon the upcoming patch.
---
Nah. There always are people offering top tier stuff for some very specific rolled mid tier stuff
---
Well, it's only a 0.15% drop chance. So yeah, this'll probably take a while longer, yet.
---
yeah true..they get close tho
---
I found a camp once that had all the doors locked open
---
I will never understand some people
---
nah, sounds like you ran in an asshole. if there is a unlocked door, go in. i also see unlocked water purifiers and collectrons as gifts. if someone dont want you to see his camp, he can build it in a closed structure and lock the door.
---
Out of ten times doing it’s a trap only once did I get it to complete. I have seen it show up down near watoga lately and the scorchbeast will goto the rail car thing down near lost home. If you shoot it it will come over. I got it to finish that once with a 3 star legendary scorch. This week it did same thing but I guess it thought it killed it before it got close enough. Idk I want to finish event being you have chance at rare drops but it’s such a buggy mess
---
oh. Beautiful roll. i am so envious. NIce one!!!
---
Long barrel, Skeet shooter. Rename your gun 'The Destroyer"
---
What the hell in todd Howard are you talking about??? Fallout 76 JUST WORKS! You must have a corrupted game reinstall it and you will be right as rain. 
---
;)
---
I am way more convinced that people will change from Junkies to AA than from bloodied to Junkies. Bloodied will still do more damage than junkies, but the change makes AA do the same damage as Junkies without the addictions.
---
I wear a high quality headset with the voice volume turned all the way up and the first time I heard this it scared the shit out of me.
---
Conversely, I had a level 30 pistol whipping me throughout my  brief purveyor  transaction yesterday.
---
I’ll pick them all up, then start dropping all of my known plans. I don’t see the point in trying to sell most of them.
---
non pvp game mode? where? since when? we are still able to practice pvp, heck even the pvp radio is still there and what about the Assassin effect? just because you are afright of pvp doesn't mean everyone is.
---
Key words being "very specific"
---
whaat? dble barrel is useless?? your opinion is useless
---
That sir/madam, is no man.
---
Fear it.
---
Humm I've just had a radio announcement that a nuclear bomb is going to fall from the sky, and I've got a few minutes to see where it's going to land 
---
I know I'll just ignore it
---
I miss the days of 2000 cap bounty super raiders roaming around
---
What if we had to fight a thunder bird?!?! And then cook that as well?!!!
---
Like...if we fought a thunder bird then for a big event (should be easy to complete), we defend it, much like when we defend Brahmin like in "free range". We defend the thunderbird from "X" location to Graham's cookout location!!!
---
They're legendary perks on the weapon, when you inspect the weapon it'll let you know which perks are on that weapon.
---
The builds most affected in practice, as opposed to on paper, are those that rely on one-shotting, not those that run low-health. Unarmed melee is probably still viable, but you may want to get in the habit of power attacking. Sneak riflemen of all persuasions are going to have a rough time, though.
---
how about go playing my little pony? seems you are not suited for a wasteland full of psychopathic vault dweller...
---
I just wish that they were also doubling or even tripling the amount of scrip you can get a day too. Ive already gotten 20 weapons (3 good ones so I'm not entirely bothered) but I feel like this would have been a perfect chance to lower stash inventory and make everyone happier in general
---
The amount of time to start a match. Once the lobby is full there is no reason why we should still wait 2+ minutes for it to countdown.
---
So then I guess I do have a couple. Maybe I’ll be ranked high enough to use them someday!  Ha!
---
There's actually a couple of nice weapons in there. 
---
I did 50 rolls on a couple of different characters and got NOTHING even close to this. I would have been happy with some of what you turned up.  
---
I rolled 3 &gt;3!!!!!!!&lt;  ghoul slayers gamma guns.
---
I use pa and mini gun n not once done this so it’s not all of us
---
It's part of the game, you have to adjust.
---
Might’ve had them locked but then a teammate opened them or an ally. I’ve found Daguerre in some weird spots.
---
Glad to hear you have some, you'll reach the level needed to use them in no time. Good luck!
---
Looking forward to the greenhouse set, but not the grind.
---
hackers and bugs, especially the aim-bug when entering a 1v1.
---
every weapon has it's counterpart, explosive isn't a harm anymore when you have someone with a combat shotgun/melee rushing them close combat. 
---
goat legs have to recharge, if someone jump nuts just take cover and wait till he jumped 3-4 times... then rush and enjoy your free kill since he wants to jump but can't.
---
Same
---
4-man premades lvl 200+
---
Thank you for the advice.
---
Just a heads up, as soon as you use a full set of unyielding armor, adamantium skeleton becomes obsolete. I cant remember ever getting crippled.
---
Don’t let the door hit you on the way out!! Shit, i wish it hit everyone’s in fallout cause I hate having my door left open lol
---
Yet another thing I love about this game. In GTA you try and queue politely for the Casino wheel and all you'll get is everyone else budging in front of you trying to get it the moment the person spinning it finishes. Fallout 76 though? I've never had that problem, even at player vendors you'll have a polite little line.
---
I’ve just come to accept it now.
---
Yea just move away from the river for a bit. At level 11/12 though you probably don’t have a super sophisticated camp. I would just bring it with you. It’s supposed to be mobile after all. Place it down when you need it.
---
Yeah I’m trying to get the rare drops too, Oh boy I just got the audio bug, I feel as if I’m cursed ha ha
---
Apparently we are playing different games. I am able to have fun without just grinding legendaries over and over again. Oh well...
---
20 sec to go through your unopened perk cards and revise your load out, just, why?
---
Wait....the food thing has other items in it? I thought that was just for the piece of pie....
---
Good for you, glad to see someone's having fun at least.
---
Eh. Definitely pistols, not so much rifle and melee IMO. I keep an AAE+1P Lever Action handy and it will kill all lower level enemies in one or two shots. And stealth melee builds are still really good. I was playing with a level 60 something the other day, he wanted help on a silo run. So we get down there, I’m decked out in PA with my 25FFR Gatling laser, he’s got a Chinese stealth suit and an assaultron blade. Full health, so he may have started the groundwork for a Junkie’s build. This kid was doing WAY more damage than me. I mean it takes me about 10-15 seconds to kill a level Colonel Gutsy but this guy was sneaking up and getting them in only 4-5 hits!
---
Oh no i have been crippled a couple time on my Bloodied heavy gunner. Well i grind xp outside my power armor for the extra intelligence given by a full Unyielding armor set....I confirm you, it can go terrible wrong lol. But thank you.
---
Not true, I went in with only Unyielding armor and only Bloodied weapons in my inventory rolling 1000 scrpit for a good melee weapon and got the usual crap nocturnal rolling pin, zealots pitch fork etc...
---
but you do have marsupial correct? so the fall dmg will be lowered anyway
---
Mmm yes, should be some sort of level matching system, but that’s asking for for too much for sight
---
Is it just me or playstation players going oddly out of their way to specify they are going to buy the PS5 lately? I've seen a lot of replies in the last couple days where people kind of shoe horn "PS5" into their comment. 
---
Just in case someone wants to take this wrong I am not claiming anything is wrong with your choice in console. They'll both be awesome.
---
I have two bloodied builds. One stealth commando and one PA/heavy guns/unarmed/melee. I find the Strength build to be much more fun to play, largely because you have so many different ways to go about playing with one character.
---
You really need to manage your inventory a lot better, I would have slaughtered you as well in that situation. I however woildbhave not returned any junk. You should feel very lucky indeed that he gave you anything back.
---
If you really can't manage to balance your junk levels then maybe get fallout 1st for a month and spend that time farming materials. Cancel after a month and you can have access to all the stuff you put into the scrap box. You just can't put anymore in.
---
Don't carry your junk on you. Always have pacifist on. It's part of the game
---
If I wasn’t, I would play something else
---
Not easy to code at all. Textures are in your client’s files. Those won’t be in your files.
---
Wish something like that happened to me, ran out of ultracite cores weeks ago.
---
I would do a nuke to get the violet flux but I'd feel like an asshat wasting a nuke that wasn't centered on the ACP or SBQ so I havnt
---
I said it helps, not that it's guaranteed, I have had way better luck since I switched but hey I suppose that's what it's like going to see mumbles
---
Nice work indeed :)
---
For a “story” reason, handmades are hand made and after 200 years they got better at building them. There’s your retcon, George Lucas eat your heart out. 
---
According to Beth we are also all left handed...
---
Personally I play in passive mode all the time. I’m level 52 and I’ve not yet encountered any issue with it. I’m sure there are certain pvp aspects I’m mission out on but the experience so far without it has been just fine. With that being said since claiming a workshop makes you vulnerable to pvp situations you should have dropped off all your junk at your stash before going and claiming the workshop. Problem fixed.
---
Hence what i've ended doing after barely staying on for 20 minutes after I get my daily stuff done.
---
Rockstar- no undead nightmare
---
Cod- no zombies mobile
---
Bethesda- sleeps on every holiday and only has events to get daily login
---
O for sure. It was nice to have an explosive combat weapon back again. I borrowed a friends gun till I out ranked it. Then a two shot handmade.
---
Wonder if the change to the TOS will mean anything.
---
Or a solo mode. That’d be nice.
---
Just more people getting punished for innocent things and the real bastards getting away with everything.
---
I locked daguerre in the generator room which is a 2x1 room with a fusion generator and daguerre no doors
---
I really want to see $69.69 on every Slocum Joe's pricetag.
---
HELLL YEAAAAAA!!!!
---
Were you wanted by chance?
---
Or maybe they were trying to get your attention to give you stuff
---
It's the least I can do. The very same thing have happened to me. And I'm gladly willing to return the favor to others.
---
I don’t bother with doors. They all look ugly. Check out my camp on PC ‘Fallen Water’ north of overseers home.
---
Someone else came in and used the machine as a storage dump, just leaving something for the next person to find. That is one hell of a nice gift also.
---
I will do. When i get off work later today:).
---
You forgot nocturnal and stalker melee, didn’t you?
---
Might have to jail her then.
---
Don't claim workshops if you don't want to pvp. It's really fucking simple and stops the game to warn you before doing so.
---
It’s a nuke dude. I’m not going to move my nuke because you are in the way. You get a warning. Move.
---
I feel like being next to a fusion gen is worse than jail lol. Just imagine what would happen to her if it were to “accidentally” blow up
---
hope so, had to move to PC cus of low fps. Not giving up on my console toon tho cus i’ve got so much stuff on him.
---
I’m pretty sure it classifies as an auto pistol, which has it it’s own perks called Guerilla
---
I did not know that...guess I should play some hide and seek. Do the items disappear when you log out like your dropped items
---
Poison resist, based on what I've been told, is overkill after lvl 1. So I'd take it but not level it
---
Tried some different pistols and rifles builds.  Just ended up missing being a melee though.
---
Well you need 300 perk card coins to max 1 card (+5 to a special)
---
So far I have a building with a bed and all crafting and stash stuff in, a vendor hut, a 5x3 fenced in crop farm, a bridge over the river, a massive purifier, a generator shed for the purifier and a separate hut for the brewer and fermenter. Creating settlements might possibly have been one of my favourite pastimes in FO4.
---
I've got the perk for 80% less thirst and hunger in workshops, so may have to just leave the game logged in while I eat and hope nothing comes by
---
Add me Sinistrmark on PSN.  I have a private server.  If you ever need to claim a workshop just message me and we can play on my private.  I have never attacked anybody at a workshop.  And wont.
---
You have to shake your controller or keyboard before the transaction to increase your chances.
---
Sounds like 2020.
---
No I’ve been playing a good guy in 76 idk they never dropped anything and they chased me away but once I got far enough away from the house they stopped hitting me
---
I probably got 1 of the best heavy guns yesterday from the purveyor, I got a 2 shot explosive gatling gun with +250 damage resistance while reloading.
---
Ah well, was worth a shot.  Asked b/c I have a BE heavy weapon I don't need (I play high health melee).
---
How the heck have you don’t BIVs quest already and only level 12? Lol
---
I’m not being rude, did you follow a guide or just happen to stumble upon it?
---
And that was my initial point, respecing now eats those points/coins and you can't upgrade the legendary perks.
---
Yes, and there's like hundreds of these 'collectors' out there. Each have there own preferences and there's no telling you have something they will pay very nicely for
---
Manypeople who spend the time and effort making their bases look great want you to look around.
---
It's a terrible event. In 1,000+ hours I've only done it once, at high level, just to have done it at least once.
---
I said wild not good. I'm well aware of how effects work in this game.
---
Is that Elizabeth from Bioshock in the back there? :)
---
More like 1200 caps amigo. Nobody, and I mean nobody, is paying 12k for a pipe weapon, no matter what rolls you get on it.
---
I got a bloodied sub machine gun. Also psyched.
---
By 9 damage... gg so good. Rather have vampire thx
---
i just wonder about the one wasteland and if bloodied builds are gonna die more.
---
I found a Nuka quantum and kept it on me, as they were rare as shit in the older games. Hardest part was getting teleported away to the far right of the map and getting done over by a miralurk hunter straight away. Fast travel back to base and walk up the road 😁 I'm not going back for my gear I dropped tho
---
I don't get why the change is so hard to understand. The change is proportional so very little if anything changes with meta ranking of builds. Junkies won't suddenly jump ahead of bloodied.
---
Silly me replying in the wrong spot again.
---
Well, if that's what the lore say sure but these are litally all AKs. Maybe those raiders came up with a blueprint somewhere and built it for themselves. Bet there's no telling if some of these factory grade AKs still lying around somewhere in Appalachia. Ah imma  get to the point. I want a proper AK goddamn it
---
The problem is the machine’s limit is too low. 3 of those weapons and you’re done for the day within 10 seconds
---
Actually yes, you are, that’s exactly what’s supposed to happen and is inherent in the risk vs reward loop of his game. The threat of having your base nuked is like 5% chance at any given time, honestly I’ve never been targeted directly and I’d imagine there’s a bit to this storywe don’t even know but I mean it’s Reddit so of course it was a mean completely random act lol, like maybe someone was one shotting legendaries in an event and not sharing the wealth etc, or maybe the guy was truly just being a grief but either way yea, takes 10 seconds to relog to another server and whatever super duper important time sensitive thing you could be doing can be done again, unless you don’t mind losing your camp. Also, there’s always Fallout 1st if playing on public servers and dealing with their risks aren’t for you
---
I kinda figured but wanted to make sure I wasn’t being rude lol
---
No. Items stay in 'containers'
---
Yes. But i server hopped The Enclave bunker and I found the word wall in progress. So I ran Silo b and the new code worked. So I'm just going to stick with that Silo for the week. But yes server hop until you find a word wall that says in progress or complete.
---
Nope.  That why I use something like luggage at train stations to dump things I don’t want/need.  A lot of people do it.  Always check them when selling off at the vendor.  It’s usually plans or ammo, but occasionally something else like stims, meds, and other things if someone needs to dump weight.
---
Why? It's your effort in the cilo. Just drop it where you want
---
And if they are there when you were looking around give them the thumbs up or ❤️. It makes them feel good.
---
A little  while back I came across a duper stashing his stuff there needlessly to say I took 1 of each thing for myself
---
Can you think of any other single location that has hundreds of easily gathered items like the Summersville book shop?
---
Its completely fine. I even routinely break into people's home through the windows if their doors are locked to check them out. Bonus if they come home meanwhile, and find me sitting on their couch in the creepy mascot outfit or a straight jacket + faschnact mask, staring at them, or sleeping in their beds.
---
Wait, do dropped items disappear when you log out??
---
I knew items in containers stayed, I just didn't realise a bag o-loot would disappear.
---
*Holy fuck. And I thought my day wasn’t going so well...*
---
I would suggest building near an unmarked location that reliably spawns some enemies. 
---
My camp location is to me the best spot on the map because it spawns 6 high level super mutants constantly.  That's tons of bullets, steel, aid etc.
---
Good to know. I am always dropping stuff. I need todo an inventory purge this weekend...way to much gear and junk ill never use.
---
What a wuss. My character can bench 440lbs!
---
I have in the past dropped nukes in odd places for infinite ultracite spawn farming.  Now it’s better because I can drop on apc and still find one.
---
But like ashamesleadership mentions, it’s your nuke, drop it for what you need.  If I see someone drop a nuke that isn’t acp, sbq, white... I’m not disappointed.  I just use that opportunity to farm mats.
---
Wish she could grant me some wholesome drops tho. I have 10 3* weapons worth shit to nothin.
---
I think it does. When the player logs out their loot bag goes as well...was playing with a guy who dropped stuff for me...he logged out and his loot bag disapeared aswwell
---
And do Tadpole. Possum again and raider settler reputation. (Ok raider can be maxxed in 20minutes
---
OMG! I build for other people! In fact if I don't see you exploring every nook and cranny, I will be offended, I tell you! OFFENDED! Please, by god, explore camps! Those jerks were total a-holes!
---
He don't sound psyched at all.
---
I got a be fixer yesterday:)
---
So the solution is to either log out in the middle of a play session to avoid a dumb mechanic, or pay $12/month to avoid a dumb mechanic. Can you not see how this is nonsensical and should be removed from the game?  I mean, camps are already protected from other forms of player damage, so I don't get why this is a thing.
---
This is the internet, so you don't have to believe me, but I'll go ahead and say it: to my knowledge, I did nothing to provoke this guy.
---
I had. To just move my camp so I would stop(it a was an accidental camp move)
---
That sucks what kind of build are you cause I had almost max scrip and got at least 1 of any kind of build weapon other then melee cause I just needed ranged weapons, and if ur on ps4 I can drop some for u if u would like.
---
True but I'd feel like people are expecting either one of these when they see someone in a silo.
---
I know I can pretty much land a nuke anywhere I wish to but feel obligated by the whole community on the world not to waste a chance for them
---
Yeah, any spawn will probably stop/replace other spawns, but next week those bloatflies are going to be a lot beefier! Level 50, probably.
---
Que?
---
Are you saying that bloodied/low health builds aren't affected the most by the new damage calculations?  Nobody said it wouldn't still be best, just that it was hit especially hard.  And AA is still not better than bloodied against Earle.
---
I've got a PA heavy level 300 a stealth commando level 210 and I'm doing a pistol/ pipe revolver build that's level 28 right now. 3 totally different play styles. My level 300 spent most of his life as a 2 handed melee and I switched to heavy guns st about level 250.
---
Glad to see most of them wearing masks.
---
No, I mean beth milking us for an experience indie companies can do better than.
---
Yes
---
Good thing I don't have a door
---
Well shit!!!
---
I have only been playing for about two months (and play solo 95% of the time), and didn't realize this. Thank you for mentioning it, I will change tactics for dropping random loot for people.
---
Not when it's already a Wastelanders reward called "Final Word".
---
I’ve got the secret fireplace door behind my door so it completes the aesthetic of the room but it’s twice the effort to see it lol.
---
Why would they die more? I have no issue surviving almost anything while maintaining 25 hp. Stealth is my best friend. It really doesn't matter if the mob dies in 1 shot vs 2-3, they still die in 1-2 sec. I just have to go through more ammo.
---
when you die its not your junk anymore..
---
Correct, but AA and TS get proportionally better because they are not hit by the change.
---
It might have been justified, but this wasn't a thread to talk about the merits or lack thereof of bloodied builds.  I was responding to a thread about TSE and somehow you bloodied haters took offense to my stating that bloodied builds are getting hit "Especially hard" which is fact.
---
‘WARNING: BY CLAIMING THIS WORKSHOP, OTHER PLAYERS MAY INITIATE PVP. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO CLAIM THIS WORKSHOP?’
---
Nah, if you have an instigating version it currently gives the buff to all 4 bullets- hour suggestion would take that away
---
I’ll take your word for it, and I’m not saying the guy was being a stand up dude when he did what he did, but with 5 minutes of warning time you have to realize it’s not an issue. Is it a weird mechanic? Yeap! Is it a holdover from when the game was more PVP and griefer apologetic? Yeap! Is it REALLY an issue considering there’s a giant red circle on the map and it tells everyone on the server regardless of their location or level or proximity to the spot? Nah. I mean I get it, it sucks, but at the same time this entire game is looting junk and building and or grinding for better weapons to loot junk, time to do what the devs intended and loot some junk lol.
---
Yeah, if his spit is fiery like the falling embers I think Asbestos Lining also negates this. Wendigos are less bothersome using sneak though. But yeah, the best part is 50+ % ammo conservation when doing double damage
---
Demolition expert is still in the game, or do you mean something else?  Fallout 4 it increased the radius at level 3.
---
Yes my TS gauss mini melts Earle faster than bloodied and junkies.
---
Damn look at all those pixels! Stupid xbox
---
It was fixed for a long time but came back with wastelanders.
---
IDK if excited is the word I'd use but I sure as hell need something to do until cyberpunk comes out
---
No, still better deal at full price than legendaries at 50%.
---
Hola Coco.
---
  Take workshops for the XP, plans, and to meet the challenge, but then get out of dodge.  (hit the claim button and head to the green line.  As soon as the capture completes, step over the line (thus you are out of the zone.)
---
  As you are likely aware, most of the mats you get from workshops can be found in the wild faster than a workshop can produce them.  
---
The craft ammo challenge can be done at any tinker bench.
---
build up a workshop or camp - "Or" is the operative.  Whatever the requirement, it can be done at your own camp.
---
OP is looking for a novice player like them to answer questions and maybe play together.
---
My spanish is incredibly rusty, so I'm not entirely sure.
---
Thanks for the heads up. I'll look up what angryturtle has to say about it. He does pretty good at testing things in a realistic way.
---
Why?
---
Remember you also need to be standing up and spinning in a counter clockwise direction to complete the ritual for good RNG
---
Take a look at Angry Turtle's videos (4 in all on the testing he did around the perks). It helped me  decide. [Here](https://youtu.be/1WWJkr2Nono) is the 1st video.
---
There's plenty of violet flux around the SBQ area though.
---
They are also level 20
---
Yeah, made a return with Wastelanders. Seen a lot of those lately and from what I can tell it only seems to happen when you die while in PA.
---
When Lifegiver was a thing, I ran 9 End.  I was virtually unkillable.
---
Haga sus preguntas aquí en inglés y luego todo estará bien.
---
Useful drops have way lower chance than garbage. Think the nocturnal and pistols as weathered asylum uniform, bloodied and handmades are the red uniform, and you’ll understand why. And during ‘sales’ the chance to get useful items is further lowered. It’s a scrip drain instead of a way to give us good deals.
---
I know some of those words!! Four years of high school Spanish is sorta paying off
---
Are you familiar with the concept of other languages?
---
And then there are console players... who cant just edit the files
---
Nice.a tse got me through almost 100 levels.im working on a new character lvl 21 and that xp grind is slow.might need to do the story mode
---
Yes, that's who I got my info from, I'm on console
---
So bosses are the only ones that need more than a single shot from a pipe pistol?
---
More stable frame rates would be welcome. Seeing as ESO is getting an upgrade I'd hope that 76 does at some point
---
Nah, dont, guarantee there are others wishing for a nuke to land somewhere else for the same reason you are.
---
So drop it and put up a party for anyone in the area \o/
---
I miss mods, the big places to build, and the high limits.
---
I would just keep checking out other camps and if shots are fired just leave nothing bad should happen as long as you don't shoot back.
---
"I'm not fallout 1st so I carry everything I own with the pack rat perk card."
---
Sorry that happened to you, but this is a big ol' nope.
---
You can always server hop.
---
Lmao I got a few snapshots of exactly that thing during feed the people...little limbs holding up a explosive plasma Gatlin..how do I post pics on here?
---
Could have been duped cores; last time I was around Charleston I popped into the train yard filled with liberators, every container in the building were each filled with 50+ fusion cores of varying charges, probably 1000 in the building total.
---
Didnt grab any despite using PA and a gatling laser cause that just ***screamed*** "dupesRus"
---
This. ALWAYS.
---
There’s no point in selling most plans because every one will get them for doing basic events. I try to sell all my plans for between 20 caps and 50 depending on if it’s a camp item or a weapon or armpit item but even then that’s hard to do because everyone has them. A lot of people will have a hundred or so plans for sale and if you look it’s like 8 of the same plans and that’s for good reason. I’m thinking about just dropping all my plans for sale to make vendor space.
---
When I read the title, I absolutely thought you were talking about a Biv recipe.
---
To be honest i'm happy if someone stop at my home to say hello :)
---
Nice,  is not so rusty,  because you get the idea right. (Im from South America, the real wasteland jajaja)
---
Not sure if it'll get patched next week but if you haven't noticed you can launch the first nuke on acp and as long as that nuke zone is still there you can launch the others literally anywhere to start the event again!
---
In 1200 hours I’ve only been attacked at a camp twice. Both times I razed it to the ground. Their fault for shooting at me in their camp.
---
I've only barely started playing bloodied commando but I'm really pining for the straightforwardness and flexibility of STR builds. Heavy guns, melee, and shotguns? Thanks! Not having to rely on janky stealth mechanics? Nice!
---
Only thing keeping me commando is I love VATS and being a cold-blooded killing machine
---
Really wish they'd revamp gunslinger.
---
The fact that it’s part of the seasonal reward grind. Ten minutes to get into a lobby so I can pick 3 locks that I’ll likely a) not find, b) get merced while trying to find c) get merced while picking. Or the ones where you absolutely have to kill another player. I’ll openly admit I’m not the greatest at NW.
---
Have you used one on her?direct shots do like at least 100 if it ultracite. I've seen it do over 300 per shoy
---
This seems to be the case with more than a few cards. I feel like the perk cards and ammo are the only ones I'm going to dump coins into.
---
I use imgur since they dont allow direct image uploads. Just get the url from imgur and post it in a text upload
---
If you get to play as a couple often I’d space out the camps to take advantage of fast travel prices in teams like one at crater the other at foundation or something along those lines
---
Oof, dang
---
I quit permanently because of the stupid shotgun over nerd lol
---
&gt;  I didn't look to see where the nuke was going until after it dropped.
---
full stop
---
Follow Through and Taking One for the Team are worth the levels. 10% to 40% bonus damage for everyone on the server attacking the target affected
---
Ok.when I get home I'll post it here.. got some good snaps in.just looks off big time
---
Wow, learn Spanish in high school? Nice!!! 
---
Wasteland = Yermo
---
Vault = Refugio
---
Radroach = cuchara radioactiva.
---
Power Armor = Servo Armadura. 
---
Brotherhood of Steel = Hermandad de Acero
---
Raiders = Saqueadores / Bandidos
---
hahahaah ohhhh wonderful :) :)
---
This is on you. You get lots of warning. Your two best options are build in the Forrest area that can not be nuked or log out when you see a nuke coming. Thats it. Its a great and fun feature and before you ask, yes Ive been on both sides of it and still enjoy it.
---
I was wondering about this. Thanks.
---
I’ve probably done 1000 pulls from Ms. Mumbles and today I hit the proverbial jackpot.
---
I did a total of 6 but these 3 came in a row- Furious Explosive Pipe Rifle, Junkies 50 Cal with 15% reload speed and Bloodied Handmade with 25% VATS.  I modified all of them and come pay me a visit at my vendor if you are interested.
---
I agree! A small little pool that is farmable would be great for tarberries. I think if they are giving us a greenhouse in the next Legendary run, we should get more options.
---
Frog legs needs to fucking go. It’s ridiculous that you need to have 9 agility to have it in the first place when you can’t have your own NW loadout. Then there’s the fact it’s near impossible to successfully aim at it. This is why people use VATS in adventure mode PvP when they can. Combine that with the kangaroo aiming down at you with explosives and/or a commando/heavy gun you’re fucked.
---
You really cant be carrying all your junk around with you for situations just like this.
---
What on earth are you hoarding that you cant fit in your stash box??
---
You have my sympathy but it's time to bulk up your junk and be brutal with getting rid of stuff.
---
Aid weighs alot in storage, but if you carry it you wont lose it if you die. It might be an idea to store your junk in stash, swap out pack rat for the perk that makes your aid lighter and carry your aid with you. 
---
It might be an idea to make a list of what junk you specifically use more of.
---
Lead? Steel? Aluminium?
---
Less useful are glass, cloth, fibre glass. Also those things are very easy to get hold of at whitesprings should you need them.
---
See, and I thought make your own fun was the real goal.
---
He was probably farming for flux , I think the wavy waters one is cobalt
---
did not know, thanks for the info
---
traduction: i'm looking for novice players that want to play with me or maybe a high level player that can guide me/us through the game and answear some questions.
---
 I posted it in spanish because i feel more confortable playing and speacking with spanish people because i dont have a super high level of english
---
sorry for my english btw
---
If i have to buy a new copy, i don't care.
---
This.  A heart or thumbs up is exactly why I make my home look nice.  I leave everything unlocked for visitors, including resource objects.
---
My nukacola machine has just that, nuka cola.  (One nukashine for you greedy toons). Free water, collectron is open... its all good.
---
I live se of v76.  Low level area.  I sell things mostly at script prices, with the occasional higher value item so I’m not wasting high levels time.  I sell meds drugs and booze for high levels and cheap meds that no one above 30 needs but a 5 will find useful.
---
I’ll make things for low level toons who are exploring my house.
---
I do all this because our community is mostly awesome.  This is one of the few games where awesomeness is usually louder than asshattery.  It teaches people to be nice.  Pay it forward, etc etc.
---
Best compliment I’ve gotten was a guy who ran up to me to tell me he was just at my house and thought it looked awesome.   It made my day.
---
Appreciating work people put into the game to make it better, is what makes it worth it.
---
I always check out camps i think are cool...then i go back to my own and already forgotten whst i saw lol
---
if your stealth is blown for some reason.
---
Depending on what he said, it could be understandable. I didn’t immediately recognise it as another language, and it took another few seconds until I recognised it as Spanish. About 20 seconds later I started translating it as best I could. Three minutes later I gave up.
---
Pretty sure the tse meta stopped being a thing a LONG time before Wastelanders dropped as well.
---
Yea yea, no worry, your right there. This is why i'm strongly thinking about adding "Barbarian" and "Evasive". I mean there's no point to max your HP if you aren't planning to add the damage resistance. It's just that i also know the importance of "Blocker". This perk card is literally a life saver in alot of situations. That's the problem on this build, i'm desperately trying to find a good balance but i can't have it all. If I go for Barbarian, I think i'll just keep Blocker for specific events. 
---
Here the goal of this build is to find that balance that will allow me to stay at my peak no matter what's going on around me. I gotta be enough strong to have the time to melt enemies bothering me and go back to my dps phase
---
No jumping around screaming for help and spaming stimpaks. If i use a stimpak, i must be enough resistant to be able to shoot while i'm healed over time by it. It's a big problem for optimised bloodied builds...they hit hard but lose time jumping around. I want my build to be constant.
---
Spamming mobs at line in the sand
---
I've never successfully completed "it's a trap". I don't know what the fuck is up with that event but a bunch of eager people show up looking forward to a nice scorchbeast bbq, and we wait... and wait... and wait... EVENT FAILED
---
Good point, that always annoyed me. If their excuse is so people can set up their perk load out just allow us to do that before joining a match. Problem solved.
---
Nice, thank you!
---
Not enough bushes in town.
---
Oh they can stand there and rot while I go get a drink or take my dog outside, but they're still assholes.
---
good job haha
---
I have a BE Minigun, QE Harpoon Gun, Action Hero, and several other decent heavy weapons. 
---
I’ve been running an auto rifle build for over a year and have several decent handmades and combat rifles but I’ll admit I’m tempted to do a complete refresh and I’m sitting on 45 perk spots I could shuffle around. 
---
Only issue is I’ve got 80K in 556 rounds and would need to retire my AAE handmade and B2525 handmade and BE primed handmade but hey, I could always put them up for sale too.
---
You cant trade 2* star stuff with guys who have good collections so its just good if you want to use it yourself or sell it in your vendor to a rookie or trade with a rookie. So always go for 3star, a weapon gets valuable with 25% vats, 15% faster reload and 90% weight reduction. Armor gets valuable with Sentinel, Cavalier, Sneak and weight reduction.
---
The Unbearable Monster
---
Dude i sell food recipes for 5, camp plans for 10, armor and weapon plans for 25, and PA plans for 100 and they rarely sell. Im getting to the point that i may just drop them
---
Thanks for the laugh!
---
just a spontaneous question, where is the secret service?
---
It's not rude lol those people were just dicks. 
---
The only problem I have is if someone kills my brahmin, that's just not cool. :(
---
If I find plans I know I just drop them by 76
---
Yeah, probably used up all my karma and can only expect horrible rolls from Purveyor..
---
Does this actually keep her stuck there? I have a doorway to pave over if it does
---
Did you try just picking up your C.A.M.P. and placing it again? Everything you built (destroyed or not) will be saved in your build menu. When you place them again, they are all fully repaired (no resources required). It’s not worth the time if you only have a few things destroyed, but if your base is levelled... I’d definitely just use this method.
---
Yeah. I can use a radiationfluids run in morgantown/whitesprings or grafton steel
---
Instead of everyone’s theories go look at the Bethesda forums. I know things can change from the pts to what actually is implemented but I don’t think so in this case. The full info on the nerf is openly discussed on the pts forums.
---
If you're favoriting your best gear you can sort it that way so you don't accidentally sell off anything you want to keep.
---
PC Masterrace  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Gauss works just fine on VATS. I use mine with VATS almost exclusively and magic effect triggers every time. I can also charge it inside VATS. Only thing I dint one shot with that is SB and Colossus
---
I just love how people jump to conclusions and invent their own narratives. It’s a SUGGESTION. And I’m not wanting to be max level just a better reward for higher level players, not just game pass players new to the game. Seriously settle down.
---
Yes, but they're a dedicated horror genre. As did they Freddy (my main,) Ghost Face, Pyramid Head, Bubba, Piggy. Coz snoot boops 😍 Snoot boops saves lives. (Side note, I taught my dog to do snoot boops!)
---
"Yeah but this why the Unyielding armor set is interesting here. It gives you back what you would miss if you would go with a Bolstering armor set."
---
You may get those poi ts in game from the buffs granted by the armor but you do not get the available perk slots. Those are the important thing.
---
Every time I get a plan I already know such as PA plans I always think to myself that it could help someone. so either I do half the price or a third of it.
---
I like the sound of that. I need to get one to go with my red asylum outfit.
---
I often give people tours of my camp.
---
Haha, you speak/spell better English then most English people I know.
---
That's more like a terrifying, older Pinnochio
---
True but a perfect SBQ hit isn't centered on the site, yeah there's plenty of violet flux but because where the nuke would be not plenty of other materials to make it stable like hardened mass etc...because all the other creatures would be outside the zone
---
Sad but true
---
Until you cant play a game mode due to hackers ;)
---
So a weapon that is designed to represent an item from a time before repeating rifles were commonly available should be available as a repeating rifle?
---
When we already have 2 repeating rifles.
---
Had a guy at the whitesprings vendor just sitting there and of course I waited but after 5 minutes i was pretty sure he was afk. I dropped a nuke on him and used the vendor. My pettiness knows no bounds
---
That was the worst, how did they think it was ok to launch like that? I never bought plans until after it was fixed.
---
I’ve been playing since the beginning so like to think back on my AAE Combat Shotgun and it was simply devastating in terms of mowing down mobs.
---
I don't see many masks?! Where are the damn masks?!!?!
---
Power Armor Man/Madam is a feature! The best feature!
---
It was part of a fallout 3 box set I believe, I’ve got one too it’s awesome
---
Kinda the same reason the op stated he was getting xsx instead of just leaving it as him getting a next gen. Cause it dont matter? No harm intended? Just for conversation sake?
---
Not everything is done with sarcasm or bad intentions lol.
---
Okey, lets say modules are perfectly balanced. What do you tell me about my point no. 3? You dont mind having such low chances to get what you actually want? 
---
Most legendary effects are garbage. Either have them reworked so they arent garbage or remove them so our chances improve. 
---
Also, I didnt take into consideration the weapon pool size. Meaning the % I provided are only to get the stars you want, getting them on the weapon you want is actually harder.
---
And you can do both. Drop on sbq and make sure you get the station and forest too. Do the sbq first. Then clear the locations. Don't get all the flux at first. But wait 20minutes. Farm mass and highradfluids again. Wait another 20minutes rinse and repeat until the nuke is gone. Farm the plants and make over 40 stable flux in 1 nuke duration. I have at least 500 stable flux of every kind in my scrapbox.
---
end of the wastelanders questline. just keep doing both the raiders and settlers quests up until the game tells you to pick a side, you'll be meeting the secret service shortly after.
---
Your choice where to launch a nuke, if you put all the effort in.
---
Whitesprings is good for flowers, and is lewisburg,  weirdly.
---
I have a little violet flux you can have,  are you on ps4?
---
Yes, thats exactly what I said. You read my mind.
---
Honestly I forgot about the perk card thing, maybe that is the reason. I've never changed from the default 😞 I seem to think of it right before the match starts and then I'm out of time haha. It would be nice to be able to look through them and set them up before joining, like you said.
---
Not sure what a perfect SBQ hit entails, but I always just edge the fissure to get the SBQ out, and make sure I hit the western most fissure and train yard as well.  This has never resulted in issues downing the SBQ, and generally the fight can still be fought outside the irradiated zone.
---
I had a Vampire Explosive double barrel and it was crazy destructive including PvP.  Not as good as my AAE Combat Shotty but yeah I remember those days well they were all the rage.
---
I've been making a lot of pit stops at the Overseer's camp whenever I notice someone's about to pop out of the Vault and just hoping they get to someone who doesn't know 'em and can get some use from them. I have a problem where I hoard anything I think could be useful until my stash box is busting and I gotta offload some excess.
---
The only plans I try to sell in my machines anymore are limited time or difficult to obtain.
---
Niiiice
---
I would have thought that also, but given location, and purveyors sale, I think it more likely they were dumping weight.
---
That they where all over the place on power levels made me less worried about it.
---
Sure, they could have been duped.  But I’m not too worried about it.  If it was 20 be25 fixers, I wouldn’t have taken them.   ...    well maybe one 🥴
---
That was so much more helpful than k you!!
---
I sell them for 1 and they don’t go. I’ve resorted to just dropping them again lol
---
No suelo jugar con micro, llevo bastante jugando pero ahora tengo un personaje que subo a ratos a lvl 27, tengo él mismo nombre que aquí en él juego.
---
Por cierto, la armadura del SS se obtiene con oro, tienes que acabar la misión misión principal creo recordar.
---
Then I just unstealth and restealth. Escape artist is nice. Plus my stealth is almost to the point that I can pet a Yao guai and I am not built for max stealth. I am typically only hit if I am not paying attention or if I am in an event with so many mobs that it’s hard to keep distance.
---
I was carnivore on my now 2nd toon. I ended up regretting that decision so I took off my Starched Genes &amp; gulped a Radaway to get rid of it. I'd trade you 10 Radstag meat for 2 intestines!
---
It’s also important to note the chick behind the bar gets more plans the higher your raider rep is. *Pepperoni rolls are my shit* lol.
---
Sometimes I go 1 HP, sometimes it's insta-death for me
---
Interesting. When one wasteland comes I’m going to look into the endurance legendary perk so that I won’t need to do a massive character respec.
---
okay, thanks I'm going to get to it
---
Nothing good. Soooo many knuckles and missile launchers.  I want legendary turrets:  Furious, 50% better accuracy (doesn't attack my other turrets or Athena when she pops in) and 99% more damage to mole rats and floaters to protect my CAMP in One Wasteland.  LOL
---
&gt;Ok raider can be maxxed in 20minutes
---
Do tell &gt;\_&gt;
---
haha last night I pulled 3 3\* legendary boards in a row. Totally getting punked
---
I just wanna make sure you guys understand here, this isn't a sneaky build. Just with the Unyielding set and the "Grim Reaper's Sprint" perk card i'm pretty effective. No joke i'm rarely out of action points. I don't really need "Adrenaline" and "Gun fu"...i just wanna precise that in a spot like in the Colosal problem event, i basically only use v.a.t.s....for everything....everything's ok. But adding "Dodgy" could be dangerous for my action points tho. There's nothing i really need in the Agility special other than "Evasive" right now.
---
I’m not complaining about the grind. I’m simply suggesting a better reward for players that have been playing since the beta, not game pass players that have played the game over the weekend. I used the word grind which apparently means I’m complaining. I’m not. I’ve never posted a discussion before, I’m fine with gold bullion, scrip AND perk coins. Just suggesting a reward for high level players too.
---
I forgot I had one of those lunch boxes, I never used it because I was worried about damaging it. As far as opening the lunch boxes in game, I've been at acp and if someone opens one it's followed up with 3-4 others so you get the full +100% xp. Open one up and see the party
---
Alcoholics anonymous /s
---
Was thinking the same, i have one too, i love it :)
---
See? Somehow y'all understand my point in this post, yet last time on another thread I got slated for saying all this same stuff! Thanks for getting me 😎
---
Suggestion.  Make legendary models 100each, reduce quantity required to craft to one on all, allow them to work on all weapons/armor that can be legendary.
---
Or 
---
Make a one star, two star, and three star module priced accordingly, then same as above.
---
And my suggestion has nothing to do with the system.
---
I logged in today, traded in a small fraction of my saved up scrip items, tried my luck 3x, logged off disappointed again for the 400th time.  Great gameplay.
---
Cool.  I am a full health PA heavy so I kick the door in and shout Daddy is Home!  I started a new character thats level 5 but I probably want bloodied stealth commando.  What about fighting earl?  I also heard from Angry Turtle in the new Daily Ops,  stealth doesnt work. Any thoughts?
---
Lol that would be funny I'm thinking bigger nuke zones or your able to fire multiple nukes
---
I member.
---
Been asking about this myself, would very much like an answer. Fo76 is probably my fave game and god knows how much money Ive spent on the game now, it not being on next gen really feels like a deathsentence for the game 
---
u/Ladydevann, it would be very nice if we could get some information sometime soon, cheers
---
All perks need rebalanced. My hope is that the changing to how damage buffs are calculated is the beginning of that.
---
Speaking generally, yes.
---
currently half price on scrip costs to buy legendaries from mole grandma at the Rusty Pick
---
Can you explain the pie thing? I'm not familiar
---
Thanks. :)
---
I always leave a few unwanted legendaries in the pie vendor once I've maxed out my daily scrips. I'll probably find enough new gear tomorrow to max out again, so they just rot in my stash. My hope is that some low level needs the scrip or even better - needs the weapon.
---
I only have one vendor at my camp for roleplay reasons, so I personally don't even have room for all the plans, so I tend to carry them around and drop them to lower level players, especially ones who showcase an interest towards camp building.
---
Ah! Thank you good sir, I try to keep up with the abbreviations but sometimes... :-)
---
Earl can be a challenge because of all the wendigos that I don’t see til they are in my face but mainly I am end up dying from the hazards rather than the mobs. Also earl can be annoying because of the ranged spit attacks that are not targeted but more spray and pray. 
---
We will have to see about daily ops.
---
Me either
---
Not so sure about that 
---
I’ve been playing this game for almost 2 years now (since the start) and can tell you between the TSE nerf and shotgun nerf and Survival mode elimination and worse yet all the stealth nerfs they have lost a lot of loyal players.  Some of the kitchy things like Meat Week have brought people back but don’t kid yourself it’s not the same.
---
I went for to star iv done 40 rounds iv got 5 different wepons brodsider laser gun minigun 1 of then explosive ,bow and railway 1000 scrips for shit
---
gracias por tu ayuda, si no tienes tiempo o juegas a otras cosas no pasa nada, no te molestes en jugar si no quieres/ no tienes ganas, te agregaré.
---
Yeah i liked building my big towns
---
Thanks for your thought!
---
Exactly my thoughts.
---
I’m really bad at replying in the right spot
---
A ton of people are wanting the same thing. Bethesda has some reason not to increase this and i don't know why. They have a cap limit so the cap holds some value. Ok sure that is sound. But weapons most time cost insane amounts of caps because of rarity. If you had no script limit some guns would become less rare and the value would go down. If that trend continued you could (wait for it) actually pay caps for it in one transaction. Shocking i know. They still need to get off their asses and redo the trading system. You got a box i got a box, put in what you want to trade (gun caps ammo etc) you hit ok, i hit ok, you hit trade i hit trade and its done. Anything added or taken away from either persons trade box at any point unchecks ok or trade selected. Idk the coding needed to do this but im sure they could do it. Other games have this trade system.
---
I want 9
---
Scattered though out the wasteland there are claw machines that have a “perfectly preserved pie” that you can win.  It’s a low probability, but when you do, the pie is dropped into a container on the machine that you can get it.
---
They are mostly worthless, it’s just something to do, display it, eat it, sell it, leave it for someone else to find.
---
It will give me a reason to log in for 5 minutes every day that isn't just using the scrip machine.
---
The key here being commonly available but not non-existant. My assumption on seeing the Dragon was that it was a BP rifle that could fire four seperate times before reloading. Would likely be more useful like that as you can already get a BP rifle that matches or exceeds the Dragon with legendary effects now that the Legendary Dragons are legacy.
---
This picture is so great. I saw pictures like this sometimes. When I se someone even in regular vendors I try to form a line but people that comes after just pass through it and/or start bashing /shooting whoever is already there :-(
---
I’ve acquired and sold two Unstoppable Monsters.  15K for one and 20K for the other. 
---
Bear Arm isn’t nearly as highly sought after FYI.
---
Wow. I feel the pain. Had the same thing.
---
These are the reasons I made a post asking Bethesda to DC the people who camped drums &amp; spits for literally hours on end. If I sleep at my camp for 20 minutes while I quickly run to the store IRL, I get DC'd. These people put their toons on drums &amp; spits, go out for the day &amp; nothing. They get no DC &amp; claim all the rewards.
---
I was attacked for saying such 'crap' because those people are 'helping.' No, no they're not. 
---
I gave up doing the Primal events for this very reason.
---
Would gladly buy, looking for ultracite and bos mod plans. Are you on ps4?
---
"  Is it just to make people feel shitty about not having the resources to keep up with people who play 24/7"
---
I work 50+ hours a week and finished the run within 3 weeks.
---
You're allowed to be upset and sad that you missed it but you had more than enough time and you have only yourself to blame.
---
Thanks for that info.  I guess I'll keep an eye out.  When there's enough new content, I'll probably come back then to clear it out.
---
Definitely not feeling the desire to grind out another legendary run season though.
---
There are a lot of weapons that melt people almost instantly; e.g., the handmade, tesla rifle, or minigun. Do you use the gauss shotgun yourself? I think many commando specced players just want to gimp their closest competition.
---
I wonder how the damage nerf will affect nuclear winter. Maybe all gauss weapons will be less powerful with additive damage, since gauss weapons have explosive damage.
---
The biggest issues are the bugs and cheaters. I have loaded in to find crates already looted. I will try to use grenades, only to bash the air instead and find I’m unable to equip grenades. I will aim down the scope, only to find my movement speed reduced until I swap weapons. Reporting cheaters with video evidence does nothing.
---
I dont remember because i got rid of her for camp budget
---
They do hurt other players, people use them in trap bases all the time
---
I personally found DR perks to be underwhelming overall.  80 points really doesn’t help as much as you think it should.
---
As far as healing, I use stims for casual play, but rely on Nuka quantum for more difficult stuff.  With Cola Nut, the healing is more consistent and also recharges AP to feed Dodgy and VATS.  Nuka Cherry is fine, too.  Tar berry juice is another thing I use regularly.
---
I play on PC, so I have cola bound to 4 on my keyboard.  It’s easy to spam as needed.  I don’t know if you can do that on console.
---
Too funny.  I have a sign at my CAMP that says, "No mask required to shop here"
---
Im on xbox sorry man haha
---
Why would you wait until the last minute?  This should have been done on Sunday or Monday. There was no promise that you’d be able to buy ranks after the run ended on Tuesday.
---
Better luck next time.
---
Do you still have it available?
---
If someone opens one during the ACP countdown, I run away. It's already challenging enough to loot a hundred wendigos without bringing confetti mess into the equation. 😂
---
Landed a 3 star Bloodied Handmade w/25% VATS and a 3 star Junkies 50 Cal w/15% reload speed.   I’ve lost track of how many rolls I’ve done but only other better drop I can recall is my 3 star QE Harpoon Gun.
---
I did not know this. Thanks 🤣😂
---
Sólo juego Fallout, pero entiende que mi cuenta principal es casi 300 y es la que me atiendo.
---
Eso sí agregame sin problema, puedes preguntar lo que necesites y podemos subir juntos de nivel.
---
Pero ahora toca siesta (:
---
Good to know need to clear a space. Lol
---
If you've been playing since Wastelanders came out and putting your 20 notes in every day, you'll have everything you want from bullion long ago.  There is no need for a sale.  I'm sitting at 5k bullion on my main and my alt that I started long after Wastelanders waiting for there to be something TO buy.
---
Is there a sale on right now?
---
Well that’s on point for my friend. He’s given me tons of box set goodies over the years lol. Thanks for the reply!
---
I do. I have it in my stash.
---
I member when Berserker was op, ohhh it was just a fever dream.
---
te entiendo,
---
buena idea la de la siesta jaja
---
Ya i bought a 3* mini gun for 100 caps and sold it to a vendor for 192
---
well, i can play it. hackers aren't invincible, in fact they are stupid af most of the times. they are just annoying, like cowards hiding in bushes are aswell.
---
Event lasted 10 weeks. Waiting until the last day seems... regrettable.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76, I'm glad you're enjoying it. 
---
As much as I love your idea here, I don't think it'd be possible since we can delete pictures we take.
---
As for being the best photo mode in any game, I'm thinking you don't play many games 🤔
---
Anyways, I'd like to be able to make pics in my camp. I actually make tee-shirts IRL of some of my in-game screenshots 🤗
---
I think it drops as the helmet itself but if youre on PS4 I get off in like 7 or 8 hours if youll be available.
---
I find that most of the plans I find at player vendors are ultracite plans! Just keep looking (PS4)
---
I'll be on at around 3 PM est
---
I gotta give it straight to ya chief, aint a opinion, is a fact. Double Barrel is the most useless shotgun in the game. heck even more useless than tesla with shotgun barrel...
---
I mean now that he’s pinned to that trailer and not trying to talk to you from under a building it’s easier to avoid him.
---
They should have 2 events this month, a nuke day celebration, and a Halloween special that caused by the nuke day event so they have little lore to em idk im tired
---
Yea, but finding mod plans I need is so difficult. If I come accross someone who has them, they are usually too impatient to sell them
---
Too bad man
---
You need to wait and find a server that's dropping the rolls you're after. I've had this work numerous times for not just the first prefix, but all 3. It's not full proof, but it helps.
---
No, we gotta use the wheel or spaming the stimpak button (right arrow on the dpad). But i gotta add that right now this character is playing under 300 dmg resistance...it's an issue, i only have one ss armor piece and not even moded yet. I'll see later how it goes, but I definitely need some more dmg and energy resistance.
---
It will do a lot more damage in VATS the wendigo spawns at ACP will be one shot one kill.
---
I have a similar work schedule but didn’t finish that fast. I did finish with two weeks to spare, though.
---
And I did a test about a month or so ago, and was able to complete the entire set of dailies in less than five minutes. 
---
Granted, the level up was completely quickly because I’d intentionally logged out of that character when it was at 95%+ of an XP bar, and it took longer to get into a NW match than it did to deploy a camp three times.  But as for actual active playing time (not counting loading screens and fast travel time), it was 4 minutes and 22 seconds. 
---
And mathematically you could have missed 20% of the dailies and still finished, even without counting the XP repeatable. That’s literally fourteen full days out of 70. 
---
Trying to blame the game design is bunk.
---
If you really want it to work, put a bug report in too.
---
I havent seen anything for awhile about it being bugged, but it could just be not many people use that perk anymore, and its not getting any visibility.
---
Sorry if you didnt find my tips helpful.
---
You’re not the only person who has a busy life, jackass. I work up to  60+ hours a week and have plenty of other obligations and responsibilities that I have to take care of before I start playing and I finished in a month and a half. So stop acting like you’re the only one who has other shit to do. You had more than enough time. If you were really worried about not being able to finish you would have saved up your atoms remembered the day it was ending so you could hop on in the last few hours to buy the rest of the ranks. Stop bitching.
---
Always check all containers. I like to put really goofy, random items in the Purveyor cash register, though. It's fun to be creative. I think last time I threw in a Guns and Bullets magazine, Whiskey and a teddy bear. Another time I threw in Pork and Beans and a Civil war era suit with an axe and a coffee tin. So yeah, go nuts! It's really fun for the next person. My next idea is to collect ALL the teddy bears and a Minigun. Should be good for a laugh!
---
Welcome to being scrip-locked
---
That is the perfect SBQ hit, allowing people to fight the queen outside the nuke zone, only problem with this kind of SBQ run is none of the creatures that attack have any hardened mass etc.. because they aren't in the zone
---
*Well, you must play the game 24/7 and have no life!  That’s the only possible way anyone could complete this thing!!*
---
/S
---
I need a gun that fires unwanted plans into other player's inventory.
---
No sorry I don't. I mainly was choosing shotgun when I was doing it and all 15 or so were the same.
---
Single biggest complaint right now, the range of the Gauss "shotgun". No prob with the damage, but that damage needs to fall off more for greater distances. The whole mode has too many little frustrating bugs- disconnects, visual bugs looting, problems with items going into your quick wheel, probs using quick wheel, aim down sights thing, reload your weapon=empty your mag, when administering first aid to downed players sometimes you stab them with the stim, but they don't get up, and then you don't have the option. Of course all the sad losers that use aimbots ect, even on console.
---
&gt;Most people would take everything and sell. Genuinely a goodguygreg.jpg
---
not realy. Most people would do the same, plans are not worth the space they take in stash :V
---
&gt;and was able to complete the entire set of dailies in less than five minutes.
---
This is the important part.  Many dailies only take a few seconds such as chew gum or eat food or join a group.  Sure there are some outliers such as find a bobble-head or something but those can be skipped as you said.  On most days, completing all of the dailies is a matter of mere minutes.
---
After I finished the run, I would not check my challenges until after I played for an hour or two.  More often than not, after I would play for a bit and just look at my challenges, the majority of them or all of them would be complete except the nuclear winter one.  That is without even knowing what they are!
---
Very nice weapons!! Yeah took me a while to get off the fence. Think it through. I traded my AA FFR handmade and TSE Fixer. Only kept the B3325 HM. Will never part with that.
---
Cool I might just do that next time, I won't do it quite yet until Bethesda fixes the little silo problem relating to codes not working properly
---
they killed (non-automatic) rifle builds so it will stay there :V
---
"*Is it just to make people feel shitty about not having the resources to keep up with people who play 24/7?*" - Season lasted 10 weeks...
---
If only Betheda could make vendors show unknown plans...
---
no fuck. that damn backpack. Once is too much.
---
It won’t, to my knowledge. It’s for perks that stack damage, nuclear winter doesn’t use it.
---
Ok that is hilarious, I would have loved seeing that!
---
ye but this one will be worse as everything will get nerfed
---
I’m used to it lol. Just for this weekend with the 50% off sale it’s twice as annoying.
---
I believe you find it in one of the Overseer's stash boxes
---
Also, the Grafton Station vendor sells the plans for the small purifier
---
The game itself has no idea what is "good" and what is "bad" 
---
On every single roll every weapon type as well as every effect has an equal chance to drop 
---
A fixer has the same chance to drop as a wrench 
---
Unyielding has the same chance to drop as nocturnal
---
Level 30 is like the pinnacle of useless level for scrip. Too high to roll for mule armour, too low to roll for usable weapons.
---
The plans were pretty rare
---
&gt;this time the nerf seems manageable.
---
WHAT??? XDDD 
---
they nerf everything and buff mobs... this case is far worse as there will be no build to escape to...
---
You'll get there some day
---
That was my experience as well. For those last two weeks, I’d be playing along and get the notification. *’Oh, I guess I killed my 25th creature or something. Neat.’*  *’Huh, looks like buying things is still on that list. I almost forgot.’*
---
To be honest that's ok for me, with the grind of attempting to roll decent SS armour pieces and then scripping them plus whatever scrip i get from events continually gets me to my scrip limit. Dropping 500 on 50 modules is a great way of cleaning that out and getting a bit of breathing space lol.
---
That aside i've never found that sales that useful, you can buy 4-5 3 stars before you hit your scrip limit and then you're stuck with the overage if you buy more or get legendaries from events etc. If you load up and aren't just dumping bad rolls, then it'd take days afterwards to get rid of it all and you end up humping it around in the interrim
---
Wait till you try uny gear, ur almost to the ultimate build
---
So its basically 10 scrip to re-roll a bad weapon? Dont see how that could get out of hand at all
---
Speak for yourself. Lol I'm the exact opposite. I rather have my entrance door kept open as a "safe haven" to speak. Only the important things are locked
---
Just because YOU think it’s a dumb mechanic doesn’t make it so.
---
I understand that, here's what I do.  After the SBQ fight I run through to the forest, there are usually enemies there by that time.
---
Next I hit the train yard, then I go south to the camp with the robots, I then end the run on the western fissure.  The western fissure is where I've had the most luck.  Scorch will generally keep spawning in groups there.  one night I came out with about 25 high radiation fluids, and even more hardened masses.
---
In Xbox, players load in at different times.   That's the only way that I can figure that I get shot by someone in power armor within the first second of loading into the match.
---
A beautiful glorious 1/3 of the screen
---
I had a tree in my bunker... Put a workshop machine and it's gone
---
I think it would be cool if we could display them on the camp TVs as it would give them some use aswell as adding a cool decoration/personalization to the camp. We could also have a slide show sort of thing if we set multiple photos to one TV. also to address lag maybe limit it to one TV per camp on a server.
---
The info I'm using for base stats are taken from 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dragon and
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Black_powder_rifle and
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lever_action_rifle_(Fallout_76)
---
If you quarter the base damage of a level 45 The Dragon (4 rounds, now fired singularly) you get 56.25 damage per pellet. The base damage for a regular black powder rifle is 180. 
---
That's a hell of a drop off. 
---
Now, from a mechanical perspective. Do the Dragons 4 hammers (for each separate barrell) each have their own trigger? Do they need to be manually engaged for each barrel? If there's only one trigger how delicate is the mechanism that switches between triggering each hammer strike? How does this work from a mechanical standpoint?
---
Just because Dragons are legacy doesn't mean we need to give them the option to be worse than a level 25 lever action rifle (5 round repeating rifle with base damage of 65).
---
Loads of people completed it, just being casual players. There was a double score event, extra challenges and double score on all challenges in the last week.
---
I was on level 60, I didn’t play the game for a month. If I did, I’d have easily got it.
---
Well unarmed was previously the highest possible unglitched dpm even after the meat hook fix
---
Its not a bloodied nerf.  Its a damage recalculation.   Bloodied will still be the strongest.
---
Rifleman is useless compared to commando, i made the switch yesterday, swapped out all levels of rifleman for commando, changed my hardened receiver to a power automatic receiver and now in vats i can shoot 2 or 3 times more bullets before i run out of vats and my level 2 four leaf clover actually kicks in regularly. When i combine that with a couple of levels of adrenaline and gun fu, ballistic bock and covert ops, i can put out massive damage. I hated doing it, i really wanted to just be a lever action/laser gun/gauss rifle build but laser guns are useless, gauss rifles are unpredictable and despite having a strong rifleman build and high damage lever action it struggles to kill high level anything fast enough.
---
When the legendary perks come out i will grind for the +5 perk, throw it into strength and make a semi viable shotgun or heavy gun build that will still be better than rifleman.
---
This happened to me as well
---
Hola :)
---
They drop.got it after uranium fever one night.strange thing was I didnt want the mask until I knew it was rare.when I 1st started playing I was always getting these scout masks and I would trash or sell them to vendors
---
Every single mod that lowers AP Cost to the minimum. That means you also need to make it automatic. Idk the names of the top of my head but you can probably just look at the wiki and figure out from there which mods would do it for you. Btw this works for combat rifles, assault rifles, handmade rifles, fixers, and maybe radium rifles
---
Exactly. This kind of ‘whine-post’ and ‘entitled attitude’ is simply annoying.
---
Isnt it supposed to be a multiplicative effect though? Or is it additive
---
Some of the skins fix it. Also certain barrels have it.
---
I have marsupial but I didn’t think it lowered fall damage.  I just didn’t go for it anyways.... saw they were up high in a very strange location and said..... nope
---
What would you consider important?
---
when you get that kill shot right in the crotch 👌
---
FO totally appeals to us old farts. If you want to introduce your folks to video games, this is the game to start them on. Just turn on the radio and they'll be hooked.
---
I agree, I didn’t play the game for a month and still managed to get to level 60. Missed the double score event too.
---
I can kinda see where he’s coming from, although we’ll over the top. 
---
In the weeks period to the next season run, you’d have thought they would have left it open to buying the last levels, surely meaning they’d have more people buying atoms.
---
Although, I can see why they didn’t, get people who were really invested to almost like panic buy atoms.
---
That would be better than a ban lol make the items secret annoying debuffs. Like less accuracy or everything weighs a bit more. Or your game crashes during events.
---
You'll never get static for dropping one on mass/fluid harvesting spots like Whitesprings or Morgantown.
---
By all means please do. I love building my camp and it’s amazing that people show appreciation to what I built.
---
After 4 years of use, I can say the handles are held in place by very thin metal. I bend them back in place a couple times a year. Otherwise it’s great! I’ve only run acp once so I will gladly make that my priority. Thank you!
---
This has come up more than once, technical problem is whatever you want has to be pushed to everyone else in your world AND if you decide to put some rule 34 shit up there it turns into a whole different problem
---
It's really great!
---
And these kinds of posts really demonstrate how badly I don't know what I'm doing when I build; I see these massive, opulent, beautifully crafted CAMPs and I build a one-story fixer-upper and a small attached vendor/workbench area and I'm at the limit.
---
Good thing I didn't go into architecture. :D
---
You might want to give it a few weeks before making any permanent decisions, I know I am. Maybe overly cautious, because I really want the ammo one, but the track record so far hasn't been stellar.
---
that's a very conditional statement
---
Good luck with that one bud.
---
You can still place objects over smaller trees and bushes and they disappear, but the grass is poking through still, it should also be "bulldozed." That's the issue they're talking about.
---
Also sometimes I give my low level visitor some loot like weapons, ammo, or junk. But I don’t use a mic so I just shoot them with my loot bag to get attention and shoot at my loot bag, I also use the gift emote and follow me emote. Might be that case.
---
And i don't even use the high capacity. I use the chemist mod. Saves me 100lbs and 3 perks and the energy and rad res reduction.
---
Ps5 runs on a modified version  of arch
---
You lost me at assaultron 😖
---
No it is not rude.  I dont know about anyone else but I never lock my camp doors.  I spend a lot of time working on my camps and I want people to be able to see it all.  The only time I lock a door is if I have a room that is just a dummy room and has nothing inside.  I have never understood why people lock all their camp doors.
---
My guess is they started shooting at you because they are dicks.
---
DOUBLE PRIZES
---
Check the cash register too. I dump hundreds of guns in that thing.
---
Actually radroach in Spanish is translated as Mutaracha (cucaracha mutante) :P
---
Daily ops might pose an issue since you can't stealth.  Mobs have infinite perception.
---
Laser thingy turns into biggggg laser thingy and give good drop
---
Lol the reason you're getting inconsistent framerates because the engine shit not because you're on ps4
---
Trash Mobs.
---
That thing with radroaches getting stuck in things like trashcans, still a thing. Was chased around outside of Mama Dolces by one.
---
lmao that would be gold
---
Yeah. I'll probably max taking one for the team, take sizzling and funky at r1 and just leave the rest for a bit
---
Thanks OP.
---
Until this post I assumed everyone checked where a nuke is landing so I never bothered to run a silo and drop one on a trap CAMP or a CAMP that's just selling a ton of garbage...
---
Now I may just start
---
Lol that would imply that there are more than 10 devs working on this game
---
Yes please elaborate on this.
---
Rule 10, also those are not in the same league at all. One is a 5% drop chance from an event you can trigger. The other is a less that 1% drop chance from some random events
---
In that case I leave the game so they don’t get access to my vendor
---
I roam camps - appreciate the time it takes to make a good one, get a little jealous at some of the collections and/or building skills.  Gaze on in awe that they can get so much stuff in w/o going over budget....
---
  Sometimes for a good laugh - like the one that has a stripper stage (fashnacht ribbons as the pole) and a bowling alley.   (a deathclaw topiary using a mirror ball as the ball, light laminate floor as the lane, and bobbleheads as the pins.)
---
This isn’t a trading sub
---
i got the forest jumpsuit from collision course, which is a significantly shorter and less shit event, you can trigger it too so might be worth rinsing that for the jumpsuit
---
Your Controller stick thing might be broken. Had the same issue on two of mine. Happens when they get old.
---
At level 398 I changed to Commando last week just to use my B25/25 The Fixer and hated it.  I used my saved perk points to change back to a Bloodied heavy gunner who goes in and out of power armor.   BOOM BANG SMASH I can go from heavy gunner, shot gunner to melee in the same day.
---
Kill the raider. Go to claim reward. Choose Appalacia has a new corpse. When she starts talking go out of the conversation. You get the rep. And talk again and again until you maxxed the rep. You have to do it 100's of times but saves you weeks of your life
---
I did forget about dailies a fair amount of the time.
---
I finished the run with \~1week to spare.
---
The repeatable xp SCORE is what probably got me most of my points.
---
It's not the first time everything has been nerfed, but it's the first time everything gets nerfed this severely!
---
This is going to make playing a low level character so much harder, the game already feels like a bulletsponge at that part of the game, it'll be even worse when they ruin the guns, perks and legendary effects.
---
I've played since Beta. There have indeed been a lot of situations that have had player drop off. 
---
From my experience and based on other people I've spoken to on discord back in those days, the drop off wasn't noticeable. I'm talking specifically TSE. People whinged to know end but once it happen, they kept whinging but seemingly played on.
---
There are many other reasons why there were drops in the player base, absolutely agreed. From what I've seen TSE wasn't it. There were so many things more significant than it in terms of noticeable player loss. A bunch you mentioned, there's a bunch other further game related stuff and even just other games releases like RDR2, Anthem, Outer Worlds etc. ALL of these saw a more significant drop than TSE.
---
Just on face alone think of how ludicrous people quitting to to a class of weapons being nerfed. That that was the straw that broke the camels back. Not the bugs and return of previously fixed bugs, not the dodgy business practices, not all the delays and broken promises, not the game going stale for 6 months prior to Wastelanders launched. A class of weapons that use to be OP that after the nerf were just ok. That was their their hill to die on. It's laughable.
---
This is why I have only done this event once in nearly two years.
---

I’ll offer one spoiled meat.

Okay, okay... ***two*** spoiled meat. Final offer.

The Red Shift skin has it iirc, but it replaced the weapon model with a new one (Chinese 56?)

Looks that kill? Why does everyone hate assbots?

Old faithful has lasted me 7 years (and a few controller tosses due to Fifa)....hoping it’s not dying now. Want to make it to PS5
---
Maybe your character is just tired. They've been through a lot lately,  give them a break every now and then 😂
---
I was at Line in the Sand and I opened one at the end when everyone was attested around. Then someone opened like 25 all in rapid succession. It was insane. I was getting notifications for about three minutes straight.
---
"I was disconnected not my fault"
---
New player here. Fuck. I had the same thing happen to me and I took everything and blew a heart and left. I didnt know your not supposed to take plans you knew, let alone sell them. I dropped the "known" on the ground later and ran off.
---
silly question but you're not over encumbered, are you?
---
could be a number of reasons.
---
When you stop forward movement, can you still turn L/R or back up?  If so, then it's probably a terrain feature stopping your forward movement.  Is there a rock or fallen tree at your feet?
---
If you are overencumbered and using AP to move, you ran out of AP.
---
If you controls are frozen (can't turn or jump), then yea, frame rate/lag.  Oddly, perhaps, I notice it more often right after I equip an instigating weapon.
---
Is that the official answer from Bethesda/Interplay?
---
Well this is just upsetting, considering the philosophical idea behind Appalachia is to rebuild a supportive community in a wasteland. I didn't come here to get told I need to play more, or be shamed for prioritizing my real life or not logging in daily- when I physically am not able to do since I'm not at home, where my game station is.. Not to mention I didn't know about the legendary run for two &amp; a half weeks and only found out from youtube. Y'all are short sighted and un-empathetic, and I regret even thinking anyone here would say anything not shitty. If you're so offended by what I said &amp; you work X amount of hours a week and were able to complete the LR in three weeks, maybe you *should* take a few days off from games and reconnect. It is, at the end of the day, a game. I thought the response would be more lighthearted, at the very least. Clearly, y'all are just mean &amp; I was very wrong.
---
You just know it'd be reset back to default everytime you log back in anyway.
---
10mm pistol can be made auto and uses Guerilla but the 10mm SMG is a auto rifle so it uses Commando perks.
---
I experienced it earlier today. It's very likely server lag.
---
Though having said that, seemingly traversable ground is deceptively catchy at times too.
---
I've only ever had successful 'It's a Trap' at the spot near the Ranger Station in the Cranberry Bog, or the spot in the Ash Heap. That place over by Delano Grange and the one near Watoga always fail. Last time I did it near Delano, I looked around for the SB, and it was on the ground a long way away and would've never made it over to where the event was. I've found the SB at the place near Watog over at NAR fighting all of the mobs that spawn there, instead of being at the event. It's a huge buggy mess.
---
For ammo that is slightly more expensive to make (Plasma Cartridges, 5.56, 308), then I don't mind it at 2 caps.

Mostly though, if I ever buy it, its to satisfy the daily challenge, or because I'm already close to 30K caps.
---
When was the double score event?? How do people even get updates for these kinds of things??
---
You need to look up confirmation bias
---
Then don't read or comment?
---
Nope - it’s like a rubber banding stutter
---
not if i put letter on top...
---
check the vaultboys eyes, or what is selected at the building menu.
---
Donde esta la biblioteca?
---
I think the trick is to build smaller. My CAMP actually isn't massive, it's just spread out. The workroom is 6 squares. The shop is 3. The bungalow is 8, plus the wraparound porch adding another 5. The utility shed is 2.
---
I was trying to get in as much as possible with score before the time was up and I literally fell asleep with the controller in my hand at 3am trying to grind XP. I'm not loaded but I was literally saving up to unlock the rewards. I'm only home 3 days a week, as well.
---
*Than
---
Hell naaah. The amount of map that would be cut off by getting rid of frog legs would not be worth it and people would still bunny hop anyway(see almost every pvp game ever).
---
This workhorse has to vendor hop to find great deals after the purveyor. He can rest on sundays like the rest of the world ;)
---
Well caps are not very important to build up so I'm sure some people do buy it for 2 a piece. However I never will. I'd rather buy steel and lead from them than buy bullets.
---
Don’t. Just don’t. Don’t even try that. 
---
Your English is better than most non-Latinos Spanish. And your English is actually better than some native speakers I know. 
---
Do not sell yourself short.  There is no ‘official’ language of Reddit and there no rule here that any participation language must be used.
---
You don’t have to justify yourself or your language to anyone.
---
No, but I’m from Spain and I’ve played the games in both English and Spanish so I know it for sure :)
---
&gt;According to Beth we are also all left handed...
---
We're all right handed, and all the guns are left handed.
---
Like everything it only gets fixed for a limited time.
---
Check reddit. They’re always being posted. 
---
Plus Bethesda’s own website or even on the home screen for 76
---
Even 1 cap for ammo is too much. If you need to buy ammo you can get it for less than 1cap in trade sub/discord.
---
 My friend always loads in anywhere from 20 to 45 seconds after me. He is running an XB1 with much better specs, so we think it may have to do with our internet speed? The load in timing being different for everyone is annoying.
---
I'll trade you everything I got for the Fixer
---
The innate 42% damage resist on power armor plus the DR, rad resistance, limb damage protection and emergency protocols might be a much better, easier to construct option for absorbing damage.  I’d say the 42% damage reduction is equivalent to needing an extra 500+ DR on conventional armor.  Of course, power armor disables stealth cards.
---
If you go stealth, I don’t think secret service is the best option.  With high level, high perception enemies coming in a few days, losing the benefit from shadowed mods is pretty significant.  Unyielding Thorn armor is much, much better if stealth is your primary defense.  Putting together a full uny Thorn suit is quite a task, though.  Full uny scout armor is the next best thing.
---
The whole point of making a cool camp is to have others visit it!
---
Come in, grab a drink from the punch bowl and feel free to examine EVERYTHING you see. 
---
Hey, might as well buy a cool gun from my vendor while you’re here 😎
---
But please, do close the doors when you leave.
---
Obviously I understand that, but why is the game board still up if you can't buy the rank ups? Which was my question, by the way. Every one is shitting on me for my schedule but not acknowledging why I posted? Also I hope you telling me to blame myself made you feel better about whatever it is made you feel the need to make me feel bad.
---
I have yet to get one from the purveyor
---
PC or console?
---
&gt;if you get hit by any enemy you must restart
---
hehe
---
haha
---
So, I'm supposed to give a key to my apartment to someone while I'm not home 4 days out of the week so they can log into my account to get the dailies. GOT IT.
---
You are aloud to attack enemy’s, if the enemy is bugged they don’t count, thought I might wanna clarify that, I might stream it if ya wanna watch
---
The places I check still have them, actually just got the last one I needed this past week. [Pleasant Valley Cabins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2NU8HAelE) has a bunch of spawn points. I used that video a long time ago, and followed that approximate route and found a lot of them(technically, now all of them).
---
Trying to educate yourself?
---
Google a map of your town, the library is probably listed on it. ;)
---
Not so rare if he already had most of them.
---
So pretty much, just bring terraria bosses to fallout? I can dig it
---
I confirm
---
If it bleeds, we can kill it.
---
No need for name calling, Jackass, I don't care about how much you work since that's not the point of this post. The original question is about why the game board is still up if we can't purchase rank ups. I hope trying to make me feel bad made you feel better. Lol.
---
If a 13 year old Somali kid can figure it out I don’t see why America’s brightest can’t.
---
What did you expect? Why would anyone be sympathetic to someone who is very poorly informed about the game and even questions whether your issue was a bug.
---
You think that if you were going to cut it to the wire, you'd actually know when exactly the event finishes. I mean it boggles my mind how you could not know that the legendary run was going. It's featured prominently in the game client, there were alerts ahead of time in the client that the event was coming, there were ItV articles over and over about it, the subreddit was flooded with posts before and during the event.
---
&gt; Y'all are short sighted and un-empathetic
---
Short sighted? That's rich coming from you. I'm stunned with the lack of self awareness that you have.
---
Until the 14th
---
As I've said below I'm not home 4 days out of the week, so your sarcasm misses the mark, sorry.
---
I,very crafted about 30 so far and all got dumped....... kinda saddening you cant even scrap them
---
Console
---
I like the idea. Once you reach max scrip for the day, an option to chance roll scrip based on weapon or armor star.
---
Well yeah, I'm Bloodied of course
---
I have 1 room locked but thats more for item exchanging purposes
---
Got a bloodied, explosive, 90wr minigun. A couple bloodied radium rifles. A quad radium. Instigating fixer. Medic Fixer. Bloodied 50cal. Instigating combat rifle. Few more decent ones, good haul overall I think. I just went and did 4 in a row, if they were all crap I server hopped, rinse and repeat. If I got a decent one I quickly bought 4 more real quick. I read that strategy yesterday and it worked out it seemed.
---
Best vendor I ever found had half the ammo at 1 and half at free. I split my order and walked away happy.
---
Why not follow your own advice?
---
It’s a public discussion forum. If you don’t want opposing opinions, don’t post yours. 
---
That’s what private blogs and Facebook pages are for.
---
On pc its usually happening when keyboard battery is dying. Not sure about console. Try switching to different controler.
---
It's actually this super common phrase while learning Spanish and it's also a [short funny rap in an episode of Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j25tkxg5Vws)
---
I'm always polite because I'm an older player that doesnt like PvP because you young people will insta kill me before I can even bring my weapon up. I just stand there waiting....but I guess I have decades of patience learned lol.
---
People who have played the game awhile don't really need caps. Or might be full on them. Like myself i have maxed out 2 game accounts.
---
I generally avoid mechanics that tend to break. specially ones like vendors, which give direct access to my stash.
---
Maxed out on caps and nothing to buy... When you have god tier loot overflowing whats the point.
---
Probably they are at max caps limit.
---
My only doors lead either to a 1x1 box that hides my power conductors and is locked because nobody should care about those, and a door on my seedy shed that is decorated as a bedroom. Anything worth seeing, using or taking is outside.
---
If I leave the door open, go nuts.
---
I have mine on a switch that is labeled "RADS" so it should be obvious. I have never had it trigger PVP. It does break really fast though if you leave it on.
---
Finally got a bloody Ultracite Gatling myself. Plus limb damage
---
So you want zero penalty for death then? Losing your junk and an incrementally increasing respawn timer are the only "punishments" (I use that term VERY lightly) for death.
---
I think it's just that not everyone want to have vendors. They are also likely close to the Caps cap so they have no need to sell things.
---
Try dropping it an picking it back up.
---
The community won a 50% off sale at the purveyor from the BOS Atlas event. It will be on until 9/14 12pm EST
---
Aw man, I'm always at work when people want to do fun stuff. Any chance of doing this again?
---
After several glitches that have allowed players to exploit my personal stash, I’m not even risking it anymore.
---
Ah, that may explain why I got shot in the back yesterday when I walked straight up to the counter, assuming other 2 people in there were AFKing
---
You were trying to grind XP with over 20 levels to go, right before the end of the event?
---
Yeah, ***that’s*** when you needed to decide it was time to spend Atoms to get up to the rank you wanted.  When was this, last night?
---
I'm actually using it now, it fits my build like a glove :P  
---
I would only trade it for a legacy explosive laser rifle I think.
---
should be 100%.
---
Gonna try max out endurance n see if it works
---
Sorry somehow I missed that.
---
I might just take it at r1 and let it be untill it's know whether or not the healing is intended
---
Leave a 'you have been insulted' note on their pillow
---
lol well I wish I had that problem.  I started playing again when Wastelanders came.
---
Most likely they're maxed in caps. I know I am
---
its automatic receiver, aligned/forceful stock, aligned barrel, quick mag and any reflex sights.. but it doesn't make it AP cost completely free, they fixed that so it drains your ap just a little bit
---
Most of the time it scares them away when i shoot at the ground
---
I'd love for this to happen but in the mean time I'm either selling them in my vendors for scrip value or selling to the robot vendors for caps or simply dropping them.  This allows me to continue playing and let's be honest, it ain't hard to accumulate 150 scrip for when the timer resets. I just don't see the point of holding on to crap when it's so easy to acquire.
---
You said that ***long*** after I posted my comment, and you just recently updated your OP. 
---
And that’s still irrelevant. There was no reason to wait until the very last moment. 
---
Did this happen last night?
---
Until then some of the stuff you can get from ACP fits the Halloween spirit like the skinned Earle rug and heads. Very creepy.
---
On pc Some servers seem to miscalculate my damage, or not apply perks or mods or something. 
---
Weapons that usually are listed as 100 show up as 70. Dunno if its due to lag / server load or what.
---
Try a different server, to see if that fixes things.
---
Use them all. It happens to me when quickly switch from a gatling while reloading to any rifle or shotgun. It's random, not always work so it can't be considered an exploit.
---
If dropping it doesn't work just shoot all 500 bullets
---
You wont be banned. And I guess you could try re logging. But mainly just fire threw the mag and then it should be back to normal
---
You can sell your extra water, with hard bargain 3 and 5 charisma they sell for 5 caps a piece. fyi
---
Budget really. I could sell things on a alt character but like I just don't feel like building a store front when I don't think anyone would wanna stop by.
---
I already have a PA Bloodied Heavy Gunner, it's my main: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f347e58&amp;d=sg2sq2s32sr2s22eu0eh2pe2id2ir2ip2ic4a71a12lt2l71lu2c13ce0c61&amp;w=c72cm2lg2ib4a04la2ej2e30sf2&amp;m=1c24fegh3&amp;am=182a38-182a38-182a38-182a3a-182a3a&amp;wp=w7w7w7&amp;wm=142534-1l2534-142835
---
As i told you, i just want this Bloodied commando build to be more constant and less weak than the typical optimised bloodied (sneaky) commando and sniper builds.
---
I’ll probably do this again, but what time do you get off work, it’ll be a while until I do this today
---
Probably have their level 10 mule account handling sales while they focus on their main to gain loot and XP.
---
Washington DC would be amazing for this. Level 100+ enemies, behmoths, deathclaws, raiders, more legendary enemies etc. I would love that.
---
They could bypass that with a second set of 'vault-tec camera film' which uploads the shots directly to Beth, you'd only be able to keep a limited number of shots stored in the 'vault-tec high security cloud' - maybe with more for 1st subscribers.
---
That way they don't have to deal with uploading modified images from a user.
---
Who would you like me to blame then?
---
It was not my intention to make you feel bad.  I was telling you that it is entirely within your control whether or not you wish to finish the season.  Front-load your season 2 work instead of back-loading it and you will succeed and reach the end.  
---
I don't know why the game-board is still up.  Why not?  There were communications from Bethesda that made it very clear when the season was ending.
---
Do you have a skin on it?
---
To be fair, you've described your attention to the game as very lackadaisical, while also complaining about not getting rewards. That doesn't seem like it's an attitude that would be well-received in any conversation.
---
Out of my 36 years of gaming and years and years of online, 76 has one of the best communities I've ever seen. It's almost amazing to see so many randoms cross paths in friendship instead of bloodshed.
---
Very nice, thank you for the advice!
---
My current CAMP is in the Mire, on a junk deposit and next to water. It's perfect in that way, but the rocks and trees made building structures difficult. I'm going to scout out another area that has both of the resource features I want (I'm not married to having a junk deposit, but that was the whole reason I moved in the first palce), and if I do end up moving it's going to be somewhere relatively flat and open. Trees made my previous location kind of a PITA as well.
---
I have another 9 hours left. So around 7pm CST I will be online.
---
The reason is that bloodied builds usually have a focus on using one or sometimes 2 particular type(s) of weapon (commando, heavy gunner, etc.). Their endurance is low bc there aren’t any perks in Endurance that boost damage or the effectiveness of a certain type of weapon. I’m a bloodied heavy build with a side of rifleman and I have only 1 point in Endurance, and that’s radicool which is great for the carry weight bonus (1 perk point gets you +5 STR, meaning +25 carry weight).
---
Honestly, because I assume people are nice. I'm a nice person, and this wasn't supposed to be a bash post and I primarily use the game for building. When I got sober my life was awful and building in game was the thing I did activity wise that 100% distracted me from my negative thoughts (1 year sobert his October!). You don't know me, so nothing is rich "coming from me". You know this post, and whatever you assume thereafter is simply an assumption. If you'd like to know more feel free to ask.
---
All these comments make sense!
---
if you restart because you got hit by an enemy, you're never going to finish.
---
Ok, we can do it then, I’ll spend that time finishing up my build because I’m in the middle of switching it
---
Well that’s why I have 15 stealth boys and 2 stealth boy MK3s
---
It’s still up so people can claim their earned rewards. The end date for the Run was clearly marked. 
---
So in essence, you’re complaining that one particular function of the Run was extended past the announced end date. 
---
Like others have said in this sub before; some people will never be satisfied with how Bethesda handles the Seasons. 
---
But this is one of the weakest complaints I’ve seen so far. You had ample warning that the season was going to end on Sep 8th. You clearly know what your work schedule is like. So if you wanted to buy ranks, then at the end of your last play session prior to Sep 8 is when that should have been done.
---
Oh sweet!  My GT is ImSomewhatWeird. Just message me and I will catch you when I get home
---
At least the first one in line appears to be wearing the Veil from the Mistress story.  I suppose that the next 2 have some sort of a ash heap filtration device on!
---
Sounds good, I’ll message u when I get home
---
Interesting but this would only come in handy for PVP, I would see no reason this needed in PVE. But that's my thought
---
Often, when I read your responses to other people here, I feel that you might be acting too harshly.  
---
Not this time.
---
He’s clearly a casual player (which is fine), but then expects to reap the same rewards a more dedicated player receives. 
---
My stepson only plays FO76 occasionally. He got to about rank 60 or so. But he didn’t whine or complain about not getting to Rank 100.  His mom and I play FO76 more than he does, but he never said it was unfair or dared to suggest we didn’t have lives or have to work, etc.
---
Me to but i got lucky with that last dupe glitch and when season 1 started i really learned how to farm xp so i got up in lvl real quick.
---
Good to see the social distancing too
---
I’ll never pay more than 1c and I won’t sell 5mm and .50 for 1c simply because I can make so much at once. But this is only my opinion and people can play however they like.
---
It was the night/ early morning of the 8th, last day. I understand it was my mistake but if we aren't able to buy them then why is the board still up?
---
Last night a fellow former vault dweller had spaced out whilst engaged with purveyor, i had to toss on my mic and give a friendly, 'pardon sir/ maam are you going to be a while?' They disengaged noticing the 4 others besides myself waiting to trade scrip =)
---
I'm not near level 400 but I am getting sick of maintaining vendors and I honestly don't have anything for sale that people want anyway. I don't bother selling plans anymore cuz I am just sick of seeing them and shuffling them around. I usually keep magazines, bobbles, some ammo, and duplicates of my semi-rare apparel items in my vendors. When I really need caps I'll just sell a decent weapon on a trading sub. I still like vendor hopping though so y'all better keep that shit stocked up.
---
Hmm I might avoid the event from now on, Thx for sharing your experiences with it.
---
So here's my question: Does it kick in if you get hit by the SBQ's cloud or cone attack? Or does the boss need to be actively attacking you?
---
I got a fixer! A mutant fixer. #smh
---
I scrip everything. Don’t need anymore weapons or armor. All my stuff is high to god tier. I use the ammo converter to get rid of unwanted ammo instead trying to sell it. I drop all the plans I already know. I sell unwanted chems to the train stations. Only need enough caps to fast travel.
---
Nice! I'm at neighborly right now but I'm itching for that ammo maker. Thanks!
---
Lol yeah that’s my experience exactly.
---
This honestly isn't gonna take a long time but neat to do nonetheless.
---
this is why I like c.a.m.p.s that have seats near their venders, or at least unlocked doors so I can look around/ craft things but for some reason, everyone's house is locked up tighter than the king's daughter chastity belt. smh
---
Why aren’t they standing 6ft apart??
---
Empty the mag. It will go back to normal.
---
u made my day thanks,
---
Maybe I should be prouder of myself :) thanks a lot
---
This
---
I think one of the reasons for this appeal was/is - we grew up in a period with cold war still raging on and a nuclear holocaust a very possible outcome. Even with the original FO beeing somewhat late (97?) it hit a nerve with us.
---
I have the same issue today trying to bring Sereum Z to her, she just stares off into the yonder after saying "Oh hey looked who graced us with their presence" and that's all I can do.  :(
---
Would you take a Medic's Laser Pistol for the Bloodied Handmade? Guess that was all Mumbles had in stock when I visited.
---
Yeah, that’s kinda why I added the hit by enemy thing
---
How about we go east, just over those hills? Washington DC is over there, in its radioactive glory. That should maybe be too radioactive... let us cross those hills for a wiped out Baltimore instead. Hot zone. Monsters. Map extension.
---
So that people can still claim their rewards.
---
This is your complaint?  That the board is still up and visible?  Is that really it?
---
Or that they just render the screenshot serverside and keep a limited number of screenshot slots available (via a second camera or secondary ammo for the prosnap which uploads to Beth/'vault tec') 
---
Uploading existing photos from a users local storage is never going to happen - even on PS4/Xbone you can move the HDD to a PC, edit the photos and put the HDD back, there is no trust.
---
I think that a thougher bloodied commando could do better in intense pve fights vs sneaky commando and sneaky snipers. This is why i wanna test it and why i'm asking if someone else ever tested it.
---
Oop, better get rid of that quick before the unarmed nerfs
---
Gotcha
---
Based on Angry Turtle's video (I'm on console so cant test myself) Taking one for the team only kicks in while the enemy has agro on you- but SBQ always has agro on someone so it depends.
---
As for Follow Through you just need to be in caution or hidden on first hit- then maintains for proper timeframe regardless of if you loose stelth
---
funny rap jaja
---
&lt;3
---
I just wish that had been clarified, I did assume this was the case but it was kind of a grey area. It makes sense they'd keep it up for claimed rewards, but with all they do to clearly try to get people to spend money on the game this just seems like a missed opportunity for revenue that I would happily, and intended to, give them.
---
Everything goes for 5caps and when they don’t go I stalk a low level on the map and drop them the hole lot. Sometimes come across a loot bag (usually at someone’s camp) with plans and I go threw it to take what I don’t know and put in my extra plans. Used to hoard plans but now rather have armor and weapons use up storage
---
I learned spanish about 30 years ago and, if I remember correctly, it was all about introducing yourself, where you come from, all that jazz. :)
---
Look, it's awesome and all that you're sober, not going to take that away from you (not that I could if I tried anyhow). Seriously dude, the response you get is the response you get. If that's not to your expectations, sad day for you. It's just a little much to lash back at the sub because we didn't meet your (at least to me) unrealistic expectations.
---
Better luck with next post dude. Next season too while we're at it.
---
damn.  I didnt even know about that glitch until peeps got banned.  Is a explosive gat plasma really that much better than a regular one?
---
Prepare to hear the same sentence alot! Only type of ammo that's viable is .556. 200 round in not much time. The rest goes slow. Even 5mm. An hour 5mm making is 5seconds minigun shooting.
---
Hey! Sorry I switched my phone off for studying :( I'd happily give you something for it if you still wanna trade :)
---
Atomic shop skins will prevent weapons and armor from showing up.
---
Not usually, but with the way the new terms of service is written, even glitching a wire trough a wall, can be considered a ban able offense so some people might be worried a random person might unjustly report them for glitching and chase them away.
---
Congratulations on staying sober. 
---
What does that have to do with this discussion?  Is it an excuse for your assumption behavior?  Is it an attempt to elicit sympathy?
---
Why should we be sympathetic for someone that makes a snide comment that implies that they think the only people that could complete the Legendary Run spend their life 24/7 on this game?
---
Remove the skin paint- if you have one also we have a daily scrip limit.140 or  150 once you go over you need to wait 24 hours to do it again.exsmple a 3 star is 40  scrip a 2 star 15 do you can only do 3 = 3 star legendaries and a 2 star and maybe 1 star in one day.
---
thats probably why we cant can't change the price
---
I appreciate your input
---
Would love a zone like the Dark Zone in the division.
---
And also insinuating that anyone that competed the Run spends their life on the game 24/7.  That’s not a veiled insult at all.
---
Holy shit are you kidding you can get banned for that??
---
+1 to that.very lucky on my end too.im at the point where I seem to gifts the good stuff I don't use
---
I wish my times with mama mumbleburg were as wholesome as this, usually I just see people violently shooting her face after getting a shaft roll (myself included)
---
Wait, so in one breath you’re accusing them of being greedy, but in the next chastising them for not maximizing their revenue?
---
Really?
---
Mire got Queen of the Hunt as a daily and if I am not mistaken the miss nanny in Berkely Springs is daily too. There should be a list of daily quests in your pipboy anyway if you already discovered them, some only trigger if you are close to the area.
---
Not enough players and that guy always wins. lol, kidding. 
---
Actually, we need more clear and useful NW emotes and new maps. Some new players don't have the atoms buy emotes or missed some emotes. It is kinda unfair in my opinion and need to be fixed.
---
You know what, I appreciate your candour. We could do with more of this in this world.
---
Sounds like your stepson has a good head on his shoulders.
---
maybe i havent discovered them.  thanks.
---
you might be interested in the filthy casuals sub.
---
when you buy something with script you should get a portion of that available to scrap back.  Like how when you buy from a vendor and caps get added back in to their pool.  So if I scrap a 3\* weapon, say 15 script become available to use in the legendary shredder.
---
Also they could just use software rendering, it isn't 'fast' but a session can only hold 24 people, and it takes ~2 seconds per shot on the regular prosnap - even if the whole session was taking cloud photos are furiously as they could, it would still only need to render 12fps, at a likely max of 1024x1024
---
Additionally, they could just set the timeout per shot for a 'vault tec prosnap' higher.
---
This is an excellent solution.
---
Perfect that lines up with my lunch
---
True I have all of those (rug, meat pile, colossus heads). I saw a camp yesterday with floating boats, fog machines, hay stacks, and a bunch of other neat stuff so very excited to see what I cam find in the next months
---
That's not how it works. But your lucky socks will for sure.
---
Yeah sorry I was trying to make a joke.    Beefsquatch is a reference to a character on bobs burgers. A cartoon.
---
You should. I still struggle with my Spanish and have to rely on a translator sometimes. 
---
And English is supposedly one of the more difficult languages for a non-native speaker to learn.  Which makes sense, as it’s a mix of a lot of different language backgrounds. 
---
Never let anyone tell you that you shouldn’t be proud of your accomplishments.
---
I see you're loading up to shoot me down and that's just not nice. You don't need to look down on me or make me feel bad for being disappointed that I missed the rewards. Yes, I was genuinely asking why the board was up if we are not able to purchase the rank ups, and understand now it's for people to claim rewards. If you really feel the need to comment to make me feel bad about that go for it, but that says more about you than me.
---
Thats a damn good weapon btw
---
Honestly it needs a new game mode or two. There are so many game modes out there that would fit into Nuclear Winter. I think a good option for the 76 community would be something like Blood Money from COD where there are infinite respawns on a timed mode that has no circle and rewards both fighting and looting--also allows people to go into a game to try and complete the daily challenge without just going full bush-wookie.
---
I'd personally love to see them make a mode like Hunt: Showdown where there is no closing boundary but every team has to collect clues and race to a certain location and defeat a specific boss and then defend an area for a certain amount of time in order to win.
---
The 10mm SMG, and regular Submachine Gun as well, are automatic rifles and so use the Commando perk cards.
---
PSN same as Reddit
---
hell, I have so many that i cant sell them.  pretty much just taking space in my vendors.
---
The SS crew wants all the gold *back*, though. The *last* thing they're gonna do is offer discounts.
---
Bloodied Explosive 90% Reduced weight .50 Cal Machine Gun. High damage, good for both mobs and bosses, relatively low ammo consumption (for a heavy) and its very cheap to repair.
---
I don’t always agree with you, but I do appreciate your honesty. 
---
Sometimes what you post annoys the piss out of me. Not often, but enough that I started to recognize your username ;).  But I also know that it’s ridiculous to expect everyone to think or feel the same way as I do. And if I take a step back and reflect I might learn something. 
---
This, of course, doesn’t mean I might not get annoyed with you in the future and say something about it. But I think you have good intentions, and I respect that. And I respect you.
---
Just remembered a forrest daily - Ecological balance. No idea if you get scrip, did not do it for a long time
---
I price everything at 1 unless either I use it or it requires me to go out of my way for mats, all my ultracite stuff is 2 ea because I don't farm Flux that much and with nukes broken rn I don't think ill be able to until theres a fix, my cores i price by current charge, 15/100 would be 15 caps for example
---
I unequipped berserker the fixer combat rifle and 
---
The weapons damage return to normal
---
There is “No” emote already...
---
I feel dumb but what does one do with ultracite cores?
---
something like this would be good for people who ask to trade. because I'm not trading with any of you, ever.
---
I'm sorry if that's how you read it, but I don't think they're greedy at all. I think the way they sell in the atomic shop is brilliant &amp; it works. I have no problems with how they make their money, just surprised they wouldn't want to keep that going. I don't think it's greedy to want your money-making business to make money... I hope you're having a grand time trying to cut me down in these comments.
---
They should just remove frog legs and nerf the shotgun
---
I never heard of this, where is it?
---
Hey man. I'm a casual as well but a hardcore on my off days. I work 8-12 hours a day so I generally only have 4-5 hours after work to get on. DM me if you wanna play sometime.
---
I don’t want you to feel bad that you missed the rewards.  I am sympathetic that you wanted them and didn’t get them. 
---
I want you to realize that your tone and choice of words were degrading. Insinuating that only those that spent their lives on this game 24/7 could get all the rewards is insulting.  Double-talking about Bethesda’s greed then chastising then for not maximizing profit by letting people buy ranks after the end date is disingenuous. 
---
It’s not the fact that you missed the rewards. It’s the fact you’re being snotty and rude about the situation.
---
They really need to add the ability to bulk ammo (like bulk scrap) to the game, so you can price the bulk at less than 1c per bullet.  The minimum coin size is a bit too big otherwise.
---
that thumbs down is brutal though. would much rather have something like "no thanks grandma I already had dinner before we came over" than "the emperor has sentenced you to death"
---
I don't think so it is same with every auto rifle and when you think they actually cap it and not nerf I think it is intentional
---
I don’t want you to feel bad that you missed the rewards.  I am sympathetic that you wanted them and didn’t get them.

Double-talking about Bethesda’s greed then chastising then for not maximizing profit by letting people buy ranks after the end date is disingenuous.  And that’s how you presented it, even if you didn’t mean to. 
---
And it seems that you don’t even realize it. Curious.
---
Please do! I try and put real work into my camp and I love when people check it out. I also like checking out what other people got goin on.
---
Also don’t worry about closing the doors because Commander Daguerre was apparently RAISED IN A BARN
---
"Wasting" is relative - it's not wasting if it gets you something you need.
---
If you need violet, want a different critter set than all the usual places, hit Toxic valley - its full of violet flux.
---
Just be sure Wavy Willards is in the zone.
---
True but something a little more friendly the outright 'no' would be nice
---
Well, I guess you should have tou perfect roll armor and weapon as soon as you hit level 50 right ?
---
I was on my low level, and got a mutants explosive faster reload handmade, problem is its level 15
---
Lack of updates over a year old and it only got like 3 updates?
---
I don't need to look it up pal that's not what I'm doing, I had shit luck before better luck with chems and even better luck with while wearing the armor so that's all the evidence I need I never said it was guaranteed but it has definitely helped me
---
Pure end game content
---
There's a ton of them. 
---
Toxic Valley:
---
* Black forest lodge hunting quest
---
* The possum badge one with the toxic clean up at Kiddie's Corner (?)
---
* Prickett's Fort burial one
---
* The toxic barrel clean up one that's given to you by the Grafton mayor (though don't know how to force trigger it)
---
Mire:
---
* South Belle Motel (I think that's what it's called) has the bomb disposal protectron
---
* Pumpkin house place has a very quick one you can do all onsite
---
* The Nanny Bot at Berkley Springs
---
* Red Rocket mega stop right near the top of the map
---
Those are just off the top of my head. There's are more than this in both areas.
---
If they don't want people checking out their camp, they should lock their doors to discourage it
---
And the day after.
---
Was your church built in the ash area of the map? Because if so I saw it and it was amazing!
---
Like the time me and my friend got so bored we tried to kill a scorchbeast by bashing it with cameras!
---
Lol, auto correct I promise.
---
That would be nice but it'd basically be an exploit for dupers to get as many modules at they want. 
---
At least with the current system, they're limited to 150 scrip worth for each character each day.
---
Not at all rude. Just don't do what I do when visiting.
---
I buy ammo  even 3 caps since i dont have fo1, its easyer sell weapons and armor than managing my inventory (always at limit) and switching perks, mainly coz i have materias stored to rrpair my armor and weapons, im lvl 205.
---
I put off the raid for the same reason initially. It's not you, it's the game. It genuinely leads you to believe there are serious consequences to choosing sides. And in FO4 (at least) that was the case.
---
lol what is it that you do if you don’t mind me asking?
---
Yes x one million
---
Now thats a challenge material. 80 atoms at least.
---
Drop all your shotgun shells, pick them back up. Gun is no longer glitched.
---
By working perfectly you mean consistently whifing 95% shots and having to leave and reenter VATS to hit ?
---
If so, yes its working perfectly and when it hits, yes it triggers Magic
---
Man THANK you.   I have googled it and never had luck and just gave up thinking I would never know!
---
Treasury notes are worth 10 gold. Don’t worry, you’ll get way more than 90 if you grind the upcoming second helping of Meat Week.
---
Got a toon of each type (big guns, melee, stealth commando, shot guns)  Allot easier to swap that way if you get bored of one style. I find melee frustrating though. Yeah you 1hk everything but its slow even with bloodied ss mmg. Guns w gun foo is way faster.
---
You've got a quadquadquad DB.  Enjoy while it lasts.
---
It is but the ammo is very easy to make.
---
Nah, Mire. See, dime a dozen!
---
There’s literally a thumbs down emotes aka “no”
---
This AMAZING! Awesome Job!!!
---
I believe the idea is that you use the time to scrap your CAMP, then move home to the hillside above, and build serval turrets amongst the rocks.
---
Im so impatient to get the ammo legendary perk just for this weapon !
---
I can guarantee you is nt related to internet speed, i have fiber internet and I load pretty late, but i have been told ssd does make significant changes in load time.
---
We can’t even figure out how to build ladders.
---
Very good sir.
---
How do you have time for this?
---
Looks likes like we got a modern day prometheus over here!
---
Bethesda : "poor player detected"
---
Use wwr armor or sturdy frame perk and you can hold 100s of items and keep playing.
---
Maybe just one....
---
A found a huge bag of plans near a train station yesterday and just took what I didn't know. There were still a lot left over, I hope more ppl found it.
---
I’m more worried about scorchbeast than anything, your welcome to join, it’s going to be at 8pm EST
---
Yeah so I found out!! When I was playing yesterday, I actually ended up leaving it not wired up, sat on a toilet. A novelty item but agreed, expensive if overused!!
---
One of my favorite things to do as well. Fill that bad boy up with plans and walk into the sunset.
---
Well it took me 20 minutes to walk from the rusty pick to Vault 76 and it’ll be at 8pm EST plus I have a plan, so maybe 2 hours at most
---
I'm not level 400,  but I have a switch to turn off my vendors when I'm near max caps.
---
Earle dropped me a BE 50cal the other day  ... a moment I will never forget. Stocking up on ammo and then I'll be respec'ing my main to Bloodied PA Heavy. Rifles will be handed down to one of my alts.
---
I walk away from vendors that sell basic ammo for more than 1c. I understand more expensive stuff like plasma, 2mm or 40mm. But no way In hell am I paying 2c for .45
---
Find myself dumping plans all the time as they just take up space and are pretty worthless once you know them. Dont really blame the dude!
---
Although it does not get nuked often, Toxic Valley is full of violet flux, and wavy willards has the highest concentration of critters in the area to get HRF, hardened mass, and glowing mass.
---
The bad part about nuking the valley (especially before WL) was there are not many places with chem benches - which is the crafting station you need to stabilize flux.
---
I have a free machine full of all my plans at my camp. I'm not a new player friendly camp (expensive guns) so I have free machine with all my plans and 1* legendaries. I feel you should leave my camp with something.
---
We were crafting and didnt notice.
---
Encryptid is more difficult than SBQ. You want more than that?
---
30 days of faction dailies would be about 180 treasury notes, perhaps more. You can do the one Settler Daily and usually just one of the two Raider Dailies, each for 3 Treasury Notes. 
---
Also, Davenport’s photo mission gets you 3 Treasury Notes.  So that’s 90 more. 
---
Also treasury notes are awarded from Public Events (the ones with the ‘!’ inside the hexagon), between 2-4. The new ACP event awards 8, IIRC. 
---
You can only turn in 20 TNs every day (technically every 20 hours), so that would be a maximum of 720 TNs exchanged in 30 days (more likely 600, though). 
---
Each Treasury Note gets you 10 Gold, so that’s 7200 Gold. 
---
Also, you can buy Gold from Smiley in The Wayward each week. Up to 300 for 6000 caps. So in 30 days that’s about 1200. 
---
That’s about 8400 Gold possible. The max you can hold is 5000 Gold. No limit on Treasury Notes.
---
We all have our perspectives. We don't have to agree to respect someone's opinion, no matter how annoying that may or may not be :)
---
Though I could probably do with a little stepping back and reflection from time to time too.
---
You have my respect sir, for what little that may be worth. I'll have to make sure to remember you name. Though, you don't make it easy 74.
---
With Blocker, Lone Wanderer, Dodgy and Serendipity, I might use a stimpak once a week while doing events and other normal play.  It’s very durable.
---
I like your high endurance idea, but I wouldn’t get too hung up on DR.  I don’t even pay attention to mine, because it’s pretty irrelevant after the damage tries to get through all the percentage perks.
---
I also invest as much as possible into stealth, squeezing out almost every possible bonus.  I’m short a couple agility because poison resist is important.  Without food buffs, my AG is 41.  Neither Earle or the queen has ever spotted me.  Just mole rats and scorpions, but you can’t avoid those.  I think that’s the absolute best defense a stealth build can have, and a lot of players are pretty lazy about maxing it out.
---
I know what you mean.  I only trade with people that I’ve arranged a trade with.  No random on-the-fly trades (someone coming up spamming you with the trade invite emote)
---
When u are able to buy every plan the game lets u buy with caps. Amits pointless to keep them on your person. So instead u save up and max out your mules waiting for cap sink events like treasure hunters or holiday scorched.
---
&gt;It's not the first time everything has been nerfed, but it's the first time everything gets nerfed this severely!
---
i mean not realy we have had few targeted nerfs to broken weapons but never proper nerf all also lets not forget about buffs to enemies 
---
&gt;This is going to make playing a low level character so much harder,
---
low levels will stay similar to what is now the problem starts in 50-100lvl range
---
Only until Tuesday. Well that may not be entirely true. I think all energy weapons are dropping in relative power actually.
---
They are duper’s. They can already get as many modules as they want. You know, through duping.
---
"How come this thing I just now thought of doesn't already exist?". You'd fit right in with the users for whom I write software.
---
It's quite possible the designers just didn't consider that feature, or didn't want to spend the extra time to implement it
---
Sbq area has tons I picked up over 150 violet 60 crimson in about 30mins. Plus 3 legendary sq and 2 Glowers.
---
so name few of these "rare" plans :V
---
It was right on my house though...There wasnt any houses around me, usually isnt either since its kind of remote. Could have easily been kept me out of the blast if that was the case.
---
Main problem there is, in short, people.  Some players will just clean out a vendor if they see anything for zero caps, either to resell or just because they can.  
---
I tried doing freebies few times, for ammo and other consumables.  I had visions of helping out a newer player with a fast infusion of ammo and stimpacks, but invariably it's some L200+ in full power armor and a legacy gun that cleans it all out.  Just not worth the stash space to try.
---
I've found that I've been getting crippled a lot more often in the PTS rebalance, especially during the Daily Ops.
---
The nerf hits weapon mods and perk cards, this is enough to hit non legendary weapons for low levelled characters to have a harder time of it!
---
Also 2 patches after the TSE nerf there was a nerf that hit every weapon by 10%, I was taking screenshots of all of my weapons at the time to compare damage before and after each patch!
---
You know what, you make a fine point. 
---
Still not a fan of the idea but at least you have me on that point.
---
Some people must, if they continue selling at that price, but I flat out refuse to. I'll craft it myself first. I won't sell it higher than 1 and I sure won't buy higher.
---
Subscription ended boss
---
Mentioning my sobriety was to give context as to what this game means to me- it literally is the thing that saved my physical life on some days. Maybe knowing that would validate the thought that I'm not trying to bitch for the sake of bitching?
---
And why did I say that I think people who completed LR must play 24/7? Because that's how it feels! I seriously stressed over this and really tried where I could- I don't do events, but I did for LR. I don't do nuclear winter, but I did for LR. I'm usually a solo player who enjoys casual building and occasionally killing a few super-mutants or ghouls, and with not being home I felt a lot of pressure when it came to doing this.
---
I really didn't think people would be so negative, and honestly thought other people felt the same way considering the amount of posts I see complaining about the game. Clearly, I was wrong. I've learned my lesson, and fun fact- these kinds of responses is why I avoid online communities and am terrified to even try engaging online, because I DO see you all as hardcore players who spend far more time on the game than I do and like I'm going to get shit on for asking questions other people will think i'm dumb for asking. I've been playing for over a year and am at lvl 84, and I know that's piddly compared to others because of my play style. I know that's on me, and I like playing the way that I do. But this... is just sad. I didn't know the audience and I know better to just not ever post again. Thanks.
---
I just use the variant of the thumbs down that’s waving your hand with a red circle
---
Exactly this. The greenhouse is the only thing I really want. And I have to grind all the way to the end to get it and I am not looking forward to that. Sure I finished the last one with about 2 1/2 weeks to spare but it just felt tedious. I haven’t even maxed out all the relationships with the settlers and the Raiders because I don’t feel like grinding.
---
Funny thing about that, it was a typo long ago. It was supposed to be ‘73’. And apparently Reddit doesn’t let people change their username. 
---
Could be worse. It could have been u/XxXMastahBlastah_BootyDestroyer_420Blazer_69XxX
---
Didnt know that...How does that work? I pretty much built my base and havent done anything to it since I started playing.
---
If youre on PC, we can work something out.
---
But as said, the goal is to trade this weapon for an heavy with the same rôll
---
I always sell at 1 cap for ammo, there’s no point in selling above that when you can just craft a ton of it with like 20 minutes of farming, the only kinds of ammo that have a justifiable reason to be sold above 1 cap is honestly ultracite ammo and only really certain kinds of it imo
---
it's a general problem we are getting the error message "not connected", "object is floating" or simple is red when it shouldn't be. how about you just play the game and enjoy building camps, you will see what i mean really fast. alternative, just search this sub for the thousands of complainants about camp building restrictions.
---
when the legendary perks com out i am going to attempt to max out legendary endurance for more health
---
2? I’ve just come across camps selling .45 for 25 caps each. Capitalism baby.
---
I genuinely wonder what goes on in redditors' minds that they are incapable of understanding an opposing viewpoint without projecting strong emotions on to it
---
First gun I got from purveyor during sale was a bloodied faster fire rate 1perception lmg
---
That would be way too difficult to implement. What if you unequip the backpack then unequip the perk? What if you unequip the perk but still have the backpack? What if you put the backpack in the stash and then unequip the perk,?
---
Dang, I bought one yesterday for 7k xD
---
Still worth it, fingers crossed for RNGesus to smile upon me for the sale.
---
Having low chances ? why dont you just trade the best roll you got for the weapon you need ? Thats also part of the game and it requires only to be Lucky once.
---
what a sad life

I payed 24th August for the subscription like said in my post so that’s not it?
---
Legendary modules cost 50 scrip, a 3* weapon sells for 40 scrip that is heavily time gated. What is it supposed to be? 1% for a module per star? .5%? People will just bitch even more about it
---
Didn’t they patch that out months ago?
---
My friend is using an ssd and I am not, which is also something we have puzzled over. I guess we can just assume Todd is playing favorites.
---
Encryptid was easy for me, just get a few people and bam, free 1* nocturnal pipe pistol. This is ACTUAL endgame content
---
I just put all my known plans for free in my shop
---
oof
---
I don't know, the level 100 guy flying through the map punching everybody's heads off seems to be a bit of a concern
---
Not at all!! Come in, enjoy yourself. I built my camp with love and care. Getting positive feedback from people melts my heart.
---
Not sure if it will be an issue of survivability but it definitely sounds like I will be using gun fu and serendipity to try and kill fast and survive.
---
Maybe if you didn’t post with a negative attitude and just asked a simple question (instead of going on a rant that you thought would give you emotional support from strangers) you’d have better responses. 
---
You seriously don’t see how including an insult in your post was detrimental to getting positive replies?  Really?
---
Let me give you an example:
---
——-
---
**Question:  Why is the board for The Legendary Run still in the menu screen?**
---
*It doesn’t look like you can buy the ranks, so I’m not sure why it’s still there. Anyone have an idea?  Thanks!*
---
No insults. Just the question. 
---
No fishing for sympathy. Just the question. 
---
No attitude. Just the question. 
---
Try that next time.
---
I'm level 400 and I keep my vendor on like to help lower levels with all the plans I grind constantly doing events etc. But now I've finished buying every single robot vendor plan I've no need for caps unless find outfits or weapons I want so I max out constantly.
---
Can I be the courier? 👀
---
I got backpacks three times and didn’t feel bothered.  I guess I just have a lot of patience.
---
I dont have first, but some of my friends do.  They have had issues where their atomic shop items and first subscription have been MIA until a relog or restart.
---
It seems to he temporary but if it persists I would recommend braving the support system in an attempt to get a response.
---
Basically any glitch or exploit specifically used for a purpose other than the development teams original purpose or some such
---
I keep having to shut mine off due to reaching the cap limit and not finding anything new to spend my caps on 😔
---
Close the game completely and restart it, worked for me yesterday.
---
Defo needs to be more time on the reset it used to start at over half hour now just gives you minites.
---
I wouldn’t not because I’m a good guy I just don’t sell plans
---
This! I often find it distracted by other shiny objects outside of the quests boundaries... If you can kill the other things that have it distracted it'll generally go back within the event bounds again. Sometimes it's enough to just get it's focus on you and start walking back to the event area.
---
Mine said I didn't have 1st last night, I had to exit the game and log back in. I noticed that the atomic shop was also greyed out when it didn't recognize my 1st. I play on steam and have a year sub.
---
the nerf to non legendary characters is small enough to not be miningfull. As i said the problems will start after level 50 when you stop getting stronger while enemies get stronger
---
&gt;Also 2 patches after the TSE nerf there was a nerf that hit every weapon by 10%
---
Tbh i dont remember this but you maight be right so not gonna argue with that
---
Hahahahahahahaha
---
That's litterally the definition of confirmation bias pal 
---
Data miners have looked into it. Unless there is some crazy hidden code that they can't find for some reason than I'm going to go with actual data every time
---
I sell all my ammo for 1 cap a piece.  It’s no use to me, so why charge more?
---
That's where I usually hit for violet flux because of the mass amount there and it's v easy to spot
---
I forgot you're not allowed to have emotions on the internet, my apologies.
---
GT: LAWRENCEANDHENR - feel free to join if you're online. Me and a few guys play evenings, very laid back, but we tend to run a lot of events.
---
Very cool
---
Did it 2 days ago. So i don't think so
---
You wouldn’t be interested in my group then, the brotherhood of zeal. We are like the brotherhood of steel only way more militant.
---
They have talked about adding additional fallout 1st rewards to the seasons but nothing has been confirmed yet. I wouldn't count on it being anything spectacular even if it does happen. I've learned to keep my expectations low and be surprised when something good comes out
---
My IGN is the same as my reddit.  Pm me yours unless you are fine just posting it as a reply.  If we happen to be on at the same time I'll hook you up, but I won't be on until this evening if I actually get on at all.  Don't know for sure.
---
My main 410 only has legacies and god rolls so aint nothing cap worthy. All i can really do is sell ACP plans maybe slip in the odd B rated weapon.
---
Interesting concept and I like it....but complex.
---
Oof. Feeling contact stress from how the last moments of that encounter must have been.
---
F indeed, by all meanings of that term.
---
I guess so. The 60x be an conduit at encryptid and cooking and photo modes etc are a pain in my ass
---
You're very right. I got it back for the Ranger armor back then because I just love NV too much. Haven't really cancelled it since then, all kinda lackluster rewards since then
---
Either mules or they’re paranoid like me about this speculated potential vendor stash glitch. I removed and stored all my vendors because I saw people posting that some of their items have disappeared
---
People were nuking on ps4 last night.  Both acp and scorched earth lit up
---
Or you can just make an alt, I have several of them.  When I Double XP weekend comes around you can level them up fast.
---
If it wasn't for the limit they couldn't have the sale.  \*facepalm\*
---
Hey thanks I had restarted the game and didn’t work but I reset my whole laptop and that seemed to do the trick, thank you!
---
https://fed76.info/
---
Flint ignited weapons should be all at once
---
Fed76.info can give you an idea
---
hey restarting game didn’t work so I restarted my laptop and that did, thanks for your help :)
---
Yeah I agree, i got it solely for the scrapbox and so far that and the monthly atoms are the only reason I keep it lol
---
Look at that graph again and keep in mind that most enemies hit for about 30 damage.
---
After One Wasteland, the highest hit is 130 Poison Damage.
---
Love how detailed and elaborate it is
---
That's good mate, happy to help. 👍
---
I'd suggest joining a 76 discord and asking around.
---
Price check posts don't go down well here with the mods and Fed76 is a joke as pretty much everything there is overpriced and the dev admit themselves that their data is biased (doesn't include any in-game pricing).
---
I’ve flown across the map before, from bottom left to top right. Never touched the ground, not in power armor. 10/10 would do again
---
Being unable to place numbers on the vendor isn't a bug just because you don't like it
---
Not sure if anyone mentioned it yet, but those files are stored locally, so it would be a hassle to load them for everyone on the server to view them.
---
I do have the secret service jetpack, how exactly would you do that?
---
I can relate. The saddest moment for me in Fallout 4 was when Gunners attacked Sanctuary Hills and killed a settler who had been keeping watching since just after the settlement's initial build-up, which at that point was many days worth of play time. Kinda lost interest in the specific playthrough after that.
---
How long does this take you? How much steel do you get? They all drop low steel yield weapons.
---
I’m only in the 260s, but for me, vending is becoming a headache, and I may just be shutting mine down for good. Watching Reddit for any reports of glitches that can lead to inventory theft, because there’s a real history there. Metering what goes in the vendor to avoid going over max caps. And there’s the constant monitoring of the market dynamics ... what’s the meta, what’s the going rate for plans, what’s rare, what effect are the bullion items having on legendary pricing, etc. So yeah, at level 400 plus, makes total sense why someone would scrap their vendors for good.

**Fallout 76: Inside the Vault – Daily Ops Preview**
---
Welcome back to Inside the Vault! This week, we’ve got a new Dev Dive video to share with you as we explore what Daily Ops will bring to Fallout 76 in Update 22. We also have one more check-in on Fortifying ATLAS now that it has come to an end.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
**Daily Ops Dev Dive &amp; Preview**
---
Prep your gear and round up your squad, because instanced, randomized, repeatable encounters called “Daily Ops” are coming to Fallout 76 with Update 22 on September 15. We recently sat down with Steve Massey and Don Etgeton from the development team to discuss their thoughts on what you can expect from Daily Ops and what it took to bring them to the game. Catch our latest Dev Dive video below, and then read on to learn everything you’ll need to know to prepare for your first Operation on patch day.
---
**Introducing Daily Ops**
---
Every time you join a Daily Op you’re going to step into a different instanced location and receive objectives to complete that will differ depending on the Daily Op mode. Our first mode will be called “Uplink,” in which you will secure a series of uplinks that will help you track down and destroy creatures who threaten Appalachia. All the while, you will square off against enemies from a single faction, like Robots or Super Mutants, who sport deadly mutations that will make them uniquely challenging to take down. If you manage to complete the objectives and neutralize the threat, you will be rewarded with some loot, XP, and in-game currency for your efforts.
---
You will be able to take part in Daily Ops alone or in team of up to four players. You can also complete Daily Ops as often as you’d like, though certain rewards can only be achieved once per day. We’ll dig into the rewards a bit more in a moment. For now, let’s take a look at the ever-changing aspects of Daily Ops that will keep you on your toes.
---
A New Challenge Every Day
---
With Daily Ops, we’re aiming to bring more repeatable and challenging content to the game that you can jump into on a regular basis, which has been highly-requested by some of our more experienced players. To help achieve this, Daily Ops locations, enemies, and enemy mutations will be randomized every day, so that you have a fresh and exciting experience every time.
---
We’re particularly excited to implement randomized enemy mutations, which are unique effects that will apply to all enemies you encounter in a Daily Op. For example, creatures that explode on death, or that can only be killed by a melee hit will challenge teams to work together and strategize how to take them down efficiently. Along with the combination of different locations to explore and enemy factions to take on each day, we feel that Daily Ops will offer lots of variety every time you join up. Below, we’ve included more details about the different randomized elements you will encounter in Daily Ops:
---
Locations: The Burrows, The Burning Mine, Valley Galleria, or Vault 94
---
**Additionally, with Update 22, you will now also be able to explore Vault 94 even when you’re not in a Daily Op.**
---
Enemy Factions: Super Mutants, Blood Eagles, or Robots.
---
Enemy Mutations: Creatures will receive one of the following mutations in a given Daily Op, in addition to “Piercing Gaze,” which will apply during all “Uplink” Daily Ops:
---
* Piercing Gaze: Enemies have greatly enhanced perception of players
---
* Volatile: Enemies will explode on death
---
* Active Camouflage: Enemies will be cloaked when not attacking
---
* Resilient: Enemies can only be killed by a melee attack
---
* Freezing Touch: Enemy attacks will freeze players
---
**Claim Your Rewards**
---
As mentioned above, you can play through Daily Ops and receive a base set of rewards as many times as you’d like. However, there are three reward tiers that offer even better loot if you manage to complete a Daily Op within certain time limits: Initiate, Paladin, and Elder. You can achieve these once per day, and the higher the tier you reach, the better chances you’ll have at unique loot. Here are the time limits for each reward tier.
---
* Initiate Tier — 16 minutes or less
---
* Paladin Tier — 12 minutes or less
---
* Elder Tier — 8 minutes or less
---
As an example of the rewards that are possible from just one Elder Tier run, you can get the following: a large XP grant, two in-game currency grants, two legendary items, and a “care package” consisting of ammo, first aid, and explosives. Additionally, you will a chance at unique items, such as a new, customizable melee weapon called the War Glaive, as well as a C.A.M.P. item that can cure diseases! We’re also planning to add to the rare item list in the future to keep the rewards for Daily Ops feeling fresh.
---
While the heartiest adventurers will be able to complete Daily Ops alone, we do recommend teaming up with at least one other player if you plan on seeking out Elder Tier rewards. Likewise, while lower-level characters can participate and have an impact on Daily Ops due to the changes coming with One Wasteland, we still recommend them for characters who are level 50+.
---
Once your Daily Op is complete, you’ll be able to view an after-action Operation Report. These screens will show you how fast you managed to complete the Daily Op, which reward tiers you reached, and a list of the rewards you earned (except for XP and currencies).
---
**Ready for Action!**
---
Now that you’ve got the basics, you’re nearly ready to join your first Operation! After Update 22 arrives, you will find a new World Activity tracker on the Map screen. The tracker will list any Daily Ops that are currently available, and you can select an Op from the list to learn more about it, including which location, enemies, and mutations you’ll face when you load in. You will also be able to enter Daily Ops directly from the tracker by clicking the “Join” button.
---
Speaking of teams, we’re making a few tweaks to Public Teams in Update 22, as well. We’ve renamed the “Building” team type to “Casual” to better fit with how players were actually using it, and removing the old Casual team bonus. In its place, we’ve added a “Daily Ops” team type, which offers bonus XP for completing Daily Ops (+25% bonus XP to start, +100% bonus XP for a fully bonded team). We hope this will give you even more reason to join a few friends to take on Daily Ops together.
---
As a reminder, Daily Ops are still available for play testing in the Public Test Server (PTS) for those of you who own a PC copy of Fallout 76 through Bethesda.net. You can also earn a special Pennant for your C.A.M.P. in the live version of the game by completing 8 Daily Ops in the PTS. The PTS will remain available until Monday, September 14, so we hope to see you there!

Fortifying ATLAS Concludes
---
Congratulations, Dwellers! Over the past few weeks, you came together to deliver tons of supplies to help construct a new Appalachian HQ for the Brotherhood of Steel at ATLAS Observatory. We, and Russell Dorsey, couldn’t be prouder! Thank you all of you who shared your hard-earned supplies with Russell and the Brotherhood. Now, it’s time to kick back and enjoy the fruits of your labor.

**A Second Helping of Meat Week**
---
That’s not all! By turning in over 200,000,000 glass last week, the community has also secured another round of the Meat Week Seasonal Event. Grahm and Chally will be back in the Forest and ready to start grilling when the event returns on September 22. We’ll share another reminder with you in the coming weeks as we get closer to this sizzlin’ Seasonal Event.
---
I'm looking forward to exploring Vault 94
---
You have to have a -15% damage while blocking armor piece for it to work...
---
Just the Daily OPs video from ItV

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb--XSNTsBk&amp;feature=emb\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb--XSNTsBk&amp;feature=emb_title)
---
I'm on pc I sell all my ammo at one cap, except for, plasma cores they go for 25 ea.
---
Honestly have no clue what you mean. Yes Ive heard people have this issue but I dont. Never have. Every now and then I miss the first shot, but have never missed 2 in a row.
---
Ive had that problem with my gatling gun. But not with the gauss shotty. There was also a problem a while back where you couldnt charge it in VATS but that has been fixed and I can take down Early with the shotty ussing charged critical headshots.
---
With the secret service jetpack. With the right perks, right gear, right build, you can launch yourself from your camp or any workshops with the springboard trap. Line it up right and you can get anywhere in the game with some practice. 
---
Here’s a demo: https://youtu.be/nbYemhMfq3E
---
Still blows my mind that not a lot of people know that straight up flying is a thing in this game
---
Good catch
---
You can have emotions.
---
You just have to understand that other people might have emotions in reaction to your emotions.
---
You seem to not understand that. You’re not the ‘main character’ and we aren’t your ‘NPCs’.
---
Tbh I have NEVER been lucky on the Pourveyor or with enemy drops. The luckiest I've been is with an Instigating LMG that I use myself.
---
I never really got the chance to play with high agility. I played my sniper build with a Bolstering set for a long time (not that great). I just got her a full unyielding set recently. I'm just to busy on my main and this commando to test her. But i never really bother with that as she always cleared adds like a god..."Gun fu" forever ! I need to update her Character builder link tho.
---
I also have a Shotgun build near lvl 85 and also got him an Unyielding set but same issue. I'm too busy. He was on a Bolstering build too....so tanky man lol : https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1773f8&amp;d=sd2so2sp2sg2sf2p00ej4eh1c72cm2ir2a72as2a12am2l71la2lg2a02&amp;w=au2lu2e31c13&amp;m=c24fe3&amp;am=172a38-172a38-172a38-172a3a-172a3a&amp;wp=w9&amp;wm=142036
---
I'm a lil scared to try playing him in unyielding armors, but i need to try lol.
---
Anyway ✌
---
with 50 seconds to go and about 30% health left, I thought to myself
---
'this is fine, I just need to pop a stim, repair my flamer and reload, there's plenty of time left'
---
but then the kit didn't work. and the stim didn't pop. and his health wasn't going down. and every single wendigo was swarming me because we couldn't be bothered to kill them.
---
and then the server kicked us out. a valiant effort all in all, I suppose.
---
Honestly, I'm going to have to agree.  This is why I can't for the life of me get passed level 20-25 on ESO because the leveling gets so boring.  I can see why they scale everything to you since it opens more quests and the like.  But man the combat gets so repetitive as damage is the same throughout leveling.
---
Nice once I get on I'll send you a friend request so I can give 1 to u.
---
It's good for a month, then cancel. 
---
I hoarded a lot of ressources in March, I have enough scrap left for probably a year.
---
So.. is One Wasteland coming on the 15th as well? I cant tell if it is or isn't based on that articles writing. On this article it says these are for update 22 but on the One Wasteland article it just calls it "an update" in September and what about the Legendary perk cards as well?
---
The only Nuka product you can learn to make are Nuka Nade, Nuka Quantum Nade and Nuka cola dark, quantum paint for X-01 pa, Nuka Cola Paint for T-51b, Nuka Cola Clock and nuka cola vaccinated from the wastelanders  main quest
---
The nuka cola vaccinated
---
Vending is a PITA, caps are BS, there is no item for item trading mechanics, and despite everything awesome having been duped to hell everyone wants a years worth of adrenochrome for a BE Laser.
---
Having those locations mean something, is something.
---
Thumbs down then follow up with the heart
---
You can do PP alone. Just buff one feederd to max. And go protect the low level one. Between rounds use FF on the high level animal and go back to protecting the low level. You only need two survivors for the best rewards. Granted this is not recommend for low level players, but end game players no problem.
---
Thanks friend.
---
That should be the go to dump
---
Does it really matter if the duppers do this, they can't trade legendary module stuff so it would only effect them really?
---
I have two unyielding pieces of armor that I want to upgrade for better pieces, but I’d gain 100 lbs or more if I lose my current weapon weight reductions on those two items. 😕
---
That's good news- I just found one for sale and got it. Can you elaborate on what mods work out best for it? Thanks!
---
Thx👽💚
---
Kyle Rittenhouse fanclub simulator
---
If I can't take my ally with me, there is no point in me wasting a precious set of my PA.
---
Nuka Dark is a learnable plan from BIV
---
I visit everybody's camp and open all the doors.
---
It's a quick swap bug. You're fine. Enjoy.
---
&gt; a C.A.M.P. item that can cure diseases!
---
Wow, this alone will make me overcome my social anxiety and join a team.  Or maybe just buy the overpriced plan from someone else.
---
Yes, Update 22 will be big, from previous posts from Bethesda.
---
Thankfully that's what I'm after. Then again, are legendary perks dropping on Tuesday? Maybe I should just focus on ammo factory.
---
Battle Royale is a frustrating game mode if you suck at combat, I spend more time waiting/ running around than I do in combat, where I die most of the tkme. Why not add in a team deathmatch mode?
---
I do, attaching the mods that made my combat shotgun - 6 range has destroyed its dps permenantly.
---
How is the Junkies that much stronger than the Berserkers they are both 50% what is making the Junkies higher, do you have some DR?
---
I sell ammo for 1 cap, but I don't mind paying more for some types. Caps are useless most of the time.
---
Its that medical scanner tube thingy you get scanned with in the nuke silos. You get one for your camp.
---
99% of the teams I join literally no one talks. I like it that way, don't worry about it, trust me. :)
---
I´m still one shooting everything in VATS with the armor and the range bug
---
Looks dope. I’m ready.
---
Even restoring the mods back to normal it still only does 1-2 damage now, it's permenantly borked.
---
I like what I see, everything in there sounds cool except the “enemies can only be killed with a melee hit” thing.
---
I noticed vaccinated. I was curious on the others thanks!!
---
I think the ice machine is safe. A friend of mine was using it at one point. Haven’t checked it personally tho.
---
I thought so but with how these past updates have been with them leaving shit out because they were still broken I didn't know if we'd get them all or not.
---
I'm ready to fight lvl100 chickens!
---
What makes a tesla good for pvp? I'm confused.
---
It's a Trap can't be completed unless you run a certain Free States quest.
---
Even then, if it had already been completed once on the server, it won't work again.
---
Sometimes, SB gets preoccupied aggroing other things nearby. If you play with low render distance, you'll never notice.
---
Your guess is as good as mine. I run at 1DR with two addictions and my junkies weapons clean house against my beserkers weapons.
---
Can't wait for these, specially loovve that BoS Spec ops outfit. Gives me S.T.A.L.K.E.R/Metro vibes. I can't waaaait. The photo opportunities alone..
---
I use the cigarette machine to the right daily between five characters and have never had a problem.
---
I assume Legendary Perks will be as well... they've been in PTS for a while and they haven't really messed with them lately.  It doesn't seem like they are waiting on anything for those.
---
One Wasteland is going to be disruptive, though.  I don't think I can possibly overstate this.  A lot of people are going to be upset come Tuesday.  Things will be difficult, at least until we learn how to best overcome them and learn new tactics.
---
I actually hated people who would have their camps next to the golf course, I'd destroy it, then get my buddy to kill me and give me all my caps back. You're probably gonna get some shit for admitting you were one of those people, I've not been on reddit for long but everyone I know and have met playing hated those camps parked outside the gold club with turrets lol.
---
I got a vampire fixer and a bloody laser rifle that are both pretty sweet.
---
Technically, you can now report bush wookies for "intentionally losing".
---
Right?! Gotta admit Earle has become a bit of a big softy, I've got all the rewards to. As much as I love the game this update was much needed.
---
i cant wait to build with the new instanced interior...pretty sure thats also coming with update 22
---
I cancelled for a month, but then I realized anytime I ran out of some scrap, I'd need to store new scrap in my stash. 
---
Also, I like the private world for nuke testing/farming.
---
The ATOMS are a bonus.
---
This coming from a guy who plays maybe 5 hrs/week.
---
Me too heart/thumbs down/ heart. I play all 5 toons and one is only 46 right now so people try and give me stuff all the time.
---
I’m over here sharpening my super sledge
---
What happens to you junk after you cancel tho?
---
What do you mean? Build with the new instances interior?
---
I am super excited. Love the look of daily ops
---
I follow the sub as well, just figure I’d try here first cause I do like doing in depth stuff and I know the game pretty well, so I dont really want anything like just fucking-around-casual if that makes any sense
---
Earle and the Queen are gonna be too much of a sink after the nerf. better put in as many fights as you can now.
---
Ha.  I voluntarily take the pylons at least once a week.  We must have very different ideas of fun.
---
You know that you don’t have to do every badge, right?  It’s been a while, but I got the backpack and high capacity mod on my third character in maybe two four hour play sessions.  The tadpole challenges can be knocked out in a couple hours easy.
---
Yeah I'm hoping so. I want a reason to play again lol. It seems like most people are finally happy with the perk cards except for 1 big issue (the cards aren't account wide but the points are) but I'm gonna assume this is as good as we will get since we've been able to stop them from pushing the update out for this long.
---
How’re we lookin’ today? 😊
---
You found Captain Autism and his merry band of agoraphobes.
---
Their Fallout 1st subs ran out (spent all the money on tendies) and now they are forced to play with randoms. This is bad Reeeeeee don't come to their camp even if they have things for sale. Those items are meant for the NPCs to buy.
---
Just came out a few minutes ago
---
The LMG is probably my favorite. The hills are alive with the sound of BRRRRRT.
---
Me to, my smile grew as I was reading it all. Be nice to actually explore Vault 94 without worrying a cricket is gonna stealth kill you from behind. 😂
---
I always hit the button when I pass one of these, but never stick around to see if it worked. Guess there are others who do this.
---
Hello Bethesda one. 
---
Adrealine is up to date, problem is 100% solve with the adrealine profil for 76!
---
I’ve tried a few by now, and I do like that style and I enjoyed my factions. I’m just not that into that grind at the moment anymore
---
I'm really looking forward to One Wasteland and getting loot scaled to me. I'm also keen to try the Daily Ops and get back into the groove of a new season.
---
free notes I guess
---
still need 300 for my T65 set
---
Definitely, it's all I've really been doing. Grinding levels to rebuild if need be or just move things around.
---
My mind/body is ready. In the process of collecting looooads of Flux for making Ultracite ammo. Siiince it's actually viable due to the new ammo perk. Can't waaaait. Plus mobs will now drop it when ya kill 'em (only in daily ops and Earle)
---
No doubt. Fighting Earle is definitely better than the queen (even after having all the rewards many times over), but once you figure the necessary tweaks it takes to take him down he’s pretty damn easy. I like what I see in the daily ops and liked the gameplay I’ve seen. Looks way better than the V94 raids. I know a lot of people liked them. And I’d like to think I’m a solid heavy hitter in events like that but I was also too casual of player to grind that dungeon more than twice. I’m stoked.
---
Appreciate the info, I forget ppl are actually playing the update already. Well that said I hope it doesn't flop.
---
I pick them all up because I think that if I dont I will be like ungrateful or something like that
---
soylent green
---
It's completely doable, but I'd say the value of the card would lo d need to be higher like 4 or 5.
---
Will def check it out later, Im usually on around the same time so that’s cool.
---
That is not coming with update 22, where on earth did you hear that?
---
Lol.... I’ve been looking for one for a while.  Everyone trading them seem to only want bloodied/junkie legacy weapons so slim chance I’ll ever get one.  I do all those events every time I login too.
---
I frequently hit the cap limit, turn them off until I've spent until I'm less than 10k, then turn them on again.  I only sell chems, rare plans, and top shelf legendaries.  The rest is give aways.
---
Once you hit a certain point, with the low limits on caps, scrip, bullion, notes, just not worth the hassle to run a vendor and play the inventory management game.
---
I already see floater grenades are included in daily ops rewards. Pretty pretty please can we NOT do that again?? I would literally rather get nothing than get burdened with something I have to dig through a menu to drop.
---
How is that different than now, if i have the chemist backpack mod on, i don't have traveling pharmacy on, but if I jump into power armor, i have to go into my cards and put traveling pharmacy back on to lower my weight.  I just would like to be able to use more than one mod on my backpack, if i unequip the legendary then i guess it would remove one of the mods, yes to implement would probably mess up something,  but right now i know several mods and can only use one.
---
Yeh I liked the raids, got most of the plans except 4 pieces of the strangler. Since bought them form Regs though, just grinding for modules and steel now to make a thorn set, well a half decent wet. Totally agree with ACP, that said I do enjoy it still. Great for that xp to lol, I find it addictive grinding levels 😂
---
You don't need to be.
---
Now where the hell am I gonna put my Symptomatic... 
---
No room next to the Rad Shower (it’s a pretty cool, fun shower, you see.) 
---
I guess behind my shed. Gotta go behind the shed to cure those damn diseases, Greg. Dirty fool.
---
Haha I know the struggle.  I started playing the game and got to level 200 with 5 pieces wwr armor out of necessity. I've since used mules to get down enough so I can use better armor.  I think the intro of legendary modules helped as I dont really roll weapons at mumbles much anymore. Though, I'm draining all scrip on rolls this weekend so I may be in a similar boat on Monday
---
Understable my dear sir. Have a nice day.
---
I haven't seen anything mentioning a delay but am kind of expecting it. Can't see much mention of the nerf on the itv either come to think of it.?  (pretty please let one wasteland be delayed again...)
---
I can understand that. It's reasonably far back that you actually have to drag them quite a distance outside. I've actually had quite a few people use it to their advantage and bring over level 91 deathclaws and the like, haven't had any hate so far.
---
Haha, same here. I have a lot of ammo to hand but I still love the farming aspect of things, more so flux components. Or ingredients for chems.
---
I have a melee weapon but I don’t think my frail commando ass will do well
---
May as well call it that, have to add humor to Bethesda's products as they don't build any in. Fun is what you make it, amirite? `:)`
---
I've seen that glitch.  Try FTing back to the silo.
---
I would avoid doing this. They will probably fix the glitch and the armor will most likely get deleted. Not worth the risk in my opinion. I dont feel like wasting all that material.
---
I use the suggested quick sale Fed 76 pricing and sell 15k to 20k caps worth on my vendors daily.
---
Yep. There's literally no downside to joining a team. I've never been on a team where I felt like anyone expected anything of me, and if they did they would just kick me out, which is super rare.
---
or at the very least, lose the ridiculous "cant be sold" limitation of them. If anyone can get them through event rewards, then why the hell is our only option to drop them into the aether?
---
Have a link for ITV? I dont see one on their page yet.
---
Sept 3 is the last one posted, other than the atom shop update.
---
Do you mean you do it now? Or back when people literally had their camps outside the golf club doors? The back exit I mean.
---
Is it 100 scrip now for a 3* ranged wep
---
that seems silly given I've taken 2nd place
---
Ammo is the least of my problem in this game haha
---
I talk a lot. I try to revive when I can, sometimes I give stuff away also!
---
You keep it and can use it. You just can't add more to the scrapbox
---
really doubt it, but it could really infuse the game with some new mechanics which is really needed atm.
---
This, it gets annoying opening the map and seeing a lower level at harpers ferry for example, knowing if I fast travel or even load in there, then the enemies are gonna be underwhelming for lack of a better word. One Wasteland is giving me a lot of things I wanted for this game, so I'm excited to say the least.
---
It's Bethesda.  I'm betting Patch 22 will officially arrive with all of its content temporarily disabled.  And vendors will be disabled too.
---
I feel you. After all serum plans and pa mods that i won't even use the only thing i spend on is fast traveling
---
OMG!!! I can't wait for daily ops!! Unique rewards, repeatable fan, loot, hard enemies with random mutations... That's a great direction bethesda!! I hope for more content like this in the upcoming updates..
---
Thanks!
---
Aha!
---
But a barn is literally the one place you would/should close a door... don't want to let the animals out.  lol
---
Now, for the last week, you can't build up near the doors anymore. I'm basically back by the river on one of the greens, a good 400-500+ meters from any buildings where enemies spawn.
---
Those seeds are the only way to make super Stims.
---
I'm so stoked to lose all my damage and builds on 3 characters! it's awesome to start fresh within the Karen one wasteland food build community! (: Hopefully, Beth can nerf full health builds and any other builds that become meta. I imagine a corn soup power build in the future! I'm looking forward to so much this game and community have to offer! it's so awesome to see a game molded by a Reddit sub! so stoked!
---
Mixes up the strategy and forces new playstyle. Melee build not required, take their health down to 1 with any weapon but you will run up and weapon bash to kill.
---
It’s just as annoying as you think it is.  Gun bashing works, but what a PITA it is.  I’ll probably just skip Ops with that feature.
---
A lot of the enemy special abilities in Daily Ops make me think that the devs enjoy a completely different definition of fun than the player base.  Does anyone like invisible enemies or gun bashing?
---
Damn I need some of your luck
---
I'm always buying plans that i don't know :)
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7lqQXufKYGP9JJNV8SWPyR/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-daily-ops-preview
---
i have a full health heavy gunner with a vamp gatling ultracite laser faster fire.
---
i can solo it on that character tanking the pilons and the imposter. only time i die is when im reloading, and i have only failed it once and that was because of lag.
---
i dont have trouble shooter gear or use energy resist buffs
---
but im on pc.....
---
Congrats, you came back from the washroom in time
---
😂🤣😂 It's a nerf across the board and numerous ppl on the PTS have said its not much of a big deal overall. Plenty of videos to see on YouTube about the damage nerf, people still melt most enemies except endgame bosses, I don't see the big deal with that, speed runners will suffer if anyone.
---
Cool-story-bro-moment: fighting Earle, full group... I logged into this server and a bomb dropped as soon as I loaded in. I didn’t have time to prep. I just went. Spent the four minutes before the boulders fell taking buffs instead checking my weapon conditions. Two mags into shooting Earle, my fixer breaks. 15 rounds out my handmade and it breaks, Earle’s is down to 5%. The rest of the squad is dead and respawning and dropping down the mine shaft. All I have left is super sledge and Earle is on top of me. I can’t wait for the others. I swing for the fences and take out his remaining health in one blow. 
---
Morale of the story, even with a full bloody commando build, bloody swing speed strength super sledge is still really really good. Like 1300 points of damage good (after adrenaline and some chems of course).
---
For me too, but only when i dont get the magic effect. With the armor, the number fisplayed dont change buy I 1-2 shit everything
---
What would be a good idea is do a plan meetup. A whole server meets up and drops all their plans.
---
Everyone goes bag to bag only grabbing those they don’t know.
---
Of course, you would have to have some form of trust people wouldn’t take them all anyways, but it would be a good way to get them gone.
---
When the dust settles, the only plans left are ones that EVERYONE in the server knows. You can just leave those because they most likely won’t be used anyways.
---
You use ultracite cores instead of fusion core if you mod a Gatling laser to prime weapon.
---
But with that armor you can do this with any shotgun.
---
Even non legendaries.
---
I never saw the value on using Ultracite, too much materials for little reward. But now thaaat ammo production is increased, hard not to resist using.
---
Ahh ok, my bad. Thought you meant back in the day, used to bug me, that said I don't see many ppl around Whitesprings these days, well not like there used to be.
---
Going to check all these locations now.
---
Sure, I'm sure it works as good as reporting hackers.
---
This is one of the most maddening things to deal with in the game lately. I got killed yesterday during Scorched Earth thanks to this bug. I REALLY hope the devs are aware of this issue, since I haven't seen much posted about it here!
---
Out of 16 tries, I got 5 harpoon guns and 2 bows. I may keep 1 or 2 of the others. And the purv had run out of scrip.
---
Beserkers rolling pin? You mean hunters hunting rifle?!??!
---
Cross our fingers they see this
---
Love being in a lobby with a group of people that know this! Feels great hitting high reward events back to back! Until your overencumbered with 3* pipe wrenches and zealots leather armor lol
---
Yeah and thats the point. You compensate the damage falloff with the magic effect. 
---
Its not that TSE is the best choice, but its just that it is still a good sniping machine if you have magic and range bug activate
---
Well you also get atoms at a cheap price, spend them well.
---
Tf are you on about?
---
I wish someone would help me on Xbox, so that I can send that Assaultron to hell
---
Haha right? They're not going to enforce a damn thing in that new ToS.
---
Who said anything about a bug? 
---
It's a flat surface, so I should be able to add letters (that's their intention in the first place) like on every other surface like statues or vault boys. You mostly cant attach them on pre existing surfaces like rocks or walls from static objects.
---
Can I just say aswell, I also felt like you described at one point then started being more of a team player, actually speaking to people and now when I play, as tedious as some stuff can be I enjoy it more than ever. Update 22 should help to, for what ever it's worth I hope you stay dude. The more the better, especially with a game like this. 👍
---
Yeah the problem is as soon as the magic bug is fixed, the gun is broken and has to be scripted.
---
And also its completely useless outside of vats so I can't even use it for crippling things anymore.
---
Anyone know if daily ops can be joined right away or requires quests to be done?
---
plus strange in numbers benefits probably 90% of players
---
ToS again... sigh... when does this community realize that fallout 76 is not the reason zenimax updated their ToS...
---
I had the same thing happen when I joined a public team. They were all in a silo so I joined them but it wouldn't let me pass one of the laser grids at the mainframe even though all the cores were destroyed and the laser grid wasn't even active. I just used a clipping glitch to by pass it.
---
I gotta have the three star for reduced weight
---
Ty
---
Well I really enjoy this glitch, and something as minor as this won't get you banned.
---
Yah I tried that gauss shotgun for a bit, went back to my tse vats shotgun.  I have a few good combat shotguns that perform better
---
Text chat would be nice tho, for those of us who don't like using voice. Cuz it's only been mentioned a few thousand times before.
---
We've known this for weeks
---
Still mad that the sale isn’t on modules
---
It increases overall damage a little to, especially with legacy lasers. Adding Primed reveivers I mean, so that's the main reason for me, and it's very lucrative haha. I watched a video the other day with the new perk quipped, plus ammosmith and it he produced 450 instead of 100. Crazy.
---
I regret buying plans for the gauss shotgun... it just sits in my stash now
---
The floater grenade rewards pretty much prove they have no idea what we actually want.
---
Mother of god.....
---
do throwing knives/tomahawks etc. count as melee?
---
They were taking it and dropping it on your bed? That's actually kind of funny
---
Well I don't like my doors closed as I usually lock it...
---
This. Fed76 is utter and complete rubbish. Or use the trading discord/sub for price checks. But it will boil down to buyer vs seller. The price will always depend on those two people, not some idiotic site that tell you complete rubbish.
---
Haha its like they don't realize Zenimax owns more than one game.
---
But to say ToS doesn't apply to 76 is just as moronic
---
I’ve seen a few in vendors also saw a nice bloodied swing speed in a vendor recently but didn’t think anyone would be interested in it.
---
They sold for 90% of the price you listed them.
---
Almost as much fun as patrolling Eastern State for 30 minutes...
---
Funny.  It does take more effort and cleverness than a wank.
---
Yeah, it was part of the collector's edition. It's where I started in Fallout, and by the time I became obsessed you couldn't get copies of that edition. I did find it off ebay though. So now I have it on the display with all my other Fallout mech. :)
---
Harpers Ferry
---
Frame drops on console.
---
Hell yeah, finally some combat balancing and more areas to hunt since enemies scale.
---
Yeah that’s going to hurt lol
---
You price your items at any costs, so you priced them at a cost you’re willing to let those items go for. Doesn’t matter who buys them or what they do with them. Buy low, sell high applies to everything being sold by anyone, in game or in real life. So getting mad about it is pointless. It’s going to happen. At least you were able to move your products, they may be sitting on them for quite some time if they’re priced too high. I wouldn’t stress it.
---
Nuke's should be all fixed up and good to go now! :)
---
Hmm I would but my camp is already 100% budget
---
What about the real-deal Overseer Candidates who wank while in combat?
---
I am super excited! :) I just recently finished all my main and side quests (I’m kinda new xD) and love when there are more things to do and work for. I hope these do well and it won’t be hard to get a group. 
---
I am still waiting on some perk load outs though *cough*
---
Yo if you’re on Xbox I’m in the same boat as the dude above me
---
You can kind of tell when you are at beginner camp and there's a collectron or whatever I'll usually leave it alone because they may not know how to lock yet.
---
You gotta specifically server hop to find fresh characters and keep your camp in the forest if you want any hope of selling
---
Somewhat has a bioshock big daddy feelings
---
Sure it applies to fo76, it applies to ALL games. But people are going nuts theorycrafting what bethesda want to change in fallout 76 and stuff. There is simple literally not a single change for us.
---
Theres another side to this. Like that time when I was waiting 5 minutes for a dude to finish up at the legendary vendor so I could by my 10 modules (how do you take that long at that vendor? Theres like 8 items and you're not selling him stuff). So I proposed a trade with him and, when he exited the vendor trade, I interacted with the vendor.
---
Dont be impatient but also don't take forever. Just don't be a dick haha.
---
Another update here! Nuke's are all fixed up and ready to go!
---
It’s been on the PTS for some time now. It is just as dangerous as it looks and will shred your HP if you don’t find cover or kill it quickly.
---
Wow what do you need 2000+ stimpacks for?
---
I can never tell if it’s an actual low level player or someone’s 4th alt character
---
Do they show that in the video, or did.i miss.a PTS image?
---
I know Beth is making it sound like the only way Daily Ops are doable in under the time limit is teamed up but let me assure you they are absolutely solo-able and, once you get used to them, almost (ALMOST) easy to do all by yourself.
---
The key is to be a relatively high level player who isn't afraid to get out of their comfort zone and completely switch their build and afford to burn some level ups to invest in perks you've never thought of having before.
---
Like, if you're a full time VATS stealth commando (like I am) and you jump into your first Daily Op thinking, "I got this" (like I did) and you promptly get your ass handed to you multiple times (like I did) and you spend upwards of 20 minutes doing your first Op and you're thinking "there is no way in hell I'm ever going to get my time down to 8 freaking minutes" (like I did) you might be disinclined to keep trying.
---
But if you've got a couple dozen saved up level ups and you don't mind trying new things (like totally switching over to to a power armor full health melee build one day and an explosive-resistant heavy gunner the next) and you don't mind redoing the same op over and over again until you memorize the layout Groundhog-Day style, then pretty soon (let's say about a week, if only because every day is a little different) you'll be knocking on that 8 minute time pretty reliably.
---
Oh and as a quick aside, if you do not yet have a jetpack on either SS or power armor I highly recommend acquiring a jetpack. Daily Ops quickly becomes a game of shaving seconds off here and there and in some arenas (like the Galleria and the Burning mine) being able to quickly ascend and descend multiple levels is key to that strategy. I'd also recommend investing in perks/armor/mutations that assist sprinting (speed), jumping, landing and fire/explosion resistance.
---
Dude, this game has so many bugs, you think a virus can take down its players? They built immunity to everything.
---
Active camo in Fallout. Interesting
---
every build needs radaways and stims. but to answer your question, junkie's (or maybe AA after the nerf) plus solar armor and the legendary rads perk.
---
unless you mean nuke zones. in that case you'll need PA or a hazmat/CSS regardless.
---
I said 500+
---
Nah! Last one was a disappointment. Creatures not spawning, or taking off in the other direction. Or spawned under the map, it was crazy.
---
I think I saw something similar. I meaaan, it's great for Lmgs at the like, usually I think you're able to get liiike 100 .308 usually? 
---
With the new perk, It's possible to get around 450 .308 rounds. Keep in mind that's Ultracite ammo that's gives ya 450ish rounds per batch now. Which is insane.
---
I think that was back when whitesprings was the goto spot to nuke and people would setup turret camps outside to kill all ghouls.
---
Berserker but you have to be armorless. Otherwise, regular commando without Bloodied/Junkies (so Furious, Anti-Armor, Quad), with Vanguard armor for added survivability
---
The damage is one of it's problems for sure. You can get it to over 700 damage and one-shot with uncharged shots. Even if you don't one-shot, the fire rate is so high you basically insta-kill with 2 or 3 shots. Then the blast radius lets you easily kill people without landing precise shots. 
---
Also hackers and aimbots don't exist on console.
---
Of course I understand that. It is a free market and it is after all just a game.
---
I died just seconds after an event ended...less than 30 secs later one douchebag steals about 200 of my screws and some other stuff, but leaves most of my other junk. Notthemostterribledouchebag.jpg
---
What is legendary rads perk?
---
Where do the pink lights come from, atom shop? If so do you remember what bundle? I have the blue one but want the pink too.
---
Frog Legs as a perk, rather than a mutation. Other than Speed Demon or Chameleon, there's no point in getting mutated.
---
+% damage perks for specific weapons. All it does is limited your choices. We don't get class loadouts and everything is RNG. No other battle Royale has this dumb concept. *The weapon should be deadly because it is in your hands, not your character's hands*.
---
Queue times and Vault 51 lobby duration are abhorrent.
---
No explosive resist gear in the game.
---
...wait, so they only have one game mode available at launch? Because that's what it reads as. That Uplink is the **only** game mode when Patch 22 drops, which **always** has Piercing Gaze (having played it on the PTS, this actually makes sense for this particular game mode) which means stealth is unusable for **all** Daily Ops until they add a new Game Mode.
---
Personally, I run a bananas hybrid build that will only get more bananas with Legendary Perks but...there are gonna be **a lot** of people who are not gonna be happy that they literally can't use one of the core functions of the game for this new content at launch.
---
I'm guessing it's to encourage new playstyles, but that is really not a great way to do it.
---
I do the same, some days ill load stuff up with good stuff that lower level players will have a field day with
---
To the right of the mumbles entrances back in the trashed parking lot is a yellow wooden crate. Used it literally dozens of times for transfers, and you can place camp/tent just a little further.
---
I'm only lvl 139 and I have around 25k caps so most the time I fast travel to low lvl bases and buy there venders out just cause unless they have ridiculous prices like 5k caps for a pipe bolt action rifle, but "you have been insulted" I buy
---
what rads?
---
literally. it gives you rad resistance and heals rads. coming on the 15th.
---
useless for bloodied builds but great for full health ones. the rad resistance still won't be enough for you to survive nuke zones, though.
---
Some Daily Ops tips I've found playing on the PTS:
---
- RESILIENT DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN'T USE GUNS. There's been a lot of confusion around this mutation in the PTS. It means the enemy can only be *killed* with a melee attack: for gunners, this means shooting them down to 1 HP and then closing the gap and pistolwhipping them. Expect a lot of reddit posts from players that don't get it when Resilient debuts.
---
- whether or not you can get Elder rank solo will depend on your build and familiarity with the location/objectives, as well as the enemies and their locations. I'm a humble melee tank build but if I'm plucky I can solo Uplink in 7ish minutes; but if it's in the Burrows or against Freezing enemies it'll be rough or not feasible. Different builds will have varying success solo, but in any case it's more important to stay close to the uplinks than to chase down enemies. You still have to be good at killing though.
---
- once you're familiar with where the uplinks are, head to the next objective a few moments before the current one finishes; this'll save you some time traveling through the dungeon. If you're on a team one guy can head straight for the first uplink while another starts the signal repeater.
---
But was it a dick move on the other players part? Definitely! 
---
I’ve ran into this so often myself, but then just get mad at myself for wanting to have faith high level players don’t screw over low levels I’m trying to help. But it never fails...
---
You should! I drop 1 star legendaries in containers at train stations because the weight isn’t worth the scrip, but i’m sure other players could use it!
---
You get one possum badge per day turning in bug parts.
---
What's so bad about that?
---
Add VIC1OUS-KR3EP
---
Ill add you ive got a card or 2 aswell so we can try at least twice its a rare drop. Ill be on in an hour or so
---
They started out good, but have gotten progressively worse each month. They need to bring back old rewards and leave them in there, and add more variety.
---
I hope they keep adding locations and objectives over time
---
Uh, the damage perks are in Nuclear winter
---
I didn’t even know this was a thing. You got me paranoid now
---
Ughh both. Bestheda haven't released a video/imagines (that I'm aware of). Buut a few people have. 
---
https://youtu.be/B7SKLdJ6LSU
---
This is the video I saw for the outfit ^^. Plus I saw a few pics for it too. Buuut lets be honest. Pictures don't do it justice.
---
 Definitely check this dudes channel out thooough. Been showing off all the PTS/Season 2 stuff. Looks wicked.
---
I had someone do the same thing to me. All my items were items are required to complete scout challenges or event drops from campfire tales tents etc. I even labelled my vending machine as such. Just trying to help players out  and this guy Jack's the prices up by 100% guess that's what you get for trying to help
---
Healing salve mire plan has entered the chat
---
Legit I got my first perfect preserved pie whilst waiting to buy something!
---
What? Ammo perk card?
---
Getting gifted hacked/duped gear has not gotten anyone banned since 2018. Stop fear mongering
---
Not at all!
---
same, and I rolled a B2515 one....
---
That's cute. When I go to an empty purveyor shop and someone enters. They start blasting me with their explosive gatling gun after I have been browsing for .5 seconds.
---
With Resilient you can shoot the enemies down to 1 HP then give them a gentle tap. It's not so bad.
---
There aren’t any perks that stack on the same weapon type (Except Bloody Mess). IE There aren’t two perks that increase heavy guns damage.
---
Not for the weapon/damage debuffs.    
---
I do want to see how the Legendary perks play out.
---
They will never make a good ui in TES or Fallout
---
I just bought it for the ranger armor TBH
---
I like how in the Daily Ops gameplay, you can see exactly how neutered a semi auto handmade has become.  The dude is just plinking away at mutants with death by 1000 paper cuts.  He’s not sneaking and mutants are durable but WTF.
---
Later a guy uses a pump shotgun at point blank out of VATS.  It does roughly 1 pixel of damage.  He swaps to an auto handmade immediately.  Holy Christ.
---
Between this and the last dev gameplay video I’ve seen, they throw more grenades in a five minute video than I do in 1000 hours of play time.  Even a plasma grenade backed up by demo expert does fuck-all versus high level enemies.
---
It worries me that they know how badly all of these things suck, but don’t seem to care.
---
Did you try changing the receiver mod?
---
I go around also collecting known plans to then fast travel to a random low level player (I'm like lvl 25 so I'm also low LOL) and I give them the plans, most of them take them since I assume they DON'T know them, but I had one guy tell me to keep the others and give them to someone else since he knew them. Similar experience to you haha
---
I don't think frog legs should be removed but it is pretty op combined with explosives or gun runner. I think they should increase the cost of gun runner by 1 so people have to choose between gun runner and frog legs.
---
The new legendary perks, one of 'em that's being added with the next update. Ammo Factory I believe it's called? 
---
Fully maxed out increases ammo production by 150%.
---
That super super mutant should be mad dog Malone, after you nuke the penitentiary
---
What is Psycho, Bobble heads and weapon mods?
---
Nerd Rage, Adrenaline
---
That's perfect, thank you!
---
Talk about the cold shoulder.
---
"Sorry babe, this camp ain't big enough for the both of us."
---
For crippling, you xant to use VATS, and damage is totally irrelevant
---
It happened during the last ban wave, that's why it got reversed because so many non dupers where caught up in it!
---
The reason why Wall decor take up so much budget is the clear textures. Imagine having to new textures for each displayed photo each player has loaded. Now imagine the  server having to store them.
---
Agreed. I hate trading with other players. You want some of my stuff. Then buy it at the player vendors
---
That's BS dude
---
Someone duping their first time and getting banned will always cry on reddit
---
What?
---
Weapon mods don’t exist in NW. As for the other two, I don’t actually know if they are affected by the changes or not.
---
We honestly don’t even know if the changes here will apply on Nuclear Winter, because those weapon’s damage are calculated differently already.
---
That’s not completely accurate.  You have about a 10-20% chance of getting a badge from Campfire Tales and scoutmaster dailies.
---
Either way, it’s easy to get a fully modded backpack in a short time with minimal effort.
---
Nope. I love showing mine off. I put allot of work into them. They are never plain jane always something unique about them.
---
Will do, thanks!
---
The video talking about the DO is really interesting, I'm excited to play some DO lol. I haven't checked myself, but I'm going to assume there will be DO challenges that contribute to the seasons right?
---
Well youre really Lucky as I thibk that the vaste majority of the players got VATS issues with this gun. 
---
I heard that it could come from framedrops, so I am going to test again tonight as I now have a really good computer, but frim what I saw on streams, it doesnt even seem to fix the problem.
---
I loathe gear and builds which require me to be gimped.
---
Screws are the real gold for me last couple weeks lol.
---
Yeah they do. Otherwise the weapons wouldn't have mods attached when you inspect.
---
The guns have huge buffs applied to their scope mods.
---
The damage Calc is in the .exe and I don't see Nuclear Winter being a separate game app.
---
Weapon damage isn't calculated differently, they're just using different weapons and weapon mods.
---
I really do think luck affects your odds. I've gotten 7 this week. Getting one within 3 minutes any time my luck is at 18.
---
We'll see next week i suppose? but good to know!
---
With PA and what rads, you should be practically immune to radiation
---
Thanks for the suggestions.  I have 23 level-ups banked and a bunch of perks for different builds I've experimented with so will be able to switch builds pretty quickly.  I've also got a couple armor sets, so I guess I need to just memorize the layout now.
---
And by the way, ALL shotguns are scrip worthy unless you use them point blank without ghe magic bug.
---
They said they plan to in the future.
---
While that’s correct *again* we don’t know if it will apply on Nuclear Winter at all. Likely not, in my opinion, because it’s a mode that was made differently to the base game.
---
What lvl are you and I'm the same name on Xboxas Reddit, add me.
---
No, it definitely still works.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_weapons](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_weapons)    
---
That is a great site for all kinds of info. The top of this page will tell you what perks affect that weapon types.
---
Curious, are you using weapon weight reduction armor and carrying a lot of modified weapons?
---
I mean, stash space is my #1 problem, but there's no camp buildable for that.
---
But the thing is, it requires precise aim to use a gun. With explosives you just shoot in the general area of the enemy for massive damage. Anyone who uses a gun well can use explosives well. The people who choose to use guns don't do it because it's the best option, they do it because it's the most enjoyable way to play.
---
High-skill players lose to low-skill explosive users often. But that same low-skill player with a gun will lose 90% of their fights against a high skill player. That's a serious issue for a competitive game.
---
According to PTS players (one in this very thread mentioned this), you can shoot them down to 1 HP and bash them and it works fine. 
---
This same poster also mentioned they expect a ton of people misunderstanding this enemy effect as well.
---
I'm stuck with stabilized short barrel for that upper handguard and it sucks
---
A terminal that could follow the sales would be outstanding
---
There was an eyepatch bundle a few months ago
---
You know... that’s not a bad idea honestly. Giant super mutant behemoth fight at the jail.
---
Nope, they run the same exact engine.
---
We need to be able to make the untradable legendary items have the effects we want. Since the Legendary system is just Skyrim's enchanting re-purposed, I don't think it should be all that difficult.
---
...or Bethesda could make them tradable. Neither will happen though, since making anything in this game less tedious is blasphemy as far as Bethesda is concerned.
---
I don’t understand why you’d want that.
---
I know you mean a replacement weapon, but I’d like to think murmghh set you up with her niece after your girlfriend left.
---
Soon mate, they're coming. I want them bad to if I'm honest. Pain changing so many perks to craft and carry, then back to a lean mean killing machine. Well I hope experience has been good so far mate. I love it tbh, 2000 hours in now. Got my hold grail yesterday to, a Bffr FR Handmade. So I'm super happy. 😁
---
Ooo man good question. For some reason I think they were stand-alone in the special section of the atomic shop, either free or like 150 atoms. Must have been like 2-3 months ago, so I wouldnt be surprised if they rolled back through the store in a month or so, seeing a lot of repeat stuff lately
---
If you're on PC, look into modding
---
Oof, I'm guessing it's gone now?
---
AMA? A Motherfucking Asshole?
---
Why are you the way that you are?
---
☹️
---
I scrapped my brahmin last night because of cunts like you.
---
I know im just joking around for upvotes :) and yeah they regularly require a second shot cus my 2 shot obliterates them then gives them a full health bar
---
How much milk do you have?
---
I was fine with earning rep normally, so I never did this trick.  I thought that was in the patch notes for p18 or p19.
---
Ironically, I’m back to using an LMG over the gauss mini again.  I’m glad I didn’t mindlessly grind pixels of rep for a solid hour for no good reason.  The ammo press doesn’t make ultracite, so I never bought that for my heavy guy either.
---
Is there a data mine of the rewards yet?  I got the 'reclaimed solar panel' in PTS already, but I haven't gotten the autodoc thing that cures disease.  I'm just curious what all is available.  The massive generator is cool looking too, but has a huge footprint for something that is just as much power as a Fusion Reactor.
---
Maybe, but one that always has a freezer full of highly irradiated brahmin meat.
---
I remember it was before the wastelanders dlc, only one I've seen since is the raider one
---
much appreciated, been running so many of these events and all I have to show for it is a multitude of vocal sacks and my cursed pick and shovel
---
Yeh, the new perks are my main focus, my endgame play is making builds and playing with them, an ever long and winding road to the perfect build, well never ending tbh but good fun. I personally don't think the nerf is going to do to much damage based on what people have said and videos, pardon the pun.
---
Nice! Love the handmade! It’s been great so far! Really love the game :D
---
A DLC purchased on the Microsoft store, right?
---
Did you get it to work?or was it the scrip limit?its really nice right now with the sale going on make sure you max out your scrip and use it at the purveyor 50%off is big when your low level I got really good armor yesterday for my level 20 and a good 1 star handmade
---
I suspect the demographics have changed since then, that people strictly looking to down everything in as fast a speed as possible have deninished.
---
It's a unique situation this game, its abyssal early reception culled a lot of the sort of people who usually ruin these sorts of games for me making for one of the friendliest helpful communities I've seen driving a game forward.
---
This ITV was only about daily ops. Each of the recent ITVs has focused on a different aspect of patch 22. No delay has been mentioned yet.
---
Yes, exactly. You know it mate, roll on Tuesday! ✊✊
---
I witnessed it happen ingame.
---
None! I wait for it to spoil and then drop it.
---
Theres 3 at wayward, 3 at the east big bend tunnel, couple in flat woods aswell. No need to make it cost other players resources.
---
GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!! HE DID IT!!
---
I think daily ops are going to be pretty awesome IMO. Haven’t watched videos but description sound cool!
---
I dont know which is rarer the forest or urban but I might trade one for a decent handmade or fixer for my alt.so if you find a junkies hm or fixer lmk pm me
---
Sure can! We're actually already working on a "No, Thank You" Emote, and we're planning to add it in a future update.
---
EDIT: Oh you don't want chems. Uh, skip Vodka and Psychobuff? And use...Anti-Armor? You're kinda hamstringing yourself with that limitation, though. 
---
Photosynthetic and Sunkissed with Junkie's PA Heavy. Rank 2 Sunkissed cancels out Rads from the Nuke Zone (but any more than that, like from a fissure site, will add to your count) and Photosynthetic works even in combat.
---
Combine/swap with Lifegiver(+45 Max HP) or Nocturnal Fortitude (+40 Max HP), depending on the time of day. Add in Tato Salad (+75 Max HP), Herbivore, Party Boy/Girl, Psychobuff (+65 Max HP), Chemfiend, and Vodka (+75 Max HP) and you become an actual walking tank!
---
Healing Factor wouldn't be a bad idea either if you're trying to cut down on stim usage.

Nah it was on the atom shop too, it comes with the whole porter gage outfit along with his eyepatch
---
He's a witch! Burn him!
---
I’m happy to see they’re using the robot dlc from 4 to make some interesting endgame enemies. I hope this is a trend going forward. Need a sentry bot with a mr handy jet to shoot me with its eye lasers.
---
Eye patches were an atomic shop bundle. I’m sure they will come back.
---
How much it’s worth is subjective.
---
This never gets old. Lol
---
Catch in me if you can ;)
---
Personally I prefer a combination of hunters, zealots, etc type armor because you don't loose the effects as you take damage
---
A ghoulified behemoth
---
No, came through the atom shop. Pirate hat, eye patch, might have been one other thing but that's about as far as they explored FSM.
---
Troubleshooter armor would like to have a word with you
---
I've found someone who I think accidentally dumped they junk in a magazine case next to the stash box at was cause it was Alot of junk.
---
I prefer my sniper for long distance headshots through a scope, but it does feel satisfying to take the opposite approach once or twice a week.
---
i got my eyepatch bundle in the atom shop for maybe like 200-300 atoms? a couple months ago post wastelanders. comes with a bunch of different obes
---
Im feeling the love here ❤️
---
Maybe a coin or note system. Then be able to trade the notes either for scrip, modules or vault steal. I see no reason to gate the modules or vault steal. Or just give modules and vault steal a chance to drop from events instead. Include them in the legendary loot pool. So instead of getting a scrip weapon, you get a module or vault steal. Or better yet, just remove vault steel from the game. It's pointless.
---
Y'know...a certain PERSONAL terminal
---
Have you done the Lowe questline?
---
You need to conplete that in order to have the plan in the loot pool.
---
Even if the hacking issue is fixed people will still accuse everyone of being a hacker. It happens all the time on console and it's not even possible to hack here.
---
I hate how many people use that sight as gospel. It told me a 1 Star bloodied super sledge should be scripped. I sold it for 4K and both the buyer and I probably walked away feeling we got a good price.
---
That's true (I run my Berserker's build the same way) but the main caveat is that the armor has to be broken first - otherwise the damage resists neutralize the gains from the Berserker prefix
---
Still need that outfit XD
---
Tho I see a lot more people rocking the red outfit than any of the other colors these days. 
---
So I would probably use it to make a unique scene in my camp once we get ma mannequins and instanced camp spaces. 
---
I think the switch blade is easier to find with those stats tho and has the added bonus of having a bleed  mod.
---
Not sure if the cultists daggers have any hidden mods laying about.
---
What’s wrong?
---
People flying around the map and sniping from outside of draw distance though walls is pretty damn obvious though.
---
Weird, I have never run Bersekers, sounds like a bug.
---
I desperately want an LOL emote.  Thumbs Up kind of gives the overall impression, but a doubled-over LOL is needed.
---
But that goes against the trickle economy that keeps you playing every day
---
A giant glowing deathclaw with a horde of other deathclaws protecting it. And I mean giant sized....like Godzillia!
---
Healing Factor Mutation will bring your heath back to 100% less current rads after combat threat ends, no stimpacks needed.  (It does not remove rads)
---
I have 2 pieces of SS armor that provide +25 RR each (on top of the base 60 RR the piece provides).
---
If you are using a high capacity backpack, it negates a large percentage of your RR.
---
If you travel light, the Chinese Stealth Armor is 1000 RR, but only 140 DR....
---
Vampire weapons give health regen per hit.  I can stand in front of an SB and unload on it (and its scorched entourage) with a vampire plasma - and never lose health.
---
&gt; locations, enemies, and enemy mutations will be randomized every day, so that you have a fresh and exciting experience every time.
---
I know this sounds good in theory, but I've ran it 4 times so far and it was v94 twice. The second time, it already felt familiar and I was able to rush straight between the objectives with a rough idea of enemy spawn locations. There will be variety, but it will be the same kind of variety as hopping between west tek and whitesprings
---
I got you bro 🐮🐮🐮
---
That’s the thing. You can’t play everyday when you are over encumbered from a purveyor sale.
---
They also didn't mention Season 2. I'm pretty sure that means they have canceled it.
---
I only carry a few weapons and never have the problem you’re describing.  But a friend of mine is constantly complaining about it...he carries 80-100 modified weapons.  
---
Just my theory...the game engine is capable of handling this dynamic, but isn’t optimized for it.  I wouldn’t hold my breath on Bethesda fixing it.  I suspect it’s a choice and you’ll have to decide if it’s worth it.  Then again, I’m not a game designer, so I could be way off.  Just a thought.
---
Yeah, wow, that dev's apartment looks empty.  Is Bethesda even paying these guys?
---
My caps are typically maxed out and even when they aren’t, I typically don’t have anything that I want to sell.
---
The only one out of the initial set of daily Ops that's problematic is going to be The Burrows. That's the toughest one because the layout makes no freaking sense at all. The Galleria is the easiest, followed by the Burning Mine, followed by Vault 94 (which I remember being much more maze like than it actually is). Once you get used to where everything is (and you won't be able do that until the ops go live) they're going to be almost easy to do.
---
If you’re on ps4 I would honestly take either, but unfortunately don’t have any junkies on me currently.
---
I will gladly repatriate my victims with broken ProSnap cameras 📸📸📸
---
Laughs in low health mele build with a 3 claw bloodied deathclaw gauntlet.
---
How do I join I'm on pc
---
I do it for the fans
---
sell all the hats at 50c each, should pay you a fixer plan :D
---
The pictures are fucking crazy. Glad you're ok friend, stay safe. Just think of all the half priced nocturnal broadsiders you're missing out on!
---
biometrtic card to get past the grid?
---
Never stop.
---
probably not but that would be pretty game changing for that mutation
---
Lack of updates
---
I read this as sarcasm and I hope it is.
---
Yeah I had it for the first time yesterday. He either clips into the floor or ceiling, or just walks around in mid air. Not a massive issue but still a little annoying.
---
vending is definitely a PITA and I appreciated the time when it was off due to bugs.
---
I do run my vending near Vault76 so the low levels have a place to drink, rest, remove rads, etc.
---
I appreciate other people's ideas in general and am not afraid of positive and constructive criticism. That being said, most of the responses have been people feeling personally attacked by what I said about people playing 24/7 and trying to make me feel like an asshole for something that was taken in a way it was never intended. But hey, if the shoe fits. Honestly, I feel like if that's the thing that upset people then they're probably just afraid of being judged for playing video games a lot and got defensive because they identified with that notion- if you look for it you'll see it. There's no grounds for the malicious and belittling nature of the response I got, and tbh it's discouraging to see and disappointing to know that this is how people are treated in the community. I'm seeing myself out so no worries.
---
76 is an MMO at its core.    
---
The fact that 99% of useful stuff has a low chance of dropping isn't a 'bug'. It's intentional. If an MMO can't keep players then it will fail and result in a loss.    
---
Regs with his list and the Miner chick are designed that way on purpose. Script is very low in reward not relating to scripting items. The cost is also higher. MMOs are never stacked in your favor.
---
Oh look, this thread again. I don't mind people taking their time but when it's more than a few minutes I get irritated, sorry. Especially after I've gone through all the other vendors in someone's camp but the one you're on.
---
There was one time after a Fasnacht some guy took TEN MINUTES to look at 10 guns on a vendor, and there was a line of five of us waiting to check the last vendor.
---
It just works.
---
You keep coming back though......
---
I just wish I had a larger stash inventory
---
I like it. There needs to be a zone so painful you can't survive in it, only launch expeditions into it from the safer Appalachia. Essentially nuke zones expect you don't drop a bomb... it just is a hellscape with super bosses and rewards hidden within.
---
Joined right away at any level
---
Yes, this happened one time to me. He was glitching through the ceiling but I found his feet and we started shooting him in the foot. I thought we might be able to salvage the event because we had him down to like 10% health but then he moved and we couldn't find him again. Spent the next ten minutes staring at the ceiling but never caught another glimpse of him. Bad times.
---
If it can be done in ARK, it can be done here lol
---
I was in a bind and bought 4K 5.56 for 2 caps each, but generally I wouldn’t. I just needed ammo.
---
Great ideas!
---
Thanks for the info!
---
They screwed up the looks with some of the receivers/barrels. If you look at the lower end ones they have the guard on the front barrel, the more completed receiver and dust guard on the top. The higher end ones don't for some reason. In 4, the better ones looked better made. Not this time.
---
I was sure it was a bug, but since they're not addressing it and including them in the rewards now, it feels like it's intentional. In which case, the question becomes why they are still considered gold items. Just giving them a buff to 2-3x their current effectiveness would fix all this, people would find them useful and being able to craft them would be considered worth the gold
---
that idea is truly awesome!
---
they gave us a week's notice. I agree the end date was a bit iffy, but there were a lot of graphs, etc. that detailed the run, and exactly when it was supposedly ending.
---
I play a non-pa heavy/explosive build and it's the most fun i've had in this game for ages! A two shot mirv fatman is a bit overkill tho...
---
Surpsingly .50 cal seems to sell quickly, I feel bad charging 1 cap per bullet but it seems to be one of the most popular ammos to sell.
---
I'm not getting my hopes for a console update to be honest after the recent delays and just announcing on the day of the update that it won't be released.
---
I'd rather not look forward to and be pleasantly surprised, than look forward to it and be disappointed/annoyed/frustrated.
---
It’s all posted on their twitter. Sept 10-14
---
https://twitter.com/fallout/status/1303777727598784514?s=21
---
Hey friend. Southern Oregon here. I love you and be safe! Nothing in the RNG that can replace your family. Funny u mentioned ash heap. O mpved there this week and now..... I regret it lol
---
Better yet. Remove the script cap during the reduced cost events. Let people go wild....Its the least they could do to the loyal fan base they kept this game
---
alive.
---
I'm running such a build . Full vanguard secret service armor with healing factor and sunkisser perk card. With armored backpack I'm hitting about 800 armor without chems. Then with a full clean space suite or fireman suite you get some extra immunities. 
---
Finally we may soon get some extra legendaries perks for that full health build : poisoning protection and others  https://youtu.be/1WWJkr2Nono
---
There is no such thing as a safe container unless you are on a private world. Someone can pillage your loot.
---
My main got two good armor pieces.    
---
My 1st all got 4 and only had 150 script. At 30 a pop for a 3 star chance that's the best so far.    
---
Regs is similar b/c when you craft those items those effects are random but can be 1 to 3 starts.     
---
My first two SS Chest Armor pieces are really good. I've only crafted 5 in total and not one who's keen on grinding for so little reward. IMO, learn patience. During a sale, the 3 star armor for 30 is best for armor choice. I don't think the miner thing gives you something you can't use.    
---
I've had better luck bouncing around to player's CAMPs. BGS needs to put a marker for Armor aside from clothing and mark it with a Star so we know if they have Legendaries or not. I hate wasting caps and time only to get some crap cosmetics that don't benefit that character.
---
Thats true, its honestly unclear wat circumstances allows one to load in faster but is nt internet speed related cause my ping is between (7 - 9) and my speed is bove 700 Mbs (PS4 Pro Hard-Wire)lol
---
Dude it has stayed for a while that it would end o. The 8th
---
Ah, back when Bethesda gave away decent stuff with their LTD editions.
---
Introducing the mega sentry bot assaultron thing monstrosity! (And 500 new bugs...)
---
I know this post is old but how good is it? Is that damage number with or without mutations, adrenaline active, bloodied mess or other damage perk cards?
---
For the past week it said in the news section it would end on the 8th.
---
You RP as a raider or an unloved child?
---
It's true that resilient still lets you use guns, but having to bash through enemies makes it an almost guaranteed failure if you're going for solo elder. Can't sneak past enemies if they all have piercing gaze, so you'll just be crowded by enemies that you can only kill slowly one at a time at the cost of AP. And if you're defending an uplink, you can't stray far enough away to kill some of them without reducing the link bonus, which is precious time lost for a solo elder run. Gonna have to either spec into a melee build or just tank damage
---
Gotta wear the chally outfit and give it away to other players
---
Think of it more as making a point: just because something isn't mentioned, that doesn't mean it's a sign of a problem.
---
I know, I'm from xbox and that scares me
---
I’d like to have a word with whoever made the ammo converter and the scrip limit...
---
Yeah I did it months ago
---
It used to be worth around 2000 caps before the dupe not sure if it's changed now
---
oh yeah, they'd be more exciting as a reward if they were buffed to be stronger as well. currently they're about as useful as a wet fart
---
When they started the seasons, they announced it would be ten weeks. Never gave an exact date, but should have been pretty easy to see it happening by about a week approximately.
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
That bit a deathclaw gauntlet would be a better roll
---
Looks good, but unfortunately knowing them it’ll likely be a disappointment with how much stuff gets broken
---
There are some rare plans though such as the tenderizer mods and gorilla statues ect. Limited time stuff that had a low drop chance even when it was around. Those sell for more.
---
What? You saw someone log out?
---
You mean the 10 week long event that ended after 10 weeks? The one that had a main screen announcement about the exact time and date it ended? And the one that people posted about constantly for the final week? 
---
That Legendary Run? Or another one I'm not aware of?
---
I will only buy 45 or 5.56 at 1c a piece... And at that price I will generally buy all of it
---
Shotgun I price at 2c and the gauss ammo at 5c
---
Kind of like the vault raids...it would be fun in theory, if there wasn't a timer tied to it. At least the freezing enemies one is pretty fair, you get slowed down if you can't kill enemies quickly enough. But with resilient, a gun build is gonna have a hard time making solo elder possible. Gonna just have to sit there tanking damage if they are too far away to bash, which most of the time will be the case
---
Remember the kid you found in a fridge in Fallout 4?  Yeah , that's me..
---
Um.... there was advanced notice. They told us sept 8. They also said run was 10 weeks. They also had zorbo show how many days were left.
---
If I can’t sell a plan for at least a few thousand caps it’s not worth the time/effort to put them in a vending machine.
---
I realized 90% of my plans never sold so now I only sell PA parts (no mods) and rare event drops. I only list a few at a time but they always get bought up very fast and I get a ton of caps.
---
How about a flying Earlebeast?
---
Did the same. Very unimpressed since then.
---
Questionable strategy to "take your time to gradually proceed" to your goal when an end date was close but unknown to you. Seems like you spent zero time on this sub otherwise you would have had plenty of warning when it was ending. Sucks to live that way, I'm sure it's frustrating for you.
---
Dear God....
---
Same.
---
I wouldn't mind if they said "this is taking a little longer than expected so we need to delay" a couple of weeks before patch day, rather than just going "Sorry console plebs, no update for you" on the day the update is supposed to go live.
---
I found one at that traveling vendor bot along with the red/green skiing jumpsuit.  No clue the worth though...
---
I will join in, My gt is "H mad dog 2000" when you are about ready to start just invite me
---
Heavy,  melee(1 or 2 hand) gauss shotties
---
I showed a super sledge with the same stats to give a comparison point for that reason, but either way those stats are no longer accurate. The energy damage on the modded War Glaives was significantly buffed during the PTS.
---
Not really.
---
Advanced notice like that little message in the corner that literally told you when it was ending?
---
I still haven't finished the main questline regarding launching a nuke nor ACP. 😆
---
I witnessed the gifted bag, and played with that player pretty much nonstop until the point they got banned
---
I usually look for someone new from 76 vault and drop them there. That way even the common ones are if use to someone new.  And stimpacks of course. 😉
---
I understand you’re upset but they did let us know it was ending and it gave everyone time to know about it.
---
Hey if you're on xbl.   I'm in la county man and it def sucks rn but I'm more than glad to drop a few 3 stars I have from the sale or can even roll a few times for you.
---
Bloodied with my Nocturnal Powerfist at night is just fun as it is. Would love a buff.
---
Agreed. I had all this stuff for free or cheap in my vendor (near the overseer camp), and I see a lvl 90 wander in and take it all. Wish I could've PvP'd him. You'd think people would realize that I'm selling level 20 gear for free/cheap for a reason, not so you can waltz in at level 200 and get free shit.
---
Lol nice.
---
Still.... Stop being too silly! Gonna make some peeps pissy
---
Glad you’re safe! Been through it myself when I lived in Arizona a while back. The pictures on tv can’t describe what it’s really like. Hopefully Bethesda extends, or does another sale for those displaced by this disaster. 2020... helluva year.
---
solar armor &amp; sun kissed perk
---
sly beast does not want to die😂😂
---
I would argue that the addiction debuffs are effectively non-existent if you use the right addictions (psycho, daddy-o, daytripper, mentats, alcohol), fully spec with mutations (Herd Mentality alone deletes all of those debuffs), and utilize the fact that you are addicted to specific chems...so that means you can use them all the time with literally no downside! 
---
Junkie's is still significantly more effective than Anti-Armor, even with the additive formula. But, if you for some reason really just don't like using consumables, yeah, it'll work pretty dang great.
---
They mentioned them at the end when they talked about the pts going down on Monday didn’t they?
---
I dump all plans besides rare.
---
It suck I get garbage all the time. The only luck I have is when someone is selling pew pews in their vendors
---
Bethesda's approach to this game is to make everything as much of a grind as possible. Now you get to grind down enemies. Isn't it fun? 
---
The longer it takes you to kill things, the more time it takes to proceed on your challenges, the less likely you are to complete them, the more likely you'll buy atoms.
---
Yah
---
Yeah, my family of 5 went and stayed at my moms for a couple days, there's fires all around us up here, it's pretty scary. It's good you were able to evac and are safe, at least. Hope y'all are home safe soon.
---
I would like a idea of them letting you guys have your own sale when it’s safe to get back home. Sorry you’re going through this. Hope everything works out for you
---
We’re about to be...
---
The quality we've come to expect about something thats been in the making for a very long time.
---
Regeneration effect on armor only works outside of a combat. Mutants effect on weapons only gives 10% when you got mutations. Not +10% per. They are not that good. At least in endgame. 
---
A full health build without Chems, radaways and Stims.
---
So Junkies builds is out because of Chems.
---
My suggestion would be a vats stealth build with either Vampires, Instigating or Anti Armor as weapon effect.
---
Endurance has 2 Perks that one heals rads during day and the other one your health.
---
Get healing factor mutation too. This would solve your problems with Stims and radaways. At least during day you will have no trouble with rads. There is also a perk called ghoulish. When you get rads you will heal health.
---
I had this combo in early game as heavy gunner. Especially during queen fights or in nuke zones is it a nice combo when you have a good PA with enough rad resistance. You get rads, that instand get away from that one perk and your health regenerates also during combat because of ghoulish and the constant incoming rads.
---
Outside of PA I would recommend a set of vanguard armor with a single piece of chameleon armor for more stealth.
---
I hit cap limits often. I usually shut down vending amd hol around looking for crap to buy before I turn them back on.
---
Gotten burned several times when people but 10-20k caps worth of stuff from me.
---
I would buy them!
---
Theoritically yes but... The solar regen is really too slow... Is anyone really using it ?
---
Could you provide an imagine to this if you don’t mind?
---
It's okay because the last thing was literally a black telletuby skin for your PA, but who needs that when you get a white one earlier before that, missed out on that 🤨
---
But hey I was able to get up to the white raider mask and thought that was cool but wanted the fire place door but couldn't get it in time
---
GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!! WE CAN DO IT!!
---
I am. Keep hating.
---
Last event I went to he did the whole walking on like a invisible platform but then went to ceiling lucky we found him through the hole where the ceiling comes down and where able to Widdle him down to complete event with only 39 seconds left. It was crazy and def the worst thing to happen on all the events I’ve done.
---
Same. I’d rather they not make announcement at all about stuff definitely coming on a definite date and then get told the day before or day of that it’s not actually coming for another week or two. I know if I buggared up a deadline, or told a customer that their product was definitely arriving on time and it didn’t, I’d have my ass in deep.
---
Just used this today. Worked fine.
---
This community is usually very positive. 
---
However, when someone tries to blame someone or something else **for their own errors**, that positivity fades quickly. 
---
Add in when a casual player *(again, no one attacked you for being a casual player)* demonstrates a feeling of entitlement and expects the same rewards as a more dedicated player (regardless of the reason), that’s also viewed negatively. 
---
Maybe that wasn’t your intention. Fine. But that means you need to work on your presentation skills. 
---
I'm looking forward to giving the Daily Ops a go and I'm also keen to try out the new teaming option for it.
---
got my camp next to rusty pick and charlston fire dept, so a lot of low lvl players pass through for the responder questline. i sell all recipes and most of the plans at 10c for them. it happens often that someones buys several things and i check the map to see a lvl 400ish buying them. really? you spend like 1000 hours ingame and are keen on a mirelurk cake recipe or ultralight robot chest plan? i dont get ppl like that but getting mad over it isnt worth it.  
---
you can only decide to be a good guy yourself, dont waste time over others.
---
Stop 😂😂
---
Okay I know I missed a big part now. And I knew it’s 10 weeks but I wasnt counting actually. Where exactly did it show the number of days left ?
---
It's 50 now, going through end of weekend.
---
Legendary perks are still coming on Tuesday. :)
---
You've never changed it? 
---
The starting perks are mostly terrible. You need new ones to even kinda hope to win in a shootout
---
Yasssss moar notessss
---
There were a lot of in game notifications dude..I've only started playing from August and I knew for a while
---
Yup they are still coming with Patch 22.
---
Yeah. With these ops there is definitely the possibility of kitting up with mob specific gear. I can definitely see going troubleshooter over unyielding for my bloodied build when facing robots. This would give significant survivability with stealth being disabled.

This seems like a pretty definitive answer!

I don't hate. :) It's interesting.

Haha my latest post was just like this

I know ☹️ i didn't understand why I couldn't equip cards I unlocked and gave up on it

---
 &gt; Yup they are still coming with Patch 22.
---
Ice machine is. I use that quite often for transfer.
---
Same, I definitely didn’t find a berserkers explosive reload lmg or anything that would be crazy
---
I don’t have one. I put it out from time to time if I have stuff to sell, but most things go the vendors at train stations and the legendary machine. I can’t be bothered to trade with people and rather get 40 script for whatever I just got. That and I always have at least 25k in caps on me, so why bother
---
Following
---
I'd like to preemptively request lube.  A lot of it.
---
*hits op*
---
I do, too. Except my spare Fixer plans. Those are emergency cap/flux funds.
---
This. I carry two to three weapons at any given time. My friend carries about a dozen or so. I never have issue with my wheel. He on the other hand complains about lag on the wheel and being over encumbered all the time.
---
You live so full with your thoughts over everyone else. I cheer for you !
---
Agreed also I don’t like the idea of them being able to physically see the items that I am carrying. Because I want the items that I’m carrying. And I just don’t trust something not to get messed up and then somehow all my items are gone.
---
On PTS, you were able to join them immediately even without completing the intro quest, but that quest takes about 2 minutes to complete so it isn't really an issue (it's really only there to explain what an Op is and the lore behind them). Just head over to &gt;!Watoga!&lt; and get started
---
Kinda. But the 'free atoms' that comes with it pays for most of it right back.
---
It is too minor to act as a "get out of jail free card" but has definitely saved my ass more than once. As long as you keep enough stims to keep yourself above 60%, you can keep yourself at medium distance to try to negate damage. More stims saved = more stims sold = more caps. roll for vanguard's legendary to boost the scout armor's DR. Use backpack mods if that's still not enough.
---
Glad your safe but to make an exception for one country is silly. What about fires in other countries or flooding or volcanos, etc. We are not the only country on the planet and there will be other sales.
---
Lol oh yes I remember the glitched primal cuts that wouldn’t complete.  I hope they fix that....
---
How dare you correct the record without any evidence 😂 pics or it didn't happen
---
Fed76. I generally price at the bottom of the range given because I am somewhat selective about what goes into my machine and am willing to wait for a sale. If you want to sell faster price for some number under that. The higher end of the scale given is really for non vending machine sales where the buyer is way more motivated to want that specific item. Most vending buyers are not looking for one specific thing but are more looking for a good deal on a nice item. If an item just isn’t selling and I want to ditch it to make space, I will start walking the price down some to entice a sale.
---
It's gotta be worth at least 3 purified waters
---
Brilliant, I’ve done that thank you!
---
Am I reading this correctly in that stealth is basically useless in these? Every enemy will see everyone at all times, and they themselves can go invisible/undetectable?
---
If your on PS4 I’d love to check the plan out I was under the impression it wasn’t craftabe would love to be proved wrong
---
Is that... is that an Assaultron with reinforced legs and face?
---
Good lord... we're all doomed.
---
Wait times.
---
A level 6 was shooting me in the back while I was selling stuff to the Flatwoods bot a short while back, went into mic and told him that there’s another vendor like right around the corner at the train station, but he kept doing it until I’d had enough and started taking pot shots at him. Never seen someone duck out so fast before 😂
---
Private world, scrapbox of holding, and a mobile free fast travel point are pretty nice.  With the discounted Atoms it's worth it to me.
---
If I want to play with actual people, I just join a public server.
---
I used to have a free for noobs vendor when I camped at Flat woods.  Level 5-10 kitted out weapons, shotgun shells, .38, diluted stuns, the like.  Had big letters saying what it was for.
---
I stopped after getting level 200+ after 200+ com clear it out.  Now I just drop bags on new characters beds like a creepy santa claus.
---
I love that a Troubleshooter armor set even makes any enemy on Encryptid completely harmless (main target included), and the biggest threat is actually being a conduit.
---
And yet if you plug that item in right now it spits out a 2-3k range with a niche value of 4K. Seems pretty spot on.
---
Took me a just minute for the whole story I described
---
I love this idea. The daily scrip limit really is brutal. 150 just isn't even close to enough.
---
Used to sell them so cheap lol 5k it was duped soon much
---
Unfortunately there is at least one company advertising exactly that. Didn't buy it, don't know if it works, but there you have it. Also anecdotally have had more than 1 person"brag" they have one.
---
pic of the recipe or at least a pic of  you crafting it ?
---
The stuff of nightmares.
---
There is no stealth in daily ops, unless they changed it. So i do recommend you to use troubleshooters armor...or get a mÄdic
---
Lol, I know it. I am just used to it I guess. Normally I only buy legendary modules, but they are lame and refuse to put those on sale.
---
Save your disappointment, Murmgh is just giving out 99% crap as usual.  Be safe and I hope you are able to get back (real) home to the wastelands soon.
---
[Holds breath]
---
Thank you for clarifying for me! :)
---
In his name.
---
Be careful with what you drop. I've traded plans for legacies on multiple occasions.
---
I almost have a set of troubleshooter SS together. I may not have a full set by start of daily but I will have one soon.
---
Yeah. Known plans and stuff in vendors always being first in the inventory list is fucking annoying. Even adding more plans to a vendor sucks if they're on your stash.
---
If they could, you know, put the known plans at the end of the list...
---
Not that wholesome, as a person who has waited in one of those lines, it is very annoying. The best thing I got was a TS cryolater
---
Can I cross this name off my list or what?
---
Haha! I love this response.
---
I just pray melee is still viable enough to take the bastard down.
---
Im drooling rn. Plaz tell me your on xbox and looking to sell some of that
---
Oh sweet, is it still going on?
---
Are the Cryolaters worth keeping for sale? I do believe I got some with good stats.
---
What I did after this sale was put all my scrip weapons into one character that won't be able to move like ever again. Whenever I think I'll need the scrip I will transfer from him. But the reality of it is this is only useful if you can't play enough to get to 150 scrip everyday. And right now i can play that much.
---
I have had, on two different occasions, had a random high-level player drop HUNDREDS of the Large Holiday Gift Boxes at my feet. Such kind people. Safe to say, my friends and I were well stocked on caps from that point forward. (I will say, though, I got SOOO many plans from that, I had to drop a bunch of duplicates)
---
Barbed/spiked walking cane, machete sacrificial blade, pitchfork flamer, hatchet electro fusion, boxing glove lead lining, a good number of ultracite PA mod plans, assault rifle, any sledgehammer mod plan, healing salve mire and cranberry bog to name a few.
---
How about you post a picture of your decked out mansion, hotshot?
---
Awesome!!
---
It’s nice to see that they think it’s fun to shoot every enemy 100 times, then bash it with the buttstock to kill it.  Combat at a snails pace is definitely the next trend in gaming.
---
I've been spending good money on plans now just to get ones that I don't know already.
---
Still not enough, especially if you already have a shit ton of legendaries to exchange for scrip falling out of your ass.
---
Totally agree. Adding anything from stash is annoying. Most of the time it says "vendor has reset" and I have to take it out of stash and add it from inventory anyway.  
---
I hate scrolling through known plans. It was before my time, but I understand they didn't used to mark them as known so you had to check each one? Must have been a massive pain. I'm glad there's a function for it now, just wish they were at the bottom of the list lol
---
I don’t necessarily think it’s an unpopular opinion
---
Play other games or do a different activity until the new grinding score season comes.
---
Thank you for explaining how looter shooters work.
---
Tato Salad with Herbivore,  Vodka with Party Boy (3), Psychobuff, Strange in Numbers, Blocker (3), Fireproof (3), PA with Emergency Protocols.  You won't die.
---
You can also use the nukacrypt companion app. It has a price checker like fed76, but I like the interface a bit more personally
---
One of the cool things about the game is seeing how people have personalized it. For people who spend a lot of time building up their camp, there is something really rewarding about having people tell you it looks nice. I think about it kind of like building a house in the Sims but then being able to force everyone you meet to look at it without being weird.
---
Plus, I'm a nosy bitch. You bet I'm peering in every window of every locked camp I pass. "Oh, they chose *that* wallpaper? Interesting. I wouldn't say I like it, but I respect their idea." Or sometimes I just awkwardly stare at someone's camp like a loser because I think it's great but can't tell them. One of my favourite things to do when I play with friends is travel to other players' camps and essentially pretend we're interior design critics.
---
I feel like it's not taking full 24 for legendary gizmo to reset anymore. Am i being confused here?
---
I always pick them all up and then give the ones I know to my friends and then they drop the ones they know and we give them to other people!
---
I hop around the map going to camps with plans looking for ones I don't have. So my own plans that are known, I throw in my vendor assuming that other people do the same.
---
The enemy ship on the game board was the count down when it reached the end what did you expect to happen have another week to finish?
---
Full health builds are getting hit too, bloodied is still gonna be highest damage and I mean honestly... it stings but it’s over the top right now. Why do you care about one wasteland I mean I’m excited for higher level enemies. And corn soup... I eat it all the time if you’re not running herbivore with rifleman commando builds you’re missing out on buffs.
---
I noticed I always get intestines from the possums in flatwoods across from the church in the cooking area next to the flatwoods tavern (I think its called?)
---
Question - do you think that a power armor and vats rifleman (not commando) could handle the ops?
---
I have the habit of stalking low levels with Chinese stealth armour and the sheepsquatch mascot head on. I try sneak up to them, appear out of nowhere, drop plans and stims, then disappear again. I'm like a wasteland Santa.
---
Same. Just gotta wait a few more days I guess. Can’t wait to get into daily ops.
---
Yeah unless I got scrapping specifically I'm always out of screws.
---
I'm closing in on 300, and have nearly run out of things to spend down from the caps limit. Once I'm out of things to buy, it won't make sense to keep my vendors open, as selling to bots will keep me topped off well enough to keep buying bullion every week. 
---
We really need another caps sink.
---
I wouldn't call it an unpopular opinion. Many people are experiencing that, myself included. On the other hand, many are enjoying taking a break. And of course, there are those who still haven't realized season one is over. The good news is that we'll be back at it next week. Yayy
---
Okay. So play another game during the break.
---
I don’t know about you, but my idea of action is not to mag dump on every single enemy in my way.
---
The swords are perfect for completing the “repair 76 melee weapons” challenge. If you aren’t a melee build, it’s hard to find an easy supply of damaged weapons.
---
Been like that since Fallout 3.
---
I like a full Vanguard's set with a vampire weapon- usually the damage I take is healed by the time I get hit again (I do use heavies though so really high rate of fire)
---
I'm not sure. The damage nerf I'm still not sure about, but legendary perks and daily ops do sound fun. I'm ambivalent, then.
---
What is the point of this post?
---
&gt;Barbed/spiked walking cane, machete sacrificial blade, pitchfork flamer, hatchet electro fusion, boxing glove lead lining, a good number of ultracite PA mod plans, assault rifle, any sledgehammer mod plan,healing salve mire and cranberry bog 
---
all of this is common and mostly trash tier :V
---
to me, reaching rank 100 in the season was more like a liberation. during the season, i checked challenges, did them and mostly had to log off then. after it ends, i started to stroll again, do pointless shit (equipping a bow as commando build and hunt scorched at morgantown airport for example) and discover areas i havent really been so far. it was great and i definitly wont rush the second season like i did the first. even if i dont make it til 100, who cares.  
---
i think, you feel this way because you dont get like a strict schedule anymore. do this. kill them. reach that. you're back to play like you want and after weeks of following some kind of orders, its natural to feel a little bit confused.
---
We must be playing the same games with completely opposite approaches.
---
Maybe.
---
It's 20 hours from your first deposit until the machines reset
---
It has to do with them being a gold bullion reward.
---
I played the BETA and honestly didn't enjoy it. It was insanely unbalanced &amp; crashed often. Horrendous reviews happened after launch so I held off getting it. A few months went by &amp; I found it on ebay for $12 so I gave it another go. My hubby watched me play &amp; decided he'd like to try it so I found the Tricentennial edition on ebay for $11. I now have around 1200 hours invested so it was the best value for money game I ever spent! Invested in a year's Fallout 1st membership a couple months ago &amp; I love it. 
---
People still have negative views about the game despite not having played it in months. A lot has changed over the months. There are still annoying little bugs here &amp; there, but that's all they are, not game-breaking or anything. I personally think all the good about the game far outweighs the bad. And yes, the general community is amazing. The only other community I truly felt part of was Assassin's Creed, back in the multiplayer days. Ahhh, good times!
---
I got a shit ton I need to get rid of
---
sry maybe i was thinking patch 23....i know i read somewhere it was coming in the near future not this upcoming patch but maybe the one after??
---
found it...they were talking about patch 22 and camp shelters at games con so i pmust have merged the two thinking it was coming in patch 22....planning it for winter so maybe 23??!!
---
Dammnit
---
I remember making it on one of my alts recently, so I agree with you.
---
I’m on vacation until next week or I would pop in game and post proof.  I’ll try to post pics next weekend for you non-believers.
---
I was BE heavy but im running shotguns junkie kinda op ngl.
---
Quick question is the camo pa jetpack limb still doable or are they getting rid of it when that patch hits?
---
Casually drop 40 duplicate plans and 1500 shotgun rounds into a lunchbox.
---
There's an infinite ultracite spot near ACP?
---
I guess I am alone so thanks for the advice
---
I am not looking forward to it. I have always enjoyed playing a power character by leveling up a lot so the quests are an easy walkthrough. For example, I am now level 52, and just finished the Freestates quests. 
---
I also play a sniper with non auto rifles, so I am genuinely concerned about this update and how it will affect my play style.
---
It takes a lot longer than 20 minutes for the irradiated flora to respawn for me -- what's your secret?
---
Selling that minigun by any chance 😏
---
Receipts or I call bullshit, you click-baiting troll.
---
(I'll rescind insulting post once you prove it, you massive, lying titwank)
---
Ah, well the mod plans are a bit rarer since they are sbq drops whereas you get the plans for ultracitw armor from the story as well as the sbq
---
A friend of mine drug me in kicking and screaming having bought me the game and the console. 
---
I was dragging my feet the entire time for months. Till he showed me the camp building stuff.
---
Then a switch was turned on in my brain. XD
---
Have dedicated way too much time to my camp. XD
---
Eventually did find some exceptionally well written quest lines too that really make up for the slog of the games worse aspects.
---
Why I do my best to make things smoother going for new peeps.
---
Yes, and there are chickens too near vault 76. If you go south past that bootlegger shack, there's some farm with a protectron, chickens go there. Also near Wayward there's a steel extraction area where the Primal event sometimes spawns - there are eirher Beavers, Rabbits, or Squirrels that will spawn. They change every time you fast travel there.
---
The internet says pics or it didn't happen.
---
Those should all be tradable. The only reason they aren't, is because Bethesda refuses to allow anyone to circumvent this grind they've set up.
---
He may be a deviant, but he's got bravado. Please do not downvote the brahmin bandit.
---
Absolutely none of those plans are common.
---
At the start i was playing lots earning extra score.
---
By the end I was logging in,  doing the minimum for score and logging off. I think I've logged in once since I got to 100.
---
offcourse not
---
Well, it’ll be one of these guys. I bet this is the entire development team.
---
Ok, it’ll be me, you, and another guy, it’ll be at about 8pm EST
---
Using this doll, tell us where the brahmin touched you when you were a child.
---
We had a 100 days notice,where were you?
---
I think its rude not to have a quick look at people's camps. When someone just runs directly to my vendors and immediately fast travels away I feel like they are saying my camp is not worth checking out.
---
I don’t see Americans asking for extensions for any kids who might play that they locked in dog kennels at the border, but you always see them asking or complaining that the world doesn’t stop if they miss something in a game.
---
Todd damn it
---
I have nothing to buy with caps, or bullion for that matter.  The only currency that consistently has value to me is scrip.
---
Peak irony right here, lol.
---
I have been able to complete all of the events, and defeat all the bosses, solo. Granted, I wasn't able to get top tier rewards for all of the events but I successfully completed them.
---
My regret is not teaming up with others to complete Vault 94 on Normal or Expert. I completed the first two Vault 94 missions solo on Novice.
---
bloodied or junkies
---
You look at the legendary map screen. Zorbo moves one space per day. Count number of spaces after zorbo.
---
Ive seen one camp that was selling missiles for 50 caps each and mini nukes for 300. The dude had like 30 mini nukes and the thought of losing 180 pounds of stash weight to try and sell something that people literally drop the moment they get it.
---
Gotta love Meat Week for all those squirrel bits and intestines. Can you imagine what these statements must look like, out of context,  to the average non fallout player.  "*These sickos are talking about squirrel intestines*"
---
i was mistaken it is not this patch they talked about it at games con...where they also talked about patch 22, so its not this patch but soon
---
And less of these posts. 🤷
---
If you're on PC I won't mind helping you.  There won't be any pressure or toxicity.  Don't even have to use a mic of you don't want to
---
Agreed, but we gotta keep asking until it happens lol
---
All I can tell you is it told me it was “scrip fodder”. 
---
As a free market capitalist I don’t believe in artificial price guides developed by random people on the internet. Let the market determine prices.
---
Not asking on here.
---
I like the idea but I don'rt want to always have to launch a nuke to get the boss to spawn
---
there is two diffrent mutation one of them will be high perception for enemy no matter what your stealth is enemy can see you and second one is other listed mutation so yeah If you want to play daily ops you need to leave your comfort zone and try other tactics
---
it's an ASSaultron yo.. they're all melty
---
Because that’s what he does.
---
I don't know which one I'd be happier about at this point
---
sounds like it went as expected to me
---
Now i know where to look
---
You right. Lol
---
Por que no haceis to preguntas en este foro? Hay mucha gente que sabe el juego mejor que nadie.
---
I like it as just a passive recovery. Mostly to keep myself from forgetting to heal before going into my next fight. Won’t save me, but more of a quality of life perk
---
I put a ton of my plans in the vendor for low caps, but if I find a newer player (level 5-20 something) I will try to connect with them and set them up with plans, ammo, and whatever else they need.
---
 Paying it forward for the help I've gotten the past couple of weeks. There are some really good people on the game. I was struggling a few weeks ago on the game myself, and several higher level players got me through by giving me lendendary weapons that matched my player level, ammo, plans, and helping me complete my power armor set.
---
Got the vault tec cuckoo clock can’t find it in the camp menu any idea where it is?
---
Yeah i know i had to level up an alt just to make it manageable even with selling alot of them in my store.
---
I did a hard flip like this around level 250 or so. Last week of the survival servers they dropped the Unstoppable Monster as an achievement item. I am now the unstoppable monster, like wolverine, nothing survives my claws. I cannot wait for the new legendary perk that boosts unarmed damage, I will only get more destructive.
---
I like this! I replayed Fallout 4 so many times purely for settlement building, I was addicted.
---
In Fallout 76 though, I'm reluctant to move my camp because it's the thought of restocking my vendors that put me off! My third camp took 9 hours to build. It was on 3 levels but not in the way you might think. It was 3 tiles wide &amp; 4 tiles long, at the length Imeticulously placed unsnappable steps, the concrete ones. I placed them so you only actually go up 3 steps. Next area was only 3x1 tile &amp; then I did the same again. If you looked really closely, you could see a millimeter gap between the levels. It was painful to build it but it looked great. 
---
My current camp is based on a hunter's camp. Wooden log cabins with guns &amp; mounted things with a nice fire &amp; trinkets. Simple but very, very cosy. And tons of food! Its like a self sufficient little hunters farm.
---
My next camp is going to be based on a fairground &amp; petting zoo 😁
---
Forgot to mention that born survivor 3\* could NOT proc, which is odd
---
As a noob, I have to ask: What the hell is a meat week? I can shoot and loot meat anyway 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Troubleshooter's armor is your friend
---
 Huzzah :)
---
I’m suffering withdrawals from not having my challenges auto complete in a month because I finished the season. I need that anger back in my heart again.
---
I have a crap ton of screws right now, the gears are gold for me. I only found 60 after 8 hours of playing and mining for resources.
---
Will there ever be text chat or just 20,000 emotes? :\\
---
Why floater gernades lol
---
Not at all.  Come in, look around, take some pics, but please, close the door on your way out
---
Yea as a stealth sniper with absolutely no interest in changing builds I have a feeling I'll completely ignore daily ops. I'm super excited for legendary perks though so I'm ok with it.
---
Ultricite PA plans are absurdly common any player who do SBQ is swimming in them weapon plans are also common and i think you can get them from vendor only gealing salves are less common but at the end of the day nobody uses them :v
---
Ya I guess my point is that we'll never really tell if the hackers are taken care of. People always false report good players.
---
If you are Xbox Ill give you every Nuka plan I have. Clock, PA paint plans, Dark, and Machine.
---
That's completely beside the point, with my setup i should NOT be instantly killed by his melee attacks. 3\* born survivor didn't even proc.
---
1. Lone Wanderer - 20% DR
---
2. Blocker - 45% DR
---
3. Power Armor - 42% DR
---
4. Psycho - 25% DR
---
The mods are a free perk already. If you need to carry so much you need everything reduced,get the perks. Backpacks are like armor,one mod.
---

 Armor Ace themed and all.
---
Guess I was deluded by excitement. They weren't ever listed as rewards. But they exist atleast and we'll likely see them.
---
I think that 76 has the best online community. Now the game may not be perfect or even great. But I think that also weeds out the assholes this late in the game.
---
Lmao. That’s just the best santa. Got to try that next time
---
Depends on the Op tbh.
---
There's a 25% chance (currently) that you're gonna face stealth opponents and that's gonna make VATS 99% useless because you can't VATS them unless they're firing at you. There's also another 25% chance your ballistic weapons are going to be 99% useless because unless you bash them with your rifle, they won't die except by melee. Additionally there's another 25% chance you're gonna get slowed down by freezing enemies so a low firing rate weapon like a rifle is gonna be a tough thing to pull off.
---
 Another thing to keep in mind is that with this update you're going to find a lot of builds have been nerfed (esp bloodied) and that virtually all enemies will be a lot stronger. We're talking level 50-100 mutants and robots (the Blood Eagles, even at lvl 100 aren't much of a challenge tbh) and the end boss in any daily op ain't no slouch.
---
If you want to know if you've got a build that can survive a daily op without much problem I would recommend going somewhere like WesTek and go in overencumbered without stealth and without using VATS and if you can clear WesTek without dying or really ever being in trouble (RobCo research and Crimson Prospect also recommended) then you're gonna probably be fine.
---
There are several ultracite plans with a drop rate below 0.1%. Assault rifle plan cannot be purchased from vendors and has a drop rate well below 1%. In fact, the best drop rate for any of the plans I mentioned is around 0.5%
---
Naise!  Mines a super elaborate Silent Hill experience,  takes me about 3 days to rebuild ot from scratch.  XD
---
What's unique about it is that its build on 2 sides of a cliff.  A seemingly normal house on the cliff,  with a 5 story building on the drop below. But perfectly aligned to such a degree that they share a roof and floor.
---
You enter through the front and after passing through a nightmarish pitch black hall your in a nightmare camp that drops down 5 stories from where u began to eventually find the vendors below.  
---
^ o  ^
---
Now if I could only get them to spawn in the front of the camp and not the back   .o   ,
---
I have been hoping for this for a long time the pistols are the most entertaining weapons in the game I don't care how they would have to do this both could be tied to the same button for all I care. I just want them to become more useful.
---
If you're on Xbox I would love to see this!
---
Imposter Sheepsquatch doesn't give a fuck about your setup. It only cares about pwning ass.
---
I am!  PaladinCiel is my handle.
---
No, delicious intestines!
---
Having various charges makes me think they were probably legit. When I started using heavy energy weapons, I had to re-train myself not to constantly hit reload...
---
Dodgy, serendipity, lone wanderer (or empath with class freak) and emergency protocols.
---
Saw that, put down my bloodied mini-gun as I wet my pants. Back to the vault... That scares me.
---
Yeah, it was added a few months after the game went out of beta.
---
I still scroll through them because sometimes I find a rare plan for cheap and I want to gift a friend.
---
I just added you 😁
---
That's true. I'm sure it could shoot a hole into the surface of mars...
---
I go by many names... The brahmin bandit, Toby Flenderson....
---
This is fantastic news.  I've played a few of the daily ops and it's fantastic.  Best way to describe is it's perfect for hopping on after work and just having fun playing.  
---
It doesn't feel grindy and rather than fetching stuff or dailies.  You can just sit back and enjoy the game whilst earning decent XP.  Definitely a step in the right direction.
---
How I do get aluminum? And how do I get repair kits. Ty
---
Oh, I play xbox
---
Was gonna say I’m at a vendor now and i see the plans but I’m on ps4...
---
You forgot the nuka cola machine.
---
Only to longshoremen.
---
I started dropping piles of plans at lowbies feet since my stash is full and just asking in game for them to only take what they don't know.  People have been cool so far.  We only survive the wasteland alone together.
---
Be safe friend, I live in the Bay Area and it has really been something else. 
---
Ash just falling from the sky, The orange sky a couple days ago, more fires burning in the state. It really is a crazy time. Haven’t seen a blue sky in a week. 
---
Feels like something out of a movie. Luckily we didn’t have to evacuate, but we came pretty close. We are still packed up just in case.
---
I’ll do a couple rolls for you, but if they are good, I’m keeping them &gt;:)
---
It's not possible to hack on console. There's no evidence of it ever happening. People lie.
---
I’ve been saying this since Moma Mole first arrived..
---
It’s really frustrating, three 3* weapons in the machine and you’re done! See you in 24hrs! 
---
I wish it was 1,400 scrip per day. The same as caps..
---
Well... I’d probably be able to pull it off with the gauss rifle and drugs, so yeah.
---
I think I have those even in bulk lol...Xbox by chance?
---
Aaaaand they're rediculously OP now if you use a magic effect. My Vampire's 33% VATS combat shotgun, in Power Armor, kills all the West Tek muties in 1 vats hit.
---
One of these days I want to find and try out an Instigating 40% Bash shotgun with a piece of 15% blocking armor (that's 3 magic effects at once).
---
Heavy Gunner perks under strength, Adrenalin under agility and demo expert and nerd rage under luck. 
---
What level are you?
---
It certainly doesn't exist in the live version. You may have mistaken it for [Recipe: Psychobuff](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/002B8BCA).
---
Drop rate can be as low as you want what metters is how often people do stuff from which this plans drop and how long this plans were in the game
---
Given that there’s only two hammers, I’m guessing each firing cap initiates two chambers.  The trigger assembly and mechanism would be a giant mess if each barrel had a separate hammer.
---
It’s such a novelty meme weapon anyways, along with the other black powder weapons.  Just let it exist as a goofy, loud monstrosity that shoots four barrels while requiring only one .50 ball.
---
Serendipity does not work in pa
---
In my more elaborate camp builds I just make separate spaces and lock my personal space so I don’t have to deal with it lol.

Eeven of the mention something doesnt mean we get it check out firecracker whiskey.

Lol yes bloodied pa builds are viable. Take your standered heavy pa build and throw in nerd rage and your golden
---
I didn't even know you could access that cash register 🤨
---
I definitely don't know a ton of plans but any I collect that I know already I sell for 5 caps each or less sometimes
---
Level 60, I was going for a full health, dodgy/blocker high health tank build until this dropped.
---
Can confirm.
---
Yeah, there should clearly be some reconfiguration of the scrip limit and/or system. But they've clearly shown no willingness to either engage the community in QoL improvement trials about scrip limits, or at the very least communicate why they continue to be out of touch about how players are consuming or enjoying the game. I don't have a lot of mmo style game experience, but I refuse to believe the majority of popular ones out there are finding success by flat out ignoring listening to or at least communicating with their fan base in a timely maner as Beth-Austin has been doing. It's really odd.
---
I had spare armor and was curious to see what the ally would look like. I was satisfied lol the way they look slow and morphed.
---
you can't sneak in daily Ops anyway
---
They seriously gave SO MUCH NOTICE when, what hour and that you should make sure to claim any unclaimed rewards notices. 
---
You are wrong. Sorry dude.
---
Don't worry about following the main story time. Take your time and explore your surrounded. Get to know the lay of the land.
---
This is so bad, i mean after half a year in the PS4 i keep getting random procs of the cap collector cap when looting corpses, and when i loot cap stash it goves me the original amount, with no extra caps even tho the cap collector proced. Is it just me?
---

---
power armor with emergency protocols should work really well. if you start carrying several heavy guns replace bullet shield with bear arms. ricochet can also be replaced with one gun army if you feel you need it.
---
Well you've got a bit of fun coming your way mate. 😁👍
---
Nothing like hot brass coating your face in the morning
---
Since I don't really spend my caps on much of anything, I've been buying serum recipes and crafting them. There's only been once(as far as I know) where someone bought my serums to sell at higher prices(I sell them for 400 each). Usually to prevent anyone from just buying out stock to resell, I usually only have 1-2 of each listed and just refill whenever one is purchased.
---
Mods are a life changer. Get Perk Loadouts, Better Inventory, high res map, Chat Mod, shaders and a couple of nude mods and you will never go back
---
As the guy that runs the PS4 plans checklist mule, I can confirm that most people are missing the good majority of these plans as the last ones they don't have. Meaning people that are actively looking for and know how to obtain these specific plans do not have them yet. I've met 4 other people out of hundreds that know all the plans, so it's no easy feat.
---
Based on that drop id consider changing. But me personally, I was put off gatlings as they are so slow and noisy! I prefer stealth personally. 
---
Use it for a bit, see if you like it. If you don't, you could trade for something decent to suit high health build.
---
Bloody fast reload revolver with pistol perks. Good time
---
That’s probably why he wasn’t sneaking.
---
You’re right. My bad.
---
Replace your camp and then scrap the blueprint that is in your stored section
---
Yeh, public teams on a whole was a great decision in my book, with helping, getting help etc. I instantly join a team on loading in now, so many benefits to being in a team.
---
Avoid east and southeast part of the map. Build camp in forest. Play events and level up. Dont get attached to any weapon before level 50.
---
You have to understand it just as annoying  when your a low level and a high spawn someone and all the enemy's jump up. I get what your saying but it does work both ways that why I think one wasteland is good for all level players.
---
How about automatic receivers that aren't missing the dust cover as well? The dust cover and handguard are my biggest annoyances with the handmade.
---
Welcome aboard. Will take some time for you to learn some mechanics and builds but the sooner you decide what you want your character to become, the better. Being a mutant make a huge difference later on. Around lvl 65 you will be able to complete your build and your character will be "ready". Past lvl 32 or 33 is when the fun begins IMO.
---
You can have a lot of recipe when you capture a workshop, for your wall you can just replace your wall with the new one!
---
For the repair kit, o' the queen or in the atom shop but don't buy then, you gonna have plenty after when you gonna farm her
---
The opposite for me. I just got a TSE Fixer from the purveyor, and when Legendary Perks come I'm going to up my PER and AGI so I can alternate between being heavy guns and a sneak commando.
---
The good repair kits can be obtained from the scorched earth event, so you'll have to wait and get stronger \^\^
---
Cafetria tablets and other junk can weild you aluminum, so get every piece of junk that you can find
---
Same here, haven't watched but from what I've read from Bethesda and ppl in the PTS they are good fun. Much needed
---
Yep, standard availability.
---
How much you guys think the treasure hunter outfit plan cost ? I still have one and I can't sell it, I put it on 8k caps it's that to much ?
---
Meh, respec now I say. Tossing away a few perk coins isn’t that big a deal, you should get your base special how you like it.
---
like 30% maybe
---
I think that it was 20%
---
They'd get a little more competitive if they combined guerrilla and gunslinger into one perk set, so you could spec into both auto and semi-auto. The dps of auto pistols is still way behind auto rifles though with no real advantage apart from a lower weight, which I think improves stealth when your weapon is drawn. Maybe a powerful automatic receiver for the gauss pistol if it significantly out-damaged the 10mm and pipe pistol?
---
Hmmm.   I think /u/akarnokd may be correct.  I am thinking of Psychobuff .
---
They could add the capital wasteland as a “zone”.  Would be cool to see, but i’m not entirely sure how it would fit in the lore. It is however big enough and maybe they could tie in a BoS quest that opens us up to the region.
---
Yeh it definitely works both ways, I should of said, thankfully this will fix it once and for all. 🤞👍
---
Just doing my job, comrade ♥️⚔️
---
Yep! 🤣
---
Or as also been suggested, infinite scrip'ing but a purchase cap to free up storage space. Whatever it is, the answer can't be they're going to limit your end game reward opportunities to incentivize you logging in more often and inflate daily interest KPIs because they don't have the budget or resources to produce more (not bugged to hell) content in a reasonable timeframe to keep player interest.
---
😅
---
You could stack 3 sets of PA, you can go full vanguard BOS with +500/500 resistances, it doesn't matter. The entity has an armor penetration perk and some multiplicative in damage output. Troubleshooter's doesn't give you energy or damage resistance, but *robot* resistance and that's why it can stand her. Or you can just avoid her melee by keeping your distance.
---
I need treasury note sinks. I have 4000+ and I gain more than I can spend per day
---
I mean if you have enough Agility and Perception already, you could use legendary Strength and try out Heavies or 2 Handed. Wouldn't even need to change your build.
---
I say they should just up Smiley's gold allotment to 500 gold per week for 10,000 caps. That would wipe out the full 9,800 caps from clearing vendor caps every day at least. It's pretty annoying to find things to spend caps on every day.
---
You must’ve been that guy 😂
---
then you're playing the game for the absolute wrong reason.
---
Hello again! I moved from there and today i visited a camp in that location, i knows the odds but i have to ask, do you have a pet deathclaw by any chance? Lol
---
I don't understand what you mean
---
So did I hear this correctly:
---
The first completion of the day will get you a chance at the new legendary weapon, plan, etc. and any completions after that (until reset) will have drops from the regular legendary pool?  Does this include plans we learned aka Fixer, Gauss, etc?
---
the best place for level grounding for your level i recommend killing all the ghouls around Morgantown and the scorches as well and then server hop to refresh the enemies. If your lucky enough you might even find some legendaries as well
---
I'm a bloodied build, but I think berserker should have much more damage than bloodied. Bloodied have more damage and more resistance at low health. Seems unbalanced all the way around.
---
From the raider wastelander dailies?
---
Well youre armour depends on your build. I'm in full unyielding SS armour as I am bloodied unarmed, but if I was to change to something else I wouldn't want to have to make level 100 secret service armour. Plus if armour went past 50 youd have players at a point where they constantly have 1000+ damage resistant
---
for gatling gun i prefer the speedy receiver, comfort grip, large mag, gunner sight is up to you. gun accuracy will increase when standing still making sentinel armor a good choice when outside power armor. I prefer the T-51 power armor with emergency protocols, calibrated shocks, arms and helmet up to you. reference this article: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7oyri/comprehensive\_power\_armor\_and\_mods\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7oyri/comprehensive_power_armor_and_mods_guide/)
---
One instigating and one executioner would be nice
---
Going into the game blindly without knowing anything is more fun, just mess around the game and follow the tutorials it gives you. 
---
Don’t worry about learning the meta of the game  until you’re atleast level 50 and midway through the story
---
You still wanna buy mate? Sorry a lot happened last night and had to leave
---
Wow. I just googled about aimbot in ps4 and I was so surprised. No wonder why I saw someone with a weird aiming.
---
Ice machine and cigarette machines have infinite weight. The cash register inside also has infinite weight
---
one man army in luck and stabilized in intelligence for heavies. noticed these two werent mention among the other main ones also and im a junkies heavy lv. 225 and you should utilize the batteries perk since it makes all your energy ammo wiegh less as well.
---
&gt;These are (mostly) small adjustments.
---
I mean, about 50% less damage for bloodied builds is not a small adjustment. and what about AA? is it really on par with junkie's now? because that's just laughable.
---
can't imagine myself doing Earle or the Queen as often once the nerf hits. they're resource sinks as it is.
---
I'm curious about that as well. I run a sneak build and it would be devastating if that doesn't work. I mean, they have finally added some repeatable daily content for veteran players, but they want to force us away from the builds we worked so hard on? That seems like an awful decision.
---
Are the plans sellable or are they locked to player?
---
If you don't want to rebuild your camp from scratch you can just edit the plain wood walls and change them to barn walls. Or if you really want to start over, move your camp and delete the blueprints to put the pieces back in your Stored tab where you can use the items you've already spent materials to make.
---
Limit is 150 and resets 20 hours after 1st exchange each day.
---
You don’t need repair kits. Use scrap / junk to repair weapons and armor
---
[Every tuesday they add an atomic shop post that tells you what will be available that week](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/news)
---
I've done Project Paradise so many times now, and the Diffuser is still the only item I haven't gotten.   Sitting on some 300 something super stimpacks still because I keep hoping to get it.  The backpack you can get is nice though.
---
On the west coast. Not displaced. But I can see the smoke daily and this is an annual occurrence. OP, I wish you the best, but bring your console/PC with you next time!
---
To plant crops, just find a piece of corn, tato, etc and plant it. Water purifier plans come from the main questline.
---
When you dilute with chemist you'll have 2000+ maybe even 3000 with super duper
---
It's not a question of comfort zone here, it's reflexes and twitch skills, neither of which I have much of any more. My "git gud" abilities are fairly to moderately low.
---
No biggie; I'm still pretty new to the game and there's lots left to see and do, so I won't be, like, missing out here. I just know I'll likely never see these except in videos, and that's fine.
---
Thanks for the info. :)
---
Whitespring vendor man! Can’t remember the name exactly

Sure, you on PC? No biggy, I wasn't on long either. Had to make up the guest room incase some family members get a wildfire evac order.
---
They can swap it up ever so often. One be legendary one be gold bullion and one even being a discount on any other currency they eventually bring out. Cause lord knows we'll get more currencies before they up limit of said currencies.
---
\*Beth-Austin has left the chat\*
---
I was wondering what was going on with those, I was in a silo the other day and everyone told me not to launch 1 but once I got there I was able to launch 1.
---
ask for a refund.
---
That's all I do, I've had a number of higher level players drop plans. I take the ones I don't know
---
Whoo boy yes. I only use PA for Earl, but adrenal reaction mutation, usual blocker, dodgy and nerd rage. I use serendipity when out of PA but switch to OGA when in. Obviously stabilized when in PA. The kicker is emergency protocols for your PA. I literally stand face to face with Earl ignoring the sea of spawns and melt him, using the occasional stim. You always wanna have a set of unyielding gear to enjoy those sweet specials all 20+ too.
---
I hope they reopen Vault 79 too
---
Adjustments to your **playstyle**, not adjustments to your **damage output**. I'll edit the post for clarity.
---
Again, I am not talking about numbers. I am talking about what the game will feel like post Patch 22, as a player, compared to it feels like now. 
---
Using a few more rounds of ammo as a Commando, at most, for the vast majority of mobs seems like a small adjustment to me.
---
As for Anti-Armor, no it is not as good as Junkie's. The gap is just smaller. The largest advantage Junkie's still has is being able to use combat enhancing drugs with no drawbacks because we're already addicted.
---
Also, if it was as good as Junkie's, why would that matter? That just gives players more options, which is always a good thing. As it stands, Anti-Armor is, and always has been, a great choice for any playstyle.
---
Bugged no? A high level challenging boss? Yes. Kill her before she kills you.
---
The Power Armor Torso mod for a bloodied power armor build should be Emergency Protocols.
---
Like, in WoW and Destiny, armor and weapons have their own levels, and their own cap separate from player level. I really think Bethesda should integrate that into this game, because it could add some pizzaz to this game beyond nuke runs.
---
some people I've seen on YT that play in the PTS on pc say they haven't noticed it now, so hopefully it'll get fixed with this update then
---
Do you know how the Piercing Gaze works? Is it just impossible to sneak your way through an Op?
---
Fair enough.
---
What do I need so many for? Healing.
---
i wish i had an award left, you definitly deserve a ton of them. thanks man!  
---
even if this means i have to use sneak again as a commando (transformed to a glass cannon, without the sneak things i still one shot everything beside the really big guys so i got rid of it), its totally fine. we'll see how it works. thanks for your testing!
---
So even using the double wall glitch can get you reported?
---
I really like this idea.  Forget the chance though.  Give me one module for a 1\*, 2 for a 2\* and 3 for 3\*.  We all know when you use the module for SS its just another roll anyway.
---
Omfg what is that?!
---
Oh yeah right
---
Which has happened before. I’ve seen this same post a half dozen times here, and the only times anyone has posted proof it’s been Psychobuff instead. 
---
There is a rumor that it was available way back on BETA, but even that’s just been a rumor from my experience.
---
Don't forget to list them for 400 caps each, they're super valuable...ugh...
---
Wait, are people seeing this on a particular platform?  I have never noticed this lag and I use the hell out of my tesla.  I use it a lot in ACP to tag all of the wendigo spawns, and I have used it several times at rumble to do the same.  AITA??  I am on PC, I have a decent rig, so am I fucking it up for those with less hardy PC specs??  If so then hahaha.....just kidding!!
---
 I mean I am genuinely thinking I could pack the tesla up, but these guys with magic guns seem to mow shit down so fast, tagging with tesla is the only way I get XP during line in the sand, or rumble.  It also gets me to tag the legendaries before they disappear in one violent night.
---
Oh hope your family will be alright mate and om actually on ps4 sorry mate
---
So like for example wooden boards would cap at 10 and handmade arty like 75?
---
Oof, really wish they had cross play. 😆
---
You can use the following but you may have diminishing returns if you use them all:
---
* Healing Factor (mutation)
---
* Sun Kissed (removes rads)
---
* Vampire's heavy weapons (big healz yo)
---
* What Rads (legendary perk for rad resistance and rad removal)
---
Also, Power Armor has hidden resistances (damage and rads) so that helps too.
---
Did it move from ‘Pending’ in your bank to ‘Approved’?  
---
If so, then submit a ticket to Bethesda Support.
---
I know right and you would have though this would be the game to do it
---
I'm not so much having trouble enjoying the game, but I have found myself with far more downtime than I feel like I used to have.
---
Echoing your post.  I played the beta and launch/ lasted to level 65 and the bugs/ stalls/ vanishing legendaries frustrated me out of the game.  My last play date was January 6, 2019.
---
Recently,  I went back check out NMS, from all the update post launch - and was pleasantly surprised.   I figured I’d do the same with 76.  Especially since their released NPCs.
---
I didn’t mind the no NPCs at launch,  I just hated the bugs, crashes and losing my camp nonsense.
---
This game is still buggy, but it feels more like a Bethesda release and less like an alpha that got pushed way too early.
---
While I am not a fan of the atom assets that are fallout 4 assets, or having to pay for a private server/ unlimited stash-  I’ve been having fun replaying this both as my solo character, and the duo character that I am using just to play with my younger brother.
---
It’s nice to be back.
---
every thing that's suppose to be released with the next update is still coming this upcoming Tuesday
---
If they ever do change the current system, I really *really* hope for your suggestion of infinite scrip/ purchase cap. I really don't like maintaining multiple characters and moving weapons around. I just wanna scrip it all and be rid of it.
---
Junkies builds like me xD
---
I am on now. will be online (not necessarily on fo76 though) for aboot 6 hours.
---
Seems odd that someone would rely on the word of single person giving you a value based on biased experience, but wouldn’t trust a complete resource that can provide you quick and at least semi-accurate  values.
---
Worst case it’s not worth what you thought and no one bites on your offer
---
Happy to help. If you really don't want to sneak, and I left this out because non-sneaking Commandos are rather rare, try out an ?E Railway if you're able to get your hands on one. Most effective would be quad, but you can make it work with your prefix of choice. The base damage is **fantastic,** and you don't even need Gunpowder!
---
Choo-choo!
---
Cool. Thank you!
---
Thanks everyone!
---
That could be a way that they do it, yeah. And legendaries could become top, top tier and scale even higher. Maybe be able to use scrip to even increase their levels.
---
Or give us script notes we can turn in if they don’t wanna change the 1000 script cap
---
Ok thanks for the advice
---
Same boat. Looted sack, listened to the holos, quest updated to go to robco but no dice getting in
---
Pew pew pew
---
Platform?
---
ty
---
Always good to point out do NOT use one gun army for queen. Can stagger her in air preventing landing.
---
Do not get into any vehicle with “Free Candy” painted one the side.
---
meanwhile I have 500+ plans at my camp and sell then so low there practically free and still can't rid of all of them lol.
---
I shouldn't die from a melee attack
---
Great use of glitching to decorate. I love the way this looks.
---
I'm probably not going to be on till tomorrow as I had a pretty long day at work. Thanks though
---
PC, forgot to put that in, just added it.
---
Just added you. I think
---
1. The number of spaces the Green space ship had to get to the end, showed you exactly how many days left. There was 100 spaces. The ship moved one space each day. So the board it's self showed you how many days left. 
---
2. A week or so before the end, they put in the game, several notices that it was going to end on the 8th. Which is a Tuesday. It was on the log in screen and the news screen. Both of which everyone sees when logging into the game. 
---
3. On their official forums, where they always post news they made a pinned post that the last day was Sept 8th, noon Eastern time. And that any unclaimed rewards should be claimed by then.
---
4. Reddit had multiple players post about the last days. 
---
Seriously. It's been talked about over and over on here. But some of the rewards, like the chicken coop will end up being available via gold from the various NPCs that sell gold. NOT EVERYTHING will be available. But those that have some function will. 
---
Look. We have sympathy. But in this case, Bethesda really went all out and made the information available in every single official outlet. Players also put the info out. 
---
I can't help but feel like you are still looking for a Bethesda's fault, with your last line. "Where exactly did it show the number of days left?". I mean, if they say the last day is September 8th, do you really need to be told, which means X amount of days from today?
---
I do 10x flourescent and 10x crimson
---
when is the sale ending?
---
unless your also like me who cryolators her to death with so she literally gets stuck in the air motionless and easier to kill. however, yeah don't use the perk like he said unless you have a reason lol
---
Andreslamantis. I might give you some free items too, to scrip away.
---
I totally agree.  I literally can not walk away from taking legendaries.  I mean I am obsessed, if we could scrap them for modules it would be a real quality of life improvement.
---
Primal Cuts events every 15 minutes and Grahm's Cook Off (or whatever it's called) on the hour. The cook off drops legendary weapons and plans you can only get there. The cooking event is a lot of fun because half the server comes to it.
---
everything in update 22 is still coming this Tuesday
---
I’d like to see a glowing bloating one like in fallout 4 where it revived dead ghouls within a range of it. It would make for some interesting fights.
---
Even 150 is a bit much. 
---
I don't know if i I'm listing any camp plans for more than 25-49 caps.
---
I get wanting caps sinks.. but scrip is very easy to max as it is..
---
not sure how being able to straight up buy it will help anything..
---
it'd be easier to just buy some ammo or plans off a player vendor..
---
buying modules and vault steel is the only plus I see.. and not everybody is interested in that
---
That sounds pretty cool. Thanks
---
Your understanding of those numbers against her are flawed. You aren’t invulnerable. She has crazy armor penetration.
---
I standardized my pricing to either roughly 1/5 or 1/10 of the cost. Caps are easy, better to offer for cheap and help other players.
---
looking forward to the ammo factory perk and won't have to blueprint them into my camp when i can be the ammo factory itself 😂
---
Read sub rules
---
35% on paper, [effectively](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-Handmade_L-45_ModReceiver-Prime_ModMagazine-Standard_ModMuzzle-Standard_ModSights-Standard_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_Kills-6_Other-0_Mult&amp;right=R_W-Handmade_L-45_ModReceiver-Prime_ModMagazine-Standard_ModMuzzle-Standard_ModSights-Standard_PHP-100_EHP-99_Enemy-ScorchbeastQueen_Hits-0_Addicts-0_Kills-6_Other-0_Mult) a bit less when considering their resistances.
---
Ya honestly not sure if I even care anymore. I just make sure I do my share of damage to her anymore and concentrate on other enemies. She's not as bugged as she used to be.
---
It's been approved for several days. What part of support do i go through specifically? When I choose anything store/atom related, it asks me for an order number. Which i don't have because I paid for them on Steam. I chose Steam as the platform while going through support as well.
---
Honestly if I dump my plans I would rather someone take them all
---
nonononono, this has nothing to do with regular DR, this is percentage based. Even if she has her insane AP powers, she shouldn't 1 hit me.
---
&gt;We need to be able to make the untradable legendary items have the effects we want. 
---
I just finished trying it out, I love it!
---
For me at least  this and the ammo perk are must-haves.
---
AA for teamplay and bosses, instigating for mobs and solo
---
What is TSE?
---
If are mounted plans, early game recipes, power armor pieces plan.. just dump them in the nearest river please! are everywhere no one will buy those plans and you gain stash space
---
Fantastic. I'm excited for this. I love hoard events and dungeon style events. I especially love the burrows and would.often nuke it to create my own glowing hoard event.
---
My questions are is the v94 emote coming back and are the drops coming from these events a one shot deal (if I miss that daily is it gone forever) or reccuring. Also, for lone wanderers, does simply joining a daily ops team put you into a daily op if one is already active? We shall see! Thanks for sharing this.
---
Why the difference between team play and solo?
---
Most plan I just drop at this point.  No one is going to buy an ultracite right arm plan for any amount of caps.  The only things I bother putting on vendor are anything CAMP related, recipes, weapons, and jet packs.  Pretty much any armor or mod plan is just taking up space.
---
I've some streams from Quakecon and Gamescon and the wives of the devs are avid builders in FO76. So I like to think the wives will make them add stuff.
---
I need help with the Atomic Shop &gt; I want a refund. 
---
Try that.
---
In Fallout 4 the “Powerful Automatic Reciever” retained the dust cover, I’ve yet to find that part in 76 (assuming it exists) but I imagine it would look the same as it did in F4.
---
If you want the nuka quantum PA paint you'll have to go on a key scavenger hunt for it and go to the bomb shelters in the forest and open the one with the plan in it as well as getting the regular nuka PA paint as well
---
Instigating works best when you’re alone because u don’t have to worry about other folks tagging the enemies for a little bit of damage and ruining ur bonus
---
In a team, people will most likely have already hit the enemy, that's why. I was thinking of events, not regular play
---
Excellent to hear
---
Hey could you help me out with a dumb question? I'm lvl like 120 and have never used jetpacks. I unlocked the captain Cosmo backpack but I'm not sure what to do with it. I am full excavator PA...do I need to craft a compatible set of armor? I didn't even see a jetpack option for crafting.
---
Sorry probably dumb
---
Biggest difference I think you’re going to find is how much more important your perk build is. Pick one weapon type (semi auto or rifleman perks/ full auto or commando perks are probably the most rounded out) and stick with only adding perks to that weapon damage even if you find yourself getting stuck using other weapons as you level. You don’t need to find your perfect gun until after level 50. But... after level 50 which is the soft level cap you can still move special points around with each level so you can still tweak or change.
---
You can also just equip the right str perks to ignore armor and go with instigating, but I have a feeling melee’s going to be harder with any prefix early on after patch 22
---
Ahh ok, I thought it was something to do with running in teams :)
---
Doesn't proc if you were already dead though.   If your health instantly drops from 60 percent straight to zero, yes your health is less than 40% but you are also already dead.
---
As someone else pointed out she basically bypasses DR.  A full set of troubleshooters though will let you take a decent whoopin' from her.  You'll still die pretty quick but you'll have time to react and heal.
---
Gun Fu does make me feel like more of a badass with my shotty tho. I only recently acquired it, and with a 32 round shotty it's just so amazing. Boom Headshot. Boom Headshot. Definitely build-dependent tho.
---
I would suggest just buying one from another player. Hit the marketplace
---
mine are all mostly prime weapon mod plans is the thing 😅
---
Same prizes?
---
The marksman barrels do, but I think he’s specifically referring to the “cheese grater” upper-handguard seen in F4 &amp; the 76 Atom shop preview images.
---
Speaking of music, if I hear the Cole Porter song "anything goes" one more time I am going to lose it.
---
I suffered through it on fallout 4 and so desperately hoped I would never hear it again... But hot damn  they shoved it into this game too. I know that Cole Porter was considered a magnificent composer... But the guy couldn't sing... I fail to understand why that song just doesn't go away.
---
I've been trying to access their support site for the last several days and no success.  So, it's not just you.
---
 Thanks, I misunderstood 
---
I only use unarmed when leveling up in places like the burrows the rest of th4 time my character runs explosive shotguns so I think instigating will be the best option
---
Im catching up on random quests while waiting for the next season.
---
It asks for a [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) order number as a requirement, which i don't have because i didn't buy it from their platform.
---
True, and I appreciate the suggestion, but it's not my build so much as my play style. I've been playing the same since fallout 3 and I'm not interested in changing. Same with playing a stealth archer in morrowind/oblivion/skyrim/tes5(eventually). Thank you for the suggestion though.
---
I agree, use to play it everyday for about 4-5 hours a night but since completing a couple of weeks ago, I just log on to do the 3 treasury note missions, quick XP run and then log off.
---
I’m also at 799 stash budget and at 30k caps. So can’t even sell anything to get my stash down lol
---
Definitely not aa. If you're using incisor, which you should be, aa is pointless
---
What platform
---
Again, they need to pull their in-game purchase because this has to be breaking some laws.
---
Ahhh gotcha haven’t looked 🤣
---
Having tried both, I personally prefer AA. There are so many instances where enemies take damage from other enemies and instigating is no longer useful.
---
That's awesome...If I find unwanted plans or someone offers me plans the dont want, I'll take em with thanks! Then I give them to any lower lvls I come by to help them out. 😎
---
fun fact, got a Q5025 railway rifle named "CHOO-CHOO" in my stash and get it out every now and then. the sound is too entertaining :D  
---
thanks for the hint!
---
Alt ) Hold Breath
---
For most of the mounted plans I'd say 5 caps is about the limit.  Everyone has a ton of them, the demand is low and the supply is enormous.  Most of them don't look amazing.  The main reason to buy them is just completionism.
---
This is part of the reason I ended up buying the AR-10 skin. I mean, I love AKs but the rifle doesn’t look nearly as good as it did in Fallout 4.
---
I just put everything up for 20 bucks, whatever it is.
---
Yea I have to remind myself to get some popcorn for all the 'BlOodIeD HaS BeEn NeRfEd!', 'mY dAmAgE!?' posts. :p
---
Dunno about, "stoked" but I'm interested to see how Daily Ops turn out.
---
I love it when people check out my camp but please close the door I already have to deal with Beckett opening them every 5 minutes
---
just get in touch when you can. i'll be on the same time tomorrow as well.
---
There are a lot of players that sell ‘junk legendaries’ in their machines for around that conversion rate already. 
---
I price mine at 15c/scrip value. 3-star weapon for 600 caps. 
---
I recommend shopping around or even friending players that you see do this regularly. There are a couple of people that are semi-regulars at my shop that tend to buy me out when they stop by.
---
So put in all 9s maybe?
---
I was at 100%
---
And blocker ect. are percentage based
---
Head over to the market sub to sell stuff. We cant speak its name here but replace "fallout" in fallout76 with "market" and that'll get you there
---
Just to your last point, Anti-armor being viable for all play styles is exactly why it shouldn’t be on par with junkies or any other optimized build. 
---
That mentality is why optimized builds have been annoyed with the nerf, because players still want more. They want any weapon you casually pick up and can use no matter your play style to be on par with the item that drops your health, DR, special stats, etc. the game should have been focused on producing more specialized builds rather than normalizing the difference between a casual build and an optimized one.
---
This isn’t saying a nerf shouldn’t have happened. Just that the logic being used is exactly why no real MORPG players would like this game. Everyone feels they should be able to play every class with little to no difficulty. That’s just lazy gameplay.
---
The only potential problem with a non E Railway is that it may still be bugged with Concentrated Fire, similar to Bows. I don't actually know one way or the other, but you'll be pumping more than enough spikes into faces that it probably won't matter.
---
Also, you'd be surprised at how little AP a non 25 Railway uses :D
---
You’re obviously misunderstanding something about the calculations if they didn’t go the way you thought they would
---
Which plans should we keep a look out for? I tend to just toss literally all my plans up for 20 but it would be nice to know what the rare stuff is.
---
ty and that's a cool site.
---
If I'm poking around a camp I'll usually just throw up an approving thumbs up or something or say hello on mic.
---
Once though I was determined to get into someone's locked upstairs by glitching through a window or whatever. I'm just so intrigued by the idea of locking rooms in camps when there's nothing to steal, so I had to know what was in there. After a while of that I guess they became rightly annoyed by my extra curiosity and what ensued was one of the best 15-20 mins of 2v1 PVP I've ever had in 76. I was doing alright too until they broke out the power armor and jetpacks and explodey guns. 10/10
---
Okay. Then how do blocker ect. work because the game says that they are percentage based. You just say that I don't understand it while not giving the truth out at the same time.
---
Thanks. I will be sure to check it out.
---
To the best of my knowledge +END food/weapons/armor do NOT add HP. It does slightly increase disease resistance but I'm not sure if it does anything else off the top of my head.
---
Don't you mean that pistols will use less ammo than Commandos and Heavies?
---
And as a consolation, you’d always at least get the junk it was made of.
---
Changed at lvl 150. Truly refreshing
---
Nope. They have been legacy since wastelanders. You can trade for one from another player though
---
It’s nice to put a name and face to the previously anonymous people I’m loudly cursing in my living room when their shit doesn’t work
---
He just wants you to grab the turret circuts board
---
PC so far atm
---
Yo what platform you on I love trying to get them all. If xbox I'll probably try and buy all I don't know
---
Pistol builds are super tricky to get the most bang for your buck. Best way ive found is to only invest one point into each damage perk, bloody mess, max out adrenaline, and invest heavily in VATs perks. It still doesn't compare very well to other builds, but it makes them a lot more useful.
---
I have not played 76 since just before wastelanders came out, and I am pretty hyped to be able to hop in and play through the new content without outleveling it.
---
I can tell you what doesn't work. Merging them at a work shop and blue printing it. So don't waste your time trying like I did haha
---
So it is not just me!!  I really want to get the recipe for the ant lager carry weight, but I am stuck on tick tequila!
---
I just put in the Steam transaction ID there and told them that as part of the description. Hopefully it does something to help.
---
I'm looking forward to Vault 69
---
His post has nothing to do with not having enough weapons to trade run for scrip. He wants more ways to get scrip because 150 a day isn’t enough
---
Not the person you replied to but I always leave all my doors and gates open and I actually hate it when people close them. The only “important things” I lock is my collection
---
But you still have to get that turret circut board
---
Join builder teams for the increased intelligence, which translates into more XP.  You don't have to actually play WITH them, which was my concern for the longest time.  More XP will help increase levels quicker as you do you.
---
Ultimately, have fun!
---
If you have fo1st, you can transfer items betwen characters more easily by using a private server. Most of my characters are now filled up with purveyor discount items :)
---
Can't wait to just wander around the forest, ashheap and toxic valley for hours experiencing a lot of the locations I missed but don't have the incentive to explore because the rewards of doing so would basically be the scrap I pick up.
---
Junkies heavy gunner, sneak rifles, unarmed or melee sneak, or non sneak... literally any build can do perfectly fine at full health you’re just doing something wrong
---
Sadly no.
---
I legit prowl vendors for bargin plans.
---
OP didn’t say that specifically. I offered a suggestion that *might help*, depending on their particular situation. 
---
I didn’t discount their idea. I simply added a possible alternative.
---
OP talked about cap sinks. They never said they always hit their daily scrip maximum.
---
My prediction: sneaky types with 'follow through' maxed and heavies with 'taking one for the team' maxed will become as Princes among Men at boss fights.
---
Haha I did the same thing. I was so pissed when I spent 10 minutes getting it perfect only to find out I wasted my time
---
F that
---
Are you gonna use all of it?? I'm low on caps 🤣
---
do the side quest trust me you will regret it if you dont
---
Pc cheaters...
---
Same here, I literally never go to those locations except to vendors. Be nice to see where it all started again.
---
I agree.
---
I mean, what could be done to stop them?
---
Anti-Armor is not on par; it's just better than it was in relative terms. The difference is still there. Unoptimized builds will still be using a lot more resources to do the same things than optimized builds, for sure.
---
Regardless, I agree with you that it would have been a lot more awesome if we got more variety of build options in addition to a formula change. But that's not what we got, at least not yet.
---
Additionally, this isn't an MMORPG. I'm not even sure what to call Fallout 76, but it's never been that. Personally, I've never thought that I am entitled to play any playstyle with no investment in proper gear, perks, etc. I know the mentality that you're talking about, but I don't think that generalization is really fair to the player base.
---
Ah. Is that the best weapon against the Queen and Earl?
---
Man, I hope that's the case. Wouldn't bet on that, though. Possibly less than heavies. Again, I don't...super know for certain. Pistols are definitely getting a net positive here, that much is certain.
---
Oh man im excited but this is going to be like choosing a character name at the start.  I have an idea what perks to go for but I need to start planning it now XD
---
I think its bulk items.
---
did you hit your head and forget who the developer of this """""""""""""""""""""""game"""""""""""""""""" is? lol
---
I was so confused by the wording of this. I read "fixed" as in never changing.
---
Good to know I don't need to write an angry comment. Maybe the notion of Bethesda fixing something was too rare for me
---
Thank you very much with the info. Have my upvote and a award for bringing me this info. I am a rifle, shotgun and pistol build. For role-playing purpose.
---
Yeah I actually enjoyed it and looking forward to season two.
---
That's a good idea. 
---
Are you using a 2nd account to transfer or can you use some random open world storage that persists while you switch?
---
I'm just having trouble justifying their price tag. I can use that money for an xbox game pass and catch up on some other games instead.
---
That answers a lot of questions. Can't trust anyone in HR.
---
That would possibly cause more problems than it solves. If for example, The Fixer suddenly became available as a level 60 weapon, then everyone that grinded to get their personal level 50 ‘best version’ would be a bit ‘cheated’, unless they boosted all level 50 Fixers to level 60. Which then for the level 50-59 characters would be unusable. 
---
With the available perks and builds that can enhance the effectiveness of a current max level weapon, I don’t personally see a need for this.
---
What’s your GT? I’ll come check out your camp.
---
I suppose that's subjective, but numbers are a huge part of how the game 'feels' to me. I'm always watching the displayed damage and Earle's life bar.
---
and I'm sure it's going to deplete at least 50% slower. which also directly affects my flamer build, both in terms of ammo consumption and how fast the thing breaks.
---
That's my group's plan, because those two STACK. Not multiple times, but the end result is, according to AngryTurtle, around 150% Bonus damage, which certainly seems Legendary to me! I've tested maxed TOTT on the PTS a ton and it is freaking great. 
---
Just makes me wish there was a more consistent method of holding aggro, but if everyone else is sneaking hey that works just fine XD
---
I run a full health Junkie's hybrid PA, Heavy, Shotgunner, Stealth Rifleman, etc so I'm actually literally Taking One For The Team by not taking Ammo Factory so I can take...Taking One For The Team. 
---
Thankfully, my friends are maxing Ammo Factory and are more than happy to craft all the ammo I'd need as long as I throw the resources at them.
---
I just take everything and sort through it after then drop again for someone else
---
Ah yes probably bulking a group of junk into a lower weight for storage that you can either sell or just use to reduce weight and you can break it down back into it's usable components later.
---
Well hey now you just know for next time right?
---
No problems. thank you! Sorry to hear about the funeral. Hope everything is okay! :)
---
Wanted to ask on melee.
---
I regularly (with unarmed, or 1 each of slugger) just run enemy to enemy generally one or two tapping. Will I have more trouble doing that now?
---
you can get in there. but the gold is just a prop. you can also get into the gold room but it's impossible to pick any of it up.
---
so im not sure, but you have the option to bundle certain crafting materials together
---
in english i think its called "bulk"
---
this makes it so that you can sell the bulk items to robot vendors, and on rare occasions it can make the combined ressources lighter than what they would be individually
---
if thats the case, crafting it should use up something like 25 of the ressources and a bit of plastic
---
anyways if its the case, dont bother with it its not very usefull
---
I've glitched in. They are set pieces. The platforms are physical, so you can stand on them. Also you can fall to the bottom and its solid ground and walls.
---
Also the gold room where u pick up the pieces, can be entered again. But no function button to pic them up.
---
I've started putting my plans for sale for 5 caps. Someone might need them.
---
Dude, I need those armpit plans! Can you make aerosol weapons with them? You on PS4?
---
Ah, thank you for the response.
---
That's my companion's job.  Now they're going to think they can just sit around all day and drink my Nuka Colas.
---
I turned off damage numbers a long time ago. Enjoyed the game a lot more after that. Just saying.
---
Also, props for using a Flamer! I freaking love those things. So, so, so underrated. They just obliterate basically everything. I can't even imagine how often a legacy one would break; the regular kind breaks often enough XD
---
These free emotes seriously enrich the game a lot more than you'd expect. Keep em coming!
---
That makes the most sense, I would bet it's the "Bulk" section. 
---
Bulking items saves weight in your stash at the cost of a couple units of plastic. This is a great way to consolidate and make space without sacrificing inventory.
---
They kept some things from you. That's very easy to do here.
---
Stealth is not worth even trying to use. If you go stealth you are always detected even when out of sight as you will be consistently surrounded by at least one enemy with the mutation at all times since the enemies do not stop spawning/chasing and do not patrol as far as I can tell.
---
Hey...hey...nudge, nudge, could you put a word in to bring back the giddy up butter cup ride? Also the gold mr fuzzy ride need that one too for my playground arcade bar I am trying to make.
---
By any chance would you like a flechetes cursed harpoon gun? As well with the helmet?
---
Good to hear that someone actually tried!🤓👍👍
---
I don't know your build, perk loadout, or your preferred weapons so I can't tell you for certain. However, general rule of thumb here is to Power Attack with Slugger/2Handed, and Sneak Power Attack with Unarmed.
---
Have their mothers yell down to basement to stop is all we can hope for.
---
Maybe I just run light or something, but I frequently go to cash in with a ton of assault rifles, golf outfits, and various chems. Takes me all of 20 seconds. \*shrugs\*
---
So yeah, that’s what I’ve been doing. Thanks! I will continue my tanking as I do.
---
Nerd Rage is under INT
---
Good point, thanks for mentioning that.
---
Really? I mean reeeeaaallllyyyy?   
---
I would just delete this post before people think you are a 100/100 on the spectrum.
---
I can’t answer your question sadly. Just note that two shot is not double damage. 
---
It’s 1.25x damage instead.
---
Me too man
---
Same thing happened to me. You need to get a friend that the key does show up for and let them complete it again. Follow them at last step and grab dome key.
---
They confirmed both One Wasteland and Legendary perks in the last 30 or so seconds of the video
---
Of course, you are correct. Im lvl 306, thats an embarrassing typo! 🤣
---
Also, to be clear, I don't wait around like a dope. If you're taking that long, I head to a different vendor. It's just frustrating :)
---
In case anyone’s curious who doesn’t know, this item is most likely the inoculation chamber that you see in the main storyline as well as inside the bunkers to fabricate a new security keycard.
---
how could you not know every time you logged on for over a week there was A a specific date and time
---
Some would say it’s risky, but I transfer items on public servers all the time between my characters. I find a container with unlimited storage in an area where not many people are around, put what I want to transfer in it, and then log back in with my other character. Make sure to note multiple player names in the server so you can re-join the correct server.
---
I’ve done this probably 100 times and have only had one server disconnect in which I couldn’t recover my items.
---
Again, it isn’t fullproof so do it at your own risk, but it works for me.
---
I use the same account. So I log on private server, put stuff in the ice box outside purveyor, switch to my other character, go back into private server, and pick up my items from ice box.
---
Private servers are persistent for about 20 to 30 minutes *after* you sign off a character. So if you switch characters right away it works.
---
Some have reported crashes and stuff, so you have to account for that 1% chance of failure. If the game crashes or your console/pc does, then chances are you won't sign back onto the same private world.
---
I have never failed a private server transfer, but I use a courier when I want to transfer legacies and God rolls.
---
What console you on?
---
It’s cool when you get in and then you’re just looking up at the monoliths around you while in a multi hundred foot tall, long, and wide chamber
---
That would literally take you more than half a year to redeem if you played every single day if you keep going at it you will literally reach a years worth of redeemable notes.
---
Dang, too bad... I thought that the gold amount was pretty low for the effort to get in there, especially seeing the prices for the items at the Foundation, Crater and Secret Service. Back to grinding I guess.🙄🤔😎
---
You’re absolutely right. I’m up to 15 assultron recall key cards :( I can’t imagine how many I’ve used
---
I think in a group you'll likely have no problem, since people on the test server are able to solo them.
---
I read somewhere that it's the generic Zenimax Code of Conduct, not specifically Fallout 76, as ESO players had the same thing.
---
I don’t think anti-armor currently is, just that the idea it should be would be a dangerous game because there are plenty of other casual weapons that would demand the same. 
---
While that’s not what we got, I think that’s why it’s just as important to keep voicing that opinion rather than giving Bethesda props on an issue that required very little work on their part and has created a whole other series of fixes that’s I’ll eventually need to be made to base weapons.
---
This isn’t a standard MMO, but it’s definitely an MO(I only used one M). It falls in the same category as GTA, which for whatever reason considers themselves a full mmo, where many of the mechanics are there but in a limited scope.
---
While I don’t think this is the mentality of the FO community, it’s the majority mentality on reddit. You can look at some of the old nerf posts when this was new information and even the level-headed responses that thought the nerf was just a lazy response to a larger issue got lots of downvotes, and I’ve personally been told by at least a few of the regular community members on here that bloodieds and junkies should be “nerfed to oblivion” with no backlash. 
---
It’s the one complaint I’ve had with the f76 community. While everyone is usually extremely helpful, despite this basically just being a pve game people seem to revel in other builds being weaker to the point they’d welcome themselves getting nerfed if it meant someone else suffered more. 
---
Perhaps it’s just because I’m on the side that welcomes those critics, but I’ve seen many of them unanimously praised everytime they shout down someone trying explain the math on certain builds
---
All the while, magic weapons still exist. The nerf will mean little besides making sure broken in-game weapons have even less competition.
---
It's a matter of pricing, imho.  Priced right, any plan will see out of convenience to the buyer alone, given they have the caps.  
---
Any plan worth 0-500C, I sell for 10 caps. 500-2000C...15 caps.  Anything above 2000C I sell for 20 caps.  Recipes are always 5C.  
---
I don't care how rare it might be or whatever.  They always sell no matter what the plan is for, mounted head plans and all.  
---
I had a player dump 200-250 duplicate mounted head plans of all sort at my camp. (20-30 each of the less rare plans)  Put them in my vending machine at 10C and all sold within a couple of months.  Took as long as it did just because I had so many of them, imho
---
As a new player, this is great! I've only started playing 3 days ago, currently level 11, no idea what i'm doing but learning as a go and doing the campaign! Loving the game so far (Playing it on Gamepass PC). 
---
Curious - have the devs spoken and reassured it's player base that FO76 will be supported for a while with cosmetic drops, content drops and performance patches and etc..?
---
I go to Vault 76 and drop them there for the new people that spawn in that server..
---
Another great idea. I don't really mind the risk since I'm on the verge of trashing them so i can get back to playing the game instead of playing some storage wars meta game
---
Im on Xbox- my gamer tag is computerlady77
---
I feel like a "legendary item scrapper"  would be a good new camp item, maybe a reward for season 3
---
I know, now I need to see if I can glitch in too, unfortunately I really suck at it and can't even glitch into my own Camp.😀😀 keep on trying again and again I guess😁
---
Get an AA faster swing speed meat hook and terrorize those pesky teenage scorched that ran you over last summer.
---
Hey all, so I've watched the video.  Read the Fed76 take on things.  But haven't had a chance to test yet.  Does this work (or not work more appropriately) on all platforms or just PC?  Playing on PS4, btw.
---
Drops are rare?
---
I would love a Junk Jet that could do that.
---
I’ll save some nocturnal rolling pins for you. Stay safe and I hope you stay well.
---
Thanks for the great tips.
---
That was fast, great news! Let's get back to work :P
---
Probably didn’t want all the extra weight
---
Collect ski poles around Top of the World ski resort, and food trays from the dining hall in eastern penitentiary and cafeteria at Morgantown HS for aluminum
---
I've played with both. Tse is cool, less accurate but that means if they're near an opening but behind a wall you're bound to nail them... and their friends. Be is much better damage and accuracy. Both might be good vs a big baddie in a standup fight depending on the distance and mods.
---
it's a really fun build. I was going to switch to gauss weaponry but I can't bring myself to stash my flamers. and with the nozzle they actually outperform the minigun, too.
---
I sneak with a legacy but use a regular, 25% faster one for bosses. Earle goes down surprisingly fast. but I can barely make it through the fight as it is, with gunsmith 5 and luck of the draw 3.
---
Players should get a nuke boss per region
---
I'm all of level 13. The ghouls over there are mid 40s
---
They make it clear joining the group is the same as any other public group and also that the rewards are a random chance each time you complete it. Complete it on the highest difficulty and it rolls for the rewards 3x at 3 different chances to get it.
---
its not that different you guys!*
---
*as long as you sneak for every attack to 2x your damage and ignore the fact that if you were sneaking before this patch it is still a big dps drop
---
the amount of cope posts about this rebalance is just insane.  the average player will be unhappy with these changes.
---
...yeah, the fact that they've never addressed Magic Weapons is concerning. I totally agree that that bug really, really needs to get fixed. 
---
But, something tells me that the cause is buried deep, deep in their netcode and attempts to fix it have broken so many other things that they're still trying to figure out how to fix it at all. 
---
Why else would they not even acknowledge them as a thing that exists? I mean, make it so Shotguns do the damage Magic Shotguns do without them needing to be magic. Seems pretty balanced to me. But what happens with UGLs, Miniguns, and Legacy Gatling Plasmas...oof.
---
Every hit on an enemy reduces condition, it's why laser splitter weapons break so quickly 
---
Also, TSE isn't that good since the nerf almost a year ago
---
I agree in a way. I don't find the same pressure to play. But when I am playing, I don't really know what to do with myself. Guess I could re-organize my vendors, that has been way overdue. With so few SBQ and ACP events, it seems very quiet in Appalachia.
---
They keep talking about running in with your gun and bashing them, but you can't bash in VATS..
---
2nd
---
&gt;  If you've stuck with it until now, you'll be okay. You'll be using more ammo, but more than the Commandos and Heavies.
---
I mean this line?
---
weapons degrade based on the number of hits. so assuming both shots connect, yes. it'll degrade twice as fast. same applies for the explosion.
---
if you want to see an explosive weapon degrade really fast, just shoot a group of enemies and try to hit all of them with the explosive splash.
---
also why shotguns break so fast.
---
You must do, I've got to navigate through a tonne of stuff and be careful of the few guns that I can't skin yet.
---
Think, at the last count , I had a choice of 112 apparel.pieces... 😄
---
Use imgur for pics
---
It iiiiis what it iiiiis, at least you didn’t disconnect 10 minutes later at earl or SBQ
---
Do you know how to glitch in?
---
Yeah, I assumed we were exempt on console, then my buddy pulled up the ad. I have no idea if it actually works, but I really hope Beth perma-bans anyone using one.
---
I am. I have an imgur photo uploader. Is there a certain one to use?
---
With full adrenaline, my bloodied lever would do over 6000 damage to the head of a lv. 68 super mutant. If that weapon can no longer one shot super mutants, that’s a problem. This change should not happen period, now that we have all grinded/cemented our builds for almost two years. This change would have been fine around the time of The Great TSE Nerf, but doing it now? Come on.
---
Jesus.... why do you carry all that with you instead of in your stash?
---
I picked up the same one. I think it had a raiders  and and enclave one. I can’t remember the other two, maybe the responders was one.
---
Very close, but no cigar. AA,agility,relode or explosive, per and firerate . Shotgun
---
This exactly.  I went on the PTS as a stealth commando and got eaten alive in Daily Ops.  I switched all my perks around and pulled a .50 cal out of my stash that I don't think I had ever used (it's Junkie's Explosive so I knew not to scrap it).  Now I can solo the Daily Ops in my Power Armor without any real trouble.  
---
The added bonus of Legendary Perks means I can still put some points back into Commando and keep doing my favorite style of play when I'm outside of the Ops.
---
Thanks for the kind words! I can't speak for the other folks, but it's love for the community that keeps me going at it! (And love for plans, of course)
---
Support tried this for me last night and I logged back in after re-linking to the same sync error.
---
There are no ghouls inside the vendors section in whitesprings, inside and outside this main building you are protected by the robots  
---
Look for the shop called STUDIO number something,
---
I'm 300 hours in, had seen a pie once or twice in vendors but didnt know where they came from. Stumbled upon that machine and got the pie on my third try.
---
Ok 👌!
---
They have posted links here before. But any praise that goes to them is much needed. They put together a list that’s helped a lot of us find things we didn’t even know to look for.
---
Darn, well hopefully something is found.
---
Yeah but it is sad that the legendary perks are just going to help you go back to the amount of damage you did pre nerf.
---
Dilute your stimpacks &amp; radaways while you're still a relatively low level, they'll go further. Public events (the ones with an exclamation mark on the map) also often reward stimpacks, radaways, and purified water, and are free to travel to. Just check the recommended level before jumping in (at least until the 15th when that won't matter as much due to the One Wasteland update).
---
The game doesn't really direct you very well around the map, but after the forest you should go to the toxic valley, and after that go explore the ash heap. Only then should you really be wandering into the savage divide like it directs you. Again, this probably gets less important after the 15th.
---
Scrap weapons &amp; armour to learn plans to modify that weapon/armour.
---
If you find a suit of power armour but are too low-level, you can claim it by taking the armour pieces off, getting in, getting out, and replacing the armour. It can now be picked up, or will automatically go into your inventory after a little while. I'd recommend renaming every suit you collect (Inventory =&gt; Inspect =&gt; Rename) as otherwise you'll end up with a load of power armour in your stash and no idea what any of it does.
---
Train stations and red rocket stations always have a stashbox, and train stations normally have a vendor you can sell unnecessary stuff to.
---
And explore! There's plenty in the game which isn't on the main questlines, including some really interesting sidequests.
---
It dies in 2 seconds with decent equipment, and you can't die if you have stimpacks.
---
Not a dumb question at all. The excavator armor is the only one that can't have a jetpack, you'd just need to get a second set of armor to add the Captain Cosmos jetpack to it.
---
That’s what I don’t get. If there’s an issue buried so deep in the code why aren’t we at least making those weapons legacies or bringing everything else up to the same power through artificial means? It seems like there could be temp fixes that would have handled this so much sooner. And that’s the issue I’ve had. Why are we nerfing everything when the exploit gear still stays the same. Why wouldn’t you just buff everyone else and then adjust the enemies like they already were doing with one wasteland.
---
Maybe that’s what the additive calls are supposed to help fix in the future, but if that’s the case the nerf should be delayed. Till then, the only thing bloodieds are doing is making Earl easier for RNG rolls and one-shotting useless mobs. 
---
Just seems like there’s a lot of praise for a flawed approach
---
What plans are you looking for specifically, I may be able to help and you might be able to get some weight out of my pocket. I’m on PS4
---
i sell plans for 25-50 caps, maybe more depending on rarity. but recipes are a consistent seller for me at 20 caps
---
*happy console peasant noises*
---
I have mostly stopped playing this week, apart from logging in briefly to scrip whatever mumbles gave me yesterday and get more disappointment from her. But part of that is because the main thing I'd been doing outside the run was the reputation grind, and I might as well wait until fast travel to crater &amp; foundation is free before continuing that.
---
But I definitely did enjoy the run, it gave me just a little bit more structure each day if I wanted it, and am looking forward to the next one.
---
I keep running out of Stimpacks
---
I usually use the mobile app, copy link and paste. This is just a random image for fallout76 https://imgur.com/gallery/hKvLvos
---
The power armor method of getting through walls is extremely easy. I just watched a youtube guide since it was easier than understanding typed instructions.
---
Nerd rage and demo expert are both under intelligence not luck
---
Weren’t they legacy way before wastelanders?
---
Because your numbers are quite honestly irrelevant against it, I'd go as far as arguing that the attacks on that thing are by far the worst damage in the game by a mile.
---
My entire crew run vanguard builds with high DR resistance ourselves and if we get cornered and attacked we're done for.
---
Welcome to encrypted.
---
Two shot, explosive.
---
Takes extreme player skills to kill a boss with bugged effect "magic" weapon.
---
\* clap \*
---
I never turn a man down when he's asking for lube.
---
So only aluminum and lead actually save weight. The real benefit is being able to sell some junk that otherwise you can't sell, otherwise any weight savings are just from using up your plastic.
---
I use power armor without blocker, lone wanderer or psycho and I can tank multiple hits before dying, with horn survivor and occasional stims I never die unless I forget to dodge the laser. You either did something wrong or didn’t have some of those things equipped
---
Yes it's easy to max but you can spend as much as you have, without limit, so an extra three hundred would just get spent right away and would actually be a cap sink.
---
So my fallout 1st will go out tomorrow but I usually don’t get my atoms for a day or two.
---
might as well haha im omw home now so if ur one ill snag it
---
You've now told me to play the game and enjoy it twice. I already do. I just don't invent expectations and then complain about them.
---
Three extra tries at god roll weapons per week doesn't help?   Edit spelling
---
90% of my plans i have i sell for 5 caps each. Unless its somthing rare then the price is higher or somthing common (im looking at you Mole Miner Gauntlet) its either 1 cap or free.
---
might as well haha im omw home now so if ur on ill snag it
---
I only sell plans from queen drops, some of those are harder to come by. And 50© is a deal
---
It’s always been instant for me. I’ve had to contact them once and they usually credit the atoms quickly.
---
Yesterday I came across a bag with several sets of undying, life saving, and weightless armor. They weren't complete but they were there. Also it had hundreds of plans, and I mean HUNDREDS. Some I didn't even know as a level 200 player, I was very suprised.
---
At least its not a magic build....(bloodied, cough, cough)
---
*Flashbacks to Zelda*
---
Glitching? We just used good ol fashioned hammers and saws. :)
---
We're all at max caps on all our characters lol. I still stick in plans at 10 caps each and unwanted ammo, as well as the odd weapon that is too good to scrip but not good enough for me (level 745)
---
I'm 180ish and if I see an interesting plan I don't have and the price is right I'm going to grab it.  Particularly recipes.
---
Yeah it use to be the day it went out but lately about a day or two later I get them. But I’ve always got them. Now if I buy them then I get them right away
---
I sell my stuff for the same price for the opposite reason. 
---
I am flushed with plans from sitting on the munitions plant in my private server which would be useful to new players. Too mamy to be going over to the overseers camp every time I want to give them away. So I dump them in my vendor at 10caps a piece, a bit more if it's more useful. 
---
My thought is it's cheap enough that most new players can afford but if some a hole wants to buy me out and sell them higher, let them. I'll take their money too.
---
Finally the basher rank 2 meta will arise! My shredding miniguns are ready
---
Bethesda said it is supposed to be fixed. So fingers crossed it will be when it goes live
---
no no, gimme them
---
And splitting the 1.25x damage evenly across two projectiles introduces a big hit to damage against armored enemies.
---
Tea time will usually net a few ants.  Also have seen them at the antique store and dolly sods but nothing was as reliable as the power station.
---
The one with the deathclaw? Occasionally the lucky mine spawns the ants but it's not common
---
Oh, that. I meant relative ammo consumption. Not like, 200 rounds of 10mm or something. Where a commando uses 2 more rounds, you'd be using maybe 4 to 5 more depending on your build.
---
They’re still at the campfire tales event, just go pick up some wet kindling
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ant\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ant_(Fallout_76))
---
Sorry, are you saying Demolition Expert affects gauss rifles? If so, I didn't know that. I do have an AA gauss rifle which I was considering making my main sniper weapon just as soon as I learn how to put a silencer on it.
---
I did exactly the same thing today too was given a 1star legendary in return a nice gesture.
---
Aaronholt homestead remembers...
---
That kind of plan yes I would keep and sell cheap but lol the basketball hoop plans I’ll just drop if they don’t sell for 20 caps
---
Watoga Underground has some I think.
---
Shredding miniguns are a huge part of my build so I look forward to utilizing them for the resilient ops. Got a Vamp’s two AA’s, and like 3 others that have useless prefixes but 40% bash damage so I can keep the good times rolling even if my main ones break. 
---
Do you think this playstyle could achieve elder solo?
---
0.1 in weight each. Sod all really. 
---
When your carry weight is 400 it's nothing. I've guns that weigh more than all that clothing put together. 
---
I often play with a girl who's an outfit  junky...it's good fun to swap clothing during a gaming session.
---
Lol or prime weapon mods

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ONLINE CONSOLE HACKS. I’ve been jail breaking PS3’s and PS4’s  for years now along side RGH’ing Xbox 360’s. I know a thing or two about  “hackers” on console. PS4 has been jail broken yes, but you cannot  cheat/hack online and it will be a long time before you can. And nobody  has even been close to RGH/JTAG’ing a Xbox one, if it’s even possible.  If you’re getting melted by somebody, then they are obviously having a  good game. I see all you guys complaining about cheaters on console but  never any video proof, where as when somebody encounters a cheater on PC  that gets instantly recorded. Weird. Sorry guys, you simply just got  shit on and you a little salty about it.
---
I'm very excited to explore vault 94 and for those pesky charred ghouls to leave the area around my low level character's CAMP
---
I enjoy playing without it, but there’s not a lot to play without a grind. Earl makes it more enjoyable when you have a good group to run with, but now nukes are down and I can only launch one every 1 1/2 hours. So I’m stuck just trying to organize my cramped inventory for the time being...
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Will you be playing tonight?
---
I can’t speak for mobile, but if you play on PC it is a different character/account
---
I agree but I learned if you spawn on a team mate instead of their base then you will spawn somewhere different. I tell ppl not to spawn on me. Just spawn on my base. I don’t know why there’s a difference but you will be under my foundation if you spawn on me. You spawn directly in front of my vendors if you spawn on my camp.
---
In my experience, yes. This was with lever action rifles. Two shot explosive breaks really fast. Explosive breaks fast.
---
Pretty sure I've seen them for sale as well after F3, and not just left overs but a new run of the lunch boxes.
---
Dang. Do you know if there is a way to stream xbox version on PC like we will be able to stream on mobile?
---
I hope so, it really is unbearable :(
---
It’s not untrue
---
The magic effect on that vamp gauss mini is way more powerful than any build without magic effect.
---
Hey man i play ps4, are you still looking for one? I have one i never use so i can just give it to you.
---
Lol 6 feet apart!
---
Semi accraute is a laughable statement. Fed76 dev openly admits to biased data to maximise profit rather than use average pricing. They use zero in-game vendor price, the single largest pool of sale data they flatly ignore for "reasons".
---
Endurance weapons and armor does not boost HP unfortunately, but food does! Try it out
---
Are you sure there isn’t a spot on your land underwater that may work? Even many land locations can’t do it, it’s really a matter of finding that sweetspot.
---
Go into first person. Get as close to the glass as possible and continue to run forward. Now go to photo mode, hold the camera again the glass as well, then exit out still holding forward. You should phase through
---
Or place down your power armor with something like a table or box behind it, preventing you from getting into it. Then try to get in it. You’ll stall for a couple seconds, then can move around freely for like 7 or 8 seconds. In this timeframe, run against the glass you’re trying to go through. You’ll end up in power armor and phase through the glass
---
It just hits hard though.  When I have soloed it in the past I do full TS armor, lone wanderer, dodgy, chem buff and am constantly injecting myself with super stims using field surgeon and first aid with a vampires weapon in my hands.
---
And then like I said, it still can kill you pretty fast, but you at least have a window where you actually can react before you are dead.
---
Im a The Division Player and i would love to see something like a Left Arm Power Armor Mod that would give a metal plate as a shield, that would block weapon fire or reduce it in X% and we can only handle one hand weapons. THAT would be something cool too, the dual wielding thing is also a cool thing but noooo bethesda, that wouldnt happen. Not possible or some another problems they would find... sadly
---
It reminds me of when the first The Division game released and people could only interact with laptops one at a time. There were dozens of people queued up to interact within safe houses which was required to progress. 
---
https://www.thumbsticks.com/the-division-queue-simulator-08032016/
---
It gives armor pen, instead of the debuff.
---
You shouldn’t assume. Do as you feel like doing. It’s the beauty of this game. The (slightly restricted) freedom of choice lol
---
I have several spots that I usually go to(make sure to run butcher's bounty):
---
Campfire tales: picking up wet kindling has a decent chance to spawn them
---
Gauley Mine: Inside the Robco facility
---
Dolly Sods: There's a chance here. If there's one in the first cabin(where Scout leader Treadly is), there's a good chance there are more in the cabin on top of the hill
---
Tea time: there's a chance for them to spawn here. More players of course mean there's a higher chance.
---
If all else fails and you're on ps4, I could also give you some rad ant lager. I regularly make it whenever I get any ant meat.
---
I didn't know this. Thanks!
---
**no. no. no. NO!**
---
I know man, Used to play a pure stealth sharpshooter, none of that cheesy Bloodied/Unyielding stuff for me, then I tried it.
---
I imagine Heavy PA is much the same jump, with the added bonus of not being worthless in rad-zones.
---
I wouldn’t try. Most objects you place in water (as in they aren’t sticking up out of the water) are unable to be picked back up after being placed.
---
Where are all you nice folks? I get screwed over by most people I trade with, I need new friends to play with..
---
This is the correct number, it was 25% at release, but it was buffed as it wasn't worth the Flux cost at that value.
---
I think for the current daily.ops they are releasing(unlink i think its called) that will be the "default" mutation, but in the future there will be a different Daily ops mission with a new "default".
---
Yeh, I even reported some new enemies (variants of existing enemies) in a previous news video :P
---
Gun bashing counts
---
Your doing the Lord's work my friend.
---
What you collect from the quest is about 50 million dollars of gold at todays value.
---
I'm about 3 miles from a level 1 evac zone and our air quality index is apparently the worst on the planet. I haven't had to bug out yet, but the real world feels more apocalyptic than the game at this point.
---
Nope, not as far as I know. You need some land that works for the glitch to use it. I’m running into the same issue at my new camp. May have to build a camp without sunken items, and just float them or merge them with the flamethrower instead
---
I’ve killed all ants in stupid vault94 to get the stupid emote. So no more left in game, sorry dude
---
That's weird because that's what (I thought) I was doing. When I logged on FO76 it was a level 4 character I made when Steam had a free weekend to play FO76 on PC
---
I wish I found your camp when I was new. As a new player I spent 90% of my caps on plans. Now I sell plans at a heavy discount bc I just want other people to have fun building too!
---
Not with 76. Xbox character can’t be played on PC version. Have to roll a new one or use a previously made PC character from Steam/Beth Net
---
After couple days "But i did nothing wrong and got banned!". Using hacked items and exploits is bad, m'kay.
---
I have a tse shotgun that goes bad real quick so I would say yes
---
Damn, I'm really not that PC competent lol, perhaps there's still steam files saved on hard drive that game is launching? Try signing out and closing steam then launching it through game pass app?
---
Most of us old hands have less attachment to the legendaries. Before we could scrip them we would just sell them for caps until we hit our daily cap limit. Then we would just drop them in any and all convenient container. Used to check the ice cooler outside the whitespring country club and see 20-50 legendary items in it.
---
Is there a fallout76 reddit group on xbox? I'll join and help when I can.
---
oh wow, I do apologize then OP! That's stupid though to be fair!
---
I've been a part of a polite line or two this week, too.  I found that flashing one's light on and off a couple times works, as a polite clearing of the throat. Going directly to the gentle burst of explosive .50cal on the shoulder just seems like a faux pas.
---
Okay, just for you I went back on the PTS to retest the Lever Action Rifle. I didn't have a Bloodied one, so I had to use a J10. Dropped my Health to 19.5%, Nerd Rage, Bloody Mess, 3/3/3 + Tank Killer.
---
With Mister Sandman, Downed a Level 100 Legendary Super Mutant in one shot. Without Mister Sandman, it gets really close. Probably could manage it with a Bloodied Lever, and you certainly can with an Instigating. I will update the post.
---
Time to get my flux fix
---
You didn’t have to do that lol! But since you did, I appreciate the information. Hopefully my lever will still be able to do the job.
---
Math isn't allowed on r/candyland76
---
Too many morons that would rather see this game die so they can get their single player experience
---
This seems to have worked out. Thanks for the help!❤
---
They need a code of conduct for events.
---
Me: \*desperately scrolls looking for the section on heavies\* 
---
Seems like it'll all be alright
---
The Friday before the big update. Maybe spirits are high and they want the playerbase engaged and excited ahead of an anticipated content drop. Just my guess.
---
I usually sell plans for 10-20 (where ever the slider ends up) and some decent camp stuff for 50. My problem is with all the crap armor I don’t even really know what’s good and I wonder if I’ve sold some awesome plans dirt cheap
---
I've been waiting for this to get fixed and I just happen to have 3 nuclear cards that I've been holding on to for my 1st time launching maybe this weekend will be a 3er
---
Exactly - these "nerf bloodied" players are going to shit themselves when they can't finish Earle in time.
---
Up to 6, depending on your level. Slots open at levels 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 and 300.
---
You can see and use them now on build planner [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
UPDATE: I just figured out what is causing this. It’s VATS. In VATS, you do not get sneak bonus, but in free aim, you do. So it’s something to do with VATS. I have no idea why, but blow this up so Bethesda can maybe fix it! Here is a video I took of my test. Watch the third to last mag, in VATS - mid-400 damage, health barely drops. Then watch last mag, similar on-screen damage, but in free aim - health melts. https://streamable.com/iy1xi6
---
3 had pint sized slasher
---
Very kind of you to offer.  I am indeed on PC, I will reach out when the patch drops.
---
50/50 chance of ants at thunder mountain substation on the northside of Watoga, there is also a deathclaw there attacking them.
---
Not a PTS player but I think 7, this is based on a video I saw though, not what someone said.
---
Too bad I can't sell it in real life😀
---
Well I like it🥳
---
Damage numbers aren't accurate in adventure mode. It will say you are doing 400 but you're really doing 80
---
She's available to anyone at any level. Great way to cap a discount behind a grind-wall.
---
&gt;I started playing the game
---
TIL!
---
Most people when I visit camps are usually nice. That’s a rare occasion of just someone being a clown. It’s only bad when people visit your camp to purposely grief you is when there is worry
---
I picked up an instigating gauss rifle on one of my alts that I have yet to transfer to my stealth rifleman main, so I haven't tried it out yet. I have noticed though that with the gauss pistol it is very hard to land headshots - you have to aim for the tippy top of the head or the projectile detonates on the body and you lose the damage bonus. Gauss rifles have proper scope options though so maybe it's less of any issue.
---
Don’t worry about it - you’d probably be more disappointed anyway :(
---
I sell all types of plan for 5 caps, doesn't matter to me what plan it is
---
My fo3 lunchbox has a hundred rounds of .303 ammo in it.
---
Silencer removes the explosion.
---
It does burn up quickly and I can see how if you are an endgame player paying for it is easy, but yes I do feel it is worth less than the cost of materials.
---
6
---
Well, I wanted to because I also love the Lever Action. Also we've traded before and you were super cool, so I figured, why not? I mean, your experience may vary depending on distance and damage drop off. But I didn't have any Adrenaline, so you should be fine. I also don't use VATS with Rifles, so if you do, Gun Fu will likely make up that difference as well.
---
It also amazes me that my character just shoved 1500 lbs of gold in their backpack and walked away.
---
So to clarify, you can have 6 total maxed out legendary cards?
---
Yeh I'm buzzed for the new update tbh, can't wait. 😁😁😁😁😁
---
Do I need to zoom in with the camera? I also seen people on YouTube clicking on the map first and then doing the photomode glitch..  did not know that I had to keep on pushing forward,  thanks will try again 😁
---
**Active Camouflage:** Enemies will be cloaked when not attacking
---
Berry Mentants will finally come in handy in more ways than just a stat buff.
---
It’s the one thing I don’t think ppl realize. I struggle so hard as an unarmed bloodied on Earl with a full team only to realize that it wasn’t any harder when a friend and I played it together with 2 others afk’ing while we did all the work. 
---
Even the heavy gunners are doing so little damage now that this nerf will hit any non-magic players like a rock when they realize how much harder he got.
---
I do wish there was a leaderboard on events just so ppl understood the actual math and how much dmg bloodieds are healing/dealing in combat. Like I said previously, I agree with the neef to an extent. But I think even the PTS players are going to be blown away when we realize the difference between play-testing and actual gameplay. The numbers don’t seem like that big of a change until you put them to practice.
---
Tactical nuke incoming!
---
Strangler heart is the cooolest looking power armor is how I made my decision
---
Edit: PS I got calibrated shocks and emergency protocols thru regular play by level 150; they’re not that impossible to find
---
Ah, thanks for the heads up. 🍻👍
---
they both perform about the same due to diminishing returns in dr and er.
---
bottom line is that, if you want slightly more defense, go with T65. if you want slightly more damage, go with SH.
---
T-65 all day everyday
---
Strangler effect was nerfed, and 1st person hud clips
---
Well anyway, thanks man!
---
Thanks all, looks like I’ll be going with anything but two shot from now on
---
Yes. But that would require you to be really high level and/or to scrap almost every card you have, leaving no utility cards for crafting etc. To max one card you need 300 perk coins, and you get 2 coins for each scrapped perk card / rank.
---
Wait, what? 
---
You can use a Gamma gun while still being in pacifist mode and the rads will still damage players?
---
It does affect Gauss Weapons, including the Rifle. It's much more effective on the Shotgun, Pistol, and Minigun but with Wastelanders the Rifle apparently got that buff. 
---
If you're on PC, I can put a silencer on it for you. I'm 99% sure I have all the mods. Might be missing a night vision scope or something.
---
No dual wielding. They're not adding in a ridiculous amount of new animations and rewriting the ammo counter system. This will take as much resources as a DLC
---
Sure thing :). My ign is aaxxo
---
I like to hoard the common plans like from workshops and drop them in front of newbie players I come across
---
Not true.
---
SoT is a play anywhere title, buy once play anywhere. (Pc or console)
---
76 isn't. You can only play it in the platform it's purchased from. If you launch it with the PCS Xbox app you're launching the PC version. If you launch it with the Xbox itself you're launching the Xbox version. Two different saves/characters/platforms.
---
Yeah right
---
Thanks for the answers, god damn. Some of those perks are OP. Looking at specifically collateral damage, does this affect pvp? 
---
Edit: sorry i meant taking one for the team not collateral damage
---
I can’t really break into the market. I don’t keep plans, and the only things people want to buy/trade are generally fixers and bloodied shit. 
---
That, and I don’t want my camp constantly destroyed by mobs. I’d rather give a tour to someone who stumbled on it by accident. They might appreciate it rather than searching my vendor and leaving it to the Scorched b
---
I leave in suitcases at train stations
---
So my hunting rifle is useless now? Is that right?
---
I had some goodguygreg(s) moments when I started playing this year. I'm definitely a novice and started playing it late (I've had the game since launch). I had a guy make me some nice leveled guns for free. I've had others just give me a bunch of bobby pins for free. Even had a few level 200+ players but all the stuff I was selling. I think the best part of these games is no one really wants to do PvP as we are mostly single player gamers. I love Skyrim and Fallout 3, 4, NV and multiplayer is not my favorite. It's great to know a large majority of players like to help each other
---
You have to go on their website and enter your information and serial number but I just got mine in the mail and they're beautiful!
---
I have seen examples but I am just too lame apparently 😀🙄 I would love to help to lunch nuke though fast with this method.
---
Or more question if u don’t mind 
---
Should I keep mods in my inventory or my chest?
---
And will it matter where I keep them
---
Do we need to hunt down the officers first or can we just use the codes?
---
I need to get some spare troubleshooter Armor. The imposter always seems to go after me and always destroys me lol
---
WE’RE ALL GONNA DIE!!,
---
I can do it faster without magic weapons. A legacy but not magic.
---
The only downside to Strangler heart is that it requires the ultracite mod plans so if you haven't done a million queen runs you might be missing some. The T-65 is nice and easy gold grind to pick and choose the ones you want or need.
---
Yeah, so, the issue you're running into is actually part of what makes the Gauss Rifle one of my favorites. The projectile is significantly larger, which works great on the Rifle but...not so great at closer range with the pistol. That's what's happening, I think. VATS should likely fix that problem, even with the Gauss VATS bug.
---
&gt; RESILIENT DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN'T USE GUNS. There's been a lot of confusion around this mutation in the PTS. It means the enemy can only be killed with a melee attack: for gunners, this means shooting them down to 1 HP and then closing the gap and pistolwhipping them. Expect a lot of reddit posts from players that don't get it when Resilient debuts.
---
&gt; 
---
Can you bypass this with throwing weapons like tomahawks, knives, sheepsquatch quills, etc.?
---
It's way easier to farm bullions to mod the T-65 than farm organs to sacrifice to the RNG gods or to pay for Ultracite PA mods, so I'd say go with the T-65.
---
Downside is that it looks terrible, and sits very badly on the chassis (there are many open spots), so if you value aesthetic, a skin on it is a must have.
---
 I'll place the Cosmos one once I finally buy the helmet.
---
Legacy is magic.
---
I’m really looking forward to going in vault 94 without all the pressure.
---
Yeah, you gain Herculean power for carrying gold bars. 😁😁
---
Yeah I hate that Beth is so shit at design and balance, they need to force people to use melee weapons (or bash) through cheesy mechanics. Can't die unless you melee them... never seen anything so cheesy. Like laughably stupid, cheesy. How it was even suggested is beyond me, a normal person would be embarrassed to suggest such a stupid idea. 
---
See this chunk of metal I have in my hand.... it kills, no problem, see this chunk of metal flying through the air at fantastic speed, it can hurt but NEVER kill. 
---
Fuck, 3 seconds of thought, and I can say geee, I want people to use melee weapons, so I will make it a skills mission, where my handler/boss/quest giver wants to test my skills, and not to come back until I have 20 kills with a melee weapon. Or each kill possibly moves you into a better bracket of rewards (along with time). 
---
But my gun can't kill... just lazy, stupid, bad design.
---
I have not heard anything about pvp, and didn't test it myself in pvp so can't answer that. But i would imagine it will work.
---
I went on late last night just to hit up the purveyor and saw a line like this. It was nice to see people waiting their turns and not bashing to hurry people up.
---
As classification goes its not.
---
Thanks man, appreciate it, but I'm xbox
---
Thanks, this is super helpful. not sure if you saw my edit but I was actually talking about taking one for the team. My apologies
---
Legacy is a crutch.
---
Daily ops is the first pve element that I'm actually looking forward too since vault raids.  Finally a way to farm ammo that's actually fun :)
---
That’s not 6 feet apart
---
Fuck yes this is so frustrating in mid-combat.
---
Literally said the same thing to someone else lol. I'm like a big kid awaiting Xmas morning atm. 😂🤣
---
Apparently it will be unlockable through gold bullion at some point in the future.
---
No, it's not useless. It'll just be significantly more difficult to get those one-shot kills on many mobs without Mister Sandman. You can probably still do it during the day, but you'd probably need to be full Bloodied, with a Bloodied weapon, 3/3/3 + Tank Killer, Bloody Mess, Nerd Rage...
---
You'd also need to take damage drop off into account. You may have to double tap some stuff, but if you have Adrenaline it'll probably make up the difference.
---
yea i saw it :)
---
Next season that and some other Legendary Run exclusives will be available for purchase for gold bullion (the end game for wastelanders)
---
Would it take long to unlock it now? When does this season end
---
Any idea as to why fusion and plasma cores can't be used with the ammo converter?
---
Sweet thank you so much!
---
I wish! I just recently learned that you can tame pets at your CAMP, and now I’m wishing I hadn’t killed that mega sloth yesterday! PS - my handle is CPMCMXC, in case we every run into one another in the wasteland👍🏽
---
Good point about the mods. Maybe I’ll go T-65 then since I don’t have the ultracite protocols or shocks, and I’ll definitely be using those. Thanks for the feedback!
---
Haha why not it’s pretty exciting when there’s a big update.
---
Season has already ended I believe, so you have missed out I think.
---
There are caps on everything and way too many kinds of currency with varying daily limits. If you grind even just a little bit you’re running the risk of being stuck with ‘too much’. Too much legendaries, treasury notes, junk, whatever. And you can’t unload it all. It takes days when you have a ton of treasury notes or legendary weapons to scrip to get your return. Plus it makes it even harder to manage your stash.
---
Tbh, I'm not too sure if it's possible to do anything on the current season. From what I've seen, there are no daily/weekly challenges available so there's no way to gain any score.(the season technically ended on the 8th so I'm not sure why the board is still up and such).
---
As far as I know, the 2nd season has not started yet.
---
Ah bummer was just looking at the game board in game thought it was still active
---
Furious for group/bosses. Instigating for solo. AA is dead weight with incisor. 
---
If you're running with instigating solo you need to avoid  plaguewalker, unstable isotope, and electrically charged mutations. They cause damage to enemies. Also avoid the exploding palm and cleave legendary perks in the next patch.
---
no you wont get back to that level. not even close
---
Yes it's very strange. I ran it right from my xbox app and it was still the character I started on the steam version. Maybe this pass is just giving us access to play PC versions of the game for free
---
Well damn, I am useless. I don’t play bloodied and am not interested in playing bloodied, so my build will be shooting BB’s from what it sounds like. I use an instigating hunting rifle w/ stealth, and if I need bloodied or adrenal reaction to do any significant damage, I might as well abandoned my build.
---
Honestly the 76 community is the most helpful and kind, I had accidentally ran across a fissure in my explorations and out popped a nice and green legendary notniceboy and he ate all my shotgun shells and all my 45. Rounds and out of nowhere comes my knight in shining power armor and he proceeds to wreck this things life and asked me if I needed ammo and drops hundreds of rounds in multiple caliber and types and just gives me a thumbs up and off he went. Thank you post apocalyptic superhero
---
Yeah, it's kinda like saying *"don't panic, but your old playstyle of using unarmed without stealth power attacks? Yeah, stop doing that."*
---
Also how are endgame bosses are going to be now? Imposter, Queen and Colossus. Their rewards don't seem to get any better, but their farming will be way slower.
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
Ah so season progress is only via dailies and weeklys? I thought it was via all challenges. I have no idea though
---
I've been shopping for a better lever action to replace my rifleman main's TSE, and recently came across reasonably priced one-star anti-armor and junkies options. I [ran the numbers](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-LeverActionRifle_L-45_ModReceiver-Hardened_ModMuzzle-Standard_ModSights-Standard_Prefix-Antiarmor_Sneak_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Covert-50_Other-0_Add&amp;right=R_W-LeverActionRifle_L-45_ModReceiver-Hardened_ModMuzzle-Standard_ModSights-Standard_Prefix-Junkies_Sneak_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-5_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Covert-50_Other-0_Add) on them using additive damage, and anti-armor is only about 11.5% behind in damage against moderately armored opponents. Theoretically anti-armor will perform increasingly better at lower damage per shot - I heard for handmades the difference is more like 5%. For shotguns anti-armor might even outperform it (though in my experience the only competitive non-bloodied prefixes for shotguns are instigating pump/combat shotgun, or quad double barrel.)
---
No, new season starts soon, so they are just probably going to leave it up till then.
---
&gt; Also how are endgame bosses are going to be now? Imposter, Queen and Colossus. Their rewards don't seem to get any better, but their farming will be way slower.
---
... Good?
---
I'd love to have a Colossus fight that lasts more than 3 minutes.
---
(and this is on a public server, with a public group;  not with some awesome premade.)
---
The Ammo converter even with the patch changes is a huge PITA, just grind mats and craft your ammo, easier faster and you make XP.
---
big if true
---
This probably flagged so naby people on watch lists XD
---
Fed76 had pricing advice. It's not nearly 100% accurate but if its a good way to at least discern the keepers from the trash. 
---
It seems to over value some items but it's better than nothing and eventually you will learn what to keep.
---
Yeah, it would seem they quietly ditched that ability.
---
Honestly if they kept up constantly with putting this game at the front of their line, it would help them as a company so much and the game could be known as one of their best eventually
---
Why are people disliking this
---
You'll be able to buy it with Gold Bullion next week - but I don't remember if it was Settler or Raider, or how much allegiance you needed to unlock it.
---
I would play way more if there was a "solo" mode.
---
I don’t think you have to zoom, just hold forward. And you don’t have to click anything on the map, it just pulls up as part of the process of going into photo mode. It can be faster when it works, but I find the power armor one to be way more reliable and consistent. Good luck.
---
By that logic your magic weapon is a Hellfire Missile..
---
Oh, Instigating would probably work okay. I don't have an Instigating Hunting Rifle, so I don't know for sure. At worst, you'd probably need to two-shot some of the bigger stuff.
---
Again, your build (perks, armor, etc) will work perfectly fine with an Instigating Lever or Gauss. I know that sucks, but...I'm just reporting the info as I have tested and observed it.
---
I’m wearing excavator power armor, have maybe 2 weapons with a lightweight perk.
---
Lag sucks on xbox
---
Would be cool to play with friends who only have PS or PC.
---
Yeah, by that same logic Pistols may get the biggest bonus. Thanks for the info!
---
Appreciate your description and help will attempt again a few times 😁
---
LOL - you've gone to plaid.
---
Make sure you have butchers bounty equipped
---
The Bog Dweller outfit was a cracker, but been quite lacklustre since then. I like the armour bench, but  a skin for another bench and say the PA Station too, would've been fairer, considering the subscription.
---
One thing I'd like to see is access to the back catalogue of Store items. Too much of the stuff I've missed is rarely seen and I think access through 1st would actually be a great selling point for Bethesda. 
---
Half the CAMP budget again would be cool. One thing I sometimes find challenging is keeping a build scale down so I can properly decorate the interior to the point  it's drowning.
---
Yup previously corrected
---
You just started so it's understandable to not know things. During the season, the dailys/weekly challenges will tell you how much score you get for completing them. Of the daily challenges, there is usually 1 NW challenge as well as a challenge for completing 5 daily challenges. Weekly challenges of course give more score. 
---
I believe it was 2 weeks after this season started, the option to use atoms to buy ranks was available. Though, I recommend not doing this unless it's close to the end of the season and you're having trouble making the last few rank(higher ranks require more score).
---
You can just use the codes, be sure to have an extra keycard just in case the game bugs out.
---
Ya, looking forward to it, not a huge fan of the paint job (colors are fine) or scheme. I am a little worried on the budget and weight hit (they need to overhaul that system)
---
\*Laughs in Heavy Build with Two-Shot Vampire Weapon\*
---
Easy Fix:  Increase Base Damage.
---
Im sure. Im also sure they are losing sleep at night trying to think up ways to fix it.
---
Probably need to step it up to a 3090 to get steady frames
---
Which cheaters have already done, multiple times.
---
Thanks for the info buddy
---
The big issue is this game isn't optimized that greatly.
---
I would suggest looking into tweaking the ini to lower lighting settings and lowering shadow distance: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9u0xtb/pc_fallout_76_optimizationperformance_tweaks_ini/
---
Buying a new video card is a bad idea right now. RTX 3070-3090 was just announced and sales begin this coming Monday. 3060 should be coming soon as well.
---
1) everyone already knows this
---
2) it's not like Bethesda is the reason this hasn't happened
---
3) everyone already knows this
---
Oh.  Hey.  That's a good idea.  Does it work for those stealthed???
---
Do you have the HUD for the helmet? Is that like the berry mentats effect?
---
If you’re looking to upgrade your gpu, I’d go with the RX 5600 XT. My pc build has a Ryzen 7 3700x with the 5600XT and I rarely drop below 60, and play around 75-80 FPS 99% of the time
---
They could do that. The more likely solution is that they need to take weapon mods into account when making damage calculations...because that's the ultimate problem right now. &gt;_&gt;
---
Another small thing: apparently, if the boss is aggroing a player (has them in [danger]), it won't just ignore stealth damage from them, but every other player shooting it. The high damage numbers will still display, but the actual damage dealt will be calculated without the sneak multiplier.
---
If you see PA heavy gunner, sneak is basically turned off for everyone.
---
My food build bloody handmade rifle went down from 130 per shot to 29 per shot on PTS.
---
I just did this from biv - I got my first ant at the house next to the giant teapot where the mr. handy is, second floor. (Not during Tea Time.) Server hopped and got the second one there.
---
Good luck!
---
Somewhere central for fast travel costs, near a station, a workshop/resource or close to your faction makes sense.
---
But honestly, just go somewhere you enjoy being
---
This info is fantastic - thanks so much for testing and compiling! Has anyone told you you're their hero?  Wind beneath their wings?
---
One question, since you mentioned Reduce Damage While Blocking with Shotguns.  Is that a feature that activates automatically or do you have to press buttons to block?  I ask because I have never had that feature on a weapon, my current shotgun (kinda magic) doesn't have it, but I like it too much to give up.  Is it truly imperative?  I can currently one-shot level 40 mole men and 2 shot level 68 super mutants, which I'm happy with.
---
Thanks again!
---
Looks really cool, wish players could post these shots on their Camp walls.
---
Excavator is better than both.  Skins a plenty. Plus 100 carry weight, you can buy the mods from vendor bots including emergency protocals, kinetic dynamo, and calibrated shocks.  
---
https://youtu.be/Hh0YYDb-FYY
---
This video will show you in actual game testing there is very little difference in actual DR, ER, and rads between Excavator PA and any other PA.  Like 10%.  Since all PA sets have build in 42% DR. 
---
Peep the chart at the end. 
---
The only downside is no jetpack. So I have a ultracite pa with a jetpack to "jet" to the end of the silo.
---
You keep Nuka Colas in your stash?
---
Look up a list of unmarked locations and build somewhere with a cool pre existing object or set piece.
---
I’m looking forward to some of the overhauled locations more than daily ops. Also exploring vault 94 without having to do a raid is nice.
---
I really like the concept of these daily ops, but as a partial sneak build, it's gonna neuter me being in here, and being bloodied doesn't help with strong enemies. 
---
I honestly really wish Bethesda would up the SPECIAL allotment past 50, I just never feel powerful enough &amp; swapping cards is beyond a pain in the ass, especially in some intense situations. I'm looking forward to this update regardless.
---
if it's not a rare plan I don't bother. usually get 10 or so and drop them in the overseer's cache near Wayward.
---
I play a lot of counter-strike so I've been avoiding vats, but I believe the second star on my gauss rifle is +33% vats accuracy, so I may need to give it a try. I'll definitely be giving vats a go on my junkie slugger for Hack and Slash.
---
I literally dropped all my known plans to some stranger level 40 “I’m level 80” in a public team who I fast traveled to so it would be cheaper. I was trying to sell stuff and after a week of no one buying plans for 10caps or 5cap I said screw it 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
That would be awesome. To be able to frame screenshots, hell yes
---
Yes I have and love the strangler heart pa I also have the solar armor also
---
What sort of environment is required? For example, I like to be near water and away from enemy spawns.
---
So find another unique spot like the moth man tree shrine thing? Are there a lot of spots with unique stuff? I’ve seen a few people in caves or in the middle of a pond
---
Interesting. I already use an excavator set for the times I need PA. You’re saying it’s still viable for a high-level heavy gunner build? I guess with jet packs on limbs being patched out I wouldn’t be able to do a jet pack and EP at the same time anyway
---
I was looking around for unmarked ponds and semi flat land last week but was also camped out near the top of the world train station junk pile and ponds
---
I went to a station and dropped like 50 plans in a suitcase as i had them in for 1 cap and no takers for weeks
---
If you visit the Overseer's house she has a slideshow viewer. That would work too.. but framed pictures arw are probably better.
---
Niccccceeee
---
You literally just need to search the sub to see that the same thing has been posted multiple times by multiple people.
---
No, you don't need to do anything for that. When you have the armor piece, the effect just starts happening in VATS. 
---
Also, it's a third star on an Armor Piece. I'll just link you some videos about Magic Weapons. It should help explain all of this more effectively than I can.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHu4CErJXU4
---
They are still there. Just Takes a lot of server hopping. I had them two times in a row and then I didn't see them spawn in 6 more trys.
---
Would probably be less to code in, because there wouldn't be animations.
---
And don’t forget, in order to get the last one you need to nuke somewhere that’s not FSP. Took my ages to figure that out
---
I feel like I see a lot of new pc players so I’m just gonna stock up “1st member thankfully so I can” and just drop them during the next meat week type hub event
---
I'm ok with the "getting out of my comfort zone" with my stealth commando, but not releasing the perk loadouts now is going to make me hesitant to do the Ops. I dont want to spend all that time swapping perk cards out for one event.
---
Oh, okay, don't use the Gauss Rifle in VATS. The Pistol, yes. Shotgun, yes. Rifle? No. It's way more effective outside of VATS.
---
Huh. I feel foolish that I hadn't realized that. Thanks for the correction friend!
---
Tldr, listen to the recording in the drive link, only way to mute it is in sound mixer on pc. Otherwise a decent amount of the fluff is describing the issue for those that aren't able to listen to it.
---
Who hurt you
---
Intelligence boosts XP and has a ton of great perks. It is worth ranking up early so that you'll level up faster. You can always spec back out of it once you're past level 50.
---
High level players in the area cause high level enemies to spawn, so if you're stuck facing a super high level enemy out in the open that you can't get past for a quest, try server hopping. This will be changing when the one wasteland update comes out. I'm a little bummed about it tbh, I liked the challenge and/or strategy involved.
---
Do you know if it was just damage that was changed from multiplicative to additive, or all buff calculations?
---
For instance, will XP and INT buffs still stack the way they currently do post-Patch 22, or will we start seeing decreases in the amount of XP we get from stacking high INT and Leader Bobbleheads, Cranberry Relishes, etc?
---
Oh man then you should steer clear from the division games then if you don’t like dumping a whole mag into an enemy.
---
So enemies dont lvl to the highest player in the area, they base on first in area? And stay that lvl?
---
Maybe it's just because the Xbox has it on Game Pass, but this past month or so I can't keep plans in stock to save my life - they fly out!
---
My headset is wireless but through a small USB that it connects through plugged into my pc, but I have run the game with my speakers plugged into the pc and through a tv's speakers that I use as a second monitor and it still occurs.
---
Update on Sept 12?
---
What will be changed or added?
---
I don't think so. I just did it and i haven't launched a nuke yet. There are a few at the silos however.
---
I've just started building near a pool of water with some steps and a pier &amp; canoe just south of Marigold Pavilion which is cool. It's no where near anything but it's a nice location haha
---
I'd want console only haha. Or an option to exclude PC players if I want to only match with console players.
---
Well if you bought it on Steam wouldn't it make sense to contact Steam customer support ? You know you have a steam ID receipt.
---
Pretty sure XP works the same. I haven't paid the closest attention to it, but...pretty sure. The fact that there are still multiplicative buffs (Anti-Armor, Instigating, Taking one for the Team, Follow Through) in the game means that math itself didn't stop existing, so it would make sense that XP is unchanged. 
---
Dunno. I guess we'll see?
---
T65 is easiest to chase, is very robust, and won’t kill the average stash savings to build.
---
Just my opinions but I liked the spot next to the pumpkin house, it’s almost across the street from red rocket mega stop, it’s off the road in brush and trees and mostly flattish, had a nice autumn feel. There is a scorchbeast that sometimes spawns around there but only once it attacked my camp. Depends what needs you have though, there’s no water there for example. Also kind of out of the way. 
---
Another good spot is around foundation, spruce knob lake and channels. Water there. Nothing too crazy goes on there, some random encounter sometimes sheepsquatch or mire lurk queen but they probably wouldn’t go to your camp, there’s a lot of water and stuff there. 
---
Lastly in the mire there’s a crashed plane in a pond but to the east of it is a nice sized chunk of land, some flatter if you build more towards the shoreline. The aesthetics there are nice at night especially.
---
Really? Because I had to look it up and it said you had to do that, then it’s spawn stuff site alpha
---
I dump plans frequently in train stations. Not worth the hassle selling.
---
Yeah, exactly. I think in addition, a problem with the game at it's core is that it decentivizes players to try new builds. Are you a sneak rifleman and want to try a PA gatling build? Well, just go ahead and use up 20-40 lvl ups worth of SPECIAL correction to give it a try! Really hope you like it, because you cant just swap back...unless you're over lvl 200 and have accumulated the lvl ups to do so. Oh, and by the way, a new Legendary perk system is rolling out soon, so using up lvl ups on stat corrections runs completely counter to taking advantage of the legendary perk feature! As you can tell, Beth is definitely thinking through a long term strategy and not making shit up week to week as they go along with little to no understanding of the game they've already made. Good luck vault dweller!
---
EDIT: I failed to mention that all this is to say, there needs to be a fundamentally cheaper means of respec'ing player builds not tied to losing perk cards...whether that's caps, bullion, scrip, whatever...something needs to give players the opportunity to explore builds better.
---
Yes, but not the damage bonus :D
---
If you go to Project Paradise, plenty of ants there.
---
Do you use power armor or photo mode? The power armor glitch is much easier for me, and that’s the one I use for silos
---
I love plans I think my best right now are the tenderizer with all 3 mods I have a fixer plan the tata salad plus blue ridge backpack the chally backpack some others can’t remember but I love having extra
---
yes, script notes is a good idea
---
"Mister Sandman, bring me XP,"
---
If I see someone selling plans, unless they're like that one that gets you 50 extra carry weight in power armor and plans like that, for full price I just leave.
---
Okay, thanks! Great info here.
---
I have some favorites, but they're too well known. There's a lead deposit up the hill from huntersville. It's centralized, and in the middle of a highly traveled legendary farming route. 
---
I'm currently camped by the barn by Charleston station. It has a pond for your water purifiers, a nearby rail station and lots of foot traffic.
---
The chipping green at whitespring. Lots of flat land and plenty of plastic to farm, which is handy if you don't have fo1st.
---
If you have fo1st, I recommend spruce knob channel, with your survival tent by colonel Kelly monument. 4 caps to foundation, 4 caps to crater.
---
The OP said, “since my area is literally an ash heap...maybe Murgh will make a special visit to the west coast and offer another sale”...how does that not imply asking for something special because of the fires? And as my original comment said...the world does not revolve around the USA and there are disasters in other areas as well and I never see them posting about missing something.
---
Once I've met a group that made my first BE gatling Plasma from 200% condition to broken and second one to about 60%. I think I need a third one in case for the next update.
---
I build inside a mountain ,under the map. Safe as a vault
---
I agree.  My stash is full of overweight junk weapons and I can’t scrip them fast enough so I’ll have to sell them.  No more sale for me, seems rigged
---
Great picture!!!
---
Interesting, that's food for thought. I had no idea about that effect, especially with it being (apparently) an intended effect not a bug.
---
Thank you for the offer, but I should get it soon. I can craft gauss rifles, so with the help of super duper I'll hopefully learn to make silencers for them at some point.
---
I managed to get them all without launching a nuke; still haven't done that yet.
---
Railway Rifles are terrible, no fun at all, even converted to auto for a commando build.   Don't even try them.  Everybody should just put all their new three-star legendary Railways in their vendors for a couple hundred caps.  Especially on Xbox.  And especially after, oh, 9pm pacific tonight.
---
Seriously, I love my auto Mutant's railway.  My fancy suppressed Handmade or Fixer lets me sneak INTO trouble, and my railway gets me OUT of it.
---
"Does someone around here need their ASS KICKED?"
---
Yeah, pal. You do.
---
Yeah I like the tent, scrapbox (absolute godsend), and atoms too. I hardly ever use my private worlds anymote tho, unless I wanna redo my camp or something and not have people running in it.
---
😒
---
There's a cute little pond north west of the Isolated cabin,  semi flat, with random npc (usually a drunktard), critters spawn point and beehives for Sweetwater daily. It's quiet.
---
I will try both, I have tried the extra powerarmor glitch but failed miserably.. kept getting the message that I can't exit the armor when I tried to exit facing the grids. So I did the usual biometric scan method and then passing the grids tried the photomode glitch at the walls and doors but couldn't go through...
---
you just threw 20 legendary perk coins into the trash my friend.
---
Yup, didn't know this and turned it in when I had almost max scrip. 87 scrip down the drain...
---
Now that you say that, I kinda wanna make a new character just to do that lol
---
Yes!  I am a full health PA heavy gunner user.  I use kinetic dynamo with dodgy, fireproof, action boy maxed and rejuvination.  I throw in ricocet from time to time, but usually good with salt or now one gun army when fighting earl.  Ita very hard to die.  Honestly poison is my bigfest enemy so I am excited for legendary perks. I use junkies and AA weapons.
---
There’s legendary perk cards that allow you to up your special points and equip more normal perk cards.
---
What does your build look like now?
---
I am level 192.
---
You'll do far better at Encryptid if you get a set of Troubleshooter's armor. Since I put my set together, I've been running it more often, and I can usually carry at least a pylon and take a few hits from the Imposter and survive.
---
Yeah, there was one i had to look up to find, i had somehow side stepped a spot on the map, but they are just sitting in vault tech boxes around the map. The locations are in the world challenges listing i believe.
---
I've seen ants at the Campfire Tales event.
---
thats fine and dandy until your stash is full and the purveyor wont buy anymore back..
---
the problem is you cant redeem as quickly as you can spend..
---
Yep, game runs like crap even on my rx 5700
---
A lot, you might wanna check the last few ITVs to catch yourself up.
---
Some of what will be added; daily ops, one wasteland and the damage output change from multiplicative to additive goes live on the 15th too as far as we know.
---
Edit: words are hard today
---
I have never had a respawn bug...
---
You can sneak over to Whitesprings no problem.
---
You can run across map at level 2 if you are careful.
---
Of course
---
the problem is you cant redeem as quickly as you can spend tho.. 
---
if you spent 1k scrip at 1/2 price 3* rolls.. its gonna take you forever to turn it all in.. on top of what you regularly get in game..
---
even without sales Im already generating legendary drops so fast that I have to buy modules just to keep under max scrip
---
luckily Im fairly good at managing stash space(not a fo1st user either) but I regularly have 10-20 weapons/armor waiting to be scripped at all times
---
being able to spend all you have isnt necessarily a good thing for everyone
---
RNG is still gonna RNG...
---
You can build the red scare jet pack on excavator.
---
im in my early 20s as well, ive been visiting players camps vendors looking for plans, may be worth checking those but i dont know an exact location
---
First time to a fallout update?
---
why are you such an asshole the 2headed cows did nothing to you
---
I have two of them.
---
Interesting. Well maybe I’ll start with my excavator set and experiment with T-65 at some point. Thanks for the information!
---
For sheer enjoyment, i love my Bloody, 50% limb dmg, 90% WR Fatman that murms blessed me with.
---
Are you looking for the Flamer weapon? I think the quest line with Abbie gives you plans to make the flamethrower trap for your camp, under defenses.
---
relog.
---
Yes. I don't know when but it was soon after I purchased one. I wonder if that guy is upset.
---
It was dropping at the recent Meat Week event so I’d assume you’d find them in player vendors.
---
Also, googling shows that raider vendors should have it.
---
I sell those plans.
---
dont want to spend a month turning the garbage rolls back in..
---
hows a fuckin sale help me?
---
&gt;once I finally buy the helmet.
---
On other helmets I always used the +2INT mod, so I don't know regardless.
---
It was at one time like 4000 in venders very cool detail use the broadside cannon or cursed harpoon gun and yellow slicker hat great for a pic
---
Didn't show when I posted and I gave more clarification on why. Comment is valid.
---
Glad it was corrected though.
---
Like find another world? I did that
---
Haha definitely i will remember that name, i still can't tame anything so far but after reading that lots of players like to kill pets i better not have one 😅 good thing you weren't the guy in the camp i went today  way too overpriced shit lol
---
I miss those days of finding dozens of legendaries in a random container.
---
Tell me you’ve at least Googled that. Usually common weapons like that are carried by one flavour of vendor bot.
---
Edit: did it for you. Responder bots have it.
---
Bethesda: Of course there will be new Atom Shop items!
---
It is sold by Responders Vendors
---
No, been here since beta. I'm a fallout fan at the end of the day, yeh the bugs and shit annoy me but the franchise makes up for it 10 fold.
---
Try it again, honestly with some quests I have had to swap servers  10+ times due to bugs. If you still dont have any luck just leave the quest for a few days and try it again then.
---
Thanks - don't know if I would want it as a permanent feature,  is that not too weird to see the enemies in pink all the time??
---
What’s the best way to kill a grafton monster
---
The flamethrower trap and electric traps both come from the end of the freestates quest at abbies bunker. I just got them with my alt yesterday. They are given as a plan that you still need to read to unlock. I don’t think there’s another way to get it and I’m not sure who would sell it...
---
I just sell them all for 1 cap a piece, they just take up space.
---
Ah, just thought the vets like us knew not to get excited about the release day of any event or patch.
---
where are the mutations?
---
Invalided link FYI for me at least
---
Vendor at any station I think? 🤔
---
I'd consider switching to a better weapon frankly...and, btw, you're better off learning only plans for weapons with value or usability in the medium/long term because any plan you learn gets added to the loot table.
---
Just my opinion eh! 😊
---
No, the best way to explain it is, say me and you fast travelled to harpers ferry.. Then come across a super mutant, he will be max level for me, but still level to you, I will get a bigger amount of xp. Its hard to explain but regardless of who gets there first or is in the area before the other person said enemies will level to both players, on my screen I'll see level 75 for example but the same enemy say your level 30, will be level 30 etc. Hope this explanation helps
---
*pew pew pew*
---
She will never land if the turrets are elevated and they catch aggro
---
Didn't they double the coins for scrapping on the pts, where it is actually 1 per level scrapped on live?
---

---
Worst case scenario you cancel the subscription and get a refund.
---
I understand you tbh but I can't help get over excited at an update, especially this one as its much needed regardless of the nerf to everyone.
---
I don't usually care for the microtransaction cosmetics, especially not the ones that aren't even in the atom shop, but back at the launch of Wastelanders I picked up the raider pack specifically to get that filtration mask it had. Looks better than any other gas mask that isn't a full helmet. Been a handy roleplay device ever since the virus happened too.
---
Low level pretty untouched. Fresh character. Looking to know where to put the perks.
---
Remember One Wasteland drops Tue, so all places are equal (almost) so where do you find aesthetically pleasing?
---
I have about 160 unused perk points, do they convert into legendary perks?
---
Use the entire mag. That's the only way I've been able to solve it. (Before it pops back up later. Ugh.)
---
I really want a vault that has been overtaken by Deathclaws that have gained sentience ... we can all agree Deathclaw Island was a massive disappointment ... Deathclaw Vault can make death claws great again.
---
appears to be an attempt at a solo tank vats commando?
---
I’m not placing any turrets. I just want to make a area she’ll on land and everyone can attack her. Plan on making hiding areas for stealth builds. Then leaving mostly everything else open for heavy guns and melee build. Thanks for the response
---
I'm guessing the amount of charge in them would cause problems. A flat rate would most likely be on the low end and would upset people too much. Just a guess
---
Thanks I'll go check it
---
The Fallout 1st rewards are the exact things they advertised to you and nothing less.
---
In fact it's MORE than they advertised because they ended up tacking on a freebie every month... which people also still find a way to whine about.
---
I mean we all know this game could have been true greatness.
---
Hopefully it will.  Glad you know it’s a nerf to everyone instead of hahahhaha bloody nerf.
---
I think junkie is actually the hardest hit since AA is basically equally good without any of the negative side effects. 
---
But I’ll let those who only played since wastelanders keep fighting about it while
---
I eat popcorn.
---
I know for the second time in the games history I have no desire to log in.  Soooo hopefully it is a great update
---
No, you agreed to the pvp when you took the workshop. It warns you of this in a pop-up so you already agreed.
---
Why ask twice?
---
Don't take a workshop if you aren't looking to engage in any pvp.
---
Yeah, I was just thinking about this. This is actually majorly disappointing, that the new playstyle for everyone *except* Heavies has basically become "sneak to do more damage"
---
One of the fun things about the Fallout games has been that almost any character type is viable, with difficulties here and there based on how you've built your character. This new patch seems to enforce a singular play-style (Stealth) that makes every other play-style less viable.
---
I agree, but it would also make me pretty sad.  I love nothing more than to blow through someone’s workshop, kill them and leave.  I don’t even take their junk or the workshop.  Just a little bit of sanctioned murder.
---
Quad and 2 shot are both primary effects, so no that's not possible.
---
I've been in a SBQ fight where someone created a 4 stories tall "platform" structure, made out of hundred of floors. The Queen had no trouble landing all over that.
---
Two shots are in fact possible, my friend had the bullshit luck of getting one. With bonus limb damage at that
---
By "BOS mod plans", do you mean the combat armour one that gives the best resistance and lowest weight?
---
Darn,  thanks
---
The TSE Tesla is truly a lemon of a weapon.  Have you ever fired an explosive Tesla?
---
Utterly and completely terrifying.
---
The trap, I must not have read it when I did the quest
---
pick up and smelt ultracite ore?
---
There's a lookout location right by top of the world &amp; the raider station. Right below that lookout is an unmarked pond with a nice radioactive spot to get your rads back up depending on your build. But it's perfect, it is a bit too close to the lookout but that's partly my fault. You can park your camp somewhere else in that location &amp; get a similar result.
---
In strength for heavy weapons I use maxed heavy gunner cards with lock and load, when I use melee I swap them for slugger (two handed melee) and either inciser or blocker (depends on what I'm doing).   I always have maxed bandolier loaded. 
---
In intelligence I use maxed batteries included because I can't say no to a fusion core along with max stabilized and first aid. 
---
On my main I generally use excavator armor with calibrated shocks and the medic pump. 
---
I run junkies heavy weapons and instigating or anti armor two handed melee.
---
Thats an interesting idea actually.
---
Just please close the *goddamn door.*
---
Thanks for that response. Disappointing as it is it's improving my  understanding of the game.
---
Most camps will list the common ammo types at 1cap each.
---
I was lucky enough to have some nut cake come along and buy all my nocturnal mini guns yesterday when I was over-encumbered😅 here’s hoping my good bad luck continues
---
I don't know why they just don't set mumbles up like the robot vendors. When you buy from her it just puts scrip back into the machines at diminishing rates. You think it would be a copy paste solution which Bethesda loves to do.
---
 fissure sites
---
Please, no more stealthing, I've done that in every Fallout/Elder Scrolls game so far.
---
150?
---
I'm almost 600 and still haven't gotten calibrated shocks. :/
---
Saw the plan the other day but, of course, it was the day Smiley had reset so I was a bit short. Haven't seen the camp with it since...
---
Yes, you can get a two shot weapon.  You can't get one with the quad effect as well, as they both occupy the 1st legendary slot spot.
---
Look at https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects - there are primary (prefix) effects, Major effects, and minor effects.  You can only have 1 in each slot.  Quad and two shot are both primary (prefix) effects.
---
Quad and two shot primary. The best u can get is quad faster fire faster reload.
---
(AND GIRLS!)
---
You can’t bunny hop if you can’t jump three times your height.
---
You said you aren’t using turrets, so I’m all about it.  My one complaint is having to run up all the stairs for the taller, more complex platform camp builds.  If you could make an easily traversable marsupial pathway of the side (maybe with the quarter floor pieces), then I would be the happiest mutant freak in the wastes.
---
As others have said it breaks faster based on hits. I usually run one rank of luck of the draw to counter this. Since each hit has a small chance to repair the weapon also. Usually works enough for shotguns and heavy weapons for repairs to not be an issue for two shot or explosive weapons, I rarely have to repair them with that perk active.
---
Yes. 2 coins per level.
---
Lol!  Nice.  Yah I’m just gonna scrip them and sell some later, maybe save a few to scrip tomorrow depending on my stash weight
---
Ohhh i read your comment wrong then, i had thought you meant it wasnt possible to get a either a quad or two shot on a tesla rifle.
---
I'm in Salem.
---
You can breath the ashes here.
---
I have 36 of those puppies taking up too much space in my stash. I might just see how many I can launch before the server explodes LOL.
---
I got bored chasing scared lowbies around trying to give em stuff, so now I just dump all unwanted items outside my shop front, chems,ammo,plans(except spicy ones fixer/marine etc) meat literally anything I don't want or use.
---
I just want floater grenades gone. I hate them as much as I hate mole rats.
---
I say it every time this comes up. Even if we can’t use them I’d be happy as hell if we could just make weightless “script bucks” with them like treasury notes
---
Sorry dude, im on PC
---
Sorry PC
---
This. You already consented to PvP by taking a workshop and staying within the workshop zone. You don't need your hand freaking held throughout the entire process.
---
Scorchbeasts.
---
If it shows up at the White Springs then I trick it to follow me so that the Sentry robot can finish it. 😀 But at this level don't go there yet and leave it alone.
---
If it still isn’t popping up, then go to Summerville and pick up all the burnt books in the one building.  There is a list of your previously picked up items that is over 200 items long (can’t remember the actual number), so it needs to be moved off of that list in order for server hopping to work.
---
I cant believe they are launching it with that bs perception mod as the default! "Piercing gaze" indeed aka lets exclude a fair portion of all builds. I need the levels for legendary perk cards now and respeccing for this will suck. Incomprehensible bad decision. My 500 hours useless.
---
Do we not get Treasury Notes for doing Daily Ops?
---
Can't upvote this enough. To hell with jet packs. Emergency protocols is where it's at.
---
::/ if u just need it on ultracite legs and are on PC I can mod them for u but if ur strangler legs ur out of luck for now I’ll keep u in my prayers
---
I just want a surrender workshop option. Mostly I just take them for challenges and don’t even want them.
---
Yeah and visit Fraternity Row and get some nuka colas!!!
---
I was thinking more hardcore PvE. I love PvP in other games it just feels weird here . Maybe if the did some number crunching and normalizing like in NW.
---
Thanks!!
---
I wonder how insane the bugs will be. Cant play daily ops with my char so thats not an option. What broken hell are we getting now?
---
Strangler, yeah. No worries, I'll find it eventually. :)
---
people take workshops for resources not for pvp.  nuclear winter is for pvp.  why attack someone who has no interest in pvp instead of taking on someone who is actually trying to pvp?  because it's easy and you can't handle a real challenge?  You act like pvp is the sole purpose of workshops and if that were the case there wouldn't be resources in them apart from guns, ammo, and loot.  everyone likes to act like a raider until someone more powerful than them comes along then they come back here and whine about it themselves
---
Exactly. And you would have to earn even the encounter with harder bosses.
---
Did you see the cakes on that thing?  It must work out.
---
You had my curiosity. Now, you have my attention!
---
Just investigated following your comment. The best I can get is a quad, explosive, resilient. Thanks for your guidance. I'm looking to maximize the auto barrel.
---
Flamers are dope, dunno why you're getting downvoted. Literally if you're not running bloodied/unyielding one-shot build then this community thinks so poorly of you hahaha
---
Maxed out Batteries Included is nice to have. Power user not so much except when you're first starting out, or if you're using a gatling laser a lot. On my full time power armor character I have 30 or so fusion cores without running power user (and 300+ stimpacks...)
---
Stabilized is a must.
---
Junkies and instigating are good for high damage melee weapons, especially since incisor gives so much armor penetration. Look for swing speed or power attack damage for a secondary perk (swing speed paired with junkies for dps, or power attack damage paired with instigating for one-shotting). Unfortunately I always find the need to run Traveling Pharmacy (there's no PA equivalent to the chemist's backpack mod) so I end up unable to max melee damage. If you are in the same boat skip one full set of slugger or gladiator rather than incisor or martial artist, or go 3/2/1 in the damage perk sets for a little bit more damage. Blocker is great but there aren't enough strength points, and survivability in PA is not really a problem.
---
For the heavy weapon it's going to be a toss up whether you go junkies or AA after the nerf. Final Word is pretty good and easy to get. Junkies is increasingly better on higher damage per shot weapons. It's probably going to depend what you find/get a good deal on. The perks you'll choose are pretty much the same either way.
---
For QOL I personally would rather not have to swap between heavy and melee. I have a [junkies PA slugger/commando](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ff53b25&amp;d=pg2ph2pp2sm2s42ss2ee2ic4lt2i12pi2pr2se2a01s12eh0l71sb2c81&amp;w=sn2&amp;m=cf8h&amp;wp=w2&amp;wm=1b2133&amp;ad=0478a&amp;n=Swinging%20Commando), and a [heavy/stealth rifleman](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=dd33e73&amp;d=pp2ic4lt2i12s12eh2ip2sq2s32sr1sb2s01pd2pk2pl2p60an2s72ao0cu2&amp;n=Heavy%20Rifleman) that wears PA only for boss fights. It would be cool if the legendary special perks boosted the cap to 20... 
---
Edit - Bandolier is important for heavy users as well, and unless you're going to be dumping all of your ammo in your stash when you switch to melee, that means it's going to cut into your melee perk cards even more.
---
The skill ceiling to use them is too high. Using them in a GL and increasing the radius would make them more viable.
---
Straight up spent a day tweaking my camp for the greenhouse set.
---
Same here I can't farm any for hours after, but then I'll just nuke the toxic area at the top, can get over 500 unstable violets, a lot of running about but worth it.
---
Have you tested the explosive heavies at all? e.g. (Fatman, 40m Auto/Reg launcher, missile launcher)
---
My assumption is that my playstyle isn't going to change too much since it was already taking 3-4 40mm grenades to take out high level enemies on a non-bloodied gun with max demo, so it'll probably end up being 6-7 with the new patch. Though I'll probably end up using more ammo overall since the enemies will now start scaling.
---
I have a two-shot, an explosive and a quad tesla. I use the quad the most. Nothing like having 60 rounds that arc everywhere!
---
If I'm honest, I'm not a huge stikler for lore being 100% I just want cool difficult zones that doesn't spoon feed you.
---
Yeah I’m absolutely sure. The items I want to merge the most can’t be placed in water anyway.
---
Bonus points for "Werk room"
---
That's cool, but that takes up a LPC slot yeah? I guess it depends on how many they allow you to have. Like I need it more for utility, scrapper, green thumb, etc... I'd like it if they upped the level cap on that as well too. But I know its wishful thinking.
---
But you agreed to the pvp when you take it... Hence the pop-up warning.
---
There are plenty of ways to get resources without risk of pvp.... This isnt one.
---
Yes they're shit, there a fucking pain to drop, and as they get bundled in with weapons, if you accidentally drop a weapon in the same session you drop these shitters it disappears. As the grenades can't be dropped, anything dropped with them does not spawn a drop bag, it's lost forever even, if it's your B252 fixer or whatever...
---
I just need to get me a Troubleshooters Anti-Armor Two Shot (so it shoots 8 bullets total) version of The Dragoon so I can get those 1,000 Black Powder robot kills
---
I had other inspirations but now that you mention it, yea very similar.
---
You do have a surrender option. It’s not going back to defend it from vagrants.
---
Buying the plans from the settlers with gold bullion
---
Thanks for the input! I’m currently only two stories off the ground. With a huge platform and some hiding areas. I have a bunch more tweaking to do with it.  Now that you mentioned an obvious flaw I didn’t even think about.  I’ll try to make little platforms around the bottom of the base so it’s easy to jump back onto the top.
---
So all you need is arguably the best 2h in the game!  I rolled 1100 scrip worth of 2* and 3* melee weapons today during the sale and got zero bloodied weapons.
---
But it's percussion cap.
---
Yes you need to increase your rep to the point of being able to buy it from the settlers using gold bullion. It’s a bit of a grind but eventually you can get it
---
I found a bag at a train station full of plans, I felt kinda bad at first, but I realized someone just dropped them. I took the ones I didn't know and left the rest for someone else. I have since been leaving bags at train station a of plans I can't sell and ammo I don't use.
---
All recipes for 1 cap, all ammo for 1 cap...except for 22mm, .38, .44, arrows, bolts...all ZERO caps.
---
I’m trying to save anything that isn’t listed as fodder on my price checker as well. There’s just so much junk  lol. And now I’ve got the weekend to do scrip quests too
---
Do I need to be friendly or allies with them?
---
Puckle Gun 1718.  And many others.  all the way back to da Vinci.
---
turn it off and then back on again.
---
what platform are you on.  If you are on pc friend me and i'll help you out.  I was clueless about all things fallout when I started playing.  Now Im lvl 117 through trial and lots of error.
---
Redzone04  on most evenings 900pm cst,
---
Okay, if I can just get my hands on an Instigating Troubleshooters Anti-Armor version I'd be good to go so I can get those 1,000 black powder robot kills.
---
always drop starter stuff into Overseer stash box
---
Can you make blueprint???
---
Well this just convinced me I'm never gonna do daily ops
---
Rip one guy on ps4, one on xbox, and I play pc :') y'all are the best
---
Yeah, I am very "exited" to almost do the same dmg after I grind thousands of lvls to max out legendary perks and stealth for every attack!!1!one1 Aren't you!?
---
So I rolled 1000 scrip today.  Did maybe 3 armor and the rest range weapons.  Only one of them is “maybe” worth something other than scrip and that’s pushing it LOL.
---
535 for me with steak and whiskey.
---
I’m not sure exactly what rank/level you need to be
---
Thank you for letting me know! I also came across a sbq fight with a platform like that and she landed almost more than normal and it was a gun fight... quick but fun. And since then I haven’t found another one like it. That’s why I’m trying to see how people feel about the idea.
---
First issue as others said is it makes other gear that players have grinded for over two years obsolete. Maybe one day that will become necessary, but 4* and 5* items will already do that, without introducing an additional levelling mechanic to weapons.
---
Second issue is many FO76 come from a single player RPG background. Some like myself have an inherent dislike towards MMORPG games like WoW and Destiny, and tend to dislike ideas that come from those games. 
---
Fo76 has and likely will always be, for me, a hybrid between a single player FO experience and an online game that sort of does its own thing, and finds its own solutions to its quirky problems. It just works for me.
---
Sadly no, pc master race for life :')
---
I think it means that the BOS will be separated amongst the ranks. Due to some different beliefs and ideals. But I could very well be wrong. But I’d like to see Enclave come back
---
I usually just do thumbs down then up and wave bb, and hope they kinda guess "no thanks but thank you"
---
The capital wasteland seems to be a popular idea and I certainly wouldn't complain. Maybe before all the super mutants show up for the sake of something different.
---
You'll get it, just keep reading up on things.
---
If I'm not mistaken, explosive doesn't drop any more on energy weapons, though there may be some (very expensive) legacy ones out there.  I'm not certain if explosive was ever on teslas, but it's possible.  And explosive is rather overrated anyway, it's useful usually but there are mobs that aren't effected by fire (though not that many).  Faster Fire Rate is a viable option instead.
---
Almost every time someone visits my camp, they open the porta-potty door for some reason - I find it kind of funny
---
One more question, who do I barter with to get the plan?
---
I might do that. Right now, I have 4 vendors that are pretty much all plans priced 50 or less each. I usually sell one or two each time I'm online but I just want to get rid of them.
---
..whats the rate on that?  bucks to caps?
---
Uh, the way that the additive formula works... your damage may not actually change at all? 
---
If you're not bloodied, and have no other buffs except for demo, the only thing that has a mod with a higher base damage would be the AGL. At least, I think that's the only one. 
---
So...yeah, I think you're almost entirely unaffected. You may need to use more grenades because the enemies are of higher level, but that's about it. Probably just need to pop a Psychobuff or something.
---
Also remember the contractor perk card when building in your camp, helped me out a ton when I first accidentally scrapped my decontamination shower!
---
You forgot to add for 6000 gold bullion lol
---
It happens. Not much you can do about it but keep on smilin'.
---
Armor is so annoying. Gotta sit there for a second doing math so you don't fuck up and end with 1 scrip in the machine
---
Yeah, definitely seems possible. The biggest issue is that you either waste large amounts of time as a gun build killing things, or are essentially defenseless against half the enemies. If you are going exclusively bash, you will still have some issues, but if you are using a bash and fire combo, the vampire's one especially will keep you going. The AAs will kill things quickly but since you have to wait before your minigun is done spinning to heal, that might end up screwing you over at points. 
---
I was already able to solo v94 against resilient mutants, but that was with a vampire's explosive handmade and then downing the boss with a nocturnal explosive gatling plasma. I think I had around 7m22s on that run. If you have an endless supply of healing items, you can make it through just tanking against the enemies you can't afford to kill, but vampire's weapons will definitely be top tier for resilient enemies.
---
Only potential issue would be the bosses, no real spoilers in case you haven't seen them but the ones I've seen so far aren't particularly melee-friendly. Bash-only minigun build might have a bit of trouble with them, and you might need to save up condition on your vampire's one for that
---
352 stanley nickles is... like 25 schrute bucks which'll get ya like 3 dollars so... like 6?
---
Both my mules are parked by that ice machine. I’ve moved a few hundred pounds without issue.
---
Stifled. It’s the only word I can think of that perfectly coincides with this game. Not only are there daily limits for everything but there is a lack of things to do. Endgame content shouldn’t solely include running around collecting junk. There’s what? 2 endgame bosses? There was 1 ‘dungeon’ added. And nuke runs get old after a while. Why can’t I grind out treasury notes until I get all those plans? I can only buy them once anyway and there isn’t new shit replacing it once it’s gone? Why can’t I scrip all those shit 1 star legendaries I get from 3 star creatures? Why do I have to decide whether I want to carry them and wait or just unload them some other way? And for that matter why can’t I scrip all the shit 3 star rolls I get from the purveyor? I gotta carry that shit around too.
---
Are you on Xbox? I’ve got plenty that I could give you and some Fusion cores set up for 40 caps a piece in my vendor.
---
Lol, "I give up."
---
I've ran into some people that started jumping around, fortnite style and slaughtering me.Kept me away from capturing for a whole month.
---
Considering some of them kinda sound like one, it's pretty fitting.
---
Yep.
---
I sell at 25c per plan and they fly out, only reason I don't sell for free is because some greedy sob will turn up and take the lot (Xbox)
---
Ok, that makes perfect sense. I thought it depended on the highest lvl in the area cause sometimes I'd kill a lvl 15ish and his friend would be in the 40-60 range. I'd always notice other players in the area so figured it was highest lvl. I'm still newish, restarted last week and haven't played since about 3 weeks after the game came out.
---
Figured somebody would catch it eventually!
---
I probably offended some nazi snowflake lmao
---
With the settlers you go to Samuel, he’s usually near the back of foundation by the elevator to Paige. For the raiders there is a Mr Gutsy in the crater core you buy plans from.
---
I used to have trouble with them...now I just walk up to them and slap em around with my 2 star gauntlet.
---
Samuel  he is at the top of the stairs at 3 o clock if you are looking at the gold bullion machine/ tinkers work bench.
---
He will only appear once you get to a level you  can trade with him.
---
Sometimes he spawns in just underwear and a baseball cap I shit you not.
---
I basically live in a box and people still check it out.... I'm so poor.
---
Meet Samuel at foundation. Neighbourly level should unlock the CSS plans for 4k gold. Practically you don't need the helmet
---
I would have no issue they just purge pvp from the game
---
Go deep.
---
Follow the tunnel under the Rusty pick. There's a few containers way at the back. Nobody ever goes down there.
---
The suit only does the job
---
Wait! COUNTER clockwise?!? *smacks forehead* no wonder it wasn't working
---
personally I think the "rules" for SBQ fights are the same as the challenge auto-complete bug. There may be common things that contribute to causing it, but nothing that's 100%.
---
You ever play Borderlands??
---
It's my least favorite thing about it, constantly farming for max level rolls.
---
It's hard enough in FO76 trying to find anything specific. 
---
No thanks.
---
I believe this is the bugged quest you need to use a private server for. I’m not on PS4 so I can’t invite you to mine. You can ask on this sub and I’m sure someone would be willing to help.
---
&gt;  You probably can't two-shot the Queen anymore
---
ok well game's broken im going to get on my knees for new vegas now, bye everyone see you in my 1200 word leaving post on tuesday
---
I turn mine on when I've visited Smiley for the weekly gold. I mainly sell serums, flux and cheap 3\*s for scrip so it doesn't take long to get those 6k back.
---
Shame they’re getting rid of the old Casual group (+1 luck). It was my go-to after the legendary run ended.
---
That’s really interesting. [According to this article](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Creature_taming) it says that tamed animals can’t be killed - unless maybe I misunderstood something. I want a pet Megasloth now!
---
Just spent my all my scrip and got 4 salvaged assaultron heads.
---
Welcome to the clunkers club, I've only played heavy weapon PA build and that was my intention from level-1 6 months ago, after about 3 weeks I found a TSE [50.cal](https://50.cal) for 1500 caps in a vendor and  haven't found or crafted a better weapon since I got it, but yeah I love PA I don't think I've died in about 2 months :) , I just wish the T-65 would get some loving skin wise .
---
I take them for my low level characters as a quick way to level them up, I couldn’t care less about the resources. If I take the 6 workshops in the lower part of the forest I can easily get my character up to around level 25-30 in a couple hours just by hoping back and forth between the  defend the workshop events.
---
Done.
---
3 Queens, 2 Earles and 1 WS for Fluorescent. I needed that. :D
---
The average player isn't min-maxing enough to feel upset about this. They will maybe go from 12 to 14 shots needed to down an overlord. Chances are they won't even notice
---
Amen steel brother!
---
Well now you know not to go there.
---
Had that notice pop up before during a queen fight. Just gotta use your best judgement, based on the group you're with.
---
Go for broke and keep shooting. Or bail and save your ammo for the next one. Decide and commit. Take your lumps if you chose wrong.
---
Doesn't change that it's a pvp zone and you agreed to it before taking it.
---
So, why should the game give a second chance to opt out when it is a pvp zone by design and you already agreed to it?
---
Already know all the plans, already have 30k caps on multiple mules, probably have every duped explosive energy gun in circulation too. What would they need to trade for?
---
It’s not available at the moment as the season has ended, but it will be purchaseable from the raiders for gold bullion starting this Tuesday. To answer the last part, it was only level 4 or 5 on the board, which you could easily get to with only one or two days worth of playing
---
Why wouldn't you just go on their profile and block them. Having fun with friends is one thing but dealing toxic is easy to get around with no effort. Maybe it's just cause I'm older but I just want to enjoy the game. The games to big to be small minded. "Past PVP" that's understandable lol
---
/math
---
I mean - I get that would be tiring to have to do everytime.
---
But - I'm genuinely jealous of missing that fight.  I've yet to experience one like that.  
---
Colossus has always been a loot piñata for me.  (and not because of me - I tend to run around killing the wendies.)
---
That's good to hear. Do you know how the Two-Shot legendary effect is changed by this patch. I know explosives get a free pass on this since the explosive damage isn't affected by the 25% dmg on the second projectile, but I wonder how that works on other weapons.
---
Legendary Perks better be released on the 15th as well...no need for them to be tested any longer...out with them now damn it!!!
---
PSA: about shopping at camps
---
stash all your junk except some fertilizer and a roll of TP
---
I did not know this was a thing , I now need this thing, good bye mortals I am off to procure this thing.
---
I’m on the Xbox one
---
Trap camps are fun. They add some spice to the Wasteland.
---
I have a Quad 25/250 that I bought from someone's vendor for 1500 caps.
---
I nearly shit a brick. They are out there just keep looking.
---
Yes, you have a chance to get these as a reward from the daily ops.
---
I only ever bought ammo at 2 caps when it was needed for the score and only because I didn't want to waste time looking for another vendor. I ususally puke on the machine otherwise.
---
there are plenty of ways to pvp without griefing as well....this sin't one....see how easy it is to flip that logic?  workshops are the easiest way to farm resources while questing or afk aside from building your camp around one of the limited recourse outcrops in the world and server hopping until you can place your camp down and even then you have this eye soar of an extractor sitting in your camp.  You get a lot more benefits from nuclear winter than from workshop pvp including various camp items
---
I believe they made that change to PTS and it will also be the same when it drop next week.
---
Name your platform, my dude. you'll have tons of offers for help and donations.
---
This has been an issue for about a month. Search the subreddit for "ounce of prevention" and someone will have posted tips or workarounds.
---
I'd like to see the Enclave come back, but I'd love to see anything added for the Free States.
---
This I can deal with. The asshats with the glitched stacks of punji boards behind a wall are what's gotten me. Thankfully there are explosive bait for them.
---
Private server
---
Is a debuff the same as a nerf, or did they buff it and then nerf it making it a debuff?
---
On reflection I would tend to agree with you.
---
What type of guns do you like ? I may be able to give you a small boost some day
---
The only reason that Heavies seem to be so unaffected is because they have so few mods that increase their base damage. Since the damage formula is based on the "stock" weapon damage, and Heavies already have such a high one...this is what happens. Perks are still adding the percentages that they say they are...but only to the original base damage. 
---
This is also why Unarmed is acting so weird. The base damage of an Unarmed weapon is the damage **with 1 Strength**, no matter how much Strength you have. However, some bonuses operate on the Strength modified Base Damage, while others do not. Junkie's, for example, uses the 1 Strength Base Damage when adding its 50%. I assume Bloodied does the same with its bonus.
---
The problem is not as severe with 2Handed, because the base damage is already much, much higher. But it **is** still a problem that needs to be addressed.
---
Exit game and log back in. Worked for me, but may require multiple tries.
---
But i can't get any more ghoul blood, so that step never goes away again, any ideas?
---
Pvp in a zone designed to be fought over is not griefing, lol.
---
No, your wording doesn't work. It actually makes no sense.
---
You pvp'd me in a pvp zone designed to pvp for control of the pvp zone... You're griefing. See how that doesn't make sense?
---
That's like saying killing you in fortnight is griefing because you just want to build... Well, it's pvp.
---
Probably someone didn't know what they had. Great find, to bad for the vendor, but....
---
For events?
---
They were maybe drop trading and didn't want you taking what they had or possibly doing somethin sketchy like duping and didn't want anyone knowing. Or maybe... 
---
y'know... Ya might honk a bit. I mean you left the vault a while ago and there no showers around and the water is dirty. I'm sure you change your costume a lot but we can't all smell great
---
Haha yeah pretty much. Incidentally I found it in someone’s vending machine for 750c lol.
---
I wanna say there's a 15 minute window after logging out to log back in. But I'm sure I've read on here people have lost their stuff because it loaded a new server for them.
---
I tend to drop mine at vault 76 as a gift for a newbie
---
Plans aren't worth much, I would have done the same thing.
---
Then I would have shot you in the back to remind you, there are no friends in the wasteland... Only opportunities.
---
You don't have the option to press A button on the corpse to get more blood? Exiting and relogging could fix it, I don't recall exactly which step mine got stuck on, but when I relogged I think it ended up resetting the entire quest or something.
---
New player, here, is this typical? Any other game would have hotfixed this within a day or two. What are you doing over there at your offices? Jesus christ.
---
Absolutely no idea. I don't actually have any Two-Shot weapons on the PTS to test that on.
---
You killed the queen by yourself? Or did you just shoot at her?
---
You need to make minimum 1k damage on the queen to get loot.
---
Facts.
---
Good summary! For a more indepth calculation you can use my website calculator:
---
[https://www.fo76calc.com/](https://www.fo76calc.com/)
---
Right now it only support range weapon calculation.
---
Holly crap .......    I have no troubleshooter armor, but a troubleshooter sniper rifle.... they had better make sneak work!!!!!
---
I hate your face. 🤣😂🤣
---
Same, very pissed about this. I was even considering their stupid "premium" but not now, not seeing how little they give an f about their players. 
---
How the hell is a MAIN STORY QUEST completely bugged and blocked in brand new content and goes unfixed for over a month? Are these guys just dicking around at 'work' over there? Jesus you'd think a decent engineer would have fixed this in an hour or two.
---
Understandable, thank you for taking the time to write this post and answer the questions in the comments. It's very informative.
---
I meant that i shoot it, it is difficult to see who killed it
---
Ghouls blood doesnt "drop" you have to press a button on the body to extract it
---
Well. Kinda.
---
It started as "You buy the game, and everything but the cosmetics will be free! And we'll even give you a way to earn the currency in game!"
---
Then the repair kits happened.
---
Then the scrap kits.
---
Then the collectrons. 
---
Then fallout 1st.
---
Now dailies give us score points instead of atoms.
---
They put a scrip limit on legendaries.
---
Then there are the plethora of bugs and rampant server instability.
---
I'm not saying it's not a fun game, and I didn't get my fair share of enjoyment out of it. I am saying that Bethesda under Zenimax media has been misleading at best, and deceptive at worst.
---
i would do what that guy did fyi
---
Xbox One, shotgun😊
---
I wouldn't say safe, but it's totally doable.  I have read about people losing items in a private world, but it's probably going to work.  When I do it, I make sure to find a spot, get my characters there, then do the exchange using a container like one of the suit cases in a train station.  It's much less safe to try to drop items and hope your bag doesn't disappear.
---
Not just annoying...I'm not playing. Log on, scrip to limit, log off.
---
All plans are 5 caps. Unless the rare ones. Then I consume them.
---
Doesn't matter who shot the killing blow. You need to do minimum 1k damage. It sounds like on all three times, you did not do enough damage. 
---
What level are you, what build do you use, and what effects are on your guns? 
---
Harpoon gun is not good vs queen unless you have a Quad one. Even then, it might be questionable.
---
oh hell ya I didn’t know that. I was already looking forward to daily ops but now even more
---
I do this all the time but I wasnt playing yesterday lol
---
Honestly they have screwed with the PVP mechanics involving workshops enough to cater to the strictly PVE crowd. I miss those random big fights at the ammo factory.  Workshops are the only good option for PVP aside from going around shooting people a practice most call griefing.
---
You need to do a minimum damage, I thought it was 2k, I could very well be wrong though. 
---
She has incredible DR/ER though, and is immune to explosive damage. Toggle show damage numbers in the settings and you will get an idea as to how much damage you are doing.
---
As an aside, always make sure you are actively participating in the event. It's possible that the SBQ flies far enough away from the event icon that you don't actually trigger it.
---
Dang that sucks. At this point I refuse to believe it’s just RNG. There’s no way Bethesda isn’t altering the odds of getting certain legendary types. Anything bloodied or junkies is worth at least 3-5k caps. Yet here I am loading up on mutant slayers
---
I've been playing games since the original Doom / Wolfenstein days. This is the one it seems, for me. Absolutely incredible. It's the world I think, you just live in it. Xbox?
---
Gonna second the large # of weapons argument here. I'm carrying 20-30 Heavy weapons w/ Bear arms and I notice that the game stutters sometimes when I open my pipboy though I haven't really noticed it that much w/ opening the wheel.
---
Yeah I got an instigating/power attack unarmed I use for 99% of play, but pull out the furious/swing speed for bosses.
---
I believe it takes about 20 hours to fully reset.
---
Thanks for sharing. Please do better next time.
---
The kind that makes you harder to detect.
---
I wouldn’t call it 100% safe, more like 90%. Do it all the time. With five characters, I never run out of ammo because I just swap the ammo from one toon to the next depending on what they’re using. Scripped a character out for the day and have excess scrip weapon and armor? Move to a different toon. Made easier by either having all my toons camps in the same spot so I can just do bag drops at my camps, alternatively a train station makes a good spot too. 
---
To help guarantee the world is yours, so to speak, have a friend (who would also need to have FO1st) act as an anchor and just hang out in that world and join back on them. If they don’t have first they’ll get booted when log off the server. Otherwise if no friend is available, generally you have about 10 to 15 minutes to swap characters and transfer items.
---
they can't damage you if they're dead.
---
Moi?
---
There's a video of someone testing 22 different weapons like nocturnal weapon up to a be gat plasma. Noc got a decent buff or moved up in the chain of a useable decent legendary prefix. Be gatling plasma and BE gatling laser got hit the hardest of all weapons. the 50 cal and LMG or mg42 got the least affected in the heavy weapons category. 
---
Bloodied 2h and 1h weapons didnt get a massive nerf like they say. You can still dish out almost 1k damage compared to like 1.6k damage before the patch.
---
90% safe. I do it everyday. If they put out a hotfix, you will not be able to get back in the same server. Other than that, it takes a small collection of fuckups to lose anything. Like a bluescreens, followed by an " unable to find server" . Or jumping into a public will sometimes make it so you can't get back. Just don't waste time, 3min or less is safe, you are probably good out to 5-7 min, but after that it gets more and more likely to generate a new server.
---
Edit: having a friend on your private provides security, as long as whole server doesn't crash.
---
Are you on console?
---
Its not 100% safe. But I use to transfer o lot of times without lost. But I need confess somites my heartbeat goes to hell. Safest way is use fixed world stash instead of drop a paper bag. Pay attetion to do it as fast as you can, lower risk os server instability that can lead you to new server and MOST important dont make a mistake to enter in a public server between swap (its can happens accidentaly in login screen) this will lead to your private server reset.
---
Yah 1/10th is my standard now. Kinda a shame that plans have no rarity in this game. I miss being excited about finding a plan in a random loot box or vending machine
---
I’ve done it a bunch of times, but I did lose a bunch of plans once doing it. I’d say it’s safe generally but for god rolls get a courier
---
Lol yah.  The one item that I price checked that’s questionably of value was a troubleshooters or mutants explosive snub nose I believe (can’t recall exactly and the price was low). The rest were nocturnal, zealots, mutants slayers, assassin’s...
---
If the doors open and a camp piques my interest I will have a mooch about and see what they got going on find some really cool ideas, I put a lot of effort into mine so hopefully giving others ideas too, Mines a shop down stairs and living space upstairs, I find it amusing when someone comes upstairs sees me and immediately turns around and goes straight back down stairs like "oops their home", other people come upstairs use my stuff bed/benches/stash with no shame what so ever :P
---
If you are just transferring scrip or weapons you can afford to lose its fine, however if you get disconnected then it will load you into a new world so dont do it with valuable items. There is dedicated couriers on the market place that you can call on to help you with item transfers. They will charge a small fee but not much.
---
I drop my unneeded plans on the ground at train stations since no one ever buys them.  Hoping it helps some low level players find a good mine in every game.
---
I've done the quest a few times and I remember once getting the second half of the recipe without looking for the terminal/door password. I think I went ahead and just made the nukashine and finished the quest.(there should be some ingredients at a farm just south of tattoo parlor btw)
---
Agreed. I don’t have any trap camps, but personally I kinda like them. I get a good chuckle when I can say “ahhh got me fair and square”
---
Two Separate Legendary Scrappers...one for scrip &amp; one for modules, then BGS wouldn't have to increase scrip daily allowance, just add another machine that you can still get modules for on top of the scrip allowance.
---
now if floater grenades actually spawned a friendly floater i'd be spending all of my time making new floaty friends!
---
save up max caps
---
on all 5 toons
---
someone Might take that for one.. but will probably want a trade
---
not a bullet :)
---
I had like 900 and only I got was a AASS Grognak axe, Bethesda has to put more scrip limit like 250 for day, so people on this event could get more things
---
This sucks, I wish Bethesda would stop rehashing old rewards, I worked hard to get the collection and now its going to be common as fuck.
---
Exactly. And if the joint looks sketchy, I'll either move on or slip into something more power armor.
---
I'm sure the constant droning noise will drive her insane first.
---
You wish to trade something for it I’ve been searching for one for so long
---
I saw it and had a baby yoda reaction
---
Lol there's a market sub. It's not this one. Ask there and you will learn all the things people are looking for in exchange for one of these guys.
---
They just need to buff the base weapon damage.
---
I run a junkies build and usually run a handmade. It has nearly twice the damage as a full auto 10mm pistol.......and zero negatives outside reload speed.
---
Why would anyone choose a pistol under most circumstances??
---
Really hoping the devs do a balance pass on everything
---
I guess they should also reduce their weight by a lot to make them a viable ammo/weapon, they are so weak but their side effects are what matter, specially poison and freeze
---
Lol probably like 20 spelling/grammar mistakes
---
Mother of god... It’s a like an assaultron and sentry bot had a one night stand. Not gently either, they were hate f*cking.
---
I don’t mind trap camps. 
---
One if the ideas behind the game, at least at launch, was other players are dangerous. That they would be the most frustrating, challenging and rewarding experiences.
---
"baby's first event" made me chuckle :P
---
🤣😂🤣
---
Congratulations on the find.
---
If you are both on the same team, you should be able to fast travel to your friend and it will put you in his event if it is not full. Remember, there are only 8 slots per instance, once those are full it starts a new one.
---
I feel like the 50 percent price is fair. But once you hit that’s 150 it’s slow to get more if you don’t have any banked and at least for me I’m done for the day I’m not interested in doing boring dailies for like 5 scrip just get another assassin’s
---
Yeah. Ive done many swaps, some under some adverse conditions and it's reliable. Like others I wouldn't say 100%   
---
Hell one time I got back into the same lobby after accidentally joining a publoc one. My items I was trying to swap weren't there but the npc I killed was.
---
I spent 2k (I got an alt for doing the daily level) on weapons.  So 40 3\* weapons and nothing.  Then this morning I went with 2\* at 150 scrip on each toon.  So 12 more weapons.  Nada.
---
It just sucks.
---
Absolutely a dupe.  But, I think my 3 best weapons are likely dupes.  Because it's damn near impossible to get great rolls with any regularity.
---
How were you able to buy it? You must’ve been at exactly 30,000 caps? That’s risky bizz
---
Yes, Xbox.
---
I got a fixer.
---
I just put on light footed for the punjies, but not gonna get bent outta shape if I forget or don’t/can’t see the trap. Falling from high places doesn’t bother me (two pieces of fall protection armor). Some of the traps get seriously creative and I enjoy them.
---
1k
---
Heh
---
Probably was
---
Nine builds. Seven "need" sneaking to be effective.
---
This frustrates me. IDK if it's this post saying "just sneak lol" that's frustrating or that maxed-out builds will need sneak to be effective.
---
Yeah i completely understand. Damn that's a lot of changes indeed throughout it's life cycle. I'm not 100% familiar with how things were before and etc but i can definitely say the bugs and server instabilities is crazy, lag and delay is extremely noticeable.
---
Oh, cool you used my findings on the PTS for this thing. Neat! But, I just tested your calculator on the Gauss Shotgun. It's not accurate.
---
Whatever source you used for the base damage on those two was inaccurate. Base damage of the Gauss Shotgun is 288. 
---
Primed, 3/3/3 Shotgun, Bloody Mess, Junkie's, Full Demo is 1085
---
On PTS it's like...802? I don't know why it works like that. Has to be something with how Demo Expert works.
---
Yes, 2mm are a pain to mass produce, can't wait till I can max the legendary perk that lets you craft 150% more ammo per craft on day one....will finally be able 2 use my 2 Shot FFR FR Gauss Minigun as a main instead of a back up.
---
There's an edit button for a reason.
---
Yep
---
I also use this method to transfer items knowing that it's not 100% reliable. Just make sure to drop your items in a suitcase etc and not just a paper bag on the ground.
---
I'd keep them in your stash if you think you're going to use them, or scrap/sell them if you won't.
---
I don't really think a crew served piece of weaponry that may have only had a production run of 2 is a very good example of a commonly available weapon. Nor would I expect that would serve as an example of how to make a flint fired rifle (I understand the design of the Pickle Gun involved a flint firing mechanism. I'm focusing I am focusing on the rifle aspect here, since we were talking about rifles) a repeater but maybe I'm just not reaching hard enough.
---
I don't mean the flora. Thats why you farm it when the nuke is gone. The amount of plants is not the bottleneck. You just go back every xx minutes for the enemy's. I tried it on a private server but that doesn't work. Enemy's respawn when new players join. So just farm high rad fluids and glowing and hardened mass first so you don't have to carry hundreds of spoiling flux
---
This is good thinking!
---
I'm not going to go threw and edit that shit for some random ppl, what is going to happen? Imma lose internet points, oh nooo
---
Haha yep
---
Honestly why does assassin’s even exist. It’s just mutants but less usable. 
---
I guess I did remember hearing it was going to become damage to all humans weapon somewhere?
---
Gotta keep yer wits about you in the wasteland, fool me once and all that.
---
Why bother even posting?
---
How many people are on your friends list from FO76?
---
Congrats! Nothing more exciting than visiting a player vendor and finding an absolute GEM
---
You’re might be right. Personally I think they unintentionally priced it at 750 as all the other stuff in the machine was pretty good but all priced with more 0’s. They probably meant for it to be 7500 which is still cheap for that weapon imo. Even then still could be a dupe.
---
You did not do both questlines? Boy did you miss the memo! Well get grinding rep then and you can get it in 1,5 months or so. You only need the suit!
---
It'll be great, game is just a shooting gallery right now
---
Holiday presents or he had someone give him the rest.
---
Legendary perks, daily ops, and one wasteland all seem pretty focused on giving more veteran players something to do. I was honestly just first doing the daily ops to get that camp pennant, but now I'm actually enjoying them enough to do them just for that. Feels like a way of testing weapons to see if I can solo elder with them. Haven't seen any massive game breaking bugs there yet that will affect me, so here's to hoping the game will actually be playable next week. Haven't been playing the live servers for a while but I definitely feel like this will make me come back for a bit
---
Honestly one of my favorite aspects of this is that the toxic valley and ash heap are now worth exploring. The toxic valley was one of my favorite areas of the game atmospherically, but going there for anything other than the radroach challenges felt like a waste of time
---
Lol idk just felt like it
---
I always find it strange when people say they can't fix bugs but can put out cosmetics....
---
Like, that's 2 different teams. Of course.
---
I agree there needs to be more bug fixes but the cosmetics team does not affect the bug team in anyway whatsoever.... Other than maybe introducing new bugs with the cosmetics 🤣.
---
In conclusion: gibberish.
---
Nice find! Just dont use it during ACP,  Line in the sand,  or any other event with multiple enimes where you should be able to use it!  Unless you like fo76 slide shows.
---
Ya. I still get on from time to time, but until they fix some of the older problems I won't be a regular player anymore, and I've stopped giving them money.
---
You know, if something isn't easily read or followed... Devs will probably look right past it.
---
You want the attention of the devs? Make it so they can read and understand what's being said.
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
That is how I transfer items to my mule but it is not 100% safe! You have to be ok with the fact that something might happen like a DC etc and that you may loose your items.
---
It has only happened to me once so far but it’s still disappointing when it happens but as I have no friends that play to help me, it is my only option
---
Nice! Hopefully the next person who buys their second one from that guy is just as happy with it, and the third, and the fourth...
---
Fair enough. Thank you very much for your feedback!
---
Well people like us who never had the chance to do so, now have a chance at your collection you worked so hard for aswell, fair game bethesda.
---
I'm always checking the sub when a new skin is released. Losing ledgendary effects is no fun.
---
Any time! Glad you're enjoying your adventures!
---
Dude u mentioned pvp, now reddit hates u:/ they will say it's for another reason but it will always really be bc u think pvp isn't that bad
---
Ironically, you posted this twice.
---
Because then everyone would have it say $420.69

GT: LAWRENCEANDHENR 
---
Hit me up if you see me. Got plenty to help.
---
Lol I've seen ppl who r unironicly like this on my lvl 15 pvp build
---
Nice work.  I got a little extra set aside for my best hunters.
---
This makes sense
---
I think I might have been to the same one? He had glitter on the floor instead of a tile and you drop straight down just before you reach the stairs? 
---
When I respawned, him and a friend were waiting at the bottom and jumping around
---
Doing gods work. Thank you soldier
---
I have a berserker combat shotgun for nuke zones when I’m in a hazmat suit
---
Sorry man my phone is also confused 😞
---
If there was the ability to type in a number I'd agree, but it's a slider.  Hard to mess that up.
---
Was his name leathal misty
---
I think the favorite wheels bugs out if u put 2 of the same guns on it.
---
Thank you! Yes i am indeed (at the moment) hahah. Been taking a break from Avengers sincd that's currently a cluster F*. Put almost 50hours into it and I'm literally losing progression and items, i was like nah. I need to like and play this game, put avengers away downloaded FO76 on gamepass PC and been loving it ever since.
---
In the last 4 months i've traded stuff between my 5 characters at least once a day. Probably close like 800+ times. And i reckon out of those 800+ times it's fucked up maybe 7 or 8 times
---
twice when i joined it put me in a brand new world. a couple of times it absolutely crashed and when i got back in none of the stuff was there. And the main one is when you back out of the game to swap the main menu is frozen and when you get back in after restarting there's a chance your stuff is not there
---
if you do do it use something like a suitcase or ice box (i have my 4 alts parked at the rusty pick) and don't trade anything rare or really expensive. I lost about 50k worth of ammo before along with a load of decent legendaries. Hasn't happened for a while though.
---
I never played during survival, instead a spent a few months on the trading forums and vendor hopping to get the collection. 
---
They need to start releasing more limited time rewards and make new ones for event rewards. 
---
If you miss out and want them then there is a huge trading base in the game SK you can still obtain them that way.
---
Never had a problem whit deathclaws they're not that difficult to deal whit , the only thing to fear in this game is the imposter sheep super mega melting laser beam 🤷‍♂️
---
Agreed, I've only been done once by a trap camp, but I knew it was before I entered, as I "aint no sukka" and had nothing on me to drop so went inside to check it out as I hadn't seen one before, was kinda lame flame traps and all that but it killed me, also had a level 48 the other day hovering about near his camp watching me, as I got to his door there was a single vendor in the far distance and it just stank fishy, I turned looked at him and thumbs down him and he hopped servers 10 seconds later :P
---
3 to be precise.  =)
---
Yea but be careful. It's best to have someone on the server. Just know there is risk involved so try to minimize transferring large amount of really good stuff all at once. Piece meal it so you can mitigate possible lose.
---
I want daily ops to play but all my friends stopped playing because of the content drought and the games personally dying for me too i do hope patch 22 is good because I really like fallout and I’m not able to play 3, nv and 4 so 76 is all I got and I don’t wanna stop playing
---
You don't have to launch the nuke. Just someone does and it spawns the log.
---
I didn’t put them on favourite wheels, I just equip them on pip boy but I can’t equip the one I want😞
---
even if just like 20% on 1 star 50% 2* and 80% on 3*  weapons and 20% 40% 60% on armor to keep with the whole lower scrip price they have going on currently.
---
Rename the weapons?
---
I have done this for all my weapons putting A/B/C.... etc as a prefix to organize my list. Helps so much when looking for weapons on a mule.
---
I did it in an open server. Ice box, drop stuff in it, rejoin the world. Just choose someone from your friend list
---
Just go to the dupers paradise market sub.  
---
Most likely be trade only though.
---
Well thats the risk you took
---
Simply buff weapon perks and blood mess perk and that's enough. They are hired professional programers and are asked to do the nerf.
---
I get soo many I just dump them outside a station, their just pixels I have no use for, my question is to the people with mules and stuff, yep it's cool to have a load of stuff and gazillion caps but to what end do you need them what do you/they do with all the caps?
---
It's called a workshop.  there is no in game label saying "pvp zone" if you wanna get technical you can pvp anywhere as long as the other person fights back.  griefing is messing with another player who is just minding their own business so yes it fits.  your comparison to fortnite however tells me everything i need to know about you
---
I tried but not work. I can’t even rename the second weapon, I can only rename the same one
---
If you survive fine in excavator continue using it.
---
Gimme a shout if you wanna shoot the shit one day. I'm a master crafter too, if you ever need anything. Got some spare PA and other gear with your name on it! GT JaggersLips13
---
Nope, nothing. Killed so many ghouls at White Springs, feral and otherwise. Can't collect any more blood.
---
guessing that is legacy nowadays, I really wish I could find an explosive flamer :(
---
im not saying remove the pvp entirely im agreeing with the op that you should be able to surrender it.  why would you need to continuously kill someone who isnt fighting back?  because you lack the skill to kill someone who is?
---
You're "Progman"?
---
I used the wiki information:
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gauss\_shotgun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gauss_shotgun)
---
Are you sure the base damage of the gauss shotgun is 288? Are the other Gauss weapon wrong as well?
---
Oh the site doesn't calc explosive damage right now. I forgot to meantion that. So the explosive damage from the shotgun won't be added in the calculation. The demo is for heavy exlosive weapon
---
Actually yes, I do fine in it.
---
Alloyed heavy metal or PA + SS Hunters combat knife or (perhaps ironically), a DCG w/extra claw usually takes care of them in short order.
---
I had 1000 scrip and didn’t get anything of value.  Done with the sale
---
They just need to bring back survival and remove all PvP form adventure.
---
He is a lonely boy
---
unlucky
---
I tried to rename it one by one from my stash box. But it ends up doing the same. I can only use A whatever A or B I equip
---
I have to ask this, with no judgement did you d00p these weapons. That as been known to cause issues like this. 
---
If not I have no idea sorry, never had a problem renaming weapons or armour.
---
I literally check out every camp I think looks cool, Im a big fan of big brain camps
---
But I am le tired
---
I am to dumb for this. It needs simpler interface where I just plot in stuff :P
---
So at level 300+ all slots are open straight away?
---
No problem then? :D Keep it!
---
I mean, I don't know what to tell you. It works for me.
---
Judging off of his answer I would say yes.
---
Glass caverns
---
deposits around any fissure.
---
In a nuke zone, some iron deposits turn to ultracite.
---
scorchbeast wing and bones.
---
No I didn’t d00p these weapons. I had one before and I just got another one, this problem appears then
---
Haven't tried Avengers, is it fun? What style of game is it?
---
Is it broken?
---
Not really a risk, I am pissed that my collection will be common as hell now. The biggest annoyance hough is the fact that they keep reusing the same crap over and over again, tying it into a new event and not giving us new rewards.
---
Yeah, I feel you
---
I rolled one of those a few days ago. Things hilarious to use and I have no perks for autos. It's mostly a pvp gun though isn't it?
---
That's really not a good feeling when one, with his/her all weapons broken, can do nothing but run away and retrieve others....
---
Or, just a thought, the person who doesn't want to fight can leave or, another thought, don't take the zone if you can't/don't want to pvp or, yet another, expect it so you won't be caught of guard.
---
Why should the game give a SECOND way to opt out of the pvp you agreed to and the pvp that the other
---
players came to engage in?
---
Id say it is. I haven't put thought into mutations but I'd prefer to not be a glass cannon, more balanced. I have a main who is a 2h melee and heavy guns so I'm also trying to keep away from that :P.
---
No, it doesn’t work even when I fully repair both of them
---
Yup. But that's clearly a robot. So Troubleshooters will help me there.
---
It literally warns you it is a pvp zone when you take it, lol, and you have to agree to the pvp to take the zone.... How is it not a pvp zone?
---
The area gives faster resources AT THE RISK OF pvp.
---
Remove pvp, you remove the risk and the zone no longer works as designed/intended.
---
It's a high risk/high reward pvp zone, named Workshops.
---
I used fortnite as an example of what you sound like.... I won't touch that trash if that's what you're, incorrectly, implying.
---
No it wasn't lmao codes reset on Monday they promised a fix that night. Nukes are the endgame we were without endgame for 48 hours it's honestly unacceptable
---
You can totally redeem scrip as much as you want.
---
There is no limit on spending scrip.  The cap is on how much scrip you can own.  
---
If I have 1000 scrip and I spend 300, I can then go buy 300 from Smiley.  Now I'm at 1000.  I can then go spend upto 1000 right away if I want.  I can then turn in items to get upto 150 more scrip per day and either redeem right away or save up again.
---
How valuable is a Q/ffr/250dr?
---
This would be an alternative website:
---
 [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Why do you have this posted 3 times? Within 3 mins of each other?
---
I was wondering this too. Got done in by a cultist today, assaultron (X3) and a Super Mutant I am properly equipped etc.
---
That only applies to weapons added since wild Appalachia (fixer, bear hand, gold bullion weapons etc). All of the OG weapons will drop whether you learned the plan or not.
---
Can't help then sorry, last thing I would suggest take both weapons out of your stash box, make sure they are in working condition. Then rename the first one, click right thumb stick (PS4) to sort the list by different attributes. Then find the second weapon and give it a different name and cycle back through the sort options.
---
Can't tell if you're joking or not.
---
I dont stick around workshops once I capture them.  
---
Get the plans and XP, credit for whatever challenge, then begone.   For defend events, stay outside the zone and use a sniper rifle to pick off the NPCs.  
---
If someone else come in, they have to kill off the NPCs before they can tke the workshop.  (and you get credit for completing an event.
---
usually, the mats are faster to acquire by looting than waiting for the processors.
---
No sorry, if you get on a private server it's supposed to work. I did it on an alt a couple weeks ago and had no issue.
---
I put on alts.  I redeemed 5000 scrip on five characters yesterday.  100 three star weapons.  Got two god rolls.
---
Being able to buy more scrip is not creating a problem.
---
I thought the same only to discover a full set of heavy leather troubleshooter didn't stop him from melting me and other 3 people at the same time 🤣
---
Not trying to be a dick. Didn't know if you knew you had 3 exact posts up
---
Thanks for your excelent work
---
Yup, that's me! 
---
Rifle is correct, but Gauss Shotgun is 231; didn't realize the one I was looking at was Primed. Minigun is correct.
---
Sorry my phone had some problem, I deleted them
---
I had the same problem, had to server hop a lot, finally a private server let me do it. I did the fuse after the PC that time. Not sure if it made the difference.
---
The powerful auto and prime receiver are also missing the dust cover in 76. None of the auto receivers have one :(
---
I didn’t know and I deleted them when I realised it sorry man
---
Thanks man!
---
Do the Collision course event at Morgantown airport.
---
in the cargo drop, you should get a melee weapon, a rifle, a pistol, some aid items, and a few other things.
---
Rofl, this!
---
Make friends, I just gave away a white springs jumpsuit because I can't be assed to deal with trade subs. Also I think it's ugly.
---
It's happened like 4 times now, Bethesda pushes an update or hot fix and next thing you know you're playing FO4 on Survival mode and everything kills you. 
---
It's much more noticeable without Lone Wanderer on since that card is basically useless now.
---
Look i must say, it's fun indeed. It's your typical looter shooter type of gamestyle but much more linear in terms of selecting your own missions on what to day, matchmaking and etc. But they have a lot of issues to fix indeed.
---
The idea, combat and mechanics when it works.. IT WORKS  and it's a lot of fun. Should definitely check out some gameplays. I have had a lot of fun indeed, i just had to put it down due to progress loss from bugs and glitches (hoping they fix that asap).
---
This just happened to me and i used 2 plasma cores on a anti armor gattling plasma
---
I swear if I log and and start getting chased by a fucking psycho ghoul in clown costume I will hunt you down and pour cold custard down your trousers OP.
---
Yup, just finished my 15 minute game of turning in the daily treasury notes and scripping the junk weapons from the day before, then shut it off after two more crap perv rolls.  Can't even get any more scrip because the dailies don't reset for another few hours.  This will go on for days, as I had like 500 saved up for this sale.  How freaking exciting.  Off to play something else that isn't metered and time gated, I guess.
---
dam, no idea.  im little confused on your wording also when you say you equip one and it shows you equip both.  not exactly sure what you mean by this.  are the guns showing stacked in your inventory?  like does it show "your gun (2)" in ur pipboy?
---
That... Is disheartening...
---
No apologies. Just didn't know if you knew haha!
---
phone prob bugged on him.  its happens
---
This was never meant to be a ”begging” post. But I’m thankful for all the kindness. And I repeat what many before me has said. This is such a nice gameforum. You are the best, I hope it will rain Atoms over you💙
---
Wow thanks man for your work! Thanks to you I could reconstruct the right damage calculation!
---
Okay I changed it to 231. I take your word for it ;)
---
Could you try other weapon without explosive und melee?
---
It's a lot more disheartening when you make a set thinking it's useful just to grind it back to scrip piece to piece :')
---
T-51b has the best DR
---
Cheers bud! Didn't mean to sound like you were asking for help. But if you ever fancy tagging along with someone, gimme a shout! Tuesday should be pretty fun!
---
Server hop if you're noticing an overwhelming pattern.
---
Not gonna happen. It is basic game-publishing: If you make a online game, it must have PvP. Once it is done it is cheap and offers more or less endless replayability.
---
PvE Content on the other side is much more work (Story/lore, quests, npcs, design) and very often doesnt offer any kind of replayability so the devs are forced constantly to keep working and adding new stuff.
---
We were supposed to be able to save our workshops on private world, so it would be nice if they kept that promise. 
---
Workshops could be more like the settlements from Fallout 4 if they didn't evaporate every time you stop playing
---
I’m not sure if legacy Tesla break the game it’s just shooting explosive bullets it’s really underwhelming to me
---
When I equip either one in my pip boy, both of my weapons are shown equipped and the one I’m holding is exactly the same one because I can see the ammo left in that magazine. I’m not able to switch to the one I want.
---
Hory sheet mang....
---
I have been inspired by the great community to try to help out new folks whenever possible. As such I have set up shop just north of the overseer's house on the train tracks. Built my camp like a little train station and I keep my prices dirt cheap. I honestly couldn't tell you if many low levels stop by, but I'm there if they need it.
---
Dilute them with purified water at chemistry stations.
---
Lookin more awesome than ever. Amazing stuff 😍
---
The player is clearly insane.
---
Either rifleman/commando or shotgun are solid early on. Heavy weapons is great too but he has to be at least lvl 25 to start using those weapons.
---
Just sent an invite :) ign TheQuantumWizard
---
Looks amazing! I can hear the wind and the crackle of the flames.
---
Yeah I get that. When OP did it it just felt more natural since he was specifying the type of drive the Xbox was going to have in his assessment of the benefits of the next gen console for the game. It didn't feel so much like product placement lol
---
Only some variants stealth is disabled. This one has the freezing modifier. There might be some that have freezing enemies and stealth disabled?? Stealth even when it's higher stat can still be dicey around robots tho
---
Every star should give you 1 module if you scrap it. Also just up the module amount when you craft to 3 modules. Then people who play more and find more legendarys also have more benefit because they deserve that. I just logged on for 7minutes to scrip items. Get 1400 caps and turn in 20 treasury notes just to complete my daily gaming. Have enough to do that for almost a week. Or maybe that is the benefit for long gaming sessions but still people who play longer should get extra
---
You’d be surprised how many people aren’t mutated even at the 100+ stage.
---
You can probably get one with red asylum dress or responder fireman outfit and hat other than that you’ll need atleast a god roll weapon to trade
---
Not one shot but definitely extra squishy. I've also noticed my ap regen boosts aren't working properly, had to check I actually had my armour on.
---
That's not quite true. They advertised several features that have not been added yet,. Some people subscribed based on the advertised features that have yet to appear.

if u have plan of cutting fluid or u know how to get it pls let me know. Thx
---
I have a strange suspicion that the person may not have wanted to sell that, instead thought he would show it off thinking it would be impossible for someone to buy it.
---
2600 views?  Seems like either no one cares or the player base is pretty small.
---
Appalachia hasn’t been booming lately so this is great news.
---
Do u have T- 60 PA plans,  not the modification just the power armor itself. I really need them. Pls let me know if u have them. Thx
---
Excuse? Two Shot Vampire??
---
This update just demonstrates how badly designed this game is. There were already only a few viable ranged builds and now it's getting even worse.
---
Working on this project must be so soul crushing. Knowing that even after the game's embarrassingly bad launch, most of the effort has been to slowly turn a beloved RPG into more and more of a gotcha mobile game clone. Think of trying to sell this update knowing that it was just yet another low effort method to try to drag out the play time of the few people still playing the game.
---
"Hey guys, you asked for meaningful end game content and new areas to explore, well how about you try out time gated challenges using the same locations and enemies you've already seen?? Oh and by the way, we just arbitrarily collectively nerfed most play style builds just because!"
---
I sure will! My GT: xSix10x
---
Ya thats annoying when it says some one has like 400 plans but they all the same. Thats why I try to not have any dups in my vending machines and have them for 25 caps or less.
---
I saw this and thought "oh fuck yeaaaah daddy gonna get presents [creepy on purpose] but you're on xbone.... Hold one moment
---
Well they are bringing out 3 new weapons a melee one, whistle in the dark (not whisper) and another one, but yea i can understand your frustration if u traded legacies for it
---
It's not useless. You just have to not be a part of a team. It's still a thing, you know.
---
Plan is obtained from Daniel at Anchor Farms near vault 76 after killing the free radicals leader. Its a 25% drop chance? Could be wrong on the % chance but it's a unique one. You might want to seek a trading platform to find one as this subreddit isn't usually used for trading
---
If one of your char is lvl 300+, you'll have all 6 slots unlocked across all of your alt. within your account.
---
Or beth could do something about the problem such as, fix it and make it droppable or remove it from game as its unintended.
---
The ones that’s just glitched punji boards and they just edit it so you fall into them is not fun other than that I respect others that actually takes time to make
---
Is Ripley inside there?
---
-
---
*Get away from her you... Biiitch!*
---
Well there was a rather large outcry from a section of the pkayerbase that felt they should have been given all of those things for free. That's probably why they're hesitant to add any more features at the moment.
---
Add shadyrebob on xbox. You can hop on anytime!!
---
Both melee and heavy guns benefit from high strength, so start here:
---
Im melee/auto rifle, but also switch to heavies for certain critters, so kee a few perks equipped for them.
---
15 base STR.  Motion Assist servos on your PA (+2 STR).  Marsupial (+2? STR)
---
SS shielded underarmor (+4 STR, +4 and +2 on 2 other specials), or BoS shielded underarmor if you dont have SS.
---
WWR and Ammo WR armor
---
Bandolier1 (reduced ammo weight),  bear Arms (reduced weapon weight),  One Gun Army (DMG), incisor3 (armor penetration), martial artist3 (swing speed), barbarian.
---
Tank killer3 (Ballistic armor penetration)
---
Stabilized3 (ballistic accuracy)
---
Twisted muscles gives 25% melee damage but takes a large chunk of ballistic accuracy, so you will need at least
---
Class freak2
---
to offset it
---
batteries included and power user (fusion core weight reduction and longevity)
---
consider healing factor mutation.  Will cut down on the number of stimpacks you need to carry.
---
Vampire weapons.  I can go nose to nose with a SB and a vampire gatling, and never lose health.
---
Or if it lands... ive taken out more than one with a vampire switchblade....
---
Try that out and see what it does for you ;)
---
You only get 1 of them from crater after you initially do both of them
---
All aboard the nocturnal rolling pin train!!
---
Same thing happens to me, would like to know as well
---
The weapon was in the machine to brag &amp; tease anyone who saw it, it wasn't for sale at all and dude probably max capped the former owner and they probably lost atleast 10k in caps on the weapon. 99.9% of ppl who spend exactly 30K on something 100% used duped large gifts to do so....if they claim they didn't...they are lying.
---
🙏🏻
---
I think they alternate every day.
---
A few of my character that are around Lvl 200 have all of the plans and such that can be purchased from non-player vendors, if I have over 25,000 caps I usually disable my vendors and re-open them once I’m back down to 20,000 or so. I have never purchased bullion from Smiley and don’t need all of the serum recipes so until there’s something new to buy I’m not super concerned about earning caps. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
A well done trap camp is art. 
---
The punji board thing shows a lack of creativity. I except more from my trap camps, griefers, and scammers.
---
100% honestly didn’t even think of shotguns 😂 and they work well with heavy gunner.
---
The Plan Collectors Discord: https://discord.gg/RCDahF
---
These were also the guys who helped get the price check plan tool added to Fed76
---
you mean at Tanagra?
---
I'm my experience, it is 5 minutes before the world is lost if no one is in it still. If there is another player who is not a 1st subscriber, then they get a 20 minute shutdown warning after 5 minutes.
---
Just wow
---
No didn't trade anything rare or overly valuable for them, its just they keep rehashing event rewards and its getting annoying. Take the Halloween rewards from last year, no doubt all of those will be available again in a few weeks time. 
---
They want to keep the game fresh for old players as well as providing loot for new players. By reusing the same rewards over and over its starting to feel like they dont care about the long term dedicated players that have given the game so much love.
---
I wonder if they shun the guy at Atlas Observatory and he gets the Enclave rolling again.  It would be a cool plot twist!
---
Same, have had an time where I did 2 SBQ back to back, was using a .50cal and did more than enough damage, but got no loot both times. There was something going on on that server, as I also didn't get the event pop up for Scorched Earth.
---
Sever hopped and did another nuke, got the event, got rewards.
---
I wish people would help me. I keep on getting attacked.
---
Top tier, any gamma or tesla with quad is top notch.
---
Yep although not all scammers have the IQ to make a trap base even if it’s simple I’ve seen some pretty dumb scammers
---
I think it means the remnants of the BOS that got their ass kicked by SB's (are there any left? We know Taggerdy died) come back. Fractured being descriptive of the condition they're in. I'm sure steel dawn the BoS will be introduced in much better shape. 
---
The BoS don't really get along with most. Not with Grahm, not with raiders, not with sentient ghouls, forced cooperation at gun point with settlers but will they form an uneasy alliance? I can kind of seeing it with even the raiders. 
---
I know there were the outcasts, a group that splintered off of the BoS but I don't think this will be about them.
---
Has he actually tried talking to Daniel? I got the plan long after I finished up the Wastelanders quests. I had just never talked to him again and had no idea he even had stuff to give me.
---
Those weapons can still come back as legendary drops.
---
Thx a lot I will tell my friend about this information. Btw do u know any of trading platform for fallout 76?
---
His wife probably has a walk in closet bigger than your house. Give the guy a break.
---
True but still seems like a waste as being in a team is more useful with bonus Int, event xp etc
---
I still use it. I prefer to wander alone.
---
Just goes to show...ppl can't handle truth...that's the truth...ill leave all your Noob punk asses down in the mine with Earle destined to lose if I catch someone using a Tesla during the fight....you bitches gotta listen somehow some way....or get abandoned and lose.
---
What about junkies ffr? I've got a gamma one, I was going to scrip it today lol.
---
Agreed. 
---
My first and only scammer, back when I was trusting and naive, took the weapon, backed out of the trade window, and dropped a bag. 
---
Inside was a "You Have Been Insulted". 
---
A true artist.
---
They alternate daily.
---
So lucky, the best Bear Arm I’ve rolled is Vampire. 😅
---
Cheers captain! You on tonight? I need to gather some materials, then prob Nuke somewhere...
---
I really just want to see more active conflict between the different in game factions, maybe with unique items/rrwards for siding with/supporti g the various groups.
---
Basically this, its such trash whenever I use it I just think why? It takes so long even after the "buff" I feel like Im falling behind by using it, grind junk is a lot faster.
---
Ah ok thank you. Do you know if you need to spend the cash yourself, or can someone who has, invite you to theirs?
---
If you click on my profile you'll see the platform I use. It has a karma and courier system to make trading safer. It has ps4 xb1 and PC users on it. Give it a look I highly recommend it.
---
What would you say to them?
---
Anyone who has it can invite you
---
That’s something that should be done in pvp I saw a scammer that scammed somebody then go on and make a new post like nothing happened he never got to do an other trade or bother making a new account and he scammed the dude for a piece or armor people these days
---
Can confirm. 1.2M caps on all characters, about 50 hacked weapons. Thousands of holiday gifts for quick cap refills.
---
No.  Just fucking no.  Don't use reddit articles written by some whiny idiot to back up your bullshit.
---
they were whining that 1st doesn't come with features that either weren't even being offered yet or had been replaced by better shit.
---
The exclusive discounts?  They replaced those with actually just giving you the shit for free every month.  That's where those monthly freebies came from, they  tried selling people the first ranger reskin and everyone lost their fucking minds because they DESERVED to get the reskin for free. So Bethesda backtracked, gave it to everyone free and has been giving all of that shit out free ever since.  Then later on they went and started offering actual discounts on stuff in the atom shop which people STILL complained about because they were too stupid to realize they were even there because they weren't plastered on the front of the shop.
---
Everything beyond that was fucking spitballing and theorizing on future additions to the program.  None of it was given details or expected release time frames let alone actually fucking advertised.  Anyone who subscribed to a monthly service on the idea that months or years later they might add something with zero details otherwise is a fucking moron.
---
X01 isnt really a grind to get and will perform a lot better in a nuke zone, but other than that there isnt much difference in the best vs the worst.
---
This beats the 1* furious rolling pin i have for 30k just so... No one buys out all my inventory and hacks into my stash.
---
I'm level 491 and this is mainly why I don't have my vending machine out.
---
Tonight can be hard. My little one refuse to sleep.
---
20 hours*
---
The 33 VATS LMG is probably triggering the "magic" weapon damage bug.
---
Tryed that removed me from the instance byt he was in one on his own it did say there were lile 2 other players there but neither were in the mine for both of us
---
Spot on. The only time you’ll see both active at the same time after that initial occurrence is if you start one but don’t finish it before the 8pmET reset. Then you can technically have both running. But it will still average out to one per day.
---
I guess some like trading. For me, I'm just such a noob that I don't know what I want to spec for yet. Kinda got stuck with strength at the moment so I may go junkie / heavy / tank
---
It only takes 1 module to create a piece of 3\* SS armor , and 2 Modules for a 3\* weapon.
---
If they did do this then it would need to be a % chance, they could for example do it this way.
---
1\* = 10% chance of 1 module.  
---
2\* = 50% chance of 1 module, 20% chance of a 2nd module.  
---
3\* = 90% chance of 1 module, 50% chance of a 2nd module.  
---
\*edit...\* revised costings for % chance, this is Bethesda after all..  
---
1\*=3%  
---
2\*=20%/3%  
---
3\*=40%/5%
---
Probably Hunters but I haven't tested it.
---
Both times it bugged on me I just kept hopping servers. First time took me nine hops, second time took four. Just run to the computer and try to analyze the sample. If it doesn't work, quit, load, and try again. (The only workaround is having enough patience to hammer away at it until it works.)
---
The north-facing entrance of the hospital is the closest to the terminal, to save you a bit of time.
---
Hope that helps, and good luck.
---
Don't bother. You can do more damage with a gauss shotgun. The only thing legacy harpoon guns have going for them is generating their own ammo, but even that's going to be pointless once everybody starts running the Ammo Factory legendary perk Tuesday.
---
Search for limb damage bug and "magic" weapons, angry turtle has some good explicative video, is related with fire rate and how it's send to to the server, also effective in multiprojectile weapons like harpoon with flechette mod or shotguns.
---
So holding back from buying all those plans has been a useless exercise of self control? Aw. 😐
---
Anyone want a full nocturnal load out? Half price.
---
I have a buddy you should meet u/kung-fu-Magik 
---
He gave me permission to introduce you. He is good peeps
---
Edit: i can't help cause ps4 i am but hes an xbone user :) hope this helps :D
---
Say what you want about the game, but the FO76 community is awesome and super generous.
---
It does. Press "triangle" to extract it. You may need to server hope to complete the year. Did this yesterday on my alt I'm prepping for Season 2.
---
Aw! HaHa. Wee cutie. Are you EU? I'm Scotland.
---
I do think dailies are kinda messed up..
---
Three days in a row now I've gotten Lucky Mucker and Dross Toss, but not The Chow Line. I've tried talking to Zoe, tried eating a hotdog, spam the A button on the paper towel roll, and nothing will trigger it.
---
For mobs no.
---
For bosses yes
---
The percentages for the perks/effects you listed are not additive, if they were you would be invulnerable (132%).
---
Lets say the imposter hits you for 500 raw damage (made up number):
---
Lone wanderer takes off 20%, 400 damage remains
---
Blocker takes off 45% of 400, 220 remain
---
PA takes off 42% of 220, 106 remain
---
Psycho takes off 25% of 106, 80 damage remain
---
There might be a hard cap on %based Damage reduction around 80% (that would be 100 damage in the example above), not sure if this value stored somewhere in my mind is correct.
---
The Imposters attacks are special anyway, no idea if AP or something else is factored in.
---
That's pretty cool. Get out the mouth harp!
---
**It's a kinda magic** - ~~Queen~~ - Angry Turtle.
---
They undersold that by quite a bit. As a low-health explosive energy weapon fiend, I am salivating over this. Congrats on the find!
---
How about an option for Fallout 4 D-pad, I'd much rather use that
---
I still use it.
---
  Season1 is over, 2 has not started...And I’m high enough level that the bonus XP doesn’t really make much difference.
---
Of course, That’ll change when season2 starts, as public teams do help a lot (or are required) for some of the score challenges.
---
Plot twist: that'll be me chasing you
---
You don't need the blood again. The game knows you put it in, and the terminal will recognize it. Eventually. :/
---
Keep any bloodied/junkies/two shot FFR gamma guns you have, they wreak havoc on bloodied builds.
---
Tesla’s are top notch
---
I'm confused to, I have 3 weapons add the same for testing and one become broken I restored but don't worked tried again and the same unequipped from favourites and altered the server weapon in the same position, it happens to me a lot to confuse them now I understand why
---
And suddenly everyone has god tier weapons and Bethesda's plans for re-balancing the difficulty is screwed over, and game play goes out the window because there's no challenge at all.
---
I think it’s more about sinking perks into demo expert, when they could probably be used better elsewhere...your mileage may vary
---
Didnt know you could get under the rusty pick... sounds interesting. I'll check it out!
---
No doubt!
---
Hey,If ya ever need anything,&amp; see me on PLEASE DONT HESITATE!!
---
Too friend me,join me,message either here or Xbox!
---
If I’m able,I would be glad to help In any way I can!!
---
I got 2 little ones &amp; a wife also,
---
&amp; usually play wit headphones,sometimes mic’ed up,sometimes not.
---
Heck,tomorrow’s my day off,so If ya see me on,please join up,I’d gladly let cha look through my drops from the purveyor/other 2 characters...
---
They’re all on my Mule now,but if ya wanted any of em,they’re yours
---
Stay blessed yo
---
I don't pvp though. I'll keep the Tesla because it's great for running xp runs. What platform are you on?
---
Thank you alot of Folks just constant complaining about Tesla's  dont use it here or there.op just needs to enjoy it.hell of a find!
---
True, though not for everyone. OP wants his cake &amp; eat it.
---
How do you fix it?
---
This is true.
---
Oh god not one of these guys again. Get over it man. Who cares what we "agreed" to? Nobody wants to do pvp. Like others have said we take workshops for challenges and maybe some mats but that's it. I can see the pvp weenies crying because they can't ambush someone because now the owner can just avoid it all together. And no its not because I or someone else "got played" or needs to "git good" or knew what we "agreed" to. Nobody just wants to deal with it. You want death match? Go play nuclear winter or call of duty. Heck go play Fortnite.
---
Only 3 accounts? Come on part-timer.
---
PS4 why
---
Can confirm. I have them both active for a few weeks now. Since completing the Run, just a quick login for me, couple times a week for Wayward Gold, Module and Atom Store. Tuesday I'll resume proper play. ;) Wasteland 3 is amazing... Buggy as fuck, but amazing.
---
Yep it’s fun to use it for a bit but I wish it still had its chain effect that’ll be 1000x better and more fun to use
---
Max-HP healing bug and insta-death are both gone, or will be with the next update. (Can't remember which)
---
Down with BoS!
---
I can give you the gamma gun for scrip equivalent. I won't use it and the people I play with use TS and E weapons. Also things I hate lol.
---
Hey, I'm just one guy so feel free to cross-check. But I thought of making a second character for fixer rolls and read multiple places it wouldn't work that way.
---
You get over it, lol. You agreed.
---
Pvp or don't take it and complain.
---
FYI, I don't take them to avoid pvp, I literally avoid pvp, so, no, not a pvp weenie. Lol. You guys like making assumptions, lmao.
---
I just understand the game being played and what the area is designed for and don't complain when someone better then me outplays me.
---
So, pve weenie maybe?
---
And even if you're just there for Mats, there's other ways free from VP if you're there for challenges the challenges are optional it's still a PVP zone.
---
i'll try and server hop between retries and report back. I've tried twice prior to this.
---
And it's easy to get a magic shotgun. I got an instigating at lvl 15 while I was leveling my heavy weapons. It was a breeze leveling him.
---
How much scrip you want
---
Sadly, there are a ton of dupes of these, so the person selling it probably has quite a few more.
---
I sell all plans 10 caps regardless of what it is.
---
ill give it a shot thank you
---
In my opinion, each class of weapon needs it's own niche. Not everything should cripple or stagger or be the best at Vats...
---
Pistols could have the lowest Vats cost and best crit ratio, allowing for some real strong gunfu on nearby hordes.
---
Shotguns could be cripple specialist, dealing A-tier dmg at a moderate rate at mid range. Mid AP cost 
---
Rifles could do the S+tier single point damage at slow rate with innate execute bonuses. High AP cost.
---
Auto pistols could get bonus damage multipliers to target's back. Short range burst.
---
Auto rifles could be generalist, and deal a small percentage of a targets current hp per shot. Allows excellent setup for single fire rifle executes.
---
Heavy guns could stagger and create suppression.
---
Make explosives worth. Aoe damage for the cost of inventory weight must be equitable.
---
And BURNING, could let it do a percentage of targets max hp (cannot stack sources)
---
And could apply some similar metrics to melee... One handed cripple, 2 hand execute, unarmed tenderize.
---
Today there's no need for a team, everyone is everything, so a "best" floats to the top.  And that diminishes the power of choice. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
---
You can carry more in excavator than you can in x01.
---
im 241, and excavator is my goto.  Nuke zones, SBQ, RR, no matter - still protects me quite well.
---
Prior to obtaining ss armor, deep pocketed Alloyed heavy metal with WR on each piece (ammo, junk, weapons, aid), AP regen on one, chameleon on one. And the high capacity backpack.
---
have the same setup with my SS armor.
---
I’ve tested the limits - out of PA, I can goto about 1430# before I crawl.  In Excavator, its 1820.
---
X01, T51, etc, run/crawl limit is 1430
---
Fire rate is like AA, there are no perks or builds necessary to make them effective, thus they are more efficient.
---
MCTaxed
---
Just got a Instigating Combat Shotgun oh, and it's magic. All yours.
---
I am a believer in it has always been, and will continue to be, a preference thing. Explosive has always been great for crowd control due to AOE damage. FFR has been king for a long time with bosses and pure damage output and I dont see that changing. I used to be stubborn and run explosive with demo expert exclusively but have since dropped demo expert and use explosive for farming and crowds and switch to FFR when I need to sustain damage. Can't see that changing. However, limb damage is often overlooked and is quite good.
---
Man you have stolen my heart, I only miss you are on Xbox don't worry sure you will find some really nice people in that awesome game.
---
I remember when I made a post like you when I was 80+ (I'm not father), then I meet a guy who helped me a lot and now I'm lvl 290 and we when we are all the gang (4 people) Appalachia burns I enjoy this game like a child :)
---
Just the 40. It's a 3 star but I think the last one is E
---
Yea welcome to gaming in 2020, however they give ESO online more love thats def true
---
True.
---
Do you mean fucked? Are you 12?
---
You can't, when it happens I usually unequip all weapons of the kind and I equip them back, but if you change server there is a chance to be back again
---
I do 99% of all recipes for 1 cap. They sell at a decent rate and I like helping the noobs out/people who don't have all the recipes.
---
All limb damage does is help cripple them, it doesn’t actually do more damage by shooting limbs. And you said FFR was better for sustained damage, it’s actually not unless you’re sneaking or fighting bosses. Explosive does more DPS because of demo expert, and it also uses less ammo meaning you will have to reload less, meaning more sustained damage.
---
Wouldn't expect one any time soon, at least not until after the instanced camp interiors comes out. (which is probably somewhere in the winter or beyond)
---
First born, or a kidney. I’d also accept human molars.
---
Can't bring myself to play ESO, I fear my girlfriend would leave me if I started going down that rabbit hole.
---
Sweden here😊
---
.
---
Don't drop, put in containers.
---
I don't keep up with the updates as I'm relatively new still only been playing around a month. But they are going to make camp interiors instanced? That'll be interesting to see, curious how it would work
---
AFAIK, the only way you “permanently” lose a camp item is if a teammate built/placed it, you scrap it, and you do not have the plan to recraft it.
---
If you store said item, you will be able to re-place it, but it will still consume budge when stored
---
Excuse me while I go cry in a corner.
---
If interiors do come out I can remove my double wall interiors that's good but I don't think that will solve my camp problem unless they make display cases not cost budget and vending machines then yes I can see my problem being solved
---
The LMG is just a good gun, that’s why you’re able to kill stuff quick but not bosses. The .50 cal is triggering that weird “magic” or whatever effect that everyone thinks is so amazing nowadays because they can’t make a proper build
---
That's even prettier than last time! Great job!
---

---
Under fractured steel in the winter.
---
I don’t think lube is going to help, *at all*
---
You got lucky, make em count!
---
Another player put it in there, it's good place to dump stuff that new players could use.
---
Enjoy your gift from another player.
---
I mean as soon as I scrap something my build budget is at full still so I cant get that thing back unless I scrap everything which is a no go
---
I am keeping my secondary character for the next SCORe run. I have no idea what the weapon she leant me was. It was either super rare or legacy. I thanked the gun and returned it when I outranked it.
---
Thank it worked, I updated the main post about how/why it works.
---
Recipes always sell for 50 caps.
---
Hey I think I know this song
---
You still get double the rolls per day so double the chances to get what you want. If you just want to throw half the rejects on the floor afterwards you are in the same position you would had been in but still with double the chances.
---
Nice! I'm usually on pretty late, cheers!
---
This did end up working thanks, i edited the post with a quote from someone who explains why it works
---
Tomorrow I’m gonna just stay on a private server and see if it matters doubt it though
---
I'm sorry that a free service that you don't need to use and isn't run by the game developers was broken for a few days but that reaction is kinda shitty. At any point you could have gone abiut solving the code for yourself instead of relying on others
---
That season has ended. A new one starts next week.  For now you can only claim rewards, not make progress
---
Hey Balaban, I am on Ps4 and probably could help you with some Ultracite plans. What in particular are you looking for weapons or armor, such as Power armor?
---
This is the way.
---
I'm lvl 412 on pc and have done every single Colossal Problem event that I could, and I've seen a grand total of one person with magical weapon and even then he waited until Earl evolved to blast him down. Where are all these phantom magic weapon users y'all talking about? You know what I see plenty though? AFKers there and this is going to make it even worse.
---
Trap camps are the best. Especially the ones that look sketchy and there’s some player giving you the follow me emote to head inside.
---
(AND CUCUMBERS)
---
Have you done ACP when someone uses a Tesla?  The FPS goes down to 5.
---
I go to white springs train and stash all my plans in a trash can or suitcase
---
Hopefully I will have a couple of hours game time tomorrow! Would be be great to join you and learn. I will add you on Xbox🙏🏻
---
do you ever use sneak?
---
Thanks, I didn't know what the dates for the season were.
---
To be fair. Prob time to switch servers. Old worlds can go stale and glitchy ;)
---
\*watches Angry Turtle videos\*
---
\*thinks back to making Gauss Miniguns\*
---
\*thinks about those Stalkers, Bashing Damage miniguns he scrapped\*
---
No problem. It would make more sense if it did actually save you weight but unfortunately it doesn't.
---
This has been my biggest issue with Public Teams lol. I love them but there will be me in a team with 1 person and 2 other teams of 1 or 2 with the same boost. Makes no sense to me why they start a new team.
---
You jest, but that's exactly why developers are hesitant to get in front of a camera and talk to people in the first place.
---
So if you know all of this why post a topic asking for opinions? 
---
I said I use FFR for sustained damage on bosses. Although, lately I have been using 50crit and enjoying it. Yes, I know how explosive works with the perks. Likewise, I also know that freeing up 5 points is huge when it really doesn't do much anymore (laughable compared to launch). However, I still use explosive with certain primary effects because I feel it works better. 
---
Limb damage is not just for crippling though. Yes it does that well but it provides a damage boost when sustaining hits on a certain limb. The bonus is it cripples faster. Forget all the "magic" talk and limb damage is still very strong regardless of the weapon. Is it the best? Probably not. It is not junk though and works better than most think.
---
I'm al so stuck on this lol.
---
I dunno about damage...bc I rip through most enemies with both.  But explosive weapons break way too fast.  So I prefer my frr ones. 
---
Plus  the 5 demo perk points is way too much tied up in a lil more damage.
---
Wait wearing an armor piece with "Reduced Damage while blocking"? Is that a bug? Doesn't seem logical. 
---
It already does at least 2x+ damage in VATS vs ADS/hipfire for me, without this. It's going to do even more?
---
I have done this multiple times. Just remember to “Pay It Forward”.
---
The other raider daily you can do every day is to turn in mirelurk meat. Idt there a quest for it, you just get meat and give it to the raider chick. Not allot of faction points but every bit helps
---
If anyone is ever on a server with thatguyincadpat in it, I sell all the plans that I've previously learned for a cap a piece
---
I sell guns and rare plans only. If it sits in my vendor for a bit I drop price big time or give away.
---
I just wasted all my scrip the other day, and didn't get ANYTHING good, and now I'm finding out there's a sale? For reference I had around 1k total that I spent.
---
Stealth is disabled on all daily ops currently. There’s 2 active mutations; one is variable, one is always Piercing Gaze (stealth removal). 
---
That may change in the future, but it is what is going on right now.
---
Are you on xbox? If so me and my level 156 friend could help you out when we are on.
---
And joining a team will give you the Herd Mentality bonus, even if you're the only member.
---
Tuesday, then we're all guns blazin'.
---
That's what you get if you want to flex. I bought a quad explosive railway for 30k  from a guy running a trap camp. My brother lent me the caps.
---
Welcome! 👍
---
I do. I found the haunted house to be interesting.
---
Aliens would be great too!
---
The music is what hooked me! I never turn the radio off in any of these games. I can see my dad watching me play, but the most I could ever do was get him to box my mom in Wii sports. 😂
---
Damn hope the rng gods bless me all i want is that disease control unit XD
---
Fuck aye! Have you ever watched "Hunt for the Skinwalker"? All about Skinwalker Ranch.
---
Excavator.  The difference in real world performance of the power armors is small.  The bonuses that the Excavator give you more than make up for the small amount of additional protection the others might give.
---
Troubleshooters will be fine. I run a full set and along with Blocker and a Vamp weapon, I can take 1 pylon and the ISS on no issues.
---
People like you who help us not have to go and search for all the codes are doing God's work keep it up I love you.
---
t65
---
THere are two types of budge limits - overall limit, and a cap on the quantity of specific items you can build.   Stored items count, and IIRC, so do blueprints.
---
  Are you trying to build something that you can only have a limited number of, and you are already at max quantity?
---
Alternately, 
---
At one time, a method of circumventing the budget cap was found.  I don’t know the details, but it I would guess if one of those ways was implemented, if an item was scrapped, and you were still over the budget cap, that might explain it.
---
Kinda like the weight limit - if you go over by 10#, but only drop a 1# item , you are still over max, so you can’t pick up anything else until you drop 9 more # - whether its 9x1# items or a single 9# item makes no difference.
---
Give me your psn, my friend requests are on private so toxic PvPers won’t be able to message me.
---
I appreciate the input but your answer does not make sense to me. I'm sorry.
---
Pen I'm guessing is penalty but how does that work? 10%? 25%? - and what is a debuff?
---
So, the problem is, ya see the extra title on it? Freezing? That fucker shoots Cryolater infused Miniguns. As melee.....
---
It suuuuuuucks.
---
Good luck. Ran like 25 of them on elder, about 15 on paladin and 5 on initiate and I've only gotten one camp plan (box lights) out of it.
---
Kinda same, actually!  It's hard to argue with all the free caps falling from the sky while I do whatever.
---
It’s not
---
typically the quest owner has to kill him, so they can reclaim their stolen item for Ward
---
My thoughts exactly, although may be worth a reconfigure after Legendary perks. We'll see
---
I always say location location...also where your camp is ..High level or low level player traffic then set vendors up to comadate thoses players needs. And you well sell everyday..And move your camp once in a while so the regular buyers May realize you updated your supplies....Just how I do it and I have no Problem selling everything I come across to all Level players ☺
---
As people have mentioned you are achieving ‘magic’ damage with the LMG. Both weapons are actually ‘magic’ weapons, but due the the LMG’s higher base fire rate as well as its higher accuracy it is much easier to get the ‘magic’ effect to trigger with that weapon compared to the 50 cal
---
not having to worry about it is nice.. I wouldnt make a build around it..
---
I take aquaboy/girl
---
It's kit_cloud. I messaged you btw.
---
Arsenic why spoil my hoping on a easy few runs for it XD cheers for the head up though guessing I'm not  gonna see this in my camp for a while
---
Upvoted for generosity and that's a damn good shotgun.
---
It was speculated, early on, that an underwater zone would be added eventually. Or at least a zone that you would need to enter from underwater.
---
Of course that never happened.
---
People also used it in the beginning to map out the entire underwater sections of the map... Which led to the speculation after a few discoveries underwater.
---
Usually it's me on a 2/4 Building team, then someone creates a new 1/4 Building team and my teammate leaves me to join them. :(
---
edit: I know I should follow but when teams start dying, it's time to server hop anyway.
---
I've never drowned in Fallout. Have you?
---
Kör hårt!
---
exploration without wasting a perk card?
---
Depends. If you play by yourself then no. Sadly you'll be the only one on top fighting. If you have a full team crew queen runners the yes. It's not a must but helps a lot and makes everything easier to kill and loot.
---
Oh god please no
---
So... sort of like The Underground for The Division?
---
If yes, then AWESOME
---
Depends.  Frequently over-encumbered?  Excavator with calibrated shocks is best.
---
Always travel light?  X01.
---
Want good protection \_and\_ low repair cost?  T51
---
Completed the vault raid?  T65 (but it takes a lot of bullion to acquire all the plans)
---
That quest has been broken for quite a while.
---
Trust me, nobody is complaining about magic weapons on Earle, I burn him til he regens, kill all adds, burn him another half, kill adds and revive ppl, then finally off him for good....Saves everyone time, ammo, chems....also a chance to Double down on Earles off 1 nuke. Sorry not sorry but he's down in 3 to 5 minutes....certainly not making it a point or goal to fight him for 20 minutes ever.
---
Well in FO4 and farharbor there was alot of hidden underwater stuff you could explore so water breathing was cool there.
---
No real deep water in 76 though unless i'm missing something its all rivers and ponds and such.
---
I'm on PC so I can't help but it looks like these guys have you well covered.  Good luck!
---
I can manage to rearrange for bonus damage for sure. I figured the base 2x damage was good enough. But I guess .5x damage is worth it for 3 points :P
---
I did ponder whether it was a fore or after thought. Thanks for that. Made me think of FO4 underwater scrapped vault.

Here I'll explain I'm basically over the build limit and IDK why. When ever I scrap an object it still says build limit max I scraped 4 items still max build limit and I dont want to remove all my har work or redo my work on my camp it would take 2 days to make the entire thing all over again. And it looks good the way it is which is why I dont want to redo the entire camp
---
Yeah... I have to agree with the other guys, sure it's called a workshop, but there is a big PVP warning on it each time you capture one, griefing would be attacking someone camp not workshop.
---
It was actually broken due to the game itself being broken, so while he couldn't have solved it himself it would've been amusing to watch him try.
---
You’d be surprised actually. While video game devs are well paid they’re on an hourly rate not commission.
---
There’s still a lot of content Bethesda is most likely going to do something with despite not even acknowledging. Sickleman comes to mind. Still hope that there will eventually be something water related. Albeit the large bodies of water in this game is seriously lacking compared to F4
---
Yep, seen this one before. Really makes Appalachia seem alive.
---
I gave a low level player a 3 star weapon and ammo.  Next day he came back and initiated trade.  He put a 1 star script item up for 0 caps and requested a god roll weapon.  Really dude
---
Yes. Then I could assign Quantums to one button!
---
👍👍👍
---
I’d just like a more narrative focused storyline on them. The lore is cool, but I want to explore abandoned mansions and uncover hidden lore. The imposter sheepsquatch was an enjoyable addition, but I’d love if that sort of content was expanded upon!
---
It's odd, the amount of wasted area on previous games and then the emphasis that parts of Fallout 4 gave nautical themes makes me think it's a relic of where they were considering branching out to such things. I honestly hope they do. Bioshock was long ago enough now 😶
---
Single father of two small girls here. I know those feels, man. HMU if you're on PC and ever want a hunting partner who understands the need for emergency AFK when there's a monster under the bed.
---
As a fellow single father I spend a lot of time in Appalachia when I have the time. Such a great community to be a part of. Wish I could help you out, but I'm ps4.
---
Everyone hates OP builds till ACP pops up lol
---
You have a point. I like the harpoon gun tho. I probably won't be going crazy to find a legacy one or anything but I would like to find a good quad harpoon gun or something.
---
Blackwater Mine has secrets.
---
What do you recommend instead of sneak?
---
WELCOME! Got a copy and paste reply. 
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
When you level up you can put a point in a special stat and pick an available card BUT you don't have to pick a card in that special. So you can put a point in STR but then when it comes to picking a card you can cycle through and pick one from INT or LCK or any of them. When you hit 50 you can move a point or pick a specific card every level up so don't panic if you mess up your build.
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. Workshops are pvp zones though. Someone can come and beat you up and steal your lunch money.
---
Everytime you see a workbench get in the habit of scrapping all junk to lighten your load. And then when you see a stashbox (found in camps, train stations, red rockets) stash your junk. SCRAP THEN STASH!
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.

Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds.

and remember to HAVE FUN!
---
I hope Jaggers lips don't lie
---
Stealth + rifle = win
---
I can't believe you are being downvoted. 
---
Workshops are incredibly inefficient for farming resources/xp.They are for PVP. There's not really an argument. This is just how the game was made.
---
There are a few flooded building or mines to explore, &amp; the Ohio River...but that's all you'd ever need breathing gear for.
---
I don't sneak or use VATS so...
---
Question - how terrible is a vats rifleman going to be?
---
I’m running PA rifleman on my main (from way back in the beta, when I didn’t know any better), with an instigating crit lever. I am planning on grabbing legendary agility to properly give myself sneak damage perks and follow through, but I often prefer only to use sneak at the beginning of a battle, and switch over to use vats for crits and headshots.
---
I do remember exploring a mine, I can’t remember which, but it has dark underwater parts. So if you didn’t know where you were going, it’d be handy.
---
I'm surprised. *William Shatner Shocked Face.*
---
Ran out of ideas? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The codes were broken by Bethesda the code was unsolvable and you could enter last week's code I wasn't bashing nukacrypt they're the MVP. I'm hating on Bethesda consistently dropping the ball, if you even look at devans post history she promised a fix Wednesday but it really went live today. but nice job getting that downvote train and herd mentality going
---
Very. More than caps limit.
---
But the t65 carry weight is abysmal.
---
That's all I've been using, the Excavator PA.
---
I honestly dont understand the need for bigger budgets, I have created some huge and complex camps within the budget. Yes its annoying that you can use too many displays but I'm reality its a lot better than the alternative. Imagine if everyone had complex huge camps displaying hundreds of items, the server stability would be appealing ( as apposed to just terrible like it is now)
---
T65 &amp; Fireproof 3 \ Blocker 3 Perks
---
Had a similar problem when I was lower lvl as well. Some claim your build budget increases as you lvl up and sometimes the game just gives you the max budget anyways. Others think the budget just changes randomly. I haven’t had that problem since I hit somewhere between lvl 50-75 though. Sometimes the budget cap just acts weird
---
I honestly never have more than 3 melee weapons on me. Even then, I rarely use anything other than my suppressors meathook since it has god tier swing speed. Weapons rarely break as well so I might just make fix it good a passive as per your advice.
---
Sometimes it effects a whole session.
---
I killed one a month ago he had over half a dozen osmosis kits on him.
---
Xbox here, but we have a common enemy in those monsters under the bed.
---
Keep on hunting!
---
I wholeheartedly disagree with your post.
---
I want a gramophone for my camp that plays the music inside Grandma's shop.
---
If you do the BOS quests it will award you the full set of ultracite plans, and a full set of level 50 armor.  No need to buy them.
---

Edit:  Immediately after posting I saw you are looking for the mods.  I'll leave the original comment in case anyone is looking for the armor plans.
---
About 6 months ago the same thing happened and Bethesda didn't fix it if you didn't put in the right code that Tuesday you were FYCKED
---
It’s a brilliant way to chill and leave the real world behind for a little while , Gamertag Gustavo2695 add me as a friend and drop a message if your ever needing anything and same goes to all the other wasteland brethren out there always happy to help if I can 🤠👍

Best community ever. Wish you all the best.

I wonder why? 😂🤣

My osmosis kit won't leave my inventory, no complaints here.
---
My psn is different than my reddit name lol
---
You can't always get what you want.
---
I’ll friend you later, I have to do some errands and chores.
---
Explosive is better when properly spec’d. However ffr has just been a better output without any further perks. My guess is explosive will be more viable now that we will get legendary special perk cards. You’re not losing as much investing into demo’d and you really only need 2 demo points to beat ffr in dps.
---
I always thought an underwater vault would be cool
---
Always hop out of PA if that encumbered, high cap backpack and full unyielding at low hp you can carry around 500lbs, pop bufftats if you still need more.
---
Yeah I agree, Id like to investigate settlers getting abducted by Zetans and the Flatwoods Monster or something. An Alien Cave Base raid full of aliens would be amazing.
---
PKOA always lookin out!
---
No but I've read/watched a lot about Skinwalker Ranch
---
Yes, I’m on Xbox
---
Damn, no satisfaction
---
With a decent vamp heavy you can tank earl in excavator armor. I did so more or less by accident last time I went.
---
lol This makes me happy.
---
That’s what nerfing all our builds are for obviously... because that’ll make things... better
---
* People don't like being proven wrong.

---
Pick one. It's probably right. 
---
I'm not worried about the karma, lol.
---
Lol guilty
---
Right before he stopped playing this guy built me a ton of defenses and a fusion generator when I was just getting back into the game as a low level player, we became friends and played for a while but he hasn’t been playing fallout anymore but he was a real nice dude, he gave me some good weapons for my level too.
---
No clue though everytime I see ward iall I have to do is talk to him twice. 
---
Once to get the quest then turn in game still has them flagged that I got the stolen goods back
---
Why would that matter?
---
If you're totally new to the franchise... Don't listen to a single word anyone says here, including me... HaHa. Just explore the world. Leave the quests till later, figure it out for yourself. Wonder the world, no rush. It's incredible.
---
So did they, but then they planned a big ol squid to go with it so maybe just leave it until they have a better brain fart.
---
I still don’t know what Legendary Modules are for, or how to use them.
---
I really wanna get one of the mole miner funko pops and repaint it to look like Murmrgh ;-; I love her
---
I thought about taking ghoulish before but was never really clear as to how it worked. I was told it heals based on radiation absorbed but was also told the healing gained was only equal to half of the rads taken. Forgive me for being clueless I just came back to this game. 
---
As for mutations I'm still trying to collect caps to afford serums. I'm not having much luck finding player vendors that are selling them.
---
Unyielding gang ftw
---
Becoming a broken record here - the only things that sell consistently is ammo for automatic weapons. Anything else just chills in the vendor. Get those ammo crafting perks and sell everything for a dollar. I routinely have players buying 500 - 3000 rounds at a time each session I play.
---
E: ^^^YMMV, rare cool shit, inside jokes, etc all sell, but they just move sloooooowly.
---
Why not do all of it? Headshots + Sneaking + VATS is a killer combo for any non-melee/heavy build. Personally, I don't really see the point of VATS with a Rifleman since the time between shots is the time it takes to aim, but that's me.
---
Let say one of them is A and another one is B. Whichever weapons I assign to equip, it’s always been B. Damn whats happening😞
---
Thank you so much, I had already been doing the scrap the junk and stashing it I figured that after being to heavy to many times. Is the BoS collectron an ok one to have I got it since I seen it was free. I'm so far not very good with making a build though. Your advice has been very great and nice, and again thank you
---
There's an old... "feature"... that me and my friends discovered. The friends list in game is constantly updating, and the more line items it has to sync, the more lag your game suffers from. I used to have the same problem, and once I got my friends list under 30 or less it stopped being as much of an issue.
---
That sounds like a great idea for a season reward!
---
Haha i played it for 3 years  untill i gave up on it. It was fun but i just couldnt fit the meta nor had the time to become meta, but they get fresh dlcs new items and weaponry new quests and raids and fallout 76 could use more of that love too
---
What screws me over is when I run into those to high for me to kill creatures. Haha
---
Nah. As I said; Baltimore. DC should still be too hot. 
---
Given the scale of Wastelanders though, I don't expect Fo76 to ever get a proper expansion. Certainly not a an entire city.
---
And to be fair, I've bulked a LOT of aluminium
---
There’s so little on the flatwoods monster and it’s a pretty major revelation for the game series. Surely they have to acknowledge that there are other aliens actively attacking settlers for no apparent reason. What are they gaining from risking their lives to kill a less evolved species!?
---
Good to know
---
Oh nice. If you can find this film, check it out.
---
Honestly it greatly depends on the build. Round builds can be time consuming, as spaceship builds are. Bethesda has also barred players from using their personal blueprints in other players CAMPs so... you have to build from scratch.
---
Also, a spaceship can take hours, while I can build a round building with rounded roof in under an hour... if the server crashes or you accidentally get booted while I'm building, all the build has to be scrapped and built from the beginning - WHY you ask? Because whenever I reenter build mode I cannot move or delete anything that is already there.
---
So for builds that stand to take several hours and intense focus, legacy weapon plus materials is normal rate. Other builds that require an hour or two I'd take a god roll, materials, flux, stuff, things, ya know... something worth it.
---
As far as decorating though I do not do that... who you are as a player is greatly shown thru your deco... so that's up to you. I'm just here to give you a cool skeleton.
---
Wiggles elbows, claps hands. ;)
---
That’s what I’m likely going to have to do, but I’m hesitant to give up tormenter for my bonus crit damage.
---
As for vats - definitely. I have 4 agility, so I mostly use it to deal with enemies I can one shot and swarms to ensure I kill as fast as possible.
---
The thing is, with how important sneak is for rifleman builds, I’ve always lagged behind by not doing it, even though that isn’t how I want to play. Now, I have no choice but to start sneaking if I want to continue to be effective.
---
I always take the perk
---
Probably just leftovers from fallout 4. I like to think if we ever get mods someone may make a world space with lots of water
---
I cant confirm that but let's assume that A is before B in the weel, and let's assume 1 o clock the first in the row, I noticed that usually A is removed and pulled "under" B
---
I had fun exploring the burrows underwater section, but I just put on power armor and wander around like normal underwater anyway
---
It would be good but only if they implement a lock for items in your inventory to prevent you from accidentally scrapping, selling, dropping etc
---
This is the best idea I've seen in a few days, this would make the game a lot less grindy and feel like some real progress is being made
---
I am getting season 2 done (need the glass building set) then taking a break from fallout. Was planning on getting the outer worlds but I might give ESO a chance instead.
---
Go fight in Nuclear Winter or find a group of players who actually want to fight you with your broken weapons.
---
Tell them how they should be fixed. Ammo converter should have the vendor interface, and the scrip limit should either be higher, or you get a portion of scrip back in the machine when you buy from the purveyor (like a vendor gets when you sell something)
---
Ah, stick to the Forest until your around L20, then head north to Toxic Valley. Around L25, head south to Ash Heap. Just explore, Scrap all weapons and armor to unlock Mods. You'll find your way.
---
Or, alternatively, use the PA you're already in and use a high accuracy Heavy Gun like the LMG, Gatling Gun, or .50cal. Packs a punch, but no need for VATS! Or sneaking!
---
What platform? I was solo until public teams now join silently for the stat gains. If Xbox, I got you - add me and we can team and I promise I’ll never bother you.
---
Ok, if you want add me, my gamertag is BullyHunters109. I could give you some stims and ammo if you need it
---
The perk also completely prevents you from taking rads from water - even when running through puddles or crossing rivers.
---
lol It is fun!! It always confuses me how people are scared of other people. I always play alone and am as anti social in the game as you can be but am never scared or worried about other people. The odd time you run into the odd prick but it's so rare. If you don't try and one shot or purposefully be evil you have nothing to worry about. I've had people run up on me and join me in my adventures and 9 times out of ten we both get a shot in, never talk to each other, but it's a good time! 
---
Level 430 and never had any kind of special build. I just pick whatever I like and off I go. Why always change lockpick cards when you can just always leave all three equipped. That's my motto. Never worry about other people. You do you and I'm certain nobody will have a problem with it.
---
If the abominations on mothership zeta are an indicator, they want them gains...
---
Right, but I have 15 perception and 4 strength, and I’m level 260 something. A complete respec of my stats at this point is likely going to be a mess, and on top of that, interfere with leveling up the legendary perks.
---
Though you aren’t wrong. If I redid the character from the ground up, I would do heavy guns, since it was supposed to be a scientist, and energy guns are only really viable on heavies.
---
Interesting. I bet you wouldn't though. Would just be a stutter and a bashful grimace.
---
People buy my plans all the time
---
Find an organised PvP group to fight amungst. Don't go hunting under prepared travellers.
---
Outer worlds was a fun ride, oldschool feel to it, when they actually spended time on making good games. Its on gamepass if you have it. Trust me like you said eso is a rabbithole. Once youre in, youre in and realize its now may 2025

If I had the opportunity I definitely would. If it was just seeing them in passing, then no, probably not.
---
Steve Massey... If the Bethesda devs can be ghouls, why not the players?
---
I setup a small camp outside The Wayward with a vending machine selling plans and food for 1 cap each for the newbies.
---
Sorry can you explain what you mean pistol users are getting tank killer? Is this update from PTS or is this your recommendations as I’ve heard nothing about tank killer working on pistols.
---
Certain plans require them. Basically most of the weapon plans you need gold bullion to buy the plans for require them.
---
Had it happen twice today! I don't think Bethesda gives a fuck unless the bug positively effects the player, then it's hotfixed the next fucking day!
---
HeHe. I'd congratulate them on a job well done but say they definitely owe me a few pints. ;)
---
First to the egg!
---
Oh alright I've been trying quest but they been pulling me away so good to know try to explore first then do quest later
---
So I'll definitely be swapping makeshift warrior out. I'll be adding Blocker and Dodgy to see how they impact the build but wouldn't Ironclad providing 50 points of DR/ER help quite a bit or is that miniscule compared to what armor/mutation effects can provide?
---
Over the last two years of this game and also through observing people's spreadsheets of rolls, it is clear FO76's rng operates on a type of time based seed that is different on each server.
---
What this means is you are far more likely than not to roll the same effects in a row on  a server, especially if you roll quickly. 
---
If you make a roll, wait 10 minutes, then make another roll, this eliminates the rng issue.
---
With the discount, I've been having to drop the excess legendaries ontop of the pervayer stash box, or leave that character over encumbered till tomorrow.
---
I'm sitting through it right now matter of fact
---
Nice.  Some time ago a guy gave me a 2 shot bullets explode tesla.  Never giving it up
---
Sorry was using the standard highness scale used on r/trees... it goes to [11]
---
Looking forward to the legendary perks and the daily ops, dreading the huge nerf, it shouldn't go public till they finish rebalencing everything.
---
I'm in ps4 sadly so will have to purchase outer worlds, keeping my eye out for deals but nothing decent had come up yet. 
---
I might just take the risk of becoming single and download ESO after I have complete season 2.
---
Oh, okay.
---
Not at all.
---
The first completion of a tier will give you that tier's rewards, with the second tier (Knight) including an extra legendary roll, with Ops always giving a legendary roll when completed. AFAIK both pull from the Purveyor list which includes stuff that you learn, so yes on that part.
---
Its not just you that has to launch the nuke, it can be anyone it just has to be targeted at somewhere other than the Prime Fissure Site.  
---
I discovered that while exploring a silo area and someone launched a nuke at Whitesprings, and the Overseers final tape popped into existence (right in front of me) near the lift entrance.
---
And everyone will be glad to see you go, Mr Grumpy Pants. Play solo if other people bother you that much.
---
Enjoy.  Used to happen with a quad harpoon I used to use.  It was nice.
---
Make sure you scrap any weapons or armor at a workbench. This will unlock mods for weapons and armor, this will help you out mid game and end game.
---
Hey everybody! Xbox gt:inbredpoets
---
I'm a fallout fanatic and I love 76. If you put your GT out there I sent you a friend request. 
---
I do t need anything, but if someone needs anything I'll be glad to help out. Even if it's just a mule for you to switch characters.
---
My kids are old enough that they game with me, but it's never 76, but I do remember trying to get some play time in when they went to bed.
---
Again if you need it or want it, I'll try to help. 
---
See y'all in the wasteland.
---
I used it on a Junkie's Hardened Lever Action Rifle, 3/3/3 Rifleman, Nerd Rage, 20% Health, Adrenal Reaction, Strange in Numbers, Bloody Mess and it's 281 on the PTS.
---
Your calculator doesn't actually let me get that high without adding a new multiplier, which is odd.
---
So my armour piece is again humiliated.
---
Yeah, no rush on the quests. The map is so big, just take your time and enjoy exploring. Read all the notes and listen to holotapes.
---
I might need something from my stash before you teleport me to an event though
---
I have, no lag what so ever, playing on PS4!
---
Well I can't wait to grind this out!
---
This right here is why I wish we had cross platform play. The community would be so much more vibrant and large.
---
I love finding trap camps there's always a way to fuck with it
---
Hold onto anything that might be good. Patch coming next week. It'll probably change up the meta quite a bit.
---
People have theory-crafted whats gonna be best, but we wont know till the patch lands.
---
It's an update from the PTS. I'm fairly certain that Pistols and Auto Pistols are getting added to Tank Killer in Patch 22. I mean, it's in there right now. Can't see why it wouldn't go live.
---
I was mistaken  it's J vats15 and 10 dmg aim. You can still have it if you want it
---
There are ways to get some extra carry weight. Carnivore + Strange in Numbers makes carry weight food really helpful. Grilled radstag is +50, I think. I always have that buff running.
---
Anyone know if Instigating will remain multiplicative?
---
I really hope your right as we pistol users could really use that armor piercing. Also thanks for the info.
---
This isn't accurate, out of all the rewards I've collected on the PTS only the War Glaive plan couldn't be dropped or traded. The rest are fair game.
---
👀👀👀👀👀
---
At one point I ran into someone and I dropped about 15 plans .. they looked through and then dropped about fifteen as well. After I looked through I took about three and then thought what the hell and dropped the rest of them (had about 75).. they looked through and dropped about 100.
---
We each took what we didn't have and then picked up the rest of what was left of our original piles, waved and hearted and went our separate ways with no verbal communication..
---
They said give an “option to teleport” which means you get a choice. You don’t have to accept.
---
You should give No Mans Sky a go. No matter what people think of the game, its base building mechanics are very similar to Fallouts, just way better with more potential. You'd kill in their community spotlights.
---
When do you see this? I dont think I've seen or realise this
---
2,000 caps per roll? No thanks. That's just not smart. Maybe 1,000 scrip for 5,000 caps...
---
On Tuesday there will be a patch that makes every character you run into level appropriate. 
---
Other than that, enjoy the game, it’s seriously the best actual world fallout has ever had, it makes up for the flaws
---
People leaving is a good thing really, I do more damage when less people are in the room. 
---
Really I've never seen this gun cause any server lag what so ever! Nor does Ash and goo piles either. I play on PS4!
---
Explosive flamers are actually the best legacy! It can hit things outside of draw distance!
---
Its on the home screen been there for a few weeks now wish i could post photos here
---
Avoided this game because of the reviews for the longest time until it popped up on game pass, and I've played almost every night since for an hour or two. Only Lv 55 but enjoying the f out of it.

---
This should help a little with understanding what levels the various zones are.
---
I agree with what Jagger said earlier, explore, take it at your own pace. The fast you rush to the end game, the faster you get bored.
---
Pepperoni rolls with it all give 75
---
Once, I was doing daily’s and needed 3 buy/sells, guy only had ammo at 2 caps. I was just wanted to be done and get off
---
Is that what fucking happened???
---
What platform you on? I'm on PS4 and find my banners often don't update unless I actually close and restart the game...
---
Standing at attention...oh my
---
That'd be fine for private teams, but people like the chill nature of public teams. 
---
Daily ops give you a pop up to tell your team mate has gone into one, and if you're on a daily ops team that's what you should be doing since there's no other benefit. 
---
Once the new season comes out attendance and completion of public events should be good since it looks like we're getting a score repeatable for completing public events (hopefully it's not the only repeatable).
---
Yes!! I admittedly was a bit of a weirdo when I was a kid - I was SUPER obsessed with Mothman &amp; had my own little notebook filled with “facts” about him and “sighting” pictures I’d printed off the internet. So it’s easily my favourite part of this game.
---
Xbox one and yeah its been a few weeks so ive deffently shut the game down a few times lol
---
I leave stuff I don't want or use in overseer's caches, since a player doing the story will eventually goto one.
---
Have you watched Hellier?
---
If you look at the damage you take, instead of the damage resistances, I did some testing and it only reduced damage from a lvl 95 behemoth by 5 damage between t65 and excavator.  It's really not worth it for the defense.
---
This is why new currencies always suck. Destiny has this issue as well, I can’t keep up with it all.
