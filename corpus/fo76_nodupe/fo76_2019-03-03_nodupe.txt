PA works underwater but it is incredibly slow. I would recommend using the Aquaboy perk if you can because it’s good to have in general. 
---
---
---
Anyone doing similar on PC??? I need some Level 50 T60 pieces! 
---
I was in two zones there today..I think u are right..I don't have that much glowing meat..but..but I got  TS black rifle and someone just dumped a TS 10mm auto..not explosive but thx whitespring
---
[removed]
---
Hahahaha what ?
---
Yeah Uranium Fever usually yields ~10 teeth for me
---
[Crack open he said...](https://i.imgur.com/vuBCGtj.png)
---
It’s super short-sighted regardless. Players frequently leave quests off till higher levels, and they should still be able to spawn regardless
---
Mirror Ball
---
We killed her twice on PC today, back-to-back, half the same people showed up both times, half different, for a total of 9 or 10 people.
---
Yep!
---
K. 
---
I participated in two successful Prime nukes today, and saw at least two more, in three hours of play. PC.
---
Forgot yip i have it already 
---
Great job, but the lack of a foundation under your fusion generator is triggering my OCD... :D
---
I mean it's the auto aim that bothers me.
---
Yeah but it can work in your favor..I've gotten 2 marine wetsuit plans in 3 server hops :)
---
I've been working the General and Harpers Ferry for violet flux - less hassle, easier mobs. I pick up 100-160 at each, depending on where I land the nuke, and how hungry I am for violet and therefore how close I look. HF gives you a good mix of masses, though I don't seem to see a lot of fluids over there. The General seems lighter on masses, but that area is also lighter on mob spawns.
---
I wish that they had a guestbook or something that lets you know if anyone has visited your camp and whether or not they liked it. 
---
No. But he killed a legendary ghoul while I was browsing..
---

---
No loot for me. 
---
THIS WAS ME TODAY.  172 with 400 hours finally got my last two today hahaha.  WHY!  
---
Same group that doesn't see why artist shouldn't be able to copy write dance moves, "what's the worse that can happen" 😉
---
I mean it doesn't work on anything so I didn't really expect it to...
---
I wish Fallout76 focused more on the co-op experience like this than PvP to be honest.  
---
I kinda feel bad whenever I take the mill, they were just hanging around. 
---
I don’t know, In the song country roads John Denver says “blue ridge mountains Shenandoah river “ so I’d assume it’s in West Virginia  
---
Where do you find those? I'm level 5432185 and haven't encountered one yet. 
---
Yeah actually someone else built it for me (I don't have the plans yet) and I have never moved it since. Maybe I'll add a foundation, I guess.
---
I have an explosive Ghoul Slayer's Gatling Laser that I converted to Ultracite, and it is probably my most effective weapon for SBQ fights. However, it also breaks ludicrously fast. To mitigate this, I've started using Power User. I can usually get 2000 shots - 2 cores at Power User Level 3 - off before it breaks, sometimes more.
---
Lucky Hole interior deposits do not convert, but I'm going to nuke that Hornwright site next. For science (and possible assloads of ultracite)!
---
Yeah apparently Denver was the original one to mess up the two Virginias.
---
Not sure if I got mine off the queen, or off the SB boss in Glassed Caverns.
---
Im on PC and use PLM mod and almost use all 8 possible configurations (new version supposedly unlimited configs but havent tried that yet).
---
So i use PA night / day, Armor night / day. Travelling+bargain, crafting armor/guns. Then there is a mahem glowing fight build (others are more sneak) and working toward a gimped melee build as well.
---
Once in combat you dont switch decks that easily so i cant really see how this would give an unfair advantage in what form. Following that i think deck presets should just be in the base game asap.
---
i use candles (from antique lights set) and shotgun turrets to keep mobs at bay. they seem to go for better lit areas and the shotgun turrets kill them quickly. i know the turrets eat budget but i haven’t had to repair anything in my camp for weeks now. i have 3 turrets, 4 candles and 2 spotlights. im also level 140+ so i do have a larger budget but i had similar setup back at lvl 50. 
---
Don't think they have implemented anything like that.  Best you can do is move the CAMP device around and hope for the best.
---
I agree... killing feral ghouls or insects is fine, but mutants are arguably the best and fittest survivors out there before we exit the vaults. 
---
Yes and thats the thing. That enables them to put out shit like that 
---
Do it for me!
---
Cutting off 25% of DR would be really useful, especially for tankier enemies like a SBQ, fog crawler, or whathaveyou
---
You get out of here with your logic
---
I'd be willing to work with them if they didn't just try to smash you whenever they see you.
---
It also crosses through W. Virginia. Goes into Harper's Ferry.
---
I mean it's just 800 bullets not hard to come buy.
---
Even for Ultracite ammo types - I try to carry 5-15k each of 5mm, ultracite 5mm, and ultracite .50.
---
That's why Grahm (and Strong although I prefer Grahm) are little gems. 
---
It was at a restraint. My mom enjoyed it.
---
She said it's a southern thing, I laughed and said mom this is the midwest you errent raised in the south
---
Like a karma scale? 
---
If it works on SBQ sure I get that. Everything else for me at least goes down quick. 
---
That's why I do this: https://reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/aw8s5y/simple_living_in_the_mountains/
---
3K is also nothing, period. I've dumped that much or more in 308, 45, 10mm, in the past, as I've moved on from those weapons, all of it looted, none manufactured.
---
Thank you!  My game just crashed and it shows me having to re-do all of the transmissions.  
---
Thanks, I'll just keep trying, none of my friends play this game anymore so  I can join on anyone.    
---
In the beta they did have one for camps and workshops. But for now, there’s only the mat for workshops. 
---
Servers were laggy, at least on PC, today, on pretty much every one I was on. I did a trade with another player where the goods didn't show up for several minutes. Did you check again later?
---
I thought I was bad with finally getting my 10th just after hitting Lvl 100! I salute your perseverance &amp; persistence my fellow Vault Dweller.
---
I literally finished this on my first day of the beta.  Didn't know it was a 'thing'.
---
I have TSE pump, combat and instigating pump and double barrel and my favorite by far is my instigating double barrel, can one shot most in stealth. 
---
Got it, I'll move it around and see what happens. Thanks! Also, another noob question here. If I pick my C.A.M.P up to move it to an entirely new place, are all the materials I used to what I have already built come with me? I have my house saved to a blueprint, so I'm assuming (hopefully) I'll keep everything and just need to place the house blueprint down and that be it. I'd hate to have to hunt down more materials to build my house from the blueprint. 
---
Bummer but I wouldn't worry about it. If you're hopping for power armor mods it doesn't matter if you land in the same server or not.
---
It's not a spoiler. Everyon on the server (who hasn't already gotten it) gets the message if the nuke is launched somewhere other than the Prime Fissure site. She doesn't give you personally a message after you launch a nuke.
---
thank you!
---
Somehow I've never seen this after being through there a few dozen times. Where the heck is this body!?!?!
---
Decide yourself:  *Mutant slayer's*, *+50% limb damage*, *+1 Endurance* 
---
I'm currently having the same problem trying to set up a visitor counter. Instead of one turning then sending a signal when it resets, they all turn.
---
It's the river that runs through Harper's ferry
---
BOS underarmor, yeah, but I've never seen that quest reward with BOS armor plans.
---
How do you know the intent?  Why is it supposed to be so amazing and not just like any other low-level event?
---
I get the lvl 9 ghouls in the golf gear more often than I'd like.  I got them all the first day I brought my alt into whitesprings (just regular old whitesprings, not a nuke) for some fast leveling.  The spawns were mostly lvl 9-23 on one run after server hopping a couple times, grinding out xp and legendaries.  Server hop a few times and you'll get the 10 easy.
---
They also grow on a farm in the forest, NE a bit from the fairgrounds.
---
Where did I say I love PvP? It's a buggy mess but restricting it to one game type only would be a surefire way to hurt both audiences.
---
I don't claim workshops I find them next to useless as any player who didn't want to PvP would log out or would be prepared for PVP as when you first take a workshop it warns ya of this.
---
But no most my PvP is from someone attacking myself on accident, bounty hunting, or messing around with friends when you lose a quarter of a thousand caps per death you don't want to get randomly killed by a level 7 with a pulse mine.
---
Has that ever worked out?
---
It’s old and hasn’t been maintained.  Factories aren’t magical machines.
---
the lever action is at point pleasant or Sutton station..can't remember which just bought one yesterday for 199 caps
---
Oof I don’t have that many caps
---
I save 3s, some 2s. I may use them in special circumstances, but sure, I also have an eye toward the prospector when that releases.
---
u can earn them quick!!!
---
How?
---
that would've been pretty easy to implement too..
---
On their own it’s simple enough but they usually spawn in groups where they can switch weapons from rifles to supersledges whenever they feel. It makes it difficult to combat this unless your a marsupial killing machine. 
---
Also stuck
---
You're more than welcome good sir. I'm a very staunch defender of Bethesda most of the time though I can admit when they've done something truly egregious but this is something else entirely. This is an issue the community as a whole has expressed displeasure in many times yet Bethesda hasn't included a regular lower level Ghoul spawn somewhere in the entirety of Whitesprings yet? It's really kinda unreal now that I think about it in that regard.
---
If u have green thumb equipped just fast travel to vault 76 and get all the soot flowers or just go to overseers camp and pick everything by the water then fast travel to flatwoods and sell it all
---
Nope
---
So they do have a use! At last, but no joke thanks and love the heavy weaponry for those heavy footed freaks
---
Yeah
---
Also try to keep a mental list of power armor spawns. Am I at or near gorge junkyard? Of course I’ll check to see if there’s one in the truck. Dolly sods? 99% chance it’s there. 
---
Ultracite weapons do double damage to scortch/scortchbeasts im pretty sure. Its in the lore in the computers. They also shoot green lasers. You cant get them legendary too. 
---
I know the ama part is sarcasm but seriously, what is the general route to getting from level 40 to 100, let alone 370
---
They moved the ini file to under users/\[user\]/my games/etc.
---
Took a while on two SBQ kills, but after the event reward messages posted, I was able to loot both, no problem.
---
My first day, when I left the vault, some random stranger left me 50 stimpaks (diluted), 50 RadAway (diluted), a set of basic armor,  and a pipe rifle (with ammo).
---
To this day, I pay it forward.  I take time out of my day to make healing salves, disease cures, armor, weapons, ammo, etc. To give new players.  My "squad" and I often leave a spot open on our team to help show new players the ropes as well. We also help by helping them pick a suitable location for their camp and help them to build it and supply them with items they don't yet have (purifiers, generators, etc.)
---
Helping new players and showing them we are here to help definitely helps to erase the stigma people have about high level players...
---
Maybe not the same issue but Bethesda did something to prevent duping by making all but one of the side-by-side vendor terminals “busy” (this is how it was explained to me). If you try the other terminals in the same group, are they ALL busy now?
---
It eventually won’t be a final boss.  New content will make it obsolete.
---
Yes, when you move your CAMP device to a new location everything gets stored and you will not have to look for more materials to build.
---
I can get you to 45 in under 1 week at 2 hours per session per day
---
Fantastic, thank you!
---
There's a decryption process that uses the silo codes and the letters in the Enclave bunker in Whitesprings. Solved codes are available here: [https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
You probably want more than one keycard for your first silo run, it's easy to miskey the keypad when your adrenaline is running.
---
I hopped off for tonight but I'll check again tomorrow! Thank you for you help c: I am also on PC!
---
I'm on PC!
---
Are you sure the BETA number isnt more of a 50 cent or Jay Z?
---
I personally love the buzz blade and would use this to farm steel from super mutants. But also kinda sucks lol. The endurance doesn't effect your HP (bugged) so does it even do anything?
---
1/10, 200+ hours.
---
Ditch Speed Demon for starters, and cure your diseases. You can make a bunch of disease cures with a quick walk up the river that runs by Flatwoods.  Gather the bloodleaf, firecaps and snaptails.  Use green thumb perk when picking up the flora, and use chemist and super duper perks when making the cures at a chemistry station.  You can get 15-20 no problem, maybe more if you harvest during verdant season.  I go to Flatwoods for Responders vending and make a 10 minute foraging run up the stream if I have less than 5 disease cures.
---
There's also the sulfur drinking fountain near the Whitesprings Golf Club that will cure diseases and refill your thirst bar for free.  It's where the springhouse gazebo is, against the low retaining wall on the left from the path down.
---
PC, sorry.  Happy to reply to DMs, though.
---
If the plan still doesn't show up, let me know, I can make you whole on caps. I keep running into the cap cap. I bought someone else plans for about the same price the other day when we had Graham, but the other player lacked the caps for the rare-ish plan Graham had and he had been looking for for a bit.
---
All I would ask is that you pay the favor forward somehow to someone else one day.
---
I believe Grahm (the super mutant merchant) has the plans for the domestic kitchen table since the last patch, but it's a rare spawn. I found him 2 times and he didn't have it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Well, so that means I will have to claim another hundred of workshops just to get that plan. I have no idea why a damn patio table it's that hard to find.

You have 700 hours, how much ammo of each kind (or the most of a few) do you have? Just a bit curious.
---
why?
---
Ok thanks
---
Oh it’s tracked. Just not told to us
---
What? Someone is a bully for pointing out all the problems a game has? That seems ridiculous.
---
Little late, but I've came to say, I live in walking distance to it
---
You still there? I can sign back on and hook you up with a card. I've already done 3 nukes today and my stash is maxed out, I don't need to launch the nuke or hit the blast zone, but happy to help you out.
---
I can back up hippo. I got it from a defend workshop.
---
When? it happened to me two weeks ago?
---
what? There was a blizzard image here. Weird
---
The most recent update, on the 19th iirc. 
---
Check the Roadmap.   This is forthcoming.  
---
Berry mentats exist.  Cryolators exist.  Recon scopes exist.
---
I linked videos elsewhere about it. He straight up DMCA a dude who dared criticize his videos. His blog is full of disgusting homophobic and sexist posts. He uses nude mods in his fall out and got called out on it, he curates a very specific persona that isn't true because if most ofnhis viewers knew whzt a scumbag he really is they'd quit watching him.
---
He'll I used to recommend him myself until I learned what a shitty person he is.
---
What will you do now that you've finished the game?
---
If they didn't shoot at me on sight and throw hot potatoes, I'd be happy to leave them alone.  Super mutants were people, too.
---
I'm thinking that yeah, you're just missing the timer, and the extra loading is because the game is removing the event.
---
Also on PC. I fast travelled to three horde events yesterday: instantly swarmed by the entire horde all three times, legendary included.
---
My only problem was with one, and it was because it was all colonel Gutsys and I didn't have the right weapons.
---
Yeah I seen that but not till summer isn't it? Needs to happen now I feel.
---
Just a dumb question. Does "defend a workshop" reward you with different plans from "claim a workshop"?
---
I have played 300+ hours and I don't know if these events have some "exclusive" plans.
---
That is why others in this thread have already admitted that they knew about him being homophobic, sexist, and uses DMCA take downs against any one that is critical of him.
---
How can you have reduced weight and faster reload🤔
---
The only reason I can think why an instigating would be better than an instigating explosive is that if the aoe from shooting one enemy hits any other enemies, you won't be able to get the instigating damage on them. So without the explosive maybe you can headshot for one shot kill, take a group of 5 enemies closer together in 5 shots. But with the explosive, you kill the first guy in one shot, but the rest are already damaged, so the instigating is worthless.
---
the ones in the middle should be useable
---
What if there was faction rank ups? (like Destiny). Where each bit of scrap, Aid, armour  and weapons count for a certain percentage of progress for each rank, and at each rank, you potentially get a Legendary item or Plans? Maybe donating 100 steel gets you 10% progress and a weapon gets you 4%, or donating 10 Rad-X/Stimpaks/Rawaday gets you 20%
---
a few legendaries every now and then, only if you get ghouls or super mutants though
---
I’m pretty sure workshop events just share a giant pool of plans. I’ve gotten the same plans for defenses and claiming before.
---
No I ran out and got one thank you though
---
Which Part of town
---
Yes, I tried that, too. It looks nice, but I can plant two mutfruit trees per campfire and four tatos or carrots. Actually, I should move the corn and blueberries onto mats or planters...
---
There is a time limit on it though.  I got lost in a mine once and couldn’t make it out before I drowned. 
---
The best part is there's only one other person in my server
---
anywhere inside the walls really, just take a moment to kill the enemies and a couple legendaries might show up, usually has one three star somewhere but mostly one or no stars
---
On a Saturday evening or night? That's crazy! All the servers earlier today were pretty busy as far as I saw, and most of them were also horribly laggy. Wonder if they spun up a fresh bunch.
---
Yeah, this is what I've noticed. The middle one is the only one that ever works. 
---
a lot of the challenges are bugged, epsecially the ones where you have to use items or plans because they simply dont register for the challenges for some reason
---
I feel your pain.  I had to have one of my kids do it for me.   
---
High damage sneak builds exist (glass cannon and otherwise). Plan accordingly.
---
Yeah I don't see how the video I linked could fall under "bullying". Just insane.
---
It's really annoying though... want to get some atomic points... bought bobbleheads and it will not complete the challenge...
---
Wow, what a gre *You have been disconnected*.
---
... Great pat *You have been disconnected*
---
What the hell fu *You have been disconnected*
---
No need to be a d-bag. I guess I just have never been griefed.
---
Has nothing to do with being lazy. My camp has been in the same spot since beta. Its huge and right near Top of the World. Center of the map. 
---
I so hope vending machines appear on the map for everyone to see. If you want to hide from big  scary griefers then don't own a vending machine.
---
Let the rest of us have our fun.
---
He points out A LOT that isn’t at all a problem. His thesis falls flat. 
---
Power to the people? Power to people. Power people. COMMUNIST!!
---
yeah ikr, i still have all those “discover valley galleria” etc unchecked even though i’ve gone through every single location in the game and making a new character for 20 atoms doesnt seem like a great plan
---
That would be cool, however if people choose to change up their style of gameplay they shouldn’t have to be confined to the server with all the people that still enjoy nuking, murdering, or mass crafting. 
---
Thanks a lot for your help :D
---
Lol why?
---
Dude doesn't know what he is talking about. Less than a month ago I recommended him. Yet now I'm smearing dirt on him? Yeah, because I found out some shitty things about him. If you find out someone you had respected turns out to be a shit person wouldn't you also try to earn others about them?
---
I’ve had this quest and key since the Beta. I’ve gone back in a few times and explored every nook and cranny of this mine. I have no idea what to do either and I just assume it’s bugged. 
---
This might just be the coolest idea I have ever seen!! I got legitimately hyped for this... sadly I play on ps4 :/
---
What do you mean? His critique of the game in his review of it was spot on and pretty much said the same exact things MATH did in his critique of the game.
---
Yes. But I have different weapons (Sniper, Handmade, Lever and Deathclaw Gauntlet) and for me it is always my Handmade that gets deleted from my favorites. However, it stopped deleting it from my favs like 2-3 days ago and everything is working now. But before that, it was whenever I fast travelled or entered a new server.
---
&gt;Ditch Speed Demon
---
I don't think I can ever go back to playing without both Speed Demon and Marsupial.  It feels like a disease to _not_ have them at this point.
---
Well I mean if you're going to do that, then just put turrets watching them and lock them to protect them as they will automatically shoot abt wanted player. However I warn you that is also a good way to ensure that your base is going to get wrecked by someone who doesn't like you being selfish. Water does not take that long to collect and harvest so either you can get mad about it or live with it. 
---
Man that sucks
---
Yup still hoping for the DC map update
---
The Can Do! perk. It’s a life saver, I dint even cook anymore because it’s made food so plentiful
---
Please don’t lock your water purifiers. Or add an unlocked one, problem solved!
---
 Bahahaha, yep, finally moved my camp with the fantastic view after falling to my death every time I spawned at my camp. 
---
No problem, good luck on your search!
---
Can't rush it or there'll be issues like there were on launch and now with adrenal reaction 
---
You absolutely cannot. I must have crossed wires there when typing. I run a Lightweight QEDBS, but my preference would be a Rapid QEDBS.
---
Hmmm weird, it's never happened to me fast travelling or server switching, only when I log out and log in again a different day/session. It's not majorly annoying but eh, I'll just keep an eye on it.
---
When you fast travel to Harpers and go through that hole in the wall in direction to the vendor, there’s almost always an armor plan in one of the shelves in the house you enter through the hole in the wall. You can get marine armor plans from there for example.
---
🤷🏼‍♂️ meh, accepting things like this is part of enjoying the game. Tbh I haven’t thought about this quest in a long time. Seeing your post jogged my memory and then I chuckled to myself and said must still be bugged. 
---
I've leveled 7 characters to level 70+ each. The ghoul golfers are always the last mission to complete. The golfers only come out when the really low monster lists get tapped, which is very rare given how high level everyone is.
---
Just bored with the game lol need a reason to play
---
Rockstar is getting the biggest pass in the industry atm, imo.
---
People think EA hates singleplayer? At least they don't try to have it both ways with each new game.
---
(I'm in no way defending EA, just an example)
---
Pc already has mods, and modders are already more than halfway done making private servers. So just wait til around July and you'll hear a lot more about private servers.
---
If purifiers are unlocked then it’s assumed they are there for everyone. Lock em if you don’t like it. 
---
Ok thank you
---
Windmills all the way, they look cool too.
---
Got my max level TSE Double Barrel Shotgun there
---
Tse?
---
If you are bored with the game then try doing something else with your time...
---
Two Shot Explosive.
---
Was really good before. :)
---
Ah ok thank you
---
Take the stalker tag off of everything.
---
While they're at it, re-balance the various legendary traits so that people want more than 3 of them.
---
You've been to hell and back. I have 350h and got 2/10 last week. One of them spawned literally nowhere near whitesprings.
---
Nice try, Bethesda 
---
Look for super rare stuff and collect legendaries for the legendary vendor guy
---
I love how everyone is pretending that there wasn't the same exact cries with 4.
---
Just like Star Wars fans have started praising the prequels, because they hate the sequels.
---
People are just fickle.
---
It means two different kinds of bobbleheads. So use any other and it should complete it
---
You have to be on a lower level server I got one in one day then nine in another day
---
Two shot on shotguns does NOT double the amount of pellets and never has. It adds a single additional projectile. So instead of 8 pellets you shoot 9.
---
I was able to complete that quest after the last big patch, otherwise I was lv 60+ with 3 of 10 killed for the longest time. I got to whitesprings after the patch and killed two and didn't even notice until I was up to 6/10. Cleared them all in about 30 minutes.
---
If someone else is using a vendor inside the bunker it also doesn't let you use the vendor.
---
Was the reward worth it?
---
Disregard my inability to read...:(
---
Nah man, the knives are just underestimated. They're good.
---
plenty
---
They surely aren't doing it for achievements or trophies, PC doesn't have any.
---
Never thought this could happen. The game should only allow one team to start the final count down process. But you can always launch again.
---
Assuming she isn't dead I would like to be able to meet her at some point. You know get a pat on the back for surviving and completing her mission of securing the silos. 
---
It would honestly be funny if she chastised you for launching nuclear weapons. So many people would reroll new toons to get a different "ending".
---
i play melee, so nothing but 2k shotgun shells
---
This is something I discovered when building on a cliff side. If I didn't want to be dropped at the base of the cliff and have to climb up, I'd have to move my CAMP unit somewhere it'd let me spawn closer. 
---
It definitely got worse recently.
---
Yep I wasted so much rad x to get through the water. Good xp and black titanium farm though
---
I haven't seen this mentioned but the combat rifle despite it's downsides has better AP costs in vats.
---
True. I have enough to make them at the Tinker bench but it's annoying to see this shit happen after they've repeatedly "fixed" the game
---
Getting gear to beat the boss that drops the gear to beat the boss easier is called...
---
...MMO progression.
---
I've disregarded all you have said due to the vulgar language.
---
How can you fight the Scorchbeasts queen but not craft a frag???
---
And a wendigo
---
i'll try to learn all plans and get some gear, preparing for prestige 
---
Yay the other person left now there's a new person but enemys aren't responing that fast
---
Yeah I feel ya i just try not to use weapons i know are still semi glitchy 
---
So when are you dumping the boyfriend?
---
Berry Mentats is hit/miss for me against chameleon and stealthboys. Recon Sensors only let me tag a stealthed player before they go invisible. 
---
Haven't tried recon scopes and cryolators yet. 
---
Do all quests, kill everything, use cranberry snack or pies, you can also play with friends and use leader
---
I think it depends on how many old biometric ID cards you can find. I suppose you could also pick them up from other silos to focus them on a single silo?

I'm with you on marsupial, but I put two AG points into Gun Runner on my melee build (I also have one rank of each three pistol perks for a light ranged option).  Gives you the same +20% movement speed without having to mainline water and dog food.  I just switch back to my super sledge when I close in on enemies.  Similar to you with speed demon, I wouldn't trade it for anything.  I just got sick of always hearing that dripping water sound.
---
If I'm playing in a party (which is probably 60% of the time) and swap in two ranks of Squad Maneuvers, I'm zipping everywhere when I swap to my pistol.
---
It just disappeared without reward

I've been through a desert on a horse with no name, and I was really thirsty... and the horse. Who shall be nameless :-)
---
There's some absolutely mental "youtubers are against bethesda and so are evil" bullshit going around here which...confuses me. 
---
How damaged do you have to be that objectively pointing out issues with the game, issues with the company, and literal crimes as "hit pieces". 
---
Seriously nutty sub-set in here sometimes. 
---
aaaaa ya got me LAMO
---
I travelled west to the noob area (since the mats are easier to find there) and found a group of lower level who had claimed Sunshine Meadows and who had clearly blown their entire budget on a brahmin heard.  The place was under attack.  They arrived to defend the place from ferals and they find me gleefully punching the ferals leaving them in a neat pile.  I must have scared them a bit because on the the players approached with his rifle aimed at me.  I looked around and realized they really had put some work into the place.  And how could I not love it?  My icon is a brahmin and I’m dressed in a cowboy hat and duster.  Anyway I waved and I stood by the brahmin and gave them a heart.  I helped defend the ranch from two more waves of ferals. I stayed and fixed what I could that got damaged, waved and left.  That felt good.  I’m going to do that more.  
---
If you don't like vats, you will probably find pistols a little underwhelming compared to other weapon types. With a decent vats/crit build, though, pistols are pretty good.
---
Then you should get off the internet snowflake.
---
I was looking to get rid of a few things earlier today. Had a couple suits of power armor and wanted to try to help out a low level with the chassis at least. Spent 50 caps trying to give it away. Chased 2 or 3 players across the map trying to help. One just stood there like he was afk. The others ran like hell. I'm only level 35 myself but always looking to help when I can.
---
Cause i find explosives really easily at spots that gives you to them easily? lol
---
Wait, there’s “winning in FO”?  I always thought of it as a game of trying to not die.
---
1. I don't see this as a big deal at all
---
2. This is something they will be looking into to improve
---
3. This is also something they will be looking into to improve
---
4. No, the costs of these plans are a reflection of the rarity of them.  They shouldn't be affordable. 
---
5. If you think melee weapons break easily, try using guns, any maybe the relevant perks
---
6. Nah what we have is enough for perk cards
---
7. That is coming in a patch
---
My camp is on the side of the cliff and if I spawn there it places me at the bottom of the cliff. If I spawn again, it puts me on the edge of the cliff at the top, by my camp.
---
I'm...not the one being a d-bag here, though.  
---
You want a feature that makes it objectively easier for griefers to target their victims because you don't want to move your camp to an obvious trading spot. 
---
You "don't care" about griefers, and you  "don't care" that this would negatively affect others. 
---
"who cares" is my issue here. I pointed out a logical issue, and you respond with a "I don't care, it's not my problem, I want this thing".
---
You're the dick in this conversation, dude. 
---
if you are looking to start a group of sorts you are welcome to add me on xbox1 @ SkilledStew603
---
I'm only like lvl 23 tho.... I always get bored playing single player and it can be really difficult to survive in areas like Watoga where everything is three times my level although I have a full suit of raider power armor so I can go into nuke zones.... my English teacher would kill me if he read this its the mother of all run on sentences but this is reddit so screw English 
---
I walked through in my power armor. 
---
About the same here - I've done it so many times I can do all 3 in about 2 hours.    At lvl25 its not that hard - I focus my build on one handed melee and I use The Blade of Bastet at this point.  
---
We don't eat grits in WV, least not in my neck of the woods. 
---
If you dont do damage, it doesnt lose durability 
---
Don’t even know what a golfer ghoul is...
---
Omg.  I hate guys like that.  I’m lvl 82 and I’d still have no chance.  Matters the situation but I usually just log off to another character for a while.  (I blacklist those names.  Forgive but don’t ever forget.)
---
Yeah pretty much if they don't suck Bethesdas dick 24/7 they are haters that are just out to stir up controversy. Which makes no sense, these people make their living playing these games, they do not want the game to fail as it is directly tied to their income. They have made a living playing the previous titles in the series for years, and if fo76 ad been good they'd have done that with this game as well.
---
It jist boils down to fo76 being a dumpster fire of a game that will die by the end of the year once modders release the private servers and then everyone will quit playing on the BGS servers to instead play on modded servers that have fewer bugs.
---
Do you know how low level you have to be approximately ? I guess you could it as a alt character if you have one.
---
Are you 2 handed or 1? I ask because I wanted to try using a pipe wrench with my second character but it seems like 2 handed is much better, almost killing any reason to use 1 handed especially with the legendary ones you get later.
---
I will be tonight. Find me on psn
---
Maybe “bully” isn’t *exactly* the right word. 
---
I really liked Joseph’s video “ fallout4 one year later” when it came out. I’m sure you’ve seen it and know that it’s basically him seeing the game in a new light, appreciating it in a new way. 
---
At the time I was trying to convince one of my own friends, one who actually got me into Bethesda games in the first place, to try the game again because I knew he wasn’t playing it right. Or at least, he seemed to misunderstand it like Joseph did (at first.) It was clear Joseph put a lot of “heart“ into it. 
---
This new video, in my opinion, heavily exaggerates issues. It’s almost like he’s proud of pointing out the bugs, knowing that he’ll eventually have some mega list of them all in a video. He also sounds a lot more egotistical (the fake heavy sighs...ugh). Seems like his million or so other views got to his head a bit, and he’s doing this less for others and more for himself. 
---
I also turned off MaTNs video maybe an hour in. I liked what you had to say about the gun mods, but his criticism of the food and hunger system showed me he doesn’t really understand how the game is meant to be played. And yes, I know this is an RPG and can be played anyway you’d like, you can go ahead and starve yourself and get all the diseases and see how much fun you have. Or you could entertain the thought that maybe, just maybe, Bethesda is trying to encourage a style of play. And I don’t mean melee build versus shotgun build. 
---
So yeah, I hope Joseph comes around and understands how much he “fluffed” the video. Really, all it mostly does is add to the fire of negativity. I don’t think he can see that now, but maybe in one year. 
---
1. again, it might not be a big deal to you, but its a big deal to many of us that has weekly challenges just sitting there with no means to be finished.
---
4. then they shouldn't sell them at all, or even have a fucking vendor, it's useless to have overpriced items if you can't even buy the shit.
---
I generally do too.  Occasionally I will find a cool camp and compliment the owner of they’re around. That’s about it.
---
Buzz collector here. Swing speed does nothing but allow you to power attack faster, you shouldn't be power attacking anyway though so unslot martial artist and equip blocker. 
---
Offensive god rolls
---
Bloodied/Anti-Armor/Furious. Bloodied is far superior but you can use other rolls if you're not a low-life build. 
---
Limb damage. The only even useful major mod but it's actually really strong on the buzz as a PvP weapon the buzz almost instantly cripples/staggers and limb damage just helps it do this better. Otherwise it won't effect DPS.
---
+STR. On an offensive buzz this adds 5% dmg. So the difference between a god roll buzz and a 1-star is legit 5% dmg. Just get a one star unless you're really into the finer things.
---
Defensive mods
---
Same prefixes, possibly consider suppressor but yeah... If it over-repaired the buzz will still do great dmg even without an offensive prefix but you still probably want an offensive prefix.
---
Major- reflect while blocking. It's underestimated but can seriously fuck up melee builds.
---
Minor - Agility for dodgy, reduced dmg while blocking, or reduced weight. The things are heavy af and don't benefit from martial arts the anyway so reduced weight can be nice.
---
1, have you not looked at the patch notes for the next update? 
---
Yep. Kent Connolly is a mention in FO76 as well (during MoM quest line)
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Oh Jesus you even think MaTN doesn't know how to play the game and thats why he criticized it? You do realize that even the devs said they were going to watch his video and take notes on it. So it seems more like he knows EXACTLY what the game should play like if even the devs of the game are using that video for inspiration.
---
Everyone was always bitching about how bad it sucked.  A few bugs here as and there, but I love the game. It ain't fallout 3 or 4. Totally different game play.
---
No u
---
If you find my camp,  please feel free to collect any food or water. 
---
Also there is a space with an orchestra (all fo76 instrument): one day o will invite the server over for play and picture. 
---
For the tasty meat song
---
A friendly mole miner merchant is coming during Wild Appalachia. 
---
So this explains why that random high level player lured me from my first base to my first grave for seemingly no reason at all... It was in whitesprings.
---
The river coming from the SWish of Harper's Ferry is the Shenandoah.  The one running north to south under the train bridges is the Potomac.  They meet up in Harper's Ferry and just become the Potomac.
---
yeah same, I went there and killed a bunch of ghouls and my count never increased so I though it was bugged.  After seeing this post now I know there's actually special "golfer ghouls" that I've never seen before.
---
Like I said, the guy has good points on the gun mods. But the guy goes back to the Flatwoods every single time he needs to stock up on food and water, then explains how getting food and water is too easy and ultimately a bad system.  
---
Yeah, no shit it would be easy to get food and water if you went back to 76 every time you needed it. If I did that every time I would be equally as annoyed. The point is he hasn’t figured out how to sustain himself in the area that he’s playing in. I understand it sometimes necessary to go on a scavenger run back in lower level areas, but MaTN made the system boring for himself then basically says it’s boring. 
---
Swing speed doesn't effect it. Limb damage is the only good offensive major mod.
---
Get rid of it and regain it if your on Xbox I got you just bring me a cobalt flux
---
Gotem
---
Could yo be able to tell roughly where exactly you put up the nuke for more fluxes and how is legendary gals in harpers ferry?
---
All I read was: "Give me! Give me! Give me!"
---
Patience grasshopper.
---
You’re joking right? Swing speed and martial artist both make the circular saw spin faster, ergo more dps and damage
---
Also the limb damage 50% bonus only gets applied if you specifically target legs or arms
---
O.o
---
Yeah, the item's model is literally of it in a bowl exposed to the air.
---
2handed is much better right now. I use unarmed no power armor build
---
Nah b, that's a common misconception. Swing speed allows you to power attack faster, but you don't really power attack with a buzz so it's worthless.
---
You should craft only 5.56 and shotgun shells, and buy the rest. One of either is easily worth two of .45.
---
We can craft them already?
---
I don't know how I unlocked it, but I can craft them...
---
It is a ghoul wearing the golfing shirts that you find in the clubhouse.
---
I've been seeing fewer nuke launches lately as well.
---
Last night I was in Watoga when someone launched a nuke on the SBQ.  I thought, *"Cool, I'm already down here.  I'll just sit and wait for them to kill her and see who comes in with good loot for sale."*  I knew I didn't want to waste my ammo and weapon condition for that bullshit.
---
Five minutes later the entire server crashed, before they even had time to kill her.  Glad I didn't waste any resources on it.
---
They're literally just ghouls in golfer sweaters and as adorable as they are they are a huuuuuge pain in the ass to get
---
Depends on the build and such but for me I use a lever action, a hunting rifle, and a hand made as my main weapons,  with a black powder thrown in as well 
---
I hit HF a few hours ago, I personally saw two \*\*\* legendaries, but I was there just for the flux. There was a group of people going around together going after critters, getting gulpers, a deathclaw, and yao gai, and I think they saw at least two more \*\*\* in those groups, plus one \*\*\* ghoul or mutant that spawned at the same point I got one before them.
---
This is probably a bit exceptional though. If I'm aware of two \*\*\* legendaries  in nuked HF in general, that's usually max.
---
As far as placement, you want to get the waterline to the east/southeast, the Red Rocket to the south, Sunday brothers on the edge of your northwest. 
---
1. You have the means, next level up use a point to get the perk to allow you to make them. Or find a friend that can share the relevant perk.
---
2. Why shouldn't they sell them?  Just because its valuable and rare they shouldn't sell them because they are expensive?  That makes no sense. And the majority of those plans can be found through other means.  Just keep playing. 
---
I agree DMCA'ing is kind of a shitty move. But  whats wrong with him using nude mods and why would I care about it. If he likes that stuff good for him who am I to judge. I have never seen him make any sexist or homofobic remarks but even if thats true why should I care about that ? I watch these videos purely for entertainment and lore information. Him being sexist racist or homofobic doesn't change anything about his content. Why should I care about this silly morality crusade ?. I find this outrage culture we life in today so anoying. It also comes from both the SJW and gamers alike. It's all so strange to me.
---
That’s literally not true, fact check yourself “b”
---
When I use a regular bloodied buzz saw without martial artist it did significantly less dps than a bloodied swing speed with martial artist
---
I’ve been using hunting rifle and fire axe for a while and just recently added combat shotgun into the mix. 
---
Damn. Checkmate
---
My personal theory is that graham was a traveling sales man or something that was abducted by the government and turned into a super mutant since all the other super mutants were military personnel who turned into homicidal maniacs. Since the military persons were trained and expecting to fight they turned into killing machines. The sales man just had his need to travel and sell amplified.
---
I’m thinking explosive 2 shot but idk depends on build 
---
Not this shit again. Berry. Mentats. 
---
Nah man, the difference between a 1 star and a 3 star buzz is 5% DPS if the 3star has str. Hopefully you didn't trade something nice for that secondary mod.
---
Dose it actually work? &amp; on ps4
---
Only for workshops. 
---
My god 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Yes you have to get rid of the mutation and regain it
---
Yeah I found out the hard way. I’ll probably start fresh when this weeks codes expire because I think that part is fun. Replacing the codes just costs a lot of caps with all the fast traveling &amp; I guess replacing the card isn’t that big of a deal though it takes plenty of bullets when you use a melee character. I was mostly just bummed that people who have probably launched dozens would want to take mine especially since i put in the effort most others don’t. They also knew I was solo &amp; couldn’t really fight back which was pretty mean.
---
Can never go wrong with a Gatling gun.
---
I usually see them spawn on a top of a dresser located on the second floor of Appalachian Antiques.  Careful, there is usually a boss up there with it.
---
&gt;The Awareness perk will show you exactly how much armor you're ignoring when you use incisor, Anti Armor weapons, armor piercing clips, etc. 
---
No you can't see the effect of armor piercing clips with awareness. So you checked it with awareness?
---
Yes materials saved
---
I think you meant ludicrous. Lol.
---
probably.
---
If you happen to find one can you sell it to me? My luck is shit so I probably won’t find it 😂
---
Well I’d say put in combat rifle then. It would work better with your current set up 
---
I’d use both. Hunting rifle for range and the combat rifle for medium and close. Unspecc’d shorty won’t do too much, it’ll just be a waste of shells.
---
Serious. Youve proven that it doesnt show up in vats, but not that its not having an effect. 
---
Last I heard, it was working on players, and useful for sbq fights.
---
They should track how many pissed off people quit playing this damn game after the last update that ruined 2 shot guns. I haven't and won't play another fallout game again! Fix what actually needs fixing and make the game stable before screwing over people that use two shot weapons and make melee players have a major advantage 
---
Flatwoods Monster
---
You can sell legendaries.
---
You could try in one of the active PS4 communities
---
Stumbling backward out of one of the treehouses in The Mire after a Wendigo leaped down at me.
---
Well, things like not defending them from PvE but doing the recapture(latter is always just one "wave"). Making the workshop big to deter players from initiating the PvP and hunting you down. Using blueprints for turret clusters and wiring.
---
Aim low.  Go for the legs and you'll get hits.
---
I play on PC.  Otherwise I would give you some for free, I go by there on my way to Watoga.
---
And can we please have the occasional Fo3 styled info loading screen?
---
So the way to get golfers, is to have a low level spawn them, because they only appear at lvl 10. So ask a lowbie to go there and spawn them if you're looking for them. They really should just give up on the game and let modders fix it. 
---
That's actually super nice of you! Thank you for offering c: I'm over it though. Yeah it sucks but I was actually more about finding/reporting a bug rather than truly recovering my caps. I guess I can use this opportunity to restart my cap count from a low amount and start trading around again. 
---
But again, thank you very much and I really like the way you're going about this. Just helping someone so they may help themselves later down the line. Stay awesome, man!
---
What are the rewards?
---
You weren’t even CLOSE to having a good title for this post. 
---
I'm level 90 at 414 hours and I've never even seen one. 
---
Surface to air event. Spawned in and encountered  3 lvl 80 scorchbeast, lvl 68 scorched, and oddly, a lvl 68 super mutant. All I can say is thank the merciful heavens that the event had to surface to air missile batteries. 
---
Besides the overpriced skins, bethesda did a very good job in the shop portion of the game i think. A one time purchase for an MMO lite game with free DLC and no subscription that is supported via a cosmetic cash shop is something I'd support and use if it wasn't so expensive. 
---
IMO they're afraid of people playing a lot and buying everything via in game atoms, so they bring the price up to ridiculous prices, i feel if they just made atoms cheaper or added a lot more items and lowered the cost of everything across the board it'd get a lot more monetary support from the community.
---
Yeah if you see people there, you have to look and see what levels, if they're level 20- RUN OVER and see if you can find some ghouls lol. 
---
I was in white springs a few days ago farming and went into the golf house. And I jump up on the display cases for god knows what reason. Then for some other reason ghouls are like hey that’s a nice butt you got there mind if me and my bros have a look. And well I turn and like 10 ghouls all just going at it. I died.... then I respond and killed everything and took no mercy 
---
If you're capable, some mines in front of you spaced far enough to not detonate eachother. A stealth headshot or two. So you get the sneak hit in, and a mine or two of damage before it smacks you. 
---
Or atleast, that's how I did it the last time
---
I feel this. Especially in nuke zones. Even flies can be hard to spot.
---
Yeah. It was the enclave uniform, thanks for answer 
---
Correct me if I am wrong but Fallout 76 takes place in 2102. Lets say the dwellers of Vault 76 are 25 when they entered the vault which means they would be around 50 when they leave in the year 2102. Fallout 3 takes place during 2277 so I don't think that would add up. Unless you mean that the dwellers of 76 are the parents of Doctor Li
---
I'd definitely want this for the higher priced/hard to get plans. Why should I have to pay 6k per power armor plan on each character if I have one who already knows it and could just transfer the item to that alt?  Makes no sense. 
---
Their "known" tag bug when it was first introduced as a feature made it seem like someone at BGS thought it already worked that way. 
---
Are you sure? Because in the challenge it says alien AND flatwoods monster
---
I’m not trying to be the king of right here, but where’s the proof it works? I’m ok with being wrong, but everyone claiming it works is entirely based on whether they felt like it did. There’s no quantifiable evidence (less shits to kill, etc) that it makes a difference under controlled conditions 
---
&gt; What I am 100000% sure is that Whitesprings has been nerfed in the last patch. I got 3-4 legendary items per run pre-patch. Right now, I get nothing at all or 1-2 items max.
---
That is not my experience, at all, are you sure you're farming it right? :-) Whenever I jump to Whitesprings, I go directly to the Golf Club (only when nobody else is around, I don't like the competition), and I'll reap between 10 and 15 legendaries in there, then I go through all the mansions and finally the courtyard and the service building with the laundry room, which will get me up to 10 more drops. All in all, there normally is up to 3 ***-legendary enemies at the club, plus 1 or two more at each of the other building complexes. I'll end up with up to 25 legendary items each run, most of them shitty 1-star armor, of course, but over the last days I went away with a 3-star Dragon, several Twoshot guns (no TSE, though, and I don't expect to), and a handful of explosive weapons as well (pistols and revolvers for now, but also a Zealot's Explosive Shotgun, among others).
---
Why you might think it's nerfed: I've run into Whitesprings with only low level ghouls spawning (because some low level player went through there shortly); in those cases you will encounter not even ONE legendary enemy. It is all about carefully selecting your server before you start your runs. My key points for a 'golden' server are: high amount of legendary enemies on the streets of Watoga, and a recently nuked Whitesprings. I only ever start farming after the blast zone fades away, and everyone high-level leaves the server. Then it's my turn, and I go back and forth between Whitesprings and Watoga. As long as you stay on a server, the same protectrons in Watoga will always spawn as legendaries (number of stars will vary each time, though). The same is true for the deathclaw spawn just north of Watoga: if it is a legendary deathclaw once, it will always respawn as a legendary, so I'll check that one too.
---
Punch it until its dead
---
Stealth build here. I killed my first 3 at around lvl 30 with no issue. Used sniper rifle and shot em in the head. 
---
At some point yeah. But those legendaries are dropping all over. So of course you use them.
---
Many are crap but the ones that aren't, are little rare. And really good ones are pretty rare and between.
---
It's the only alien in the game so likely it's the same.
---
Power armor has a chance of spawning and once it spawns it well then have another chance to spawn with a core and what not. So a core could spawn in armor or not. And no I don’t think the cores would respawn unless the area rests and a new set of power armor spawns in and the old one despawns
---
No kidding, the game is still buggy as shit to this day months after release. Whatever happened to releasing finished products on time?
---
I use it just couldn't see the 6 bombs coming out, good to know. 
---
Just play a different game until summer. I never understood why someone would continue to play something they are bored of.
---
Honestly I would love this well the devs listen? Only time will tell but it’s a great idea especially with how NV did it but they are some legendary buffs and receivers that apply armor piercing and explosive shot 
---
Really, I did it eventually around level 80 or whatever, like two months ago. Sorry I don't have a question.
---
Ushanka hat you say?
---
I was just in a SBQ battle and we only got her down to 25% when the time ran out.  Went through about 2.5K of rounds and broke three weapons.  It seems to me she is totally not worth doing anymore.  From what I hear, her loot drops suck most of the time and with the ammo I expend takes me a couple of days to get back up.  If there is a better way to kill her then that would be a YouTube video I'd watch and have my friends watch because obviously we are doing something wrong.  I'm 0 for 3 and not sure I'm going to try again anytime soon.
---
OP I have the same type location..if u fast travel again to ur camp ..it will take u to your camp (not at the bottom)..annoying I kno but better than walking up to it 
---
The 10th ghoul should be the mega boss. Like a ghoul Prime or something. Should drop a (useful) 5star. Should unlock the biggest achievement in all the land. 
---
What you are promoting is the idea that every player of every online MP game has to assume that he or she can and will be the victim of false accusations.
---
You are also claiming that thus, everyone has to constantly record his gaming sessions and keep the records for ever, just in case. Assuming you have piled up *900 hours* of playtime, do you have an idea how many GB of data we are talking about?
---
And let us assume we are talking about people playing on the PS4. Without a designated capturing device, which are not that cheap by the way, you actually *can* safe records of your gaming sessions - the last 20 minutes, that is. Which would mean that you would have to pause your game every 20 minutes to make a manual safe.
---
*And* you are assuming that the people *making* those false accusations would have even the slightest interest in actually *watching* those 900 hours. And I mean ALL of it, because otherwise who says you did not just send them 900 hours of random gameplay of other people or you porn collection. I am pretty sure you are aware how ridiculous that is and how the chances this would actually happen are.
---
But honestly, the most important point here is that your proposition treats every. single. player of online and MP games as suspicious and it demands from players to not only silently accept the idea of permanently being under general suspicion, but actually take precautions that might not only still lead to nothing else than people like the folks at Bethesda completely ignoring the evidence provided, but that are actually beyond the technical and financial capabilities of many gamers.
---
Was going to ask about the chances of allowing external forces to help branch out and make to apd xbox branch
---
Thanks for the info, it might just be unfortunate rolls for me. I've been farming for over 200 levels and I've never had such a bad streak before. I don't have a problem finding the 3* enemies, it's just the loot.....
---
Wasteland champion.

Exactly this, I’m only level 81 but I can’t remember the last time I saw one.

Stumbling into Line in the Sand in beta at level 26 with a level 15 gun.

I found 2 Quads within a couple days. A Quad Lever Rifle and a Quad Double Barrel Shotgun.
---
I am pretty sure it's the same. They are red in color and glow red with the head lamp on. 
---
Bro, I've done many dozens of SBQs, this isn't a reaction to mere anecdote, but to statistics.
---
Use the perks that reduce your targets damage output and damage resistance as well as the luck that can cripple your target. With good luck you’ll cripple the legs and he/ it can’t move or even attack if that. 
---
Found a quad lever action 30min ago
---
Falling into a Fissure while carrying all my junk

End game content.

Should be, pretty much anything but humanoid npcs scorched beasts and and special monsters like flatwoods monster and such cant be tamed. 
---
Basically if it looks like an animal and isnt a scorched beast you should be able to tame it for your camp
---
I'm pretty sure I found a quad sniper rifle on xb1 after patch. 
---
It was 20 caps for me not even kidding 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Whine whine cry cry don’t buy there next game ok good have a good time

Funny, that doesn't sound like a non-melee build. I do about 150-170 with wardrum and similiar.

The first time I went to the ski shop... I walked up by the back door where a bench was to scrap and saw some mongrels inside. Then I got hit from behind. Thinking it was the mongrels, I turned around to find my very first deathclaw right in my face. I screamed "holy shit!" and ran inside so fast. 😂😂😂 Figured I'd be safer with the dogs.
---
Hey, how do you get the title next to your name? Like it says Brotherhood next to yours.
---
Damn
---
[Burning damage is not quite strong in PvE. Even in PvE the burning damage is ass compared to just running a regular ballistic weapon.](https://youtu.be/aqMYBJqC8y4)
---
Burning damage is almost nonexistent, and the splitter mod has the potential to increase the output of lasers for maybe 2 clips before the gun double-breaks from 200% to 0%. And even then, you can still get outdamaged by ballistics.
---
The energy branch of guns is absolutely useless. It has barely any practical benefits over using ballistic in the slightest, with high maintenance costs and low practicality and utility.
---
Other responder is correct. Aliens technically arent in the game yet but they used a Zetan (fallout alien) for the base model of the flatwoods monster so t counts as both
---
They prob add more Aliens in the future.
---
How did you avoid getting banned for ~~playing too much~~ having too much ammo? 
---
If the rumours of fo3 remastered are real, what a great time for its release. Give people their remastered game like they want, and release the map for 76.
---
If he keeps breaking promises, soon. This isn't the first time he's done this. 
---
I'm more interested in 27 levels. What level are you where you don't even bother lol.
---
I just lured the Mirelurk King towards it, along with some Mirelurk Razorclaws and a Mirelurk Hunter. They killed each other until it was just the King left with half health, from there I hid in a corner and took pot shots with my crappy weapons. I was way too low a level to do it properly, so hiding like a baby helped a lot for me.
---
i play melee
---
Well, if you go back to your CAMP and all the purifiers are empty, I think that's a pretty good indication.
---
And if they aren't, then you're none the wiser, right?
---
I have found a 1-star Quad weapon just a few days ago, didn't keep it, and I'm not sure what weapon it was, most likely a heavy gun like a harpoon gun or a boadsider. Lots of Twoshot guns recently, Nocturnal is not rare for me, and my Nocturnal Explosive Flechettes Harpoon Gun is a keeper.
---
I have never, ever seen the Double prefix in my time with the game. RNG is just that, there is nothing uniform about drop rates.
---
I know right? I see this post so often. “I’ve played 700 hours and I’m bored what do I do?” 
---
Literally anything else. 
---
Jumping to Scorched Earth via the "Join Event" fast travel option....  
---
And spawning directly over the fissure. 
---
I doubt it so I always just collect the armor and scrap it just to make sure. 
---
Looking down over the side of a high ledge trying to spot a safe way down and a mongrel decided to nip me. Sent me almost to the bottom but I landed some how on the tiniest bit of outcropping took almost all of my health as I was collecting my wits he plopped down dead beside me frightening me a second time.
---
Same,  and the spawn point for me is south. 
---
However I remember last time I placed the camp and move it I was facing north. 
---
So,  do we spawn on the farthest point from the camp facing our back respect the position where we drop the camp?
---
Just killed my first yesterday after over 500 hours, and I got both challenges completed. 
---
I would love just to see player metrics
---
I'm not sure it has to do as much with what level as it does with it being your first visit to the golf course. My guess would be that they only spawn once the first time you visit and the only way to guarantee someone hasn't visited the clubhouse is to pick some level 10 dude from the forest and lure him out there with like a Snickers bar.
---
When the game lags at white springs golf club, and you go from no ghouls to 20+ ghouls surrounding you
---
Based on what I've seen, this explanation sounds plausible.  My friend always spawns around where I originally put my CAMP.  And for me, always to the north, always near this one particular tree, but slightly inconsistent in terms of how close to the tree I am.
---
Still kind of sucks though... I always spawn in the middle of my friend's foundation and I'm pretty sure this is why.
---
No problem buddy
---
whats the capital of Ukraine?
---
Right side of the forum, there is a edit and you can select a flair for your name
---
Be an adult and do what I did. Repeat it until you can do it in your sleep. No different then getting all the gold Relics on Crash Bandicoot. 
---
I would give you one of them, too, but I'm on PS4. But trust us, they are really not that rare. Sometimes I found 2 or 3 within Appalachian Antiques.
---
This is exactly the info I was looking for! I have an Anti-Armor blade with agility power attack damage (agreed useless) and it  melts. It pretty much insta kills anything under lvl 35. I just figured there had to be something better. I guess I’ll start hunting for a bloodied blade with limb and st or WR to add to the collection. I don’t really PvP, but the anti armor cripples the queen and keeps her on the ground significantly longer. 
---
Kiev?
---
&gt; modders are already more than halfway done making private servers.
---
Source/explanation? I'm curious what you mean by this. Bethesda has been pretty clear private servers will only be available through them.
---
I don't think the Wendigo is going to be your problem, it's those damn mire lurks and hunters that are a pain. Get a supersledge ..
---
It took me about a week and a half. I was surprised when I received absolutely nothing for thus achievement. For such a pain in the rear mission the ending was a joke.
---
Forget but ive played since beta
---
I’ll take a look probably won’t find anything 😪😂
---
That’s what descendants means, my posts asks what if the children of the people from vault 76 are our parents from Fallout 3. 
---
lol too funny :)
---
you could ask a higher level player to help out
---
I posted a few months about a possible solution to this - an event driven prioritization similar to the "Gambit" system in Final Fantasy XII. It didn't set the world on fire, but I'm still of the opinion that the creating "decks" is only solving parts of the problem and creating others.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajz7ok/one\_possible\_solution\_for\_perk\_management/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajz7ok/one_possible_solution_for_perk_management/)  
---
It's in the thread in more detail, but some of the problems with defining decks are:  
---
* Static decks don't adapt to additional cards and SPECIAL points. This isn't as big a problem after level 50, but means that every few levels you'll be redefining all your decks to benefit from new SPECIAL points.
---
* Your decks will be "full" loadouts, when nearly all circumstances need only two or three cards changed.
---
* Precluding combat scenarios you'll be faced with as many as nine or ten distinct decks (Day, Night, Camp, Hacking, Lockpicking, Weapons Repair/Crafting, Armor Repair/Crafting, Ammo Crafting, Food/Drink Crafting, Scrapping, etc.) If you include combat scenarios you 'll potentially add several more (power armor, regular armor, Melee, optimization for weapon types, etc.)
---
* While it makes it easier to change on the fly, it still requires you to break immersion to do so. It will also still require multiple actions in quick succession (pop in, change for lock picking, pick lock, pop in and change back... oh, there's a terminal, let's do this again...)
---
A system like the one I outlined isn't perfect by any means, but it addresses these, and other, problems, is significantly more flexible and adaptable. The system could be as simple or as complex as the framework needs and would be significantly useful at all levels.
---
I said it then, but any kind of "decks" manager simply streamlines a system that *shouldn't exist at all*.
---
I did it at level 15? It wasn’t that hard for me, but after I completed it I immediately got rekt by a level 62 gangrenous ghoul.
---
But at least I got Plague Walker from it.
---
I know this post is a month old but I just got a hooded rag outfit and was also disappointed that it removed all of the armor. I would love to rock this all the time but I'm  not going out of my camp unprotected either.. hope they fix this.
---
I’m finding a lot of wooden armor.  It’s not as exciting as it sounds 
---
What do you get for doing the quest?
---
What the guy above me said, plus: Next day or different server gives you a full chance for another spawn. When I'm server-hopping Watoga, I can easily stock up on cores, but when I stay on the same server, even for hours, they never respawn.
---
He asked for tips on how to kill it solo.
---
Fisticuffs all the way.
---
Ill add you too im vMarksman_81
---
So I've been wasting my time using that on SBQ then. Dammit.
---
Submit a bug if you've got pics, etc.
---
You can level one time and grab the level 1 card required for crafting the frag grenade. It’s what I had to do.
---
Ah didn't know that thanks. Yeah patio table might even have that on my alt. Let me check
---
Lvl 130 odd. 500+hours. 6/10. Got 5 in one day about a month ago but not from tbe clubhouse. They were in the houses to the side which used to be shops. On completing this quest you should be given 10 5 star Legendary weapons and armour and a million caps cos its bleeding impossible!!!
---
if you're doing Sneak/Crit/VATS with a Rifle, you're one of the few people who show up at SBQ and do any damage. 
---
Make sure you mod your weapons with Calibrated or Tweaked automatic receivers for the increased Critical damage multipliers.
---
I'll try that. Thanks for the tip. I don't really lock anything but I always feel greedy if I inherit a workshop with everything locked up.
---
Yeah I know she's been buffed. But when we show up and do all the dps, it's not the sbq, it's you.
---
Look to the right column on this page, where there's a checkbox and it says "Show my flair on this subreddit. It looks like:" Click on the EDIT link next to your user name below that to select your flair.
---
Oh yeah, target those wings with the buzz and it's like magic. Not consistent magic but magic nonetheless. 
---
For me, Nocturnal comes up with annoying frequency.
---
I did acquire one Quad legendary on my own and bought another from a vendor.  But that's literally it.  It doesn't seem like that prefix comes up particularly often.
---
If you open your map you can find out.
---
Yeah I can read, thank you for pointing that out. I’m sorry you don’t understand sarcasm 
---
Where do you find them? Never seen one and I’m level 90
---
It's because they don't spawn as high level ghouls.  They only spawn when no high level is in Whitespring.
---
Basically, you need to join a server that just happened to be created at the default low spawn level
---
I look at it this way, Grahm, volunteered his spot in the Vault so YOU can enter, thus we give him the respect he deserves.
---
Splitter mod was for pvp. Even though the gun breaks in 2 seconds, its still the single best sniper in the game. Burning damage is till burning damage. Yes we all know Energy damage is weak but that doesn't discredit how overpowered the Splitter mod is for pvp (and yes durability of all energy damage weapons is whack). 
---
I found a quad harpoon gun. Sold it to a vendor before I realized that it could be useful.
---
I'm doing Whitesprings right now and have had 2 3star and 4 1 stars. Still pretty decent odds, imo. 
---
Tbh I think I finished it, the reward was so insignificant that i cant remember
---
Cool story bro. Besides my team of three, the repeat show ups were all under 100, except for one. You keep puffin' though. It's not normally a good look, but it suits you. 
---
Under your challenges menu, you can look at your combat stats. It tells you how many of each type of creature that you have killed and the weapon that you killed them with. Up until you get the achievement at 1776 of each kind of creature anyway. Maybe more, I haven't killed that many of each one yet. LOL 
---
For the longest time I was stuck on one ghoul left, but then I went to a new area of the Whitespring that I had never been to before (the northernmost buildings) and completed it, so I’m assuming specific ghouls are tied to certain areas of the Whitespring and won’t spawn any where else.
---
Safes. Boss mobs. Events. 
---
Yeah i usually Melee &amp; clear mobs when shes flying, and shoot her when the mobs are clear 
---
I would rather get it through an update rather then cheat like that
---
Just get good, I can fight them with my fist easily with no power armor 
---
&gt;  It's more of how you guys lack passion for the game.  
---
Just...no. Your 1 mutation not working does not show them not having passion. Get over youself please, game devs are people too. Criticize their work sure, criticize how they've done things, but to say they don't "Have passion" for their jobs. it's just uncalled for and childish.  
---
Entitlement culture really gets bad when you start feeling entitled to knowing how people think and feel. 
---
I’ve always found cryo grenades, head shots and frag grenades effective for wendigo.  If you can kite the mirelurks into the mix without catching all the aggro, even better.
---
Proven: Being high level does not mean high level of intelligence. 
---
I feel ya 100%. I hate whitespring nukes and monster mash. Mostly because I know in the end I’m going to run out of FC and Radaway. 
---
Trying to remember the map marker name. It's between Pickett's fort and the downed space station. There are usually 3 that spawn there. You need 2 different perks cards in order to pick these up.. home defense(Max I think) and light footed.
---
Quad cryolator
---
Customer service*. Marketing are the asshats who try to make a cow into a princess to sell it to you.
---
I was thinking about getting this as my first fallout title in a few more months when its hopefully fixed up a bit better, but seeing things like this just upsets me, i am big on playing games that care about their customers. This may be a deciding factor for me to just pass on this and other online bethesda titles for the future. I would hate to put soo much time into something only to be permanently banned for something like this, without any warning or 3 strike system.  I think ill just save the money and buy persona 5 instead, I've been hearing great things about that game anyway.
---
Stumbled on this even by total accident yesterday, wasn't even trying to end it. Just found the horde.
---
Event worked okay to me, despite me nor trying to trigger it in the first place but had to fight for my life. Hence I finished it.
---
Some people are actually nice. 
---
I have never seen this drop in all my time playing, not sure they do and the prices in the store indicate they do not. I have seen the barn wall and warehouse plans drop during a workshop. You likely going to have to buy these or see if someone will sell them to you cheaper, they going to cost you a mint since they pushed up the prices which are now ridiculous for these.
---
I killed 2 on my first time there. That was the day after I got the game. November 27 to be exact. I was like level 10 maybe. Level 79 and I haven't seen another one. LOL 
---
Do you sell them to vendor bots? I have a theory: selling items increases the chances for getting the same type again but with different legendary effect. I still need 100 drops on my part at least to be more confident.
---
Thanks!
---
Nuke zones and events. 
---
Wtf, I did it in 2 hours 
---
That's how they supposed to work, but if you get disconnected, the stuff stays. So what you could do, is quit your game instead of leaving normally and I bet it will remain for the next person. It might be worth a test to see if you left normally if the working items stayed, I know in the beginning the assumption is they disappear, but I have seen so many workshops which I took over when unowned with items still intact, my guess is it might just remain intact.
---
RNG did drop the other 21 prefixes and I am logging all my drops to uncover any bias.
---
So what constitutes a golfer ghoul? Can I get credit for them during a nuke event. 
---
Yeah strategy guide lists a few variations of aliens that seem to have been cut from the game. There’s some other info in there that’s not accurate (bowling ball launcher for fat man).
---
Hoping they give us some serious alien content with the new cryptid events coming up. Would love for them to make the alien blaster good again too. Hopefully we can upgrade it in the future 
---
So what you're saying is that you've transcended into fighting lag. 
---
Not true, it works all the time.
---
How did it feel when you realized you could have done this 364 levels ago very easily?
---
Gun powder rifle, shoot it with a sneak critical, them stab it to death with your most powerful stick. I personally enjoy a bladed mole miner gauntlet.is is quite powerfull.
---
This is well and good, but these stories always sound like overwrought virtue signaling to me.
---
OP gave away some extra stuff, explained a few things, and teamed with a lowbie for a bit. I just don't see the 'amazing' story, as people are calling it. 
---
Sorry to be that guy.  
---
Kill things 
---
Same man. The faster reload is amazing with my quad lever action. Couldn't go back to not having that.
---
I got one for you, free of charge. GT: Jose Ambuervo
---
I found one. Thank you though!
---
Jeeeeez
---
50 cal or Gatling gun are the two best heavy guns in the game imo. Personally I like 50 cal more but crafting the ammo will eat your steel up quick so stock up.
---
Anti armor is a great effect for either. Same with explosive. Furious 50 cals are damn good too. Gatling guns benefit a lot from the +25% rate of fire effect.
---
I also like the harpoon gun a lot. Explosive with flechette mod is nasty. And I just found a quad one that’s a ton of fun. Only a 1 Star but having four harpoons ready to go is a blast. 
---
Rifleman I’d say go for a handmade, gauss, or lever action. Instigating is a good effect if you’re a sniper. Goes well on hunting rifles too.
---
Reported to Bethesda, obviously cheating...
---
Hotkey radaway and non-stimpack healing items so you can heal during ghoul fights.
---
Remember their GT, get ya squad up, make a plan and get revenge. 
---
No I’m just Abraham the lincanator 
---
I found a quad combat rifle. Level 40
---
&gt;  vanguard gear pushing my damage resistance and energy resistance to almost 400 
---
There's your issue. Vanguard is great, but against ghouls or nuke zones, you're going to want gear that also has the radiation resist. If you have it on every piece of gear and use Radshield, you can handle nuke-zones and ghouls pretty well.  
---
Non-power armor builds are very rewarding, but often require much more gear, and lend themselves to stealth builds.
---
Wish you could save more than 50 pictures at a time
---
You can get legendary ultracite laser rifles and pistols. Not Gatling lasers though. Got a quad pistol sitting in my stash right now
---
Quad just means you have quad ammo capacity,  not that you do 4 slots.  So no,  it consumes the same amount of ammo. 
---
I gathered that with my anti-armor, but I’m sure the limb damage would help drastically. I don’t suppose you’re on PS4 and willing to sell one from your collection?
---
Mega oof. Also happy cakeday👍
---
I’d recommend using VATS with the mirv. Free aiming it is a lot trickier than a normal fat man. It does a ton of area damage though since it shoots like 6 mini nukes. The damage on the stat screen is per nuke so it’s more in total than a regular
---
Now you have to meet in game and PvP. It is known. 
---
I use two identical chainsaws that do this.
---
I’m pretty sure when you kill things that gives you experience the direct result of which is leveling up. 
---
Found a quad harpoon gun last night. It’s really fun. Only a 1 Star but I like it a lot
---
A sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
i killed my first one at level 36...... sadly thats the only one ive ever killed
---
Sniper, aim for the knees.
---
You could use drugs and perks to boost your speed perhaps. Gain a bunch of time on the easy bits, take your time on the hard ones. Or you could get someone else to do the work.
---
Thanks
---
u/lordbaronstein on PS4 has a similar shop!
---
Quad western revolver
---
Im still on 0 lol
---
Remember their tag. They will come “online” sooner that later.
---
Get a group of people you like to roll with. Track him down and mini nuke his place. And put a nuka Grenade in his toilet. 
---
What's a golfer?
---
Clean versions of - Spacesuit, Straight Jacket, Ranger Hat, Ranger outfit.
---
And Skiing Purple &amp; white , Skiing Red &amp; Green.
---
It's called "adrenal reaction"...i think you lack passion for this mutation. 
---
Defend workshops. Easiest way to get CAMP plans. You cab set up 2-4 workshops and then just defend them as the events come. Each defense yields a plan and some other stuff.
---
Got my 9th and 10th just last week.
---
Defending workshops and cleaning them gives guaranteed plans of all types it's best to get them there 
---
Thank you will grind more
---
Being 300 lbs overweight and with 3 broken pieces of armor and attacked by 2 scorchbeasts at the same time.
---
What would force them to come online? 
---
In essence, you have answered my question by saying "no, you can't follow someone who appears offline".
---
Never using an energy weapon until I found a g-d, m-f'n  savage assaultron head...was so excited...then I believed I actually screamed "Ah $#!+"!!! F THAT THING 
---
Being level twenty-ish and thinking ‘Yeah I can totally take that hermit crab...’
---
In no particular order of importance:
---
1) To show a possible FEV effect, reinforcing the lore.  Someday, we may have a playable super mutant
---
2) To make the world a little less lonely
---
3) To learn about meat.
---
You cant
---
Anything. A game they play with other people. There are many an option.  If your on Xbox you can “follow” them by search their name and following but not friending. 
---
There is a vaccine quest for the immunization of the scorch plague, I guess we can assume that we were all lucky to not get infected until completing that quest.
---
I haven’t came online in probably about 3 years soo... not a greifer I’m just saying some people never appear online. And no there is no way to track a player who appears offline, Ive tested with my buddies and they never know, you used to be able to favourite the player and it would always show but they changed that about 7 months ago.
---
Srry been busy do you still need
---
Took me awile to get them all, best to have a friend hold him while you relog , he will reload inventory .. 
---
The Clean Spacesuit was around 700.
---
The Skiing outfits were 18
---
The Straight Jacket about 430.
---
If you find any others please let me know :)
---
In summary, you want the game made easier.
---
What did you get as a reward?
---
I don't really either in workshops, now in my C.A.M.P, I leave water open, but lock whatever resource because I never have enough in budget for more than two turrets. 
---
My odd logic is that if a player is going to destroy my C.A.M.P, they're going to first unlock the resource. Instant bounty on them, making myself and everyone else aware of it before actual destruction begins.
---
Explore the map do quests and kill things.
---
I have said I want to try again and this sounds fun.  Might finally do an Armored Militant.  Specialize in heavy weapons with Power Armor and Sniper/Pistol Build for casual hunting.
---
Sorry man I'm on PC and tbh I've never traded away any buzz blades. It's the best weapon in the game, I can't just go giving it to people. I even collect the ones with really awful rolls just because they have such terrible rolls lol
---
I received the red barn and steel building from owning and defending Billings Homestead. Now this was on different days. However the same place.
---
at their level...forest horde events...250xp base for each location plus the enemies there... so up to 1500xp...plus if youre in a team well rested etc. 
---
I want some in power armor
---
Off topic:
---
I'm a level 300 and I've never killed a scorchbeast before
---
For the agility training/obstacle course, you don't need to actually do the ridiculously easy obstacles, if I remember correctly. Simply hit the buttons in order, the game counts that as you completing the course, and it helps you skip the... Tricky? Bits.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Just tried...doesn't work 
---
Without the BS...i lost all the benefits from that mutation. all i have from it is -12 HP and im not gonna snipe the other mutations i have just to get it back not knowing if its fixed.
---
I think brick walls are available from the Whitesprings Rail Station vendor.
---
I definitely agree with this. I want 3 decks.
---
One for crafting/repairing
---
One for outside power armor
---
One for power armor
---
There’s a lot of perks that only work with or without Power Armor and I have a mix of them on my build, because I need that extra oomph if I break out the T60, and I don’t have time to waste tinkering with dozens of cards.
---
They also announced mods wouldn't be out until end of this year but there are tons of mods already out.
---
just regular ghoul in golf outfit you can see in golf club
---
very satisfying as i don't  have to see it in quest list
---
People are going on just fine at level 25. Key word going in. Hazmat suits are a dime a dozen and there a ton guides to get one.  All they need to is get a few hits on a mob and let the big boys finish it. 
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/fo76-35Co9T3WYUhDgdJpwZ
---
nothing. it just disappears without any reward
---
To bad I’m on PS4 then because that ant-armor is my it’s my favorite weapon and I need more lol. I’m currently an unyielding sentinel build, so I’m looking for a bloodied one now. But Im thinking next I want to try making a new character and doing vanguard sent with a vampiric and suppressor blades. I feel like the vanguard and vampire would be invincible. 
---
Very slick!  What types of wood did you use?
---
I'm far from some sjw but you read his blog he says some shitty stuff. My biggest issue is the DMCA but for others it's the other shit he spewed on his blog. 
---
 Numerous games have agility exercises.  Trial and error.  It might take a hundred tries, or a thousand.  Good luck getting your money back.
---
To me thats the issue...best way to level up? roll with people who are OP and just tag one meaningless shot and get XP for it. Kinda lame. Oh well best bet then is roll w higher levelppl, let them do all the work and just spectate.
---
Lame
---
I'm level 80 and up to 4 now.  Where the hell are they??
---
Join us in the Xbox club: The RGG Group. Team up with higher level players and watch the xp roll in. We're on now 😁
---
Yeah but I won’t be on till around midnight is that cool
---
Yeah that's good
---
I will have to rate this whitesprings experience as undivine because of this!
---
Hah, I just gave up and got the Vault-Tec one at Atomic shop. I saw it selling at the Whitespring furniture store, but glitched and lost the chance to buy it.
---
I've actually grown fond of the Vault-Tec one, though, despite not loving it at first.
---
Anyway, my only recommendations would be the aforementioned vendor or Phoenix or whatshisface in Harpers Ferry
---
They were referring to officially supported mods through Beth.net like FO4 and Skyrim. Obviously what people are able to do on PC is a different thing altogether.
---
I wasn't saying I didn't believe you, I was just asking where you got this info because I haven't heard anything about it. So, do you have a source or no?
---
If not mistaken the higher ghouls are supposed to be the older ghouls. As for clothing it probably tore off. But I know what you mean. 
---
The best part is that I heard the quest respawns.  I hope to holy heaven that it doesn’t I can’t suffer through that again 🤣
---
They have stated every patch that they are working on it. Shame it has taken this long however. 
---
You can get right outta here with that talk, sir. It’s just a slogan!
---
I feel ya. That’s just what people will do. It sucks but what can you do. 
---
Works with 1 handed melee I use it it's great. 
---
I'm pretty sure it affects all melee damage 😊
---
I want to be able to use this to stimpack my friends from a distance. xD 
---
What are you going to do next?
---
... Would I come across as uncultured or unintelligent if I asked what the hecky "gritz" was?
---
The serum specifies unarmed only. 
---
Giving you rads when you drink it? 
---
As a griefers or, "raider" what I do is use a alt account and follow the players gamertag. When they accept it i join the world with my alt and inv a friend. I tell him to stay on server, I switch account and join with my friends inv. Ez Pz.

lol same I thought it was bugged or something, which obviously it is.  First time in whitespring I killed 5 just by roaming around the holes and now I'm 93 and still only have those 5.  I started a new character though because it just got boring.  They should up the max weapon level to a bean, same with the enemies and make scorch beasts able to get up to 150.  If you can gain infinite levels they gotta compensate in the rest of the game as well
---
You can drink a bunch if you want to try for a mutation
---
Yes! I was having this issue earlier after a legendary robot blew himself to high hell in the tall grass. 
---
I joined
---
What level will prestige be?
---
Oh no i understand that. the ppl i roll with know this too its why we go into the mire unarmed. We like the challenge. We know where the "farms" are but we dont need that. Gamers gonna game...i just figured at least at lvl 25 id offer them somewhat of a challenge without a super high level OP handling it for them.
---
also side note if any lvl 25s are seeing this 
---
grab lead steel an nuclear waste and go takr the Excavator. Earth Mover event/quest
---
Where’s a good place to get radaway, I’ve tried getting mutations but ended up low on health for a long time
---
Honestly, I just want some way to trade duplicate cards in for new ones. I've got a few that came in packs, and others where I accidentally picked one not realizing I'd already maxed the card.
---
Vanguard with the right vampire weapons is what I'm working on now. I think the vampire buzz is just a fantastic choice for that build but on the new toon I'm working with a vampire shotgun that seems to heal for each pellet so it's really nice too.
---
Wait, seriously???
---
Brilliant. Bethesda please
---
Look up rcayton1, he sold me a bunch a couple weeks ago.
---
Feel the hate flow through you.
---
Oh the irony.
---
You want to follow another player to another server for the purpose of subjecting them to interactions potentially perceived as negative?  That sounds like something a griefer would do.
---
You just have to be in whitesprings at a low level. They didn’t expect people to end up mass grouping at whitesprings so unless you and anyone else there is low level they spawn, it’s not a chance encounter.
---
They all think it’s a random encounter lol
---
Yeah. Go ahead and test that. Its how it works.
---
Two shot and instigating loses durability fast. :p
---
What system are you on?
---
Uhhh I’ll just trust your word I need my ammo 
---
Any good spots for .308 ammo?
---
Ps4
---
Wasn't meant to be as smart ass as it sounds, after I finished it I realized how super easy it is if you know what ghouls you're looking for. Congrats!
---
Happy cake day!
---
Hit the Watoga emergency services. Or enclave bunk they have decontamination arch. 
---
What’s a decontamination arch?
---
i'll try to kill all wendigos in clown costume
---
We do really if you think about it, its just we don't pick them up as such, the ammo changes dependant of magazine type.
---
Wit the stinging magazine its not the actual magazine that does the stinging, but the bullet inside it.
---
But yea, would be nice to have to actually find the bullet for the magazine type.
---
Heard ammo factory makes it. 
---
Farm lucky hole mine for lead ore.
---
Take the golf course in top left of map for acid.
---
Farm uranium fever and scrap guns for steel. 
---
Gunpowder I get stacks of from super mutants.
---
I thought this was a glitched quest, I am glad that it is able to be completed, congrats
---
It acts as a unlimited Radaway 
---
you can prestige after lvl50, and you'll become lvl 1 legendary character
---
Bummer, but thanks for trying
---
Eventually they might be able to, but the engine wasn't designed to track that stuff. Remember, at its core, the game is built off of FO4. It's more of a design failure than a simple fix.
---
Level 50 I believe 
---
There is a story with quest but they don’t intrude on you to do them. The game is mostly explore and whatnot. 
---
thanks!
---
Could you build an extreme staircase up?
---
I'm unsure of what still is around.
---
But in the last 2 weeks I have found from legendarys about 5 bloodied weapons.
---
All of them very good but not bought from anyone, people are saying that some people got all their duped stuff deleted down to 1 bit then say others they know didn't get they stuff wiped and had tons of duplicate stuff.
---
So it could be possible but am not confident of what alot of people say on fallout lately so much lying made everyone sceptical. 
---
So do the ballistic ones. People shouldn't have to spend tons of ammo to kill higher level enemies. I understand the legendaries should be hard. Please un-nerf the energy as well as ballistic. It is supposed to be a first person shooter, right? I fell like I'm playing Syrim, I have mostly melee, and it just gets old. Who's with me?
---
Not really, no. It sounds like a terrible idea. Factions would be much better, which is thankfully what they're doing.
---
Add me. I'll give you some in a little bit
---
It is an exploration game, the questing though isn’t the best. It’s mostly a grind to become stronger and better weapons
---
I want to regrief/ put a bounty on a griefer but that griefer shows themselves as offline.  I don't see what is so hard to understand here
---
Yea I think so also but I don’t see anything concrete. Thanks tho I’m just gonna for it I guess
---
Pointless and derivative.  Maybe he should do one about youtubers making the same video over and over again.
---
I just want a laser rifle to not break in 3 shots. Been asking for this since launch.
---
Well I can honestly tell you that there is a storyline, however it feels more like direction to the next “area” to explore, and I am the kind of player who thoroughly goes threw each area and enjoys exploring.
---
I think this game is amazing! And if I never spoiled the creatures for myself I think I would be having much more fun since I could explore them as well! (I’m sure there are a few I haven’t seen yet but I’ve seen the biggest baddest ones already from watching YouTube videos) 
---
Cool, what does he say? Because I sure as hell won’t fall for a clickbait title.
---
I got the adrenal serum from a SQB drop.  Wasn't sure if it was worthwhile so came here to research.  Good to know its not working right now.
---
If it was, is this one of the better ones?  I already have marsupial w/starched genes.
---
You and everybody else here. 
---
We definitely should!
---
Talons gives -4 agi so I don’t really want to use if it doesn’t do 1H yknow
---
He basically compares the two sides and explains why both sides formed
---
That’s interesting! Since both are based off st why not both? You don’t have to have cards dedicated to it to make it a decent back up 
---
Bethesda barely even acknowledges that NV exists, the chance that they incorporate a single positive change from NV is less than zero.
---
Jeez I guess I’m lucky I never knew this was a thing
---
At the start he nitpicks about several minor things, then he says how several things could be designed slightly bit differently (meh, but ok), and then he uses these bits to paint such an amazing vision for what this game could become that he just blows everyone’s tops right off. 
---
How do you tell them from the other ghouls? I killed 1 last night, no idea
---
Heh, oh man, read the title and thought someone was starting an RP group of socialists in-game.  
---
Thank god.  I came here to say this, and expected to be shouted down.  I really don't care about having a camp, it serves no purpose for me.  If I'm in the game, I'm moving, I've no interest in maintaining a static position.  When I need to tinker or whatever, I do it wherever I am, and that is certainly useful, but otherwise I have no use for it.
---
A larger stash, on the other hand, would be most welcome.
---
Worth it. It deceptively starts as a nitpicking video, but becomes a very grand game design vision in the second half. 
---
**Worth the 2 hours**
---
And it’s blocked at level 10?
---
Yeah lol
---
Do you get laid?
---
How does a level 10 survive solo?
---
Sounds like you got suckered.
---
The ghouls spawn at your level wtf
---
I'm more of a Gatling man, myself.  Slow, steady DPS with built-in stagger allows me to kite hordes of mobs around while my Gatling throws hammers at the ensuing mobs.
---
So you’re just straight bare knuckling ghouls? 
---
I have seen anything less than 50. I just hit 38 last night
---
One of the Beth people here in reddit (on one of the other threads)  said they’ll circulate it inside Bethesda. 
---
This game is excellent for that. The different zones have a cool unique feel, and I love exploring in this game even more than grinding for experience. I did most of my leveling u to ~30 or so just by exploring as many locations as possible and fighting along the way. Tons of fun :)
---
Did you read anything in my comment, other players scale the levels. You have to go there as level 10 when others aren’t there already 
---
I have about 600h hours in, level 157, and it's been sitting at 6/10 since before level 50. 😂😂
---
Yeah, I've got a bunch of useless ballistic weapons collecting dust. Somebody should tell Bethesda that M-2 (Ma duce) 50. Is the most powerful heavy machine gun in the world. They where mounted on WW2 fighters. So if it can take down a ME-109 it should handle supetmutants and the rest. Our military still uses them. The gun design  is a hundred years old! It shoots accurately up to two miles! And don't get me started on the minigun. That thing should be devistating.
---
Golf sweaters and visors. 
---
Awesome
---
Depends on your build   
---
Okay then
---
As someone who is level 52 and hasn’t played in months ,and never launched a nuke; what is a golfer ghoul? :O I’m intrigued 
---
I'm at almost 200 hours and that's pretty much all I've done.  I've only completed the main quest up through the first town.  
---
I have to say thanks, I never got to thank the first guy who helped me. At least now I try to keep the mic nearby to do so! I’ve only come across 2 “bad” players and they were together killing others. For the most part it’s been great people like you! 
---
25% damage is 4 perk points. 25% AP is 1 point for melee. 
---
Left it in a tunnel. 
---
Geez I posted this like 2 times already but here, from the other night.. Pause on frame one didn't catch the full but just shows how much damage I do. Look at the grey on the bar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KGQARCiy3s
---
I was being chased by a wendigo and ran into a deathclaw.  Game over, man...game over.
---
For a stealth melee build, one handed is nice since it’s quiet and fast. 3-4 quick hits at 2x damage is better than one massive hit usually, but stealth isn’t for everyone.
---
What do you plan on selling when the vending machines come out
---
You can, as you level up past 50!
---
That sounds dope. My gt is Sepia Seacow. I’m on now if y’all wanna add me.
---
I was at Charleston train station today and he had 2.
---
Sounds good.
---
Oh, man.  That first tunnel in the game where you have to lay out explosives at night.... Damn.  Now I need to go play it now.
---
For my  sneaky bastard sniper, I chose shielded Enclave Urban. 
---
Tanking and killing 3 80 SB and walking. Sadly ran out of stims and ran into a traveling deathclaw merchant that killed me for not buying his human bones. 
---
Just another long drawn out video regurgitating everything we see on reddit everyday to remain a relevant YouTuber 
---
Traps are exempted from slap damage.. that’s kind of their point. You have to be trespassing/breaking into someone’s camp for them to damage you. 
---
Platform? 
---
I think you mean "indeterminable" reason, as in you cannot determine why. The optimization isn't \*horrible\*, but it could do better indeed. Most people don't seem to notice how epic the view distance of everything is in this game though.
---
I'm only level 70 something and I've never seen one. What's the secret?
---
&gt;that you find in the clubhouse.
---
Haha, "that you find"
---
1. added
---
Forgetting I placed a nuke mine down and then having my ungrouped friend tp to me
---
Class freak 3 my guy. It's a necessity if you run multiple mutations IMO 
---
Same.
---
Added you.
---
Thanks. Seems obvious now. I think what threw me was I thought fountain was a water fountain not a drinking fountain.
---
I just ran into a duper thenother day at Whitesprings. A lvl 13 with over 200k combined of various ammo, massive amounts of junk items, and one of almost every weapon type imaginable. 
---
Got video of the interaction too.  As soon as I get the time to set up a YT and get the video up, BGS will be getting a copy, since their email system evidently couldn't handle the 25mb video I sent a while back about a bug. 
---
They deserve it. Too bad it seems like the concerns of their fans are considered the joke of the week. This whole thing has really opened my eyes to Bethesda. 
---
Wow then this game is perfect for you. It’s just 5x more are to explore. The map is pretty incredible, definitely FO76 strong point. I think you’ll enjoy it quite a bit if that’s what you intend on doing.
---
"Around" the clubhouse. The circle is there, but the actual ghouls could be anywhere on the property. Got my last one up by the condos.
---
This definitely works against players though 100%. If you guys want proof then get online with a buddy, check your damage resist and then get shot with the endangerol. I literally always have one on me. 
---
I agree. It does work on the sbq, we use it and see the grey bar move. Same with tenderizer, "it just works".
---
And disease chance. 
---
The rads are sweet though. Between dilute radaway and toxic water, I'm able to balance my rads right at 80% to keep Nerd Rage and Emergency Protocols active. 
---
Ama huh. Is it worth going back to finish the main quest line. I got up to the Boss base, but I lost the spark to keep playing. I'm about lvl 43
---
At what point did you start getting bored out of your mind? Level 70?
---
Have you found all of the overseer tapes?
---
There are two red tool chests, one 2 feet tall and one 5 feet tall.  There are two lockers.  One grey, one white. 
---
Yeah it works. Put in on a alt after the patch.
---
Quad double barrel shotgun from white springs nuke drop. Pretty dang sweet
---
These are in no particular order, but in retrospect here's are some pointers I would've liked to know when i first started.
---
• Be careful which quest you finish early on. Some quest will give you a unique weapon as a reward but the weapons stats will be limited to your current level. To get the best out of these unique weapons I would suggest do certain quest once you hit level 50.
---
• Workshops are an easy source of junk for most beginners, but are also a wonderful source of plans for your camp. While, you can't gain all plans from workshops you can still get some of the nicest furniture for an easy job of claiming or defending your workshops.
---
• Carrots/Haze/Corn are all great sources to make soup. Soup will help deal with starvation and hydration. Also, having the perk Green Thumb is easily one of my favorite perks on the game for farming. The perk allows you to get twice the amount of food from one plant or flower.
---
• This point is kind of debatable, but I personally never repaired weapons or armor until I hit level 50. Since weapons scale till 50 I never saw a point of holding onto these items since you can find the same weapon/armor but with better stats after a couple levels, but as I said this is de debatable.
---
•Lastly, if you ever get to level 50 or at least 40 go visit the fallout 76 marketplace subreddit here. I have gotten some of favorite weapons from here, so if you have the caps I would recommend seeing what people have. 
---
I hope some of this helps. If you have any questions I be more than happy to try answer them. Good luck in the wasteland!
---
Nice!
---
How can you put 700 hours into a broken failed game full of bugs and super low score ?
---
I mean don't you have better games to play ? Too much time ? Rich parents ? 
---
If you need some help I can send you a RE-2 code from steam my bro, so you can play an actual good game.
---
I go naked with a sledge and kill mutants, ghouls and horde events. No armor so repairs only needed for the sledge. I don't carry junk so when I die I spawn right close and don't care about picking up stuff. I'm a sniper build but melee is so broken it doesn't matter. 
---
Horizon Zero Dawn had great detail. Kills, types, finds etc....
---
Random
---
Ahh I see there Ad Victorian wait minuteman WAIT NO MORE FALLOIT 4 PLS BROTHERHOOD EVIL
---
What is the level cutoff? Anybody know for sure?
---
I'm at 9 right now on my level 70, and on my 'main' I only managed to get 10 around level 130. No idea how the spawns work because I had seen the golfers spawn next to level 68s gangrenous ghouls, but then never again.
---
Possibly make it so medium and long scopes have alt dot sight mods for them so you can toggle which one you want to use
---
Dude I remember it, super creepy. Not much else going on beyond that tho
---
Like when the queen drops to a meat pile in tall grass?  
---
The fact that THE boss of the game does this is completely asinine. 
---
I really wish there was. I guess the unexplained circumstances make it weirder, the sacrifice upstairs is also creepy af. 
---
They definitely know how to crash the servers. Wouldn't doubt it still going on.
---
I did it last month in my second trip to Whitespring. That’s also around the time someone told me to logout and log back in to jump servers - didn’t know that was a thing. I was level 44 and server hopped 7 times to get my 10 golfers.
---
I'm sure it is. He had way too much stuff on him. We tried to kill him through slap damage but he just logged out.  We were at least going to deprive him of all his duped junk items. 
---
The Overseer has the most annoying and unlikable personality. I would very much like to see her fed to a scorchbeast.
---
With Super Duper perk and Ammo Smith, I can make a shit on in no time steel is never an issue with me. I usually have so much, I dump tons of it. 
---
It’s 45 seconds for 5 rounds 5.56 if you run the number that’s about 200 rounds in 30 min
---
It’s the end of the world. People are trippin out. Plus the moth cult and whatever else is out there. 
---
Good to now, if only I  can get the targeting HUD, I finally got the jetpack yesterday.  I've been server hopping for three days now.    
---
https://youtu.be/-Z1IDSZ83l8 it’s at the end kind of. Fallout 76 funny moments how to stop grief killings 
---
I did six back in November/December and then nothing... 
---
Yesterday whipped through Whitesprings and thought to myself, "The ghouls sure are dressed differently." "Quest" closed.
---
I hope there's a big animation like Pokemon. 
---
I’ll send you a message when I play again
---
Kill em all. Ps4 unfortunately here.
---
I'm sometimes, perversely, glad it's not just me. Last night I was on a Queen kill and I got an Event Failure because it didn't die in time because it wouldn't fucking die. And then the other Scorch and whatnot meatpiles took 20+ minutes to load. I was bored enough that I actually hung around just to see if they would. \*sigh\*
---
I was typing on mobile so it was a fucking nightmare to even see how paragraphs were or were not working. Thanks though, I need to figure out the reddit modes of hiding stuff.
---
You have to be in combat.
---
It’s because your character is in Caution/Danger mode (when an enemy is nearby or has detected you).
---
I get bounties all the time when dealing justice to griefers. "Just because Zangief is bad guy, does not mean Zangief is BAD GUY".
---
I dupe my soup
---
ur gt?
---
I've tried, and it didn't work.
---
Lmfao. I finished this quest in 2 days. Level 67
---
Really? I never realized that. I feel like I’ve seen that animation outside of combat. Oh well, that definitely makes sense though. Thanks.
---
Easier? in where did you read it should be easy?
---
I guess you have to reread the topic again.
---
Dam bro, I’m weak after reading this
---
Obviously that's what I have to do NOW, but instead of giving us stupid perks that we can't finish, why not just being able to give us perks that we CAN finish.
---
Will you lose all perks? Have they addressed the benefits? 
---
I got mine at Welch, but also saw it in grafton
---
I wasn't trying to have a "good title" reddit is a shithole, and I'm not here to impress you tard.
---
Real talk fellas, there is a specific building that is full of them. The hitch? It's actually just outside the circle inside Whitesprings that the quest map data gives you. It's above the circle something like a quarter inch zoomed all the way out, think it's mostly centered but it might be off to either the left or right. I don't quite remember, finished this hundreds of hours ago. Hope this helps some people out.
---
I second this. Use caps and not atoms and Make them placeable inside your camp.
---
Mothman cult place to me was worse honestly 
---
I have "keep playing" this game, and yet the plans don't drop, instead I get shitty recipes or legendaries that is 5 levels lower than I am, it's dumb af.
---
Arrived at white spring train station with perk card set up for trading/scrapping. Two low level players were trying to kill three scorched beasts and a ton of mole miners. We persevered, killed them all. One of the guys had died 6 times..... nothing like spawning directly into a sonic attack.
---
That would be pretty cool, if they haven’t been keeping track they better start soon
---
Where did I say I wanted to be a god at this videogame? I think you need to reread the topic again, never have I said I wanted to overpower this game in any way.
---
Neither, handmade rifle all the way.
---
https://imgur.com/UfCCdhR
---
"Give me give me" Lol, it's not much "give me" it's more like "Add this, so the game makes sense."
---
Fyi. Server hopping helped me get through this quicker, it felt like id find one every other server then have to hop again.
---
Did you not read the first line?
---
Did your eyes start glowing? Was lightning shooting from your fingertips? Did your dick increase in length and girth tenfold?
---
Upvoting because “Less shits to kill” would make a very fashionable T-shirt.
---
How can you bother to follow a sub for a game you don’t like
---
You're English is pretty good but I think we're losing something in translation here 
---
that’s the real challenge 
---
I have the plan so I can make one if you want.  GT is BenevolentDM
---
From my understanding this quest is bugged in the following way. It's meant to be completed at a lower level, I think possibly level 10-12 but of course the area is filled with level 30+ enemies so when we're level 10-12 we avoid the area. Once we're at a high enough level to explore the area, the game no longer spawns golfer ghouls for us, however it will spawn them for other lower level players nearby. So a level 370 player would need a level 10-12 sidekick to help spawn the golfers. Any that spawned for you by chance was probably triggered by a low level player in the area. 
---
When I was low level I stuck to this quest like glue. 
---
I agree that the PvP players should be with other PvP players but I think making strict servers for PvP, and PvP would be better. Maybe even take a monster Hunter approach and once you hit level 50 or so, allow to search for servers that are for those trying to launch nukes or servers for trading, helping beginners, or even CAMP building would be amazing. But I also feel they need to fix some things first like the eternal loading for enemies
---
I was just “correcting something” mate, 
---
I know have a reason to actually keep playing 
---
You can tell from a scratched out user name whether or not the person who made the comment actually plays or cares about the improvement of FO76? Wow, can you tell me what next week's lottery numbers are going to be? I could use the extra money. 
---
Spread the word. All must pay. Even the noobs over at Ps4
---
It was a witch hunt man, ever since I found the outfit on a dead responder I wanted to find it. I personally am solely after brotherhood outfits but I think I’ve got them all. Good to know I’m finding new stuff at level 108
---
I've killed no less than *three( Wendigos while wearing a clean clown outfit from the haunted house in the northeast (I know it's not called Freddy Fazbear's but I definitely think it's an Easter egg) and have still yet to fulfill that quest.
---
gt? im interested
---
This morning I got a quad Tesla with 10% dmg while aiming.
---
How does it feel to know that you've used up all the luck left in your life in order to accomplish this? Does it give you a certain calm since there's no more ambiguity about what chance will hold for you in the future?
---
Yeah, the way I see it is that it's more beneficial to the gaming community in the long run to release a very vanilla somewhat light on features. This allows Bethesda to balance the game better with less variables and also allows them to see how people are playing the game and receive feedback on what works and what doesn't. If they had released a game with 5X more features but then removed some of them later on due to negative feedback by a majority of players you run the risk of losing players that DID like the removed content. I really think releasing a somewhat bare bones game and building it up with things players are actually asking for is the way to go in games of this genre. 
---
 Yeah its not great. Hi ho. ;)
---
Lmao everyone's having problems with this I got it done at level 12
---
Are there 370 perk cards in your deck or did you quit opening them 250 levels ago?
---
I saw a nuke on prime this week, several on Whitespring, and even two on Morgantown tonight. As for prime, lots of people showed up, but the Queen stopped taking damage, and the 15+ players failed. 
---
It would make sense. There was a bunker I ran across with the planters from fo4 with food growing. The best part was was that you just looted the planter for all the veggies, not each individual plant. So I think that means it’s in the game code. We just need it for ourselves. 
---
Do I want to throw open my shutters to my balcony garden and trim some tatos off my garden? Yes!
---
Whitesprings is always full of high level players and always full of hordes of high level ghouls. Guess they compliment one another.
---
1, 2, 4 and 6 sound like you want things easier. 
---
Well, maybe you should look up what activities give good plans an which don't
---
There's a possibility you don't have the correct level of machinery based skills. Gunsmith, makeshift warrior, I know I have to switch my perk cards sometimes to build certain armour pieces then back to weaponry perks. Same for ammo and health production  based perks.
---
What is the event called?
---
Put on reactive plates or something else on your chest piece jet packs eat through fusion cores. That being said optimized bracers are great if you melee a lot
---
Since I'm a stealth build, stabilized shocks
---
Id like it if they wouldn't ban people on pure speculations and that the people that are banned should be properly informed why (solid evidence) and when thwy will be unbanned
---
What you are missing out on is the fact he lied. Its not about assuming every person on MP are cheating or victums of accusations. In his own words is what makes us thing he is a cheater. 
---
1. He posted a guide about how he gathers his stuff to craft and everything but He said he was caught in the bann raid that happened but He actually was banned before that happened. His guide was posted at least a full day before the ban on dupers happend. 
---
2. He admitted using a macro to harvest items because it would mess with the system and you get more items than you are supposed to get. Ironically that is the same kind of thing you do to dupe.
---
3. In his guied he never mentioned anything about nuking or using perks like green thumb to harvast all that flax and stuff which you would need to get as much as he did in 1 month. He only mentioned using superduper and ammosmith
---
4. He said he was banned because he would drop his ammo pick it up drop it and pick it up and then pass it to his mule account and that doing that inflated the actual numbers that pass through the account. The issue with that is his main would have a lot more than just 140k worth of ultracite especially seeing how his mule account had over 505k worth of ammo and ultracite. 255k was just the ultracite in his mule account. He had a total of 645.654 worth of ammo total and only his main account had just ultracite. It would list more than just that if he dropped and picked it up so many times before passing it to the mule account. 
---
I'm glad you have, but I've never had a fun fight against the queen. She takes lots of bullets or hits. Sometimes she dies, sometimes she doesn't. It's never technical or strategic. She doesn't hurt anyone, or have a strategy. 
---
Nah.
---
It’s probably there for future dlc . At least I hope so .😬 
---
I have lost count of both, to be honest. The good deeds far outnumber the griefers, but I love me some pvp. Pvp has dropped significantly for me since the last patch. Dunno if it's coincidence or some other game stealing the pvper's attetion? Either way I'm still having fun
---
Has anyone found what happens next after randomly generating the passcode? My friend and I made it this far and are stumped
---
Whitespring ghouls really should be at a fixed level.  Everything here except the robots should be fixed at low-mid level regardless of your current level, it should only be a high level zone when nuked.  I kinda just grow tired of people endlessly camping it, it would be nice to see players venture elsewhere rather than here constantly just to wipe the restaurant like a daily ritual.
---
Legit brought a real tear to my eye.
---
Once again, the fallout Community amazes me with their limitless kindness and superfluous good nature.
---
Then you clearly didn't understand them.
---
For you to say that #2 is for me to make things easier when it should have given me more loot for a SCORCHQUEEN BOSS BATTLE is beyond ridicoulus, I mean it's just plain obvious.
---
I use targeting hud on the helmet with bright headlight, medic pump on the chest, tesla bracers on the arms and callibrated shocks on the legs i really like this setup.
---
What’s the GT?
---
Tennis courts are as you describe, but getting the spawned ghouls to take the bait and follow someone  in is tricky work.
---
Xbox here, I've tried to pick them up many times, no go.
---
A lot, but it seems to load correctly if I de-select and re-select the quest.
---
I sure wish there was. Huge oversight on Bethesda's part, that. 
---
Just learned this the hard way and burned 2 cards. Launching nukes is getting to be too much work to do by yourself - I kinda stopped caring anymore. Endless waves of robots with unlimited ammo and Im burned. 
---
I think I killed 7 in the first night, and a month and a half later it looks like the 8th committed suicide. Now I just need the last two to follow suit !
---
What do reactive plates and optimized bracers  do?
---
How did you afford FO76 &amp; a system...
---
with no job?
---
Reactive plates reflect 50% of melee damage back to target and optimized bracers re ap cost of power attacks
---
Sounds about what I would aim for, I have the VATS matrix overlay, but Phoenix in Watoga doesn’t sell any headlamp mods, I don’t think. Medic pump I don’t think would work because I run bloodied melee and take damage all the time, it would eat through my stims
---
I got hit with it hard after the last patch, then I saw a post on here saying it might have something to do with the launcher. Now before I start playing I close the Bethesda launcher and relaunch. I haven't experienced the Rubberbanding outside of the Enclave bunker since I started doing that. 
---
Ooh, I should get the reactive ones. Thanks for letting me know:)
---
Surprised you don’t use the stealth boy chest if you’re stealthy
---
Not a problem I looked up the mod list and what they did before I ever started nodding my power armor
---
I tried that, have it in storage. It ate my fusion cores too fast even with 3* power user. 
---
Is this the one in the Forest where they all drank the special Koolaid (rat poison)? It's kind of creepy.
---
Ah, I would usually just go claim a power plant, but I’ve never really been a huge power armor user before this so I wouldn’t know how fast fusion cores are used
---
I have never seen empty springs in my games
---
What console, sir?  Also may I ask for further specifics as to how this bug looks to help clarify for others?
---
What do you mean by flashing colors?  Does the entire background of the perk menu flash colors?  The perks themselves?
---
And when it's doing this it means none of them are active I'm assuming, including starched genes which is how you realized they weren't working when you took a radaway and lost a mutation?
---
I did that but I'm a low str build so it's annoying farming cores
---
Yeah thats fair enough i just love standing there in battle like a tank while my armour heals me its great.
---
This is an awesome story man. 
---
I always find myself running out of stimpaks even with PA on
---
Go for. HUD helmet. Stealth /reactive plates. Optimized bracers. Your choice of legs. Calibrated are most used. Otherwise I mix 1 kinetic servos with 1 optimized servos. 
---
Mine is 12 I think, with my unyielding and radicool etc etc it goes up to 24 outside PA. It’s where I get my 1004 damage on my DC gauntlet. Shame I can’t use it in PA
---
Did not know that thanks for the info 
---
Cool, thanks for the tips!
---
Calmex and phantom device should give you enough of an edge if you have a pretty solid stealth build.
---
I can confirm the ONE time I hopped quickly into my PA was while a scorched beast was giving me hell.
---
However I hopped out quickly once [HIDDEN] afterwards so I'm wondering if there's some kind of initiator to that animation besides being in danger.
---
I know...  pretty stupid.
---
Xbox One, flashing a lot of colors along with significant lag in trying to see perks. Most perks not even visible. Walked into Decon shower lost muts, and immediately relogged. Problem solved afterwards but lost the muts
---
I'm gonna give that a try 
---
The only thing I can do while sitting is turn my pipboy light on and off.
---
Let me sit and eat my Salisbury Steak and drink my Nuka-Cherry :c
---
6 of 10 since October.
---
Still on?
---
Glad u enjoyed it
---
Yeah I think that's what they did. They must have placed them in before calling us over
---
The esteem of your colleagues.
---
As'well as lag and rubber banding, I keep seeing a tiny hitch in the animation of walking with a gun too, like a deliberate split second jolt of the animation resetting.  
---
I just found a junkie’s Gatling and conveniently enough I have like 3 addictions so I’m gonna give it an honest go. Normally I run with a shredder minigun for melee which works like a charm but means I can’t carry 5mm. But I’m gonna try the Gatling out soon and see how I like it 
---
I feel like there is more to it as well. I mean, the in combat/caution/danger thing makes sense, but I’m pretty sure it’s happened to me just hopping in/out while at my camp. I guess we’re past the point wondering why/how things happen in this game.
---
r/wholesome
---
I might have to go back into the Ash Heap, then, or do the Poseidon event. I was at the mega-excavator recently but  I barely had enough strength and firepower to take on the mole men.
---
I personally swap out a jetpack chest piece with a stealth chest piece 
---
Why don't you guys just use your phones?
---
What’s with golfer Ghouls? Lol
---
Hard pass on that link
---
You would like this game but I *strongly* recommend you research a certain style of play before you begin leveling and selecting perks.
---
Early game can be **brutal** as low levels are at the mercy of enemy spawns if higher level players are in the area.  You'll run into level 50+ enemies sometimes so don't be afraid to dip and run.
---
This Fallout also has a crap ton more grouped enemies, you may occasionally find yourself swarmed by a horde of scorched, ghouls, mongrels, wolves, mirelurks, super mutants (especially), and such.  Do not be afraid to dip and run.
---
Finally, bottom right corner well (usually) tell you important information with various little red icons.  If you're overencumbered you'll have a red weight symbol.  Diseased will have a red biohazard symbol.  If your armor is broken or almost broken you'll see a red shield symbol, and a red gun symbol of your weapon is close to breaking, and seriously, get used to equipment breaking, being overencumbered and seeking workbenches, and needing to grind for junk materials to repair and craft better stuff as well as building your camp or workshops.
---
It's work, but after a point it goes from work to fun once you're no longer desperate for junk materials by finding worthwhile locations to loot or workshops.
---
I personally level by holding workshops and doing their defend events.  Just be prepared to burn through all your ammo, often.
---
It would be perfect fir me, truly
---
Did you design this yourself? 
---
You’ve tested my limits for long enough
---
How and why is duping outside of super duper still a thing :(
---
Job has a strict phone policy, "security risk"🙄
---
Quad laser and double shotgun tonight.
---
I wish we could purify it into boiled water somehow.  Toxic Valley is great until you run out of boiled water.  Not a serious issue considering you can fast travel to vault 76 and get water from there.  But it'd be nice to make all of that toxic water useful somehow beyond giving rads and diseases.
---
I have yet to see a single one over 200 hours in.
---
Its working fine my dude, its just that if you HAD it before patch 6, you need to remove it and get it again to work.
---
I guess im super lucky and killed all 10 during the beta
---
Honestly I come here to laugh once in a while, it's kind of surreal to me how people eat any shit devs make this day and are happy with it.
---
It's not even a question of opinion really, everyone has their own taste. But you know something is wrong when people play a low score game who deceived players more than once, (nylon bag,half finished game, server issues,etc...) and people still pay for it.
---
Devs will keep shitting on people as sheep continue to buy their games.
---
I mean anthem was worse, I have fun with the game, have a good day amigo
---
Look at me the bigshot, grinded our ten ghouls in a few hours, granted I kept server hopping.
---
I LOVE YOU BETHESDA. Just one request though. Please can we get bigger budgets for our CAMP's? also. Camps should be near indestructable . Wrecking Ball perk should matter at least . I'm tired of living in a glass house ... xoxoxo
---
Holy cow please not. Do you ever waste one second what will happen if Bethesda is changing anything ingame? For such huge impacts like the level system they only can brake it, beside the system is one of the few what work. Max lvl is 50, beyond that you only get skill points. No hp or any other different between lvl 50 or 500 with same build.
---
Please use your brain at least one second before saying this have to be done.
---
Wow, OP actually finally delivers! ;) But hey if you haven't seen the Bethesda road map for they did say they were at least going to make it so you can put your stash items on display in your CAMP.  Super pumped for that.
---
My bro has a \[spoiler\]floating rock \[/spoiler\]in his camp, too. He calls it Camp \[spoiler\]Floating Rock. \[/spoiler\]
---
Is there such a thing as a nonbloated glowing ghoul???
---
And seriously, withered, charred, gangrenous ghouls are all fugly.  Surely we can get some normal looking ones that aren't...  Fugly lol.
---
Even reaver ghouls got their original outfits on.
---
Go right ahead! There's tons of lore in this game to explore about, people to find out about, the story takes a back seat but I recommend doing some of the beginning quests just so you can get off your feet. 
---
$10 this will be front page news somewhere
---
Metal picnic table 
---
Do you have over 100k of any ammunition? Or anywhere close?
---
Follow up, how close are you to having 140k ultracite ammo on 2 separate characters?
---
Wiki, reddit mostly. Or the official guide. 
---
Noted, it's always nice knowing griefer tactics~
---
Gotta counter you bloody raiders somehow lol
---
Naw man, I want hydroponics! Draw water from a purifier and power from your camp's power grid and grow basically any plant you want. 
---
I just want to set up my own private post-apocalyptic grow house.
---
Lol sorry. And YES! Excited for that and the machine that will let us break down/mod legendary items!
---
What’s it like after you ascend? 
---
If you're talking about that glitch where the social menu incorrectly displays an online person as offline, the only fix I've found with my friends is the person online showing as offline has to close application and reopen the game.
---
Only other solution I've found is logging in and from in a server or at the main menu, on ps4 at least, go to the dashboard, under the game go to your friend's name and select Join Session.
---
But dude, sometimes when we get griefed we just need to move on.  It's not worth sinking down to a griefer's level.
---
I go around to every server and wonderglue them to the ground.
---
Thank you
---
Very trixy!
---
Oh well, at least we have purifiers
---
Team up. 
---
I'm not that high but morningwood0917
---
You still holding it 
---
Looks like one the Interlopers shrines. Hopefully we will get it this spring.
---
Server hopped the Clubhouse last night for almost 2 hours. Ended up with around 40 legendaries. So I’m not sure why you aren’t getting more. What’s your CHR when looting may I ask?
---
Most griefers screenshot a ton, make note of the people they're always in teams with. Follow those people..
---
Profit?
---
They're both trash games for people with low standards.
---
I'm glad I've passed on both and went games that actually have good developers =)
---
Finished it all in one blessed day haven’t touched the game since
---
Lol ya. Make sure to teabag if you kill one of our raiders. There a dissaponment if they die. Haha goodluck. Gt is YummyFortnut69 on xbox if you ever need someone dead. I'm lvl 164.
---
I want some even higher level ghoula in clown outfits.
---
Monorail elevator has a bunch in the very top you can kick them off edge but never pick up. 
---
Awesome envy u I grow up with ColecoVision games are amazing know...but we knew the struggle and now it's wow...
---
Factions flags would be great for roleplay. The assets are already there, all they have to do is put the logo and colour the flag the faction colour. 
---
That mod's been a lot less useful since the last game update made the author change how it works. I miss being able to do all my changes right there in the game. 
---
[I've got the online code somewhere. give me a few minutes](https://i.imgur.com/Zw5cYjO.jpg)
---
I'm sure they will hopefully be free through future dlc. 
---
There's a sort of exploit with the vertibot defenses at workshops like the poseidon energy plant workshop.
---
The vertibot that you can spawn by repairing the landing pad (8 steel, 6 aluminum per repair) can be destroyed for 300xp then respawned immediately as long as you have the materials.  Just know when it explodes it'll damage nearby workshop items like extractors and generators, and hurt nearby teammates but not you.  So guns over melee are advised.
---
Cheap crappy way to power level that I don't recommend (and am mostly sharing in hopes it gets patched eventually somehow.)
---
I personally recommend you take 3+ workshops and continually do their defend events rotating between them.  Between enemies and event completion rewards you'll make a bunch of xp AND materials.  I recommend Dabney Homestead (bottom of mire), Federal Disposal Site (bottom of savage divide), Hemlock Holes (middle top of toxic valley), Red Rocket Megastop (top right of savage divide next to mire), Munitions Factory (northwest of megastop) and the junkyard with 3 junk spots (top of ash heap).
---
I say those 6 because they have great resources and their defend events can spawn some worthwhile xp and material giving enemies.  Just...  Be wary of the Scorchbeast Attack defend event, it spawns 2+ scorchbeasts for me usually...  And is brutal to deal with solo.
---

Platform?
---
Source? Logic process? (No downvotes from me)
---
This could be good but it would to work in a way to still make benches worth going to. 
---
Something like this. You can craft a single kit and the kit restores like 15-20% on all weapons that are within the 100% durability and not the 200% you can get with perks. 
---
so you can use the serums but those are expensive, so as long as you die of radiation (drink dirty water until dads kill you, die in rad storm or nuked zone, etc) then you get a random mutation. Do that enough times and you’ll get all of them :p (just used starched genes and class freak and you’re good 
---
Wow, that was actually a pretty cool story. Thanks
---
Wow... So it is possible... I'm still at 0. tried for a few hours in total over my time playing not server hoping and got 0
---
It’s so sad to see all the work Jon put into this video yet it only has 1/3 of the views fallout 3 is better then you think a week later 
---
Interested
---
-keep it simple
---
-dont blow it 
---
-count your money
---
How did you pay 100 dollars? Are you sure mommy didn't buy it for you and you just don't know how much things cost?
---
How many hours did you sink into 76? How many into fortnight? I think you got your 60 bucks.
---
I don’t understand what your saying. 
---
This and that ONE cat bowl in the cat lady's house.
---
I concur.  That was a good read.
---
And well played action.

I keep seeing the same bloodied handmades  for sale or trade
---
A lot of the youtubers invited to the greenbriar event have a history of not always agreeing with bethesda off the top of my head oxhorns a great example he was quite vocally against creation club and every time a new creation comes out he makes a video saying if it’s worth it or not
---
I know, I've been following your work here. And as funny or blatantly fabricated the following may sound: tonight's farming run (just finished) yielded two Quad guns for me, one Quad Gauss and one Quad .44. Both just 1-star drops, of course.
---
Have taken pictures to prove it, in case you insist. ;-)

Very cool! Gt: YummyFortnut69 I'll have to check it out sometime. I'm killing people for aluminum with friends atm
---
I have absolutely never played an MMO with a stash limit.
---
Its fucking retarded
---
I got 6 when I first got the quest then I never saw them again.
---
I mean, when you damage your own product, again, and again, it is a bit...  Expected, that people who love that product will think the producer of that product doesn't care about it.
---
Just saiyan.
---
Free future dlc would be nice. And have your own faction flag of whatever faction you may have joined. 
---
Can we please get the option of packing up our camp and only placing it down when we need it, instead of moving it from place-to-place?
---
As in, we can pack it up, and not have it on the map at all until we put it back down?!
---
So for example, if a nuke is about to be dropped, I can pack-up the camp, and walk away instead of having to find somewhere else to place it.
---
I've been getting 3* weapons but all of them melee...my last 25 or 30 drops have either been melee weapons or armor no guns
---
He wasn't duping.
---
I’d like so that explosive wasn’t a legendary type, but a receiver and ammo just like untracite, you could add it to any gun and as long as you can keep up with the junk needed to make the ammo, you can have explosive. 
---
I have an alt that is my junk supplier so hit me up when on next I'll sent u may tag be on after work graveyard I'll msg u if ur not on...
---
Dude, some people dont like bulking items/resource management over killing and looting shit.
---
This game is too tedious as it is to get anything done.
---
All people are terrible to some degree.
---
I tend to roleplay with other people as it is and having something small like this be added would go great with my base too. 
---
Fuck ya. You'll get lots of levels. I have work in like a hour. But ya hmu
---
So the reverse of the blueprint system? It saves your design to place it back down when used.  Either way you look at it you pack it up to move it. 
---
The same Juicehead that made video after video pre-launch to take advantage of all the hype, and then made video after video post-launch to cash in on all the hate?

Basically, just like shitty record companies  of old, game companies pay for good reviews of their games, and shitty reviews of competitors. It not illegal, and it makes good business sense, especially if you're a 'murican company. 
---
Now BGS can't throw around accusations like that because they don't want the stones sued off em'. But I sure can! I think a lot of us (including BGS) know whats going on here, because 76 is not a bad game, just a flawed one. Flawed games used to win game of the year, but I guess no one remembers after fortnite and GTA online.
---
Melee to stagger, shoot it, get hit, stimpack, repeat.
---
I highly recommend you have 2.5x sneak damage and use a vats crit starting out.
---
Do know that Wendigo Cave has a few ghouls, some mirelurks, and like 3 or 4 mirelurk kings, so the Wendigo will need to be fought to.  It also has trap boards that will hurt you if you walk over them (punji boards??) and bone chimes.  You'll need to visit it for Rose's quest.
---
The wendigo will be at the second waterfall area, it will however not be spawned in waiting for you, it jumps down once you approach the waterfall (again, not the first one you'll find but the second one AFTER all the mirelurk kings).
---
It'll jump down and if you're sneaking you shouldn't get it's attention if you stop approaching.  Vats crit, then if it isn't dead before engaging you a melee hit can stagger it giving you a breathing chance to shoot it more.
---
And again if it does engage you, melee, shoot, get hit, stimpack, repeat.  It'll be over before you know it but seriously, the mirelurk kings are more problematic than the Wendigo.
---
Walk in and punch it. If that isn't feasible for you, your armor is grossly insufficient

"Until dads kill you", I fell out of my chair laughing.
---
Thnx I'll check it out.
---
This is too restrictive, in my opinion. We should be allowed as many card presets as we wish. We have our SPECIALs locked in, and we *earned* our cards, why should it be a privilege just to use them?
---
I just figured if they're around for so long that their genitals have fallen off that their clothes are long gone.
---
Just lmk 
---
well all that is overkill just 2 pieces of armor with 50% fall damage and you take 0 damage from falling the goat legs doesnt matter
---
Where did you find it?
---
Crafting, repairing, building, teamed up, solo, power armored and SBQ would all be different decks for me if I could have them. My special layout is not that versatile, so I can't have ALL my "home" cards equipped at once. Restricting decks like that would be a sure way to get everyone to have the same build, just to optimize potential versatility of the 3 decks.
---
Whats your psn
---
Lol I was wondering whether 100% from armour was enough.
---
Umm I didn’t say it HAD to be done, I suggested they should. Completely different but even with what you said about once you pass lv 50, you’re wrong. You continually add perk cards do you not? Allowing you to potentially buff different/more characteristics of your character based on how you use them...and the game is already completely broken.  Please use spell/grammar check before your next post because I only got like half of your comment.  Also, 50 is definitely not the max level, scorchbeasts already can be level 80, as well as super mutants up to 68 I believe. So you either are a very low level or haven’t played too much because all of what you just said is incorrect... 
---
So the purchased serums DO give you mutations without radiation? 
---
We already have access this doesn’t restrict them. It simply gives us the means to change multiple cards at a faster speed instead of one card at time. 
---
If I’m going shopping for scraps; say I hit up west tek and need to pick locks and hack.  Normally I have to stop and swap several cards. With a deck system I can set up a quick deck to still fight and do that hack and pick locks. And not mess up my default build. 
---
S0l1d5nake666
---
It’s not that difficult. It’s a simple pip boy camp button and boom blueprint and place. Done and done. 
---
With the stealth indicator somewhat broken right now who knows if hidden really means hidden right now. I was being attacked by a group of mole rats yesterday and it said "detected" the whole time.
---
Could be coming soon in future dlc or patches 
---
The mansions in ash heap are pretty high as well. 
---
Even new players will run into this because Whitespring is constantly a blast zone.  Morgantown seems to be popular too, which is rough since you need to go there for main story stuff anyways.  Poor newbies
---
I'm glad you joined us. Any time you're want to team up with someone, just check the roster tab in the club to see who is online. Almost everyone there joined from a "looking for group" post here 😁
---
I've experienced each side of this. Early on in BETA they worked by just joining the area and fighting the horde. Not sure when they changed it to search several areas but once they didn't the event never worked for me. Everytime I would port in the event would be gone. I wouldn't see anything for it on the map. Completely going. 
---
Then a week or two ago 900 hour guy said he did them a lot. I thought they were just broken.  I tried them again and sure enough they worked where I had to search different areas. So over the past week I've had some work this was but also some not work where they completely disappear.  
---
So, I don't know. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. 
---
Assault Marines are on the front lines, Light Combat Armor guys are guarding the supply Depot.
---
But that requires you to move your camp, I want to be able to be able to pack it up without having to move it to somewhere else on the map.
---
Oh oh! Ohohoh!!!  Ohhhhh!!!!!
---
I went to Bailey Family Cabin to go to the munitions factory but accidentally went towards red rocket megastop instead.
---
I was sneaking and saw a dead yao guai, went towards it when suddenly the ground shakes and RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, a Matriarch Deathclaw comes up out of the ground facing me and screams in my face.
---
Needless to say I ran.  And ran.  And ran some more.
---
And turned around to death's claws coming at me.  Found a small cliff and hopped down it, displaced and once hidden again engaged on my terms.
---
Crazy deathclaws man.  Good god!
---
Yeah just find a location with most of the benches and sleep bag. Having a second camp is not going to be likely added or considered. 
---
Those flipping deathclaws!
---
yea i do a no PA build and is almost a must to have that
---
That must've been a trip.
---
Nice! Finally got it! Thanks for the heads up!
---
The top of Seneca rocks, climb to the peak using jetpack+ marsupial, wear power armor so you don’t die on impact 
---
Marine armour was given to the USMC marines. And combat was to national guard, army, Air Force. Leather is likely for civilian: hunters and the like. Metal is probs from militia or made with blacksmiths pre/post war and raider is raider. 
---
And swag and riot to police and swat as well as BATFAL
---
Thnx, also the point was to not use pa ._.
---
This post was ill-advised and under-informed. 😂
---
Bored as with this game level 46? I think. 
---
The Watoga and BoS vendors occasionally have these plans, I have even seen the Free States vendor have them
---
You really should understand how things work before you talk shouldn't you.
---
Yes. And for a short time (hour, maybe), you'll have no negative effects from the mutations.  
---
If you want to keep the mutations, the perk card Starched Genes (L) will help do that. But it will prevent new mutations also.  So it turns into constantly checking if you have the card set for your next action. 
---
To minimize negative mutation effects, perk card Class Freak (L) will do that.
---
And if you run in a group of mutants like my wife &amp; I do, perk card Strange In Numbers (C).
---
 
---
Pain is the only way I learn, and I am sure learning tonight.
---
To your edit: Apparently just 100% negates all fall damage, waste of time getting 330% I guess.
---
If you build up a workshop location and log out your stuff will stay for the next person who shows up.  Seriously nice too since building them up takes some serious resources (especially gears).
---
It however all goes away if a server crashes.
---
I'm not sure if workshops reset after a set amount of time either like vendors do or if they reset after a period of inactivity, or if servers reset after so long.
---
The workshops were why they could
---
Unless this has been added in a recent update, even with 100% reduction you will still take damage equal to how high you fell. So a casual jump off the devils backbone will still kill you.
---
I wasn't at the workshop and they weren't trying to claim. 
---
\*shakes fist\*
---
Ey, we got a deathclaw trader.  Should be asking why *that* is a thing.
---
Spilling blood daily. Dying too. All good as long as death is getting done.
---
Blade of bastet cuts through it pretty easy so I’m guessing armor pen may help
---
Workshops forfeit your passive mode. No immunity. Passive mode is to protect you from starting pvp. People can still hit you and inflict slap damage but can still kill if your hp gets too low. 
---
They wanted to pvp and by claiming a workshop regardless of pacifist mode because pacifist mode only stops you from accidentally shooting another player not from them killing you. It just makes it a little harder to kill you. Also they could’ve been farming you for caps
---
Helps to know what causes it. It SEEMS to only happen when they fast travel to you before you finish loading. You travel somewhere, then they travel to you while you load.
---
2 pieces of 50% fall damage armor is all you need.  Goat legs, power armor, anything more than 100% is a waste.  
---
You don’t have to physically be at the workshop. You can claim and walk away. They can still track you down. If your a part of team that has one and they leave it may and could pass to another of the team. 
---
How do you keep playing? I’m level 13 and I have no interest in playing until we get mod support and private servers.
---
FWIW I knew what you were talking about from the start because the alternative makes no sense.
---
It only forfeits passive mode if someone tries to claim/contest it. But either way, it's happened before when I didn't have a workshop. Just hit me one time with a power fist and I died. Even in my PA with medic pump. 
---
Jumped off the monorail the other day to test it.  PA is not required, zero fall damage with 2 pieces of regular with the 50 effect.
---
no with 100 percent on armor i take no falling dmaage no matter where i jump from
---
Combat rifle is bad in semi auto but okay in full auto with a wide spread and high recoil. I would take the hunting rifle for damage with the snappy, hair trigger or hardened reciever if you're a stealth/ranged build. The .50 reciever is also good for the hunting rifle because the ammo has the cheapest cost for the most ammo.
---
I just want a chem that highlights dead entities like berry mentats highlights living entities.
---
Maybe give us a new kind of mentats, melon mentats why not?
---
Then they just a really god rolled weapon that does more than the protection shield can hold. 
---
If u play i Bloody build (like me) take my advise prooved by my self:
---
Head: Targeting HUD (makes living enemys glow red, very helpfull on dark areas) and a Lamp Color u love (White, Vaultboy\*dont do that XD\* Violet, Red or Blue\*i love that one not to bright and quite nice to watch for my eyes\*
---
Torso: !!! EMERGENCY PROTOCOLL !!! 50% Dmg reduce if u have under 20% Life an makes u 25% FASTER... what we want more ass a melee??? it boost our bloody, makes us faster and reduce the incoming dmg to a quite nice ammount there is NOTHING Better for us (JetPeck? funny but nothing more, we have marsupial mutation with that we get mostly every where we want to got! Stealth we dont need. Medic Pump we dont need cause 50%dmg reduce makes us though enough to take our self a stim if needed! Reactiv Plates where to? we take 100%dmg from melee enemy AND Range NOT WORTH IT maybe for PVP but not for PVE! And the rest is just fun stuff)
---
Arms:  Optimized Bracers is the only worth to reduce AP Costs for Strong Attacks
---
Legs:  Calibrated Shocks qualitiy of Life!!! Nothing more to say. the others are only if u realy think u need AP cost reduce/refresh, sprint speed \*drains more ur fusioncore not good!!!\* or play as a jumping ExploFrog XD
---
Realy take my advice u will love it as a melee!!! for the most the Torso is IMPORTENT !!!
---
Greetings from a lvl 80+ player with 11 free perkpoints to spent because im so strong and dont know what to do with them \^\^
---
My 2 cents: Craft a second chest and put the plates on that dont toss that jetpack. You might want it later/want to sell it/want to give it to a buddy.
---
A sad downside would be griefers who specifically come to mess it up but I guess that would just make them raiders. 
---
Db unbroken
---
If you don't care what mutations you get an easy way is to fast travel to Harpers Ferry, turn around and run to the end of the bridge and you'll be irradiated to hell. Get the mutation you want and equip level 2 starched genes perk and then fast travel to the enclave bunker and clear your rads in the decontamination shower. That's the cheap way to do it. Serums are the expensive but more precise way.
---
It's pretty annoying when a legendary robot explodes and its body flies off.
---
It's almost as annoying when a caps stash is blown away by an explosion.
---
Isn't it always dead, though?
---
A ghoulified BoS in PA w/o the helmet, so that it makes a lot of sense, and it only spawns on a nuked zone.
---
When shot from the back, there's a chance the fusion core explodes and its power armor falls apart.
---
I leave mine unlocked so other people can get water if they need it. Most people leave however many locked they want water from, and leave at least 1 unlocked for the masses. 
---
If you're asking about water taken from a locked purifier, I can agree that's irksome, and it'd be nice if you could know who did it. I'd rather know who steals my junk/death bags, though. 
---
Can you get rid of a specific mutation? 
---
But that's why you get your neighbors to create a Watch.
---
Sometimes I spawn south of my camp, sometimes I spawn on a ladder inside, sometimes on my landing foundation. 
---
I'm also on a cliff, and every time I load into a new server I fall all the way down, maybe once or twice, then have to wait for my camp to load in, and fast travel to it. 
---
200 more to get the ban! Good luck!
---
OP I promise you, take a legendary weapon that isn't painted (tricentennial or otherwise), go to any vendor with caps, and sell it.
---
You can sell legendaries, just not scrap them.  Just know certain 3 star legendaries sell for excruciatingly more caps to players than they will to vendors.
---
stg I didn’t type that but lmao
---
I'd love to have a Brotherhood of Steel flag/insignia, surprised they weren't already in the game.
---
What is yours?
---
smart dude 
---
can you explain how to get the most benefit from a bloodied build
---
I haven't seen one yet, thought I was doing something wrong.
---
Grits with cheeeeeese!
---
Super rare and everyone wants it 
---
Agreed.  
---
You can plant crops in the firepit, FYI. It looks funny, but at least you can do that inside. 
---
SBQ fight. My weapon broke and my favorites wheel was missing the one I wanted, so I quickly changed to the next one that I wanted to use. Too quickly. I accidentally selected a fat man that I didn't even know I had. You can guess what happened when I shot that at point blank range. I was not expecting that explosion and I think I literally yelped when it happened.
---
It's pretty much the only thing I was happy to pay so much for. It really makes building a cool camp worthwhile.
---
Stinky meat
---
This has been brought up a lot, but it's a valid suggestion.  I think as more people continue to play the game amd advance past level 50, it will continue to be mentioned.  I'm level 66, and I'm starting to see what all the fuss is about.  Noting like going into a fight and forgetting to re-equip my stimpack card for my gunsmith card.
---
Go to Watoga and do the side quest Mayor For a Day.  It might be a challenge at lvl 25, but the payoff is huge for leveling up.  I don't want to spoil it, but after it's done you can walk around Watoga and bank xp, legendaries, etc with little to no chance of dying.  You also get a fairly powerful weapon, but doing it early means it won't be max level.  If I ever start over I'm going straight to Watoga.  
---
2 Characters, the first is level 39 and has only one since November, The second a level 14 which I started two weeks ago has got five at level 10. Strange indeed...
---
because Gaben blessed them.
---
Free shit is awesome! If you get enough free shit you can bulk it and make bulk fertilizer.
---
Yeah, i agree, this is the reason i didn't update yet and still using my old configs. Banking 7 perk cards now for a minor deck respeck. I hope, also for other platform users, this will be a standard feature soon!
---
also because being literate enough in the fo76 society is highly censored and forbidden
---
I have it and Lucky Break at level 3 with 12 Luck. Procs all the time.
---
It's not rare at all, and most people don't want it.
---
If you take those 0s and swerve right and left then shoot em with a 3 like Lebron, it makes it 115. So in reality it's pretty cheap.
---
My vote Watoga : Watoga is best place for that and i even have idea exactly where the hideout should be .There are some entrances to underground garages that are closed. Like 3 of them next to AMS ( the main tower  ) .My Suggestion is Reopen one of them and with all garage floors underground we will have different sections on different floor . Example Floor - 1 Vendors - 2 Hospital services etc . Now how to combine this with lore ? An automated experimental survival robobrain is stuck down there and his protocols are clear.... help others just like he is programmed ( 25 years is ore than enough for automated unit that doesn't needs to sleep to do its thing ) Now why the unit didnt lefted ? ... i will give you a hint . Claptrap from borderlands had problem traveling through them :D And he hated them also . Who will guess will get a cookie !
---
I wish, but that's where I'm still pretty casual. I tend to use whatever armor I think will help me goof around, weight reduction perks etc. 
---
You would think after 600 hrs, I'd be able to better answer you on that one but not really. 
---
No, we just disagree. 
---
For example vehicle game Crossout Im playing right now, have different craftables sorted as uncommon, rare, epic, legendaries and relics. All what they really are, are just made up labels.
---
Take the game as it is, without tangling on words. Fallout 76 is fairly flexible and open game, that allows you to play with what style you want to. Of course you don't have unlimited options, particularly as you start to get max level enemies.
---
don't bullshit. It was the workshop. It sucks, yes, and should be changed.
---
Hmm, really, not sure then. Ig Bethesda is just low on bottle caps 🤣
---
Wishing I was there. The servers I am on are not as fun.
---
I totally agree with a deck system. It's the thing I want added to the game more than anything else right now. What I don't agree with, however, is limiting it to 3 decks.
---
&gt;As always, apologies if this has already been brought up on the forums,
---
It has and Bethesda needs to do this, particularly for console players who don't have the handy mod PC players have.
---
Lame response, it's not a cheat, it's a simple QOL mod. We play this game to have fun, not to waste time changing cards all the time. 
---
be at 10% hp, Run full unyielding armor, adrenal reaction, nerd rage, bloodied weapon.
---
We did the SBQ tonight just now. Got her halfway done and disconnected from the server. 400 rounds of 40mm and who know how many other rounds. I was in a party so I thought I could just rejoin. They must have been kicked too because I respawned in a no nuke zone with my friend where we were getting pummeled by three scorch beasts. Died three times just trying to get back in the game. F that SBQ. I've wasted so much mats and bullets on that thing only to be disappointed. 
---
I went with three for starters. Maybe every time a player prestiges they could unlock another. 
---
Would love to have had you. Our next event is coming soon, so join the HOA on Twitter at @HOAWasteland.
---
Nice! I have one on xbox. I love how people get so mad at pvp. It's part of the game.
---
Watoga is great for fusion cores. 
---
No bullshit. 
---
I think they are programmed to run when they are alone or are around too much damage 
---
Of course I miss this, really needed shocks
---
&gt;simple QOL mod
---
&gt;Can literally change competitive cards sets in mere Seconds
---
B U L L S H I T
---
Yet
---
Is the sun real?
---
Wait, would players get to have different specials for each deck?
---
Def not a cheat. But a valid point. It should be in the game. BGS needs to stop leaning on outside devs to fix their product. They need to hire the modders and let em really go to town.
---
Agreed. When I see someone 1shotting stuff I run around and pop everything once and then go behind them and clean up lol. 
---
Nope it’s just for swapping. Like from combat to crafting or utility 
---
Awesome :)
---
Noob question, how do people have that "flair" next to their name, like Mega Sloth? 
---
Sweet tomatoes I'll be on when I get home..
---
Its getting betting. Patches are coming in good supply and dlc is coming March 12th?
---
I was having a real hard time with that and just kept ignoring it, finally one day I just spent like 2 - 3 hours at Whitesprings and got it done. It definitely has flaws.
---
Yes I was wondering the same
---
I could see they would power armour. Holding jump lets you go higher with more ap 
---
What type of PA? 
---
and how u think should that be possible? without an analog input that can see how "strong" u want to jump? in keyboards there is only on or off so the only thing i can think of is short press space short jump and hold space strong jump? that would make jumping a delay problem many dont want to have. sooo not realy worth it and by the way on what situation do we realy need a"short" jump?
---
You don't know what the hell you're talking about and you don't know me. Stop speculating like an ass.
---
No, that disease healing thingy it works always. 
---
And disease cure is plan you need to aquire. I don't remember ever been able to craft one, either due to not having plans, or lack of materials, at level 160. I don't have enough cures to sell them(unlike many other things), but by using cures for more important things, I make do.
---
Shit, wish I saw this earlier cause I was looking for a t60 right arm, lvl 50 and I managed to find both at Delta near Fissure Site Prime. I'm gonna be farming in the area still do if I come across another one, I'll message you.
---
Pretty much this. They respawn when the server does. 
---
Ultracite and X-01, I have all the mats for crafting
---
I just shoot them until they're dead. 
---
to change from regular ammo to ultracite is only worth it when u get a weapon to clear out the SBQ. ultracite ammo making is work and not needed out of a queen fight IMO.
---
So nope i dont think so that 4 dmg is worth the work it need
---
Yeah honestly I think we should be allowed as many hot swaps as we want if our specials are locked in.
---
Otherwise, I'd be cool with getting a whole new deck with completely different specials every time we prestige, then only being able to swap between them with special machines that players can have in their bases.
---
I really enjoy reading stories like this 👍
---
Ye lol when I did it they werent in the actual circle where u were supposed to kill them
---
Word bro. How many people you have
---
Ooof. You can’t craft x01 mods, the plans don’t exist. I haven’t had the good fortune of an Ultracite Shocks plan yet. 
---
I’d be ok with a non combat swap and internal 1 min cool down.   Not that a cooldown it s needed but is always a welcome. 
---
20+ trying to grow
---
Yea you got to chase them down. 
---
Think of it as a shield. It’ll warn for while then turn off. And explosive weapons don’t count each but rather the more you hit with it. 
---
I don't have an opinion on him either way, I haven't watched any of his videos in over 3 months.
---
A timer would be a welcome. 
---
I know, I mean I have the mats ready for Ultracite
---
Theres been a drop off for sure. Im constantly in very empty servers. Nuke zones are fewer and farther in between. I have noticed alot of low level players lately, though idk if these are new players or people restarting or just out to farm rare outfits. Content wise its the same game. Its not dead but its pretty much the hardcore base thats left at this point.
---
Pacifist prevents you from doing any damage to other players (including wanted ones) thereby preventing you from instigating PvP. If a teammate not in pacifist tags someone and they tag back, both teams are now flagged hostile to each other, pacifist or no. 
---
If a player who isn't wanted is marked as hostile to you, you do full damage regardless of whether you're in pacifist or not, but they do too. 
---
No I don’t believe you can, but just keep picking up guns you find that are the same and you’ll learn the mod you want in no time
---
I wish we had two "camps", a main camp that's more like a house or structure, and a mobile camp that's got the basics. That way you can build your super cool place like I want to build, but when you're out and about you can have a campfire and a bed and basic workstations. 
---
Pretty much, yes. You start meeting the same randoms repeatedly and servers are oddly quiet at times. Hoping for  revival with new upcoming content. However it still crashes and freezes too often, for me to call enjoyable.
---
Leaves the hardcore fanboiz and suckers like me, therefore expecting incoming downvotes.
---
Because there's a crap load of items it unlocks, but they're almost entirely all different iterations of the same item (a neon sign character). 
---
Side note:  they snap to each other in a weird fashion and use up a ton of budget, like any other light. 
---
Ran into a legendary mutant suicider that kept running away instead of throwing his touchdown nuke. It was my favorite thing
---
hoarding so much ammo is just waste of stash space if you ask me. I play melee mostly and i don't need it
---
No. You might also get banned. Skip it.
---
A free workshop you say.... 
---
Ghoul in golfer outfit. You have to kill 10 to complete quest at whitespring
---
No its not like fallout 4 where you can keep the mods. You have to craft them everytime. Unless you buy or find a mod in the wild. You also cant level up weapons.
---
A short press would be terrific. I would like to short jump over, logs, rocks, etc. I like the marsupial mutation a whole lot but tapping the button has a result that doesn't feel right and makes more of a challenge to maneuver for the landing an other problems that might come from a jump meant for a Boulder vs one meant to go over that log back there
---
I'm trying myself as full-time streamer
---
Thank you!
---
i have 100 stored points right now. just in case
---
no
---
You can't reuse mods or level up guns. You can mod the part of the gun back to standard or its default part but you completely lose the mod also
---
no info yet
---
One's a 3d model
---
the other's a fucking template made in photoshop
---
65k or something
---
If you scrap the guns you pick up you unlock the different mods  randomly. To unlock all the mods for a weapon you need to scrap roughly 100 it seems like
---
yes
---
SWEET!
---
You can change the colors (pip boy ui and the color it emits) in config files. 
---
Lucky hole mine? If ya look for what I think you are. All they way in the back behind the alter type thing with the 2 cultist blades on it. Usually on a shelf. And the bindings are in a crate nearby sometimes. 
---
after lvl200, probably
---
If you're getting laid, you ain't gaming. If you're working you ain't gaming. If you're on the toilet, you ain't gaming.
---
Ditch the girlfriend,  lose the job, get a shit-bucket, play Fallout 76.
---
Just halve the price of atoms, there, problem solved.
---
That's the kind of price I'd be ok to pay for atoms if there was anything interesting in the shop, and if they were to make sales on them, it'd be even more of a nobrainer
---
I just did the BotB quest and I got the armor and PLANS! -3.3.2019
---
you can't nuke without main quest and you get some plans, so yes
---
Luck
---
i have some plans for sales, also i know all serum recipes. I like to cook food, so if it doesn't spoil in vending machine, i might sell some rare food
---
lvl 9 ghoul wearing golfer outfit

yes. i use vats to teleport and radshield. it works

---
People come on...
---
Ah right on. 
---
Since they have dialogue lines I'm guessing it's intentional. Always seem to me they not so much as fleeing as much as they are LEADING. If ya not careful ya end up in a total fustercluck.
---
honestly i killed about 7 and didn't even noticed it was golfer. The're wearing golfer outfit but it's not very noticebale
---
Needle spine and heat flashes are from insects I believe that other one is last one I need. Lol sounds like a fun one.
---
2097 I believe was when the last of them died out to the Scorched
---
That actually makes sense
---
You would think that they would just have golfer ghouls spawn in the clubhouse if the quest was selected smh.  Congrats on completing the quest.  It was the last quest I completed behind launching a nuke.
---
yup, thats what 100% means, otherwise you are looking at a health buff from falling!
---
Its temperamental as fuck man
---
2 shot lever action last night.
---
This is nonsense. You can't one shot a player with no engage. They started capping your work shop. End of story. If you don't want die..... Don't take the workshop. 🤷
---
you already have this. just blueprint and store it.
---
 *&gt;370 player with 700 hours*
---
I hope i don't gonna start "i-go-ban-thread" tomorrow? :-)
---
Hey I noticed this including the "strange music" notes. I did look around that place for quite some time. Never found something.
---
Keeping is easier as you just have to level up to respec your specials. Versus going through all the levels again and learn all the plans again as well. 
---
I went from 2 to 6 without realizing it. 
---
I just killed #10. It was level 9.  I just  hit level 100. 
---
Dumbest. Quest. Ever.
---
Lol that would be hilarious
---
serums can be bought for 500 caps or less in the market subreddit.
---
See this post?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aw9z88/psa_slap_damage_results_of_an_extensive_although/
---
Until you can show this kind of dedicated proof, I'm just going to beleive this dude that shows his math, and not you.  Sorry.
---
The most reasonable explaination is that you got mugged b/c of workshop PvP mechanics and although that can suck, Workshops are in the PvP realm of the game whether you like it or not.
---
The days of people posting "i dun got 1 shot even while pacifist!!!" are over.  Now you need to show some proof or it's all BS.
---
I'm level 21 and killed 3, lets see how much i will get in the future
---
Most of the beta bugs are gone, or very rare. Only play it if you like the concept of the game though. I have played without break without many issues.
---
This has been tested and show to be a false rumor.  You must have entered PvP combat through a PvP mechanism in the game (or someone else forced it upon you but make no mistake you entered PvP).
---
Proof: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aw9z88/psa_slap_damage_results_of_an_extensive_although/
---
too bad there's slap damage...
---
I don’t know what any of these posters are on about. 
---
There is always players in servers man, of all levels. 
---
I play 3-7 hours a day. I always encounter people, I literally had to fight someone off for a workshop yesterday. 
---
The stability has increased, Iv had one crash in a week, but I do have freezes which undo themselves after 30seconds
---
If your friends were permabanned, they were cheating. 
---
Faction wise 2097. And I assume civilians just trickle out and leave or become scorched. Or taken by the super mutants. 
---
Doing the Lord's work!  Now people that claim this will have to show some f'ing proof before anyone should believe them.
---
Just another day in the wasteland. Glad you enjoyed it.
---
💪👍👌
---
Because we don’t need everyone writing “owo what’s this?” On every workshop they come across. 
---
This. I changed the colours of the light to 1.whatever so it could be white
---
Underrated post
---
Damn, with 100+ hours (yes rookie numbers) already, I have yet to see one ... 
---
I know, twisted muscles and nerd rage and chems and alcohol, but my point is during the presser he said you could be a raider if you wanted, and you can't really because they had a knee jerk reaction and added a stupid system that they keep doubling down on
---
you have mods installed 
---
Add these to your Fallout76custom.ini, right after sResourceArchive2list
---
" SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2"
---
If you’re on PC, I can sell you whatever mutations you want. And a lot cheaper than what others will ask. Like 100-150 caps. 
---
And the toy truck in that shed near the whitespring station. 
---
Ya. With right perks and guns. Raiding is easy. Cal farming and junk farming😉
---
Dude I'm not a carebear lol. I'm just new and didn't know if that guy was legit or not. But now that I know how public workshops work (basically it's open season on you on the whole map), I know it wasn't a hacker. Case closed.
---
He was crouching 24/7 and never could see him coming, nor did I expect it tbh.
---
.50 mg should be more powerful than strike by board. Weapon balance is screwed
---
I feel like it's semi decent on PC, but I have no idea what it was like before. I got it about a week after launch.
---
Yah legendaries mutants have the tendency to fucking run. 
---
I had one run on me in Harper’s and his dumb buddies came and started shooting me. 
---
Legendary Mutants are big ol softies 
---
So much passive aggressiveness...
---
I have noted several causes including what day_vees said.
---
The other two are:
---
Chameleon Legendary effect when active for a prolonged amount of time sometimes seems to turn you perma-invisible for either yourself or your teammates.
---
Other one I don't know the cause but a teammates player model will T-pose naked suddenly, unsure as to the cause, but once this happens they become totally invisible, not even a floating name.  Weird thing is they sometimes are invisible to only one teammate and not the whole team.
---
I think it’s random, but yesterday I did notice I never found a lever gun. I bought a few and traded for some but never picked one up. Finally bought the plan to build some to get more mods and guess what.. first crate I open after learning the plan.. lever. Killed a few things in a nuke zone... 2 more. 
---
Beats me, but I’ll tell yah right now they won’t be 11500 caps in 3 months. 
---
gauss or lever action for sure, but the handmade benefits from commando, not rifleman
---
Ya very true.
---
Have you tried farming Watoga? I see t60 sets there all the time. 
---
No sweat man, I'm on here a lot and i have never seen it suggested. I don't think it hurts to suggest something that has already been suggested since the goal is to get it noticed. Now if you were asking questions whose answers can be easily searched, that would be different.
---
We need this for all extractors.  And death bags.
---
Pacifist mode is so you don't accidentally harm others, anyone can still harm you. With or without a workshop, anyone can still kill you.
---
It is known!
---
The really rare items aren't spawns.  They're drops from quests or events. 
---
Once had a normal nonlegendary combat rifle overwrite my legendary combat rifle's favorited wheel slot.
---
Was most disconcerting until I realized I could get rid of that normal combat rifle without the game mistaking it for my legendary one.
---
I've been killed without a workshop while on pacifist mode. 
---
You give me the materials I can just craft you what you want
---
I recently found a quad crossbow. As appealing as it might be using that, there is just no way to make that weapon somehow reliable. 
---
How do I get this quest around level 20? I’m level 36 rn on my first “playthrough”
---
never do Mayor For a Day until you are 50, even if you aren't a melee build, you can sell All Rise for a pretty penny
---
How? where? how?
---
Oh, I just realized I misunderstood your problem.
---
You're inheriting locked workshops that you want to unlock. 
---
Are you getting these by a team member leaving or claiming them yourself? If it's a team member leaving it may not let you without replacing the resource generator. So, just store it and put it back. 
---
I know when I have friends build my bases, they can't even put locks on them, for a fusion core generator, I'm not sure how you would store and rebuild that. If it is a teammate, ask them to unlock before exiting the server.
---
If you're just claiming a workshop it should allow you to remove the lock on your own. But if not I'd try the same method above.
---
Ok now that I think about it, maybe I was killed before the last patch. Maybe slap damage was fixed. I'll have to see about this. This would be great if true.

About same for me as well. Completed it shortly after launch, just learning that its difficult to do now
---
Yeah like mistress of mystery and fire breathers and such. I’m just trying to find things like the Halloween witch costume and hunters coat, both of which I have already, but just some fun stuff like that. 
---
Those can be bought off the vendor bot if you come across him. 
---
...
---
Seriously?
---
Don't you have anything else to do than big this scheister??

The Brotherhood will destroy all raider scum!!!

you can go in water but you don't swim, you just walk on the bottom slowly, so be careful jumping into certain water, you might not be able to get out in the PA
---
Only other thing I can think of is me being on a team where my teamate owned a workshop maybe and/or he returned fire.. Either way it happened. And he was also chameleon while standing and with a weapon.. Is that possible at all without some sort of hack or exploit? 
---
Go talk to your mother or boss in that language and then tell us how far you got with that.
---
What makes you think you're in a position to make any demands like that? 
---
What do you do in the game? I get bored after an hour.
---
I have that mod 300 caps 
---
You forgot grape mentats. 
---
Many thanks!
---
*says in sassy voice* " That's not how my fallout 4 playthrough went!" Lol but for real we will see. I love to kill the BoS nice and slowly. And I get free armour to kill more worthless victims with! Yay! Lol
---
That was so much fun, thank you for awesome entertainment 😃
---
I play third person at long range cause Red Dead...  I'm oddly more accurate with the hud dot reticule than I am with the ads reflex dot sight.  The sway on scopes is insane and not worthwhile.
---
It works out though, you get about a 2x zoom from third person and after 800 hours of using a flir on a dmr in bf4's metro map, that's really all I need.
---
Various vendor bots sell it for ~50 caps. 
---
Is there somewhere that says that? Or just when all the terminal entries kinda stop happening?
---
just store your camp
---
This is hilarious!  Best I’ve done was to stack stash boxes as high as possible to melee flying scorchbeasts with some pubs.
---
dude, store everything and just leave the camp where it is
---
It just shows up when you walk into Whitespring.
---
Who are a police force. 
---
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Lasers. 
---
I am also curious about this. 
---
Will it reduce a level 100 to level 50? Will it reduce a level 150 to level 100? Or will it knock us all down to level 1 and create a level playing field for everyone over level 50? If it’s the latter, that seems quite frustrating, but it would counter the power levelling of characters using "exploits" pre-patch. 
---

---
Yeah I got lucky a few times with him and managed to get them
---
Ooo and sweet roll too, I always go with grape mentats plus sweet roll plus hard bargain for seriously expensive purchases like serum recipes, P.A plans etc. I don’t know what that adds up to in % price reduction in total but it definitely makes an impact
---
I got lucky enough to get not one, but two hunters long coats off him. They were stacked in his inventory, but didn't stack in mine. 
---
I just imagine them going to a settlement in DC and being super surprised. "Wait, Radiation *doesn't* make you need to eat 20 kilos of food a day? 
---
*gasp* 
---
You monster!
---
That’s freaking awesome
---
I killed all 10 on Christmas day and only got 10 caps out of it. Was it worth doing it?
---
Serum recipes?  Those effects don't work on other players lol. 
---
Seriously though, don't buy them from Modus. Get them for a fraction of the cost from other players on one of the trading subs. 
---
Yep. By the time we were done cycling him, I had 5 I think, along with a bunch of other stuff and maybe 100 caps left. 
---
Will you do 150?
---
Magnetic Personality and Herd Mentality, too.
---
It's in the OP. I recently did some testing to find out what percentage armor piercing clips add pre latest patch and now they do actually show the final tally with the magazines.
---
Yes, was using Awareness to check resistance.
---
Great points and well stated!
---
Same, I was cycling him with some friends but only managed to get one but that’s all I really need, if I ever come across more I’d get them just to sell because of how hard it can be to get them
---
Couldn't you just fast travel?
---
there's at least 3 wikis
---
I can do 250 as I payed more from watoga vendor for it
---
The very first time I went to Whitesprings, still a low level, all the ghouls spawned very quickly and chased/attacked me. Well over 20 of them at once for sure. I haven’t been back since.
---
Deal my psn is ryanburns003 I'm on now
---
Glad to read this. I’m Level 70 and so far I’ve found one. Apparently I’m right on course!
---
oh fuck really? where is it?
---
I like making life more of a challenge lol, gives me a reason to grind for caps, going on Grafton monster and super mutant killing sprees etc and is keeping me occupied till the new content comes 😂😂😂
---
Watch them all go north through Pennsylvania and end up slaves in the pitt
---
I have had a lot of fun and I'm still playing. Better with friends. 
---
They will be cheaper with hard bargain 3, eating sweet roll and taking grape mentats at the same time as using a charisma bobblehead 
---
I'll be on tomorrow I'll sell to you for 200 I'll be on about 5pm Aus time after work if u still want 
---
Maybe level 40-50 is the sweet spot... high enough not to die, low enough so they’ll spawn, and server hop if they go missing for awhile.
---
There is not, and this is an issue with many games that have an ingame roster. The only work around is to either explain to your friends your not looking to play or remove them.
---
The Charleston vendor bot also has a rare “Skiing red and green” outfit I just recently got. Never saw someone in game have it. Except on the wiki that it exists. But there are jumpsuits that you have a rare chance of getting by doing the Uranium Fever event. Also a western outfit and chaps from doing events/ daily quests in the toxic valley. Some super rare outfits are only obtained through region daily/events. You won’t be able to buy them off of anything unless another player sold it to a vendor, or you come on here to buy it for a crazy high price.
---
In Cranberry Bog at the ranger district office you can get a flight helmet that will be sitting on the gurney. Looks great with the bomber jacket. 
---
Maybe that player had alot of stealthboys. 
---
Probably similar to the reset you can do in skyrim. 
---
Honestly just got to the mothman museum. Go to the basement and you should find it there. Look closely though because it can be missed. 
---
Where is the body? I missed it in my play through (took 2h hours solo), logged out for the evening and came back the next day to find it wants me to start over from the beginning. I figured I'd just get a couple of friends to power me back through it, but if it's as simple as finding the body, I could do that instead.
---
I collect outfits too,  i should post a list of which ones i already own, maybe i have rare stuff in there without knowing 
---
I stumbled upon the flight helmet early today in that same spot earlier today ironically. Didn’t know that some dailies came with outfits as well, I’ve never gotten any outfits from doing events or dailies for that matter so guess I’ll have to start doing some more of those and hope I get some
---
Want to open the PC department if I'm allowed as lvl 14 with 2 good friends
---
Block for session works for me
---
I'm hoping for a permanent perk card per remort.
---
Yeah they are really rare. You’ll have to find a list or video that shows certain ones maybe. I never really did events or dailies until now but I’ve seen people in game with these outfits and I need them 
---
welcome to whitespring
---
He just said he’s overencumbered. 
---
Yeah happens to me too
---
the fav wheel just started bugging out for me since the last update
---
This is what I’ve been saying!!
---
If I take any that I particularly like, I just take a screenshot on the xbox to keep it 🤷‍♀️ 
---
I see you already found out my fellow mega sloth:)
---
Maybe not technically a pistol, but the 10mm SMG is secretly one of my favorite weapons. I crafted one, modded it, and it's my most reliable backup if an enemy closes the distance on my lever action. Generally tears things up, and a hoot to unload with. 
---
hour? there is enough content for at least 100-200 hrs of fun play
---
9 of 10 since October
---
Magic... or luck
---
Aslong there is a pacifist mode option, raiding is pretty boring 
---
i'm a fair player. nothing to be worried for
---
Yes there is actually. I’ve seen a “normal” sized glowing ghoul in Whitesprings a couple times now.
---
what about killing wendigo wearing clown suite?
---
I wonder if Bethesda placed camp flags in the game if they’d later create a capture the flag side mission. Could be interesting?
---
If i manage to get a jetpack mod i will let u know 
---
Put me down to 1 and give me 1 extra special point cap per prestige and i'm happy tbh.
---
The main story line isnt rly interesting but i love to explore the map
---
I fail to see what you're trying to say about that enclave hoodie. they look EXACTLY THE SAME. The ONLY difference I see is it looks a slightly redder shade due to the lighting of the pic. You're fucking pathetic.
---
There’s a video on YouTube where this guy goes over every rare outfit you can get from doing daily/events. 
---
On the world map, it's located south east, inside a mine. Kill your way to the end, you can skip the scorch beast, just sneak on the right side of the cave. Loot the body and listen to the last transmission from the array. 
---
I guess theres one person duping those over and over
---
personally mine caps at 175% of item value. so if i'd buy a plan that has value 100 bot would sell it for 175
---
Honestly i never encountered a duper so far
---
Did you have 4-5 sites claimed when this occurred, by chance?
---
Play the game? 
---
Add onto that a piece of unyielding armour and have low health.
---
COME AT ME BRO I'M HIDING BEHIND SEVEN WALLS
---
I killed 10 in "Beta" and 10 with a different character after launch, since I had to start over. I have different builds and have yet to kill one with my level 90, level 45, level 22, or level 15. I remember trying to get the holotapes..bad idea. This was before I knew those high level enemies stuck around, I was killed quickly, my weapons broke, I ran out of aid and ammo. I ended up scraping that character cause I was dying every 15 minutes.
---
WHERE ARE THEY?!
---
New endgame idea 😁
---
Maybe it's because I'm old and curmudgeonly, but a game has entertainment value if you feel it does. There's been a lot of negative press and rightly so. But they are also trying to make progress. I'm not going to white knight for Bethesda here but I am still having fun.
---
I have a built in team since my wife and I have MMOd  together since we were dating. I've also played games far worse and far better. Those that didn't improve I kicked to the curb.  I think it's a bit impatient to be asking for new content so soon, and the fact that they are roadmapping and planning new content is fine with me. I have alts and enjoy changing up playstyle. 
---
Did the game release before it should have? Probably. There were many bugs and felt like the beta was an alpha. Were they trying to meet quarterly earnings? Yeah, my opinion is definitely. But there isnt a single MMO I've played going back to MUDS (ok, so not mmo but still) and UO that didn't have some growing pains in the beginning.
---
TL;DR, Fun is where you find it and what you make of it.
---
I use both. Hunting rifle for proper 1-shot sniping when hidden, then swap to my sniper combat rifle for when my cover gets blown and baddies come rushing at me. 
---
Not really. About 75 percent of servers I join I can raid some either with them shooting back or using workshops. Or the occasional destroying a base and becoming wanted with a friend 
---
It's quite easy: If you don't like it, don't play it! Simple as that! Why come here and ask questions only you can answer yourself? Quite pointless, isn't it?
---
I for myself am playing since beta and still enjoy it.
---
So it's in the room with the scorchbeast? I killed one solo and then another one emerged. I just said F that and ran to the elevator at the end thinking I'd finish the mission by doing so.
---
Thanks for the help.
---
I got all 10 in about 30 minuts on my first character, within maybe 12 hours of the game launching. All subsequent chars havet seen a single one and now i just untrack it when i go in there. 
---
I really doubt it. We had a good 30 minute standoff before that quest marker BS, so he would have been completely breaking the bank trying for 30 minutes to kill one guy while continuously popping stealth boys. And I myself have had my game glitch out and give me permanent Chameleon, so I know for a fact it happens.
---
That's how they survived long enough to be "legendary ".
---
Yes, it's on the right side of that room, a dead corpse. Many other dead creatures laying around it.
---
No problem 😊
---
Just 2
---
Are you really focusing on a feature that has a vague description and a timetable of Summer 2019? No matter the game if you are not having fun right now then you should probably move on and come back later with fresh eyes. IMHO if you are having fun then push on till you have ever level of every perk card and can have any build you want at any time you want. 
---
While I am also curious about the second expansion "**Nuclear Winter"** I think Bethesda is probably focused on the patch, new features, and what they will be launching in ten days as part of the "**Wild Appalachia"** expansion that includes the new survival mode. If nothing in the new expansion hooks you then maybe tryout another game for a while. 
---
the amount of people at the event determines her health
---
I remember that quest because it was so unique lol I dont recall having any issues with it though.
---
endangerol, learn it, use it, love it, also psycho
---
If you are not holding up today's newspaper, I'll have my doubts ;)
---
check your quest list. it usually comes back every time you re-log
---
I'd worry about whether is was (50% of 50%), i.e 25%  or (50% + 50%).
---
It is great helping people, I rarely wear a headset but sometimes I do, especially when I am gifting in the wasteland. These poor low level 5 players were getting attacked by 12 feral ghouls so I stepped in and killed the ghouls. I gave them everything the ghouls dropped plus some stimpacks and ammo. They were thankful and I told them to try and level up before you go out in certain areas. 
---
Ah I was hoping that the people I was PvP’ing with didn’t mistake me for an exploiter and the situation sounded somewhat similar. I had chameleon armor on and was inching around, using my friend as bait. Died a couple times but it was pretty fun overall. 
---
Way late to the circle jerk bud, that was a couple months ago 
---
I've heard it's random but now I'm thinking it's a dice roll affected by certain factors, such as special, perks, and even equipment, so it's still random but not as much as pure rng.  I say this because I too have noticed drops that are more useful, and only recently so I bet it was a recent change, although why it's not in the patch notes is beyond me, you would think a change like this would make the community happier...
---
To belonnnnggggg
---
In the plaaaaace
---
Oh, no. This guy was SPRINTING  around with chameleon active. No inching around warily. 
---
If you're on a PC, there's a mod for that.
---
I killed em all at once during beta. Was this a thing people couldn't do? 
---
Interloper worshippers if I remember rightly. 
---
Isn't there a separate forum for this?
---
Worth using the mod until 
---
Isn't there a list on Dulfy.net?
---
Just thinking ahead, I like the game and wanted others opinions. Actually cancelled a upcoming pre order for a game I “thought” I loved because I can’t leave the wasteland long enough to play anything else:)
---
There are only 2 pieces -- head and body.
---
Alright. I actually giggled at that one.
---
I don’t know I’ve never checked there before
---
The  "**Wild Appalachia**" expansion launches in ten days and it will probably bring another wave of bug fixes along with new features. If what they have slated for that patch does not interest you then maybe you should move on. 
---
Also on a side note because you brought it up, I don't think anyone would say SWTOR failed. The game launched in 2011, went free to play, and from then on was a commercial success. Say what you want about liking or nor liking the game personally, but back in 2014 it was reported the game was still making 165 million in annual revenue. Considering it probably cost like 40-50 mill to make the game and then it defiantly made at least 150 million a year for like 3-5 years before the player base took a sharp decline and that is close to the definition of a success. The game was not as big as they wanted it to be but it was no failure is what I am getting at. 
---
Yikes. That sounds frustrating. I lose track of assaultrons so I can only imagine. 
---
the plans don't go between characters, one character could have a camp built that the other character literally can't build...
---
You only need to pop the stealthy boy when you want to move and let the armor handle things when you are still. Not saying he was not cheating but that there was a slim possibility he was not. 
---
Just remember that you loose caps equal to your level when you die in PvP.  
---
So how many points do you need to respec?  Is it worth the amount you will potentially lose?
---
Will the respec enable you to better defend yourself in PvP situations?
---
Likewise will leveling up a new character correctly save you enough? Keep in mind you will need to collects plans and recipes all over again.
---
Only YOU can answer the question of what is better.
---
could they not be leftovers?
---
Oh, you should. They have photos too.
---
Sweet, have to go look soon
---
Sounds like poor planning. If your holding a workshop, don't go out exploring and getting over encumbered.  If you are doing that, you are not prepared to defend the workshop which can happen at any time.  So sorry, but your situation is of your own doing.
---
I tested it. Nothing changed in the stats and then it just turned into a regular fusion core. I think power armor accepts ultrasite fusion cores, but I don't believe it's ment to. 🤔 
---
I played aliens : colonials marines
---
Sorry, didn't mean to hurt you that much
---
There's two types of Fallout 76 players. 
---
The ones who sunk hundreds of hours into a game and are some how shocked and surprised that they become bored. 
---
And people who didn't. Who seem far more excited about the upcoming content. Who are getting far more enjoyment of the game. 
---
Also, mistreatment of the lore that goes back 20 years? I love the original Fallout's, but original Fallout fans need to shut up about it already. At this point Fallout is BGS Fallout. Not interplays. BGS has developed, crafted, and honed the themes, tone and setting of Fallout far beyond what the originals did. 
---
People who are irritated about where BGS' has taken Fallout need to remember they saved the IP from the dumpster fire that was Interplay, and if they hadn't the IP would have likely died forever. 
---
Hard bargain, 15 charisma, and which was it. . . Berry mentats? Grape?  What ever, point is I paid less than 6k from the merchant.
---
For me it would be ok to just delete them, they are annoying af 
---
Orbital strike combined with 10 artillery barrages incoming!
---
Sure, psn SaintNitsu but you join my server.
---
Kk I’ll be on in about 15mins
---
Or less
---
Right... you can read my comment again, because with level 92 it took me all that killing to rise the level by one inch.
---
Furthermoremore, doing whitespring, events and workshops over and over is really boring.
---
This
---
Level 122, played since beta, I've killed 2.
---
I know all about how chameleon works. I use it. So I know when someone is either cheating or just using stealth boys when they move. This guy was continuously running around the workshop, not crouching, for what must have been a good 30 minutes looking for me. Not ONCE did he become even momentarily visible. I was initially thinking he WAS using a stealthboy, so I patiently waited for it to expire. When it never did, I realized what was going on. 
---
If carrots is what you need, then Groves Family Cabin is what you're looking for.
---
Im always giving stuff away to the lower lvls, often times ill make a loop of whitesprings and when im done i normally have close to 10 legendary weapons\ armor. Mostly 1/2 stars between lvl 25-35. So if yalls on xb1 and are around those lvls look me up. Gamer tag. " CyanideZero" 
---
A good place to find unique headgear is the ranger base in cranberry i got med googles and 3 flight helmets from there dunno if anything else spawns ther but its always worth a check.
---
If your a 1 Star legendary, you should have a chance of losing one of your 1 Star weapons or armor. ;)
---
...I mean, just because a given group of people that you ran with put in fucking insane hours, did all the early game (some would say early beta) content, doesn't mean the game's dead by a long fucking shot. 
---
There are 1.4k ACTIVE fucking users of this game _in this subreddit alone_ right now. 
---
&gt;  What is the fucking point of pacifist mode if some random asshole can just come up and one hit me with a gauntlet or power fist and kill me?!?!?! 
---
Pretty this type of build is next to be nerfed.  Combined with stealth it's pretty much invincible in a PVP workshop scenario. 
---
My friends and I have learned this from experience. 
---
Also I wouldn't be surprised if the workshop system reverts back to as it was.  The 2/19 patch basically made it a complete waste of time.  If someone contest it from anywhere in the workshop, that makes it impossible to defend. It gives every advantage to the invader. 
---
Workshops are now completely worthless for those who truly want to farm resources with them. They are basically just PVP shitholes. 
---
Hey I can help you with anything mate
---
Earthbending mutation?
---
Think of all those springs, screws and ballistic material just waiting to be collected!
---
Well ain't worked for me. In another thread everyone said it doesn't work to get rid of all mutations and re gain it. After the incubation where it shows normal but don't work it only shows the -××% hp debuff in mutation list. 
---
Don't assume anything during incubation time
---
Med goggles are a thing! I’ll have to check more often then!
---
You are meant to do the quest when your a low level, takes like 5 mins to complete, or get a friend who is like level 20 to spawn into the server  first. 
---
I mean, on one hand, I agree that pacifist mode is fucking garbage in this game, the number of times I've been killed in 3-5 hits is fucking frustrating. 
---
But while the entire "Workshops are a PVP mechanic" is a fucking STUPID idea, that's what's going on here. If I have a "claim a workshop" challenge, I do it, then I server hop, because toxic griefer scumbags will come along just to fuck with you, all the fucking time. 
---
TLDR, you're flat out wrong, but your general sentiment is in the right place. 
---
No, but you can read the terminals in the vault and see that there had been some minor problems but not much. Apart from some presumed Nuka Cherry thief there were no severe mental illness or criminal behaviour. 
---
That's...pretty much what bethesda's going for, though. Even though statistics from consoles show the vast majority of their active consumer base aren't griefers, just about every move they make is to make it easier for griefers to make the game shitty for the rest of us. 
---
I killed all 10 ages ago, was happy that I had gotten over it, then I changed servers to join a friend and the quest was back at 9/10.
---
Haven't seen one since.
---
I mean, have you ever tried to WORK with neon? Personally I think the real stumbling block there should be a high-tier crafting card of some description...
---
Are you on?
---
My mark 3's havent work since the game came out. I have 15 in my storage since none of them work. 
---
This is the best advice I've seen on this subreddit in ages. I'm getting sick of the speed demon negatives and will be taking these cards on my next level ups :-)
---
Light combat armor would be given to soldiers whose role would be hindered by the increased weight of medium and heavy armor. A sniper, for example, would likely not be given bulky, visible armor and would either abandon armor entirely or take light combat armor and some camouflaging gear.
---
My shotgun , simple and efficient
---
Nice, always a good tool
---
I wish the recon scope kept enemies tagged until dead and looted. 
---
Golfers aren't the endgame killing wendigo in a clown suit is
---
Just had this happen twice when I died on the rooftop when uploading the virus in Watoga. Really annoying as I had to restart the game to get rid of the black screen. It made me loose all my junk.
---
Ye i had that on ps4 too. Maybe the server is in need of maintenance or something? Hot fixes? Crispy crunchy tender flaky patch maybe?
---
Prove with pics or never happens xD
---
To change servers, while in game, open menu by hitting escape and then hit C for Social, then click on your name and Leave World.
---
This guy just ripped me off. He offered 10K and an AAE Hunting Rifle for my AAERW handmade. After he bought the handmade for 10K he logged out. His psn is the same The_Wolf_King456 
---
I have him scamming me recorded and screenshots of the trade chat both on reddit and PlayStation messages. 
---
this is quality content 
---
Ok thanks for the update. Must have been really recent change.
---
I have found that placing a load of nuke mines helps with this
---
gauss rifle, still looking for that 3 star...
---
Damn, I just had a 3 star one the orher day, Instigating but it was only level 35
---
Good info, thank you!
---
At my camp, I have 4 Water Purifiers, 10 Corn stalks, and 8 Blackberry bushes. Very helpful with Greenthumb Perk.
---
I grab 100 Dirty Water from the nearby water source and convert it to 50 Boiled Waters, then I cook BlackBerry Juice and Corn Soup.
---
Each only weighs 0.5
---
I sell the Purified Water (4 cap each) to Vendor.
---
Thank you for this info!! I spent damn near an hour trying to figure out what the heck I was doing wrong. 😆 Dropping every single holotape that I was able to drop, fixed the bug. Ugh. Thanks dude! 
---
Bloodied Switchblade + Swing Speed
---
I suppose it might be like scouts get light or sturdy and front line troops get heavy. Or troops in an armored vehicle or vertibird would probably get light armor etc
---
Oof
---
Anywhere lol
---
Yep, may well set my camp up for more food and water!
---
Ye this is odd
---
ships in the night...
---
I use other QoL mods, but I'm nervous about something that changing a texture/lighting entry.  
---
Will their anti-cheat pick it up and screw us?  
---
Is not being rewarded for combat part of the intended experience?
---
Dude thanks for this amazing tip - did not know about this but I've found a couple of YouTube vids explaining it, but one unanswered question. Is there any way you can remove the mat/campfire after moving the crops inside?
---
I hated pvp. Got all the way up to lvl 310 and was being farmed for caps. Not ever been a big pvp player but someone told me the furious explosove cryolator i have would be good so i spent all muh caps, repaired all muh armor and went out looking for wanted player. I gotta say, its fucking enjoyable when youre not getting cap raped by a team of three arseholes with tse weapons. Won a few, lost waaay more, and im not salty because its not costing all the junk i happened to have on me and 300+ caps everytime. Im game 😄 
---
The current annoyances consist of...  
---
1. CAMP items taking too much space in the total allowed limit.  I have a base, but no walls or ceiling.  
---
2. Bank weight limit is still far too low.
---
3. If you don't know how you want your lvl 50 Stats to be, you will mess up and have to start over.
---
4. Many Perks are not as good as one imagines.  Such as the Perk that "helps" with Vendor pricing.  (Charisma of 5 with 3 ranks in the Vendor lowering price perk, along with Grape Mentats (+5 Charisma and "lower Barter prices" ends up being a 1 cap difference for selling Purified Water (Normally 4 caps per, 5 caps per with Grape Mentats and Perks.  At best, it lowered the price of a plan costing about 3400 by 5% )
---
Yeah i first noticed that in the silo run when you have to get biometrics scanned. I think its when enemies are close.

...dude...
---
And the statistics say no one has time to craft there to busy repairing weapons after patch 6 killed durability further 😂
---
Juicehead brings nothing but devisive commentary and ill informed conclusions. Fuck that gobshite lol
---
Nope, standing next to the radiation barrels 🤷🏻‍♂️ ill flag it up with Bethesda in case anyone else experiences this 
---
Thanks! I'll try and be mindful of this when I next try to mutate! 
---
I've been saying this since i found out they nerfed the .50 cal receiver for the hunting rifle. Those are freaking anti-material rounds irl!! It shouldn't take 5 rounds to the head of anything not made of several inches of metal. ONE .50 cal bullet should obliterate anything wrapped in fleshy goodness. And one specific enemy the .50 cal sniper rifle if it was more realistic would be perfect for are sentry bots. You should be able to target the fusion core without waiting for the cool down that bullet should punch right through front, back, side it don't matter.
---
I'd love to see the kind of variety in ammo that the original System Shock had AP, HE.
---
I miss my penetrator perk from fo4. I wish they'd implement that
---
The server is basically a super-database.  The only reason to have bank limits is to limit memory storage.  For every item in your bank, they have to store at least an item code, and maybe a quantity value.  For food, it would require recording the time-stamp when it was created.  As for Weapons, Armor, and PA, it would consist of Item Code, Mod Codes, Legendary Level (0 through 5), Legendary Trait Codes, and Durability.  
---
The best tactics to deal with the weight limit currently consists of scrapping all junk, removing all mods that add weight to Guns, Armor, and PA, and then keep one set of PA loaded on a Power Armor Chassis.
---
That’s true.
---
All zero star legendaries retreat while the 1-3 stars always engage.
---
Darn, that's exactly what i wanted to do. 
---
Call the cops. 
---
I've had the bug once or twice as well, but I thought it'd be only on my end, guess not
---
Check for graphics card or CPU over-heating?
---
Have you uninstalled and reinstalled FO76?
---
Control + Alt + Del
---
It seems quiet in the world's though. Not sure of anyone else seen this too
---
I can never place more than 3 mines before placing more detonates the oldest
---
How can we Join the group?
---
&gt; Get them for a fraction of the cost from other players on one of the trading subs
---
why would anyone be selling such a plan though? dupes?
---
My TS dragon.
---
That's a good combination right there.
---
do multiple such pieces stack?
---
Yeah, thats why its effective, if someone is in the blast radius they will take damage. So if some arsehole is trying it with you, you basically create a rolling thunder effect by back peddling and dropping the mines 👍
---
*Huge elongated sigh
---
"Oh Bethesda......"
---
Booooring.
---
Serum plans drop from the SBQ.  The dupers didn't buy them from Modus, they farmed them from the queen or bought them off people who did. 
---
When they were going for 1k each, yeah, they were dupes.  Now though, you can still get them, it'll just cost a lot more, but nowhere near as much as buying from Modus. 
---
Not a problem, I'd guessed this was crafted on mobile, I can't imagine being able to do that and not be pulling one's hair out in large clumps.
---
On PC the spoiler tag in Reddit is as simple as selecting the text wanted and hitting the exclamation symbol on the edit bar that is between the *Superscript* and *Heading* buttons, know idea about mobile though.
---
Thanks again for taking the time to post you encounter, a great read ;)
---
I just fought one that refused to go boom, just kept smacking me with his beeping ball for a solid minute 
---
Can we upload images and videos with the new moderators in the team?
---
Currently I can't upload any images here.
---
I can be halfway down the stairs at Whitesprings before I'm pulled back to the door, also none of the items/bins are loot able in that time.  
---
BUT it's not every time, so now I just wait at the door for a few seconds to be on the safe side.
---
Holy hell XD. And here I'm waiting for Survival beta to come out so I could level my 3rd. I only have ideas for 2 other characters until new perks eventually come out. 
---
speak for yourself
---
I am massively excited. The only big that still consistently effects me is the excavator power armor carry weight bug. Losing that 100+ as soon as you die or exit the PA. Ridiculous that that is still a thing 4 months in, considering it's the most used armor in the game.
---
Besides that, I'm hella excited for the legendary vendor. How is that not the most exciting part of this update?! IT GIVES US A REASON TO GRIND, despite having (usually)  shit legendary loot drop. It's now worth something. End game achieved.
---
1. Idk, probably no
---
2. If you like that spot, it's a good one, however it is good to build bases near water so you can build purifiers
---
3. At level 7 weapons don't matter, later on you'll have to get good legendary, two-handed melee weapons for maximum damage.
---
This is the wasteland !!
---
Great story.
---
I dunno if the space suit helmet is rare, but I found it in an unmarked store in Charleston, close to where you spawn after a fast travel. It was on a shelf in a... Dry cleaner? Near the beauty salon.
---
Also had a nurse's uniform, if that's useful.
---
The space helmet looks good if you're wearing a bunch of mismatched armour over the Vault Suit, makes you look like a proper scavver. I dunno if a full space suit exists, though
---
When will you stop playing the game?
---
should i? there is new content soon, survival mode, prestiging, raids. Can't stop won't stop
---
Upload your image to Imgur and post the Imgur link in your post body. We don't allow direct image posts.
---
can't take any conclusion on the hoodie from a low quality phone-taken picture nor from a good quality but tiny resolution photo
---
Not sure. Might do since other pieces stack, but I've only got one piece at moment so couldn't say for sure.
---
Saw one run away and hide in a corner from a liberator, and he had a minigun. Eee a spider!
---
I tagged one with my lever gun it ran off so I followed it and it ran into a death claw that finished him off hehe.
---
I've had the x01 jetpack mod disappear out of my stash box and then time were it shows I have all the needed mats but won't let me craft 
---
Already did
---
Hey, somebody make a moan thread about finding lunch boxes in game and we'll see if we can get that wanker juicehead to make a bitch video about it!
---
I miss the loading scroll thing from fallout 3  where it told me things I did "60 pants exploded". Good old pick pocketing 
---
Thought about it this very morning. good idea.
---
This is what the game is best for, not questing or farming, but having fun with friends, and making new ones.
---
Go and have fun with it then, we'll be here when you finish it. Enjoy yourself.
---
If any of my shotguns had a legendary effect beyond my quad combat shotgun, they'd probably be my favourite.
---
mods used to be able to be scrapped, and you might not have had the perk to craft what you were trying to craft
---
&gt; Maybe the server is in need of maintenance or something? 
---
maybe, I was alone on a server after being there a long time, it definitely could use a reboot lol
---
yeah, I've seen it mentioned a few times
---
I like to help out power armor players with the odd fusion cores,I have power armor that I only use in a nuke zone so I only need a few cores,while out getting scrap yesterday I came across 3 cores and held on to them until I bumped into a guy at the whitesprings and gave them to him,to me this is what the game is about helping out each another as I've no interest in pvp.
---
The other day while fighting the Sq I killed myself and a guy with a heavy bounty on him came to my aid and for this I just want to say thank you to him as I didn't expect this at all.
---
I only got this because I got swarmed then had to run so I could single out the fucking wendigo attacking me. So. Many. Rads.
---
Is this woolies?
---
If you go back to the vendor and try to buy the plan again does it show as a known plan?
---
Does it remind you how much you hate communists (IE the Chinese) ?
---
They still spawn at higher levels. They just become ridiculously rare. I killed my last 4 mixed in with high level ghouls. I actually saw two golfer ghouls a couple day sago when I went to Whitesprings.
---
Is [this]([Fallout 76 Build with 1/1/1/1/1/1/1]\(https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwAAAAAAAAABAQETAQIDBAUGBwgJCgsMDQ4PEBESEwLEAQMA\)) what you are looking for?
---
It does. You can get the helmet and suit from the crashed space station.
---
With the player population going ever down I think they are trying to keep a smaller number of server instances full and not adding players to poorly populated worlds.
---
Its been 1 hr you liar
---
I am having a ton of fun building a cool camp. And there are still a few recipes and plans to see. But tbh, if I start to feel like I’m getting bored, why not just put the game down for a few weeks and try something else and give the content a bit of time to come. Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
---
Thanks for the answer!
---
Images are standard on most subreddits. Why not here? 
---
I complete that mission in 30 min what is wrong with it
---
Lvl 260 and I have never seen one... my quest stage is still 0/10 lol
---
Well personally put it in my stash box and got every crafting perk fully ranked, seen and done all after almost 700hrs
---
r/woosh
---
I'll look into that, I didn't see one when I was there, but then again, I'm not the brightest bulb in the Vault
---
yeah, mods used to be able to be scrapped, when building something and you are out of raw materials it uses non scrapped items, even from your stash, now mods won't scrap no matter where they are, and if you are sure you had the perk equipped I would submit a ticket, cos yeah, bugs def exist...
---
Where do they spawn?  I must’ve walked every pixel within that circle and not seen 1 ghoul riding caddy.  Do I need to wear the golf outfit and lift my skirt to attract them?  
---
Yeah, had it happening loads last night, I fast travel first and my tight wedge daughter travels to me for free but it makes working together impossible once she arrives.
---
It’s not too late. Fallout 4’s content was started to be released pretty much on the same schedule as 76’s is. But they do have a lot of work to do. 
---
Personally I don’t feel the game lacks content for 3-4 months of playing. I’ve never felt like I’ve been close to running out of things to do. 
---
But i know that I play less than some others that devote more time. 
---
Considering my camp is in the mire, with the super dense vegetation you mentioned, and my character and I both have a 1 Perception, I would love this.
---
Yeah I gave the game a break because of the horrendous glitches but coming back I enjoy how smooth it feels compared to how it felt before and I just love playing it now. 
---
I want to find more recipes and plans because for me building my camp as best as can be will be my endgame. 
---
I would want people to come by and see it's a place to eat something, get a drink of pure water and being able to rest in a comfortable place because comfort is number 1# priority to me.
---
Also because I like coming home to camp after a long days haul out in the wasteland.
---
It helps enforce Rule 3.
---
Quad harpoon gun
---
You'd enjoy Subnautica.
---
I feel like the harpoon gun is a serious statement piece, if somebody is rocking one of those you know they're a badass.
---
Try the market sub
---
No I seriously already did 
---
Anti-armor Death Tambo, temporary powerful replacement for building my melee perks
---
r/woosh 
---
Camp building is my endgame too, although I am making a new character now and I’m not quite there yet on this one. The first batch from Wild Appalachia may not be enough to give the game the life it needs, but I think once we see the player vending and legendary trade npc come in to play things will get exciting again
---
It's quite hidden. Where the boss spawns there, there is a sheet of paper which contains the code to airlock C7. This airlock is at the northern end of the area which is locked via a keypad that you need to use to open it up. So, I don't blame you for missing it lol.
---
I would love to return, but the problem is that The Division 2 is released at the same time as the new content starts dropping to FO76. 
---
I wonder how much this hurts FO76? Is the player base same with these two games? 
---
witchunt!!
---
The black powder should not be more powerful than a missile either... lol
---
Well I rolled an alt for a different build and had a lot of fun with it now that I knew what I was doing. You will get a much more tailored result.
---
Yes just noticed this yesterday because my health wasn’t regenerating, I was permanently stuck in caution mode. No idea when that started.
---
0 of 10 since October.  
---
After countless visits. And then i quit ):
---
Guess I'm going on an adventure to get it, then!
---
:D
---
As nice as this would be, you have to understand that the pictures you take are stored locally on your computer. To allow me to see that photo your client would have to upload to the server which would then have to make the picture available to me...
---
In a game where textures and entire tables will not load from locally sourced data.
---
I’m just posting facts. No witch-hunt involved.
---
Yeah the first batch does seem a little lacking I'm hoping this piece of DLC really pulls through, I guess what would also be interesting is hosting a bar. I mean what with all the apparently crazy combinations you can make with liquor it would be nice to make a few caps on the side with people coming to buy your wares and goods.
---
I live in cranberry bog and I have been trying to find a way to fight scorchedbeasts properly but to no avail only thing that helps is pacifying them if it gets to deadly but I guess that's practice of some sorts to the queen I'm a level 61 but I see level 50's and 40's handling them so guess through trial and error I can figure out a way.
---
Honestly the roadmap looked pretty unsubstantial to me especially considering this is gonna be coming out over the course of the year like a drip feed. Based on the game's track record so far I can't say I'm very optimistic about any new content though I am hoping for something to give me a reason to play again.
---
Daft question, but do you have the Power Smith perk card activated in your intelligence? Without it you won’t be able to apply the jet pack mod I don’t think. 
---
Use your brain
---
I just got scammed and am trying to let everyone know to be careful of this guy and I have to deal with you too? Awesome
---
I feel like it is faster to just make a new char. To respec 30 points of special you have to gain 30 levels then another 30 to get all the perks. All the while having to earn a ton more exp than what is required to go from lvl 1 to 50 because your already lvl 50+
---
Thats a hell of a story
---
When in doubt, break the legs. Always. Break. The. Legs. 
---
There is more servers than players atm
---
Nice. I'll look into it. I used to mod a few games back in day. Might be fun.
---
Go outside?
---
I feel for you. I only pop back in every couple of weeks to see if things have improved. 
---
I think if I was desperate to not drop stuff/server hop I’d try the power armor glitch to get through the map. I believe if you do you’ll fall and respawn somewhere on the map nearby. Maybe you’ll die but your junk bag will be hopefully reachable 
---
lol, sorry bro, can't read too busy playing KH3
---
Fallout 4 is still good. But I quite enjoy fallout 76. Ice meet allot of awesome people on there
---
Yeah they do run out quicker i just like having it. It has saved my life so many times i tend to forget about my health so my power armour does the work for me lol.
---
First, if you get more powerful abilities, it aint prestige, it is mandatory. Second, first 50 level we had quests to do, now I am supposed to do what, do same quests again? Shoot everything I see for exp? Do event after event after event.
---
The message I get is server not responding, controls have been disabled and then it kicks me out. I've checked connectivity on PS4 and it states 100%- excellent connection.
---
Its against the reddit rules is what he wants to say. Next time engage a middle man 
---
It’s not against the rules if I’m not witch-hunting 
---
Do you not get the message if you launch at prime fissure site?
---
I'm on the only platform PS4 as I love the dark side ;) - I've reinstalled it twice. Ow, same problem both times and on first reinstall I had updated application to latest patch..it was however playing up before that..I've had the game since Xmas and it's been awesome up to now
---
I’m not asking anyone to go after him. And I’m not accusing him of cheating. I am stating that he scammed me and that I have a lot of proof. 
---
Dude, what I paid for the game is irrelevant, the issue is connectivity
---
I love the 5 gulper raid at the NAR yard by Watoga. Wander up and the super mutants are being slaughtered by gulpers, cool, but they are utterly immune to my tattling gun.  
---
I can stand on the stairs and put 70-80 rounds into one of them and it keeps coming, break out the handmade and it's a different story.  
---
BUT using a shotgun with enforcer gives you crippled gulpers, which fucking breakdance around on the floor and is possibly the funniest thing I've seen in the game.
---
No idea,i did the others.
---
Could it be that hole in the mire?
---
Question number 1, can I have 2 of them? 
---
Question number 2, is this on ps4?
---
Bethesdagear is a verified Twitter account, there is no check mark after the name so this is not actually Bethesda 
---
My prediction is that each prestige will set you back 50 levels, and for each prestige you get a legendary star next to your name, among whatever other bonus they plan on adding
---
This is worth noting and I will look into this more but it was working perfectly for 2.5 months with hardly any disconnects, I am checking my notes now to see if I had the issue before the latest patch update as I'm not so sure now.
---
Thank you for this suggestion, I will look at this now and see from there
---
no, they can only spawn on low level player. so you need a friend
---
Aware of that, and I also said that the same number of people showed up both times.
---
The event outfit are super rare. I ve been doing nothing but events for 3 weeks now and none of them dropped.
---
Love this concept. I've been a massive Fallout fan for years but Fallout 76 killed it for me to be honest. Not the world - it's inhabitants who mostly seemed to be griefers. It's good to see people taking the law into their own hands. I do have some questions for you, however;
---
\&gt; How do you deal with due process?
---
\&gt; Are all muties and civies treated the same?
---
\&gt; What happens if someone has been wrongfully arrested or killed?
---
If you can answer all these satisfactorily I'd be interested in supporting your cause with webspace for a website and comms software, for free.
---
I know it's difficult for you to see past your tremendous ego, but you're missing the point. We didn't kill her much easier the second time because some insipid self-important chump showed up.
---
Where did all the mines come from, anyway? Up until the Mothman patch I don't believe I ever saw a single active mine anywhere. Grenade bouquets, yes, but no mines. I was kinda wondering what the point of Light-Footed was, as traps aren't all that common in 76. Now though mines are abundant in my farming areas. I gather they disabled them for the sake of server stability for all this time? 
---
analytics is very hard to keep track of in a game lol 
---
I'm curious, what are the crafting components? Is a lunchbox not required?
---
Cool, I hope you enjoy it. I wish I had a PC so I could download that, when the time comes.
---
I have been long time laser user. Just start using plasma gun. Very high maintenance but it is so much fun. 
---
What are you talking about game doing better? Friends list players are all grayed out, endgame is missing, SBQ is same garbage as it has been since release, more than ever people report being alone in the server and asking where everyone is? Even the content that is coming out has been rationed and next 3 months of content will give no point of return to game, because all of it is basically "cosmetics". Look at the next update- brewery. Has anyone said:"Alcohol is crucial to my build","I wanna buy all your alcohol","We need more alcohol". No, because it is useless. Even the Nuke cola is just a Stimpak. 
---
I know for certain there's one that spawns in the raider camp north of the Top of the World (the one with the water purifiers). The damned toads keep triggering the mine before I can disarm it though!
---
The heated pitchfork. It's pretty useless against some high level enemies, or big hitters like Grafton Monsters, but I like how it looks.
---
The tactical handmade rifle sounds nice when it fires, too.
---
What do you get for completing it? Is there any more to the quest line?
---
There is that one challenge that asks you to kindly dispose of 76 scorched using a crossbow. Your Quad Crossbow would come in handy for that: just go to Morgantown Airport, where there are only lvl 1 to lvl 6 scorched, and one-shot the hell out of them!
---
I would love to find an explosive crossbow, though. Is that a thing?
---
Jesus I've never read such a meaningless paragraph
---
My longest fall time was off the Gorge River bridge, I could make a cup of coffee in the time it took to hit the bottom. Bird bones, goat legs, one armor, it took off about a third of my health. 
---
Not until summer, when they add Vaults. Spring update bring nothing to endgame to replace SBQ. Legendary vendor will reduce SBQ RNG, but you still have to do that pos.
---
Should’ve have more players around I think the key issue is spawning when other players arrive 
---
Maybe she will be a NPC when the Wastelander dlc comes out. I am 99% sure that this dlc will add humans to the game since it will include a brand new faction
---
Good advice that will save some repair headaches.
---
I was server hopping while levelling and filled 10 of them in around an hour so ....
---
Nope, didn't work.  
---
But i found out that spot is a good source for 'Collect Bone-parts challenges" like skulls a few days ago
---
As a heavy weapons user, Id love to have:
---
one for travel and crafting to reduce my carry weight and build stuff.
---
one for combat.
---
Then may a misc one. 
---
3 does seem like a sweet spot.
---
It looks great even with just the armor. The mask covers the neck. They spent a lot of time on these costumes it seems. 
---
It's not necessary to go to the old fishing hole. There is a whole list of other places to go if you just click on the challenge
---
I like Far Cry's little X on the compass, unobtrusive, informative, simple.
---
That would be cool.
---
If the handmade is automatic, yes.  Non-auto handmade is under Rifleman.  I've modded my auto handmade drops to remove that receiver so my Rifleman kicks in. 
---
Seem to me the ones willing to support the game further have a louder voice on the subject than those that just complain online. After all at my job I pay more attention to paying customers then those that never buy anything.
---
nothing. it just disappears
---
Mines like 5 now :S. Plus I have eagle eye mutation so thats - 4. Only have 1* Starched Genes perk. So now my X-01 just sits in my inv, along with an ultracite I am configuring. I keep about 5 cores around in case I wanna do a nuke zone. 
---
Thanks, didn't notice there were more able locations for it
---
Discord on the right
---
I'm with you. I buy clothing and camp items, but the frames and little pictures are just not worth it. They'd be a nice present though. Love the clean clothing though, I buy all of them!
---
my TS pipe bolt action, still hunting for a better version of it
---
a close second is my pipe revolver, i just wish they came in legendary
---
I see a comment has been submitted, but no text or anything, weird 
---
Devs are aware of this, but as they pointed out some time ago,  a timer will not solve it since there also has to be an indicator if this is the time left to start the event, the time left until the event is finished or the time left to do a certain part of the event. The last they commented on this they said they wanted to combine a timer with a visual aid to show how "complete" the event is at the same time, possibly changing event markers size or color.
---
Renrar is a  moron mate, I say fuck the bloody cunt and lets get on with our days.
---
I haven't come across that yet in my travels
---
Maybe the pond where the SM behemoth spawns by twin lakes?
---
Lol yes mate. U have good eyes!
---
I would assume that if something detects a problem with the server your on and it is not game breaking, the server stops letting new players join it randomly. Your friends can still join you. Once the last player leaves the server it will restart. Seems to happen after the SBQ is spawned and killed... for good reason that event kills a server.
---
ah, I see, I didn't know there was a non automatic receiver for the handmade
---
**BADTFL**: Bureau of Alcohol, Drugs, Tab...
---
[Here you are](https://i.imgur.com/4IOQTs2.png)

This is brilliant! Next time I will have a few of those in my back pocket. :)
---
Means the person who submitted the comment deleted it!
---
People always say Build near water... but I have 3 rows of small purifiers in my base, (15 total) that pump out way more purified water than I ever need.
---
I wonder how that unlocked? 
---
Saw a legendary liberator run circles around the lower floor of the golf club.  Took two or three of us heading it off like we were trying to catch a damn fish by hand, lol.
---
Now I saw the notification of the comment, but I see no comment again. And deleted comment says [Deleted comment]
---
I’ll just try to repost the post
---
I'm afraid I can't remember at all sorry
---
Daaaaaamn.
---
No, there is no cross system at all so you would have to start over on PC.  Bases are easily movable so you can change them when you find a site you like better or that offers better resources.  You will continuously find better weapons and you can match your perks to your needs.  You're still very early in the game so just use the best things you find or make.  And just as an FYI, go to your map and hit the options button.  There is a "Help" section that gives a lot of info about the game systems and mechanics.  Welcome to Appalachia!
---
Alright, thanks. The hard part will to be finding one alone that isn't set spawned. Thank you kindly.
---
That's likely because they spawned when no one was around and we're still there unkilled.  They won't spawn if there is only high levels in the area.
---
It’s a mechanism inherited from Fallout 4. You enter and exit your power armor about twice as fast in Caution/Danger mode.
---
I think story wise, our personal one character (and maybe a small team of 3 other people) is the only one who canonically goes through the main Overseer missions. At least that's how the Overseer's tapes are worded/implied. 
---
That means there is probably only a handful of people who are actually immune to the virus. 
---
Which means eventually everyone will likely become infected and die. 
---
It's called sarcasm.
---
Elon Musk is way more terrible than most though
---
There's also the clean spacesuit and helmet. I found the clean helmet randomly somewhere the other day; still waiting to get the suit to go with.
---
I would put them in a bag and take a pic of it at a location that was changed with the last patch (if there is such a place), but then you could still insist that I might have stashed these two last month. Can't win against paranoia, right? ;-)
---
I have the red and green skiing outfit, and there's also a navy and orange one. I think I bought it somewhere (not from that bot), but I don't remember where anymore.
---
Actually, like the old handmade, level 15 is the sweet spot.  Get to WS, server hop till the ghouls are level 9-15 and you will get your 10 in a few mins. 
---
I always dump stuff in front on the vendor at flatwoods, Usually lower level legendary items along with a load of ammo.
---
We need a time sink. I can think if a few ootions.
---
1/ improve reward drops on non repeatable quests
---
2/ gives you the option to go back and get that level 50 version of the static item.
---
3/ improve names items
---
4/ unlock ability to use additional stars
---
5/ some passive non-perk benefits maybe?
---
Yes on mandatory.
---
No enemies that I could see (I was close by and waiting for them to start on me tbh) and no bodies..
---
I've seen Scorched do this as well. 
---
You can do lower lvl workshops and still get plans
---
Are you using Escape Artist? If not you need to be. Break contact, turn a corner, re-stealth,  go back to killing.
---
Post a link to your build if you can. Something has to be off if you are really having issues with being swarmed. Only mutation I run is Carnivore just to make Good Doggy and Canned Dog Food even more OP than it already is.
---
Use VATS if you aren't already. 
---
As a point of reference, I can stealth into Whitesprings Golf Club, clear the entire building, without being touched once, and be back out the same entrance in about 90 seconds if I don't stop to strip the place of plastic, etc. That is using a non-legendary lever action rifle.
---
Sneak attacks ftw. It may only be 2.5 times during the day, but at night, using a suppressed weapon it shoots up to 3.75. We are unstoppable killing machines at night. Scorch Beasts should die before you have to reload as long as you get the jump on them.
---
Something is off if super mutants are giving you issues at all. 
---
Has anyone else never seen a suicider yet? I'm Level 96.
---
I can make em my psn is YoungSpud-san 
---
I didn't see it there yet, so I made it happen for you.
---
Ok, when can you get on?
---
Really, that one was obvious, though. Even after the nerf, I rarely join servers that at least half the workshops get claimed. I still do them, if I'm bored.
---
Right now 
---
Guaranteed on the way into West tek
---
Request sent, you have a mic?
---
Yes sir
---
Ok, but I’m waiting for your accept, I’ll be in the game waiting 
---
Yep joining now
---
I bet you have that "let me speak to your manager" haircut. 
---
I don't see a problem with that, and personally, I love it. It lets me farm my favourite locations to my heart's content, and whenever I want to see other players again, I can just change servers.
---
Irony
---
--------
---
Head 
---
Because it's so unreasonable to expect a quality game play experience? Let me follow you around and ruin your fun all day and see how you like it 
---
I’ve done it and it disappeared off my quests but I don’t think I got any rewards. What did you get?
---
Favorite melee weapon has got to be my 1* bloody puncturing pole hook. Been carrying that thing around for 150 levels. I was swinging it at queen fights when everyone else was still using All Rise. 
---
As for guns I'm torn. Lever action rifles or the gatling laser? If I have to pick just one... gotta go with the big dog. When you absolutely have to incinerate everything within a quarter mile, the gatling laser is how you're gonna do it.
---
Epic..
---
I just got a quad pipe rifle yesterday 
---
3 hours now......
---
A little later today, I will be. 
---
Completely unrelated but this picture makes me want Bethesda to commit to a nuclear winter, the map would look amazing covered in snow 
---
servers are just like the division. If your on a high numbered server you'll end up alone as players start to dwindle
---
Assuming you're a proper Sneak/Critical/VATS build with 1 Strength and 1 Endurance.
---
any shadowed deep pocketed 3\* legendary with ap refresh and 20% weight reduction. chameleon, cloaking, life-saving, vanguard.
---
ideally shadowed or BOS (until that modification adds weight) ultra-light  3\* weightless combat armor with ap refresh and 20% weight reduction.
---
you want crazy AP refresh speed for VATS &amp; running, deep pocketed makes most armor weight negligible when worn.
---
DR/ER is pointless on rifle build because you should almost always be in caution and hardly ever be in danger or be hit. 
---
No you're attitude is unreasonable. I don't know why you expect them to patch things outside of their schedule. Content is ten days away let them focus on that.
---
They do infact since they never denies it but got defensive. Calm down Karen ma'am
---
Youtube
---
Let me get this straight... Game breaking exploit that ruins the fun for EVERYONE. My attitude is unreasonable? lmfao. EVERYONE here hates turret farmers. It's come up repeatedly month over month how these mouth breathers just login to ruin the experience for other players. That should be priority #1 for bethesda
---
That's par for the course. 
---
Yeah, I am guilty of it too. I haven’t plugged in my headset in a while and I actually checked the settings the other day to make sure I had area chat on because I hadn’t heard anyone else in a while. I need to get back into the habit of just saying hi when I see someone.
---
Same!  Nowadays I just have one heavy machinegun turret near where my generator is to make sure theres at least SOME protection while I'm off gallivanting about 
---
Only in 76 would people be excited about a 20 person turnout 
---
&gt;He gets all legendaries
---
No he doesn't, not if he is not standing right there and tagging everything on his own. It's a complete waste of potentially good spawns.
---
You can try to minimize that by doing an inspection of the blast zone before you launch. Granted, a douchebag camper could still spawn in in the meantime...
---
That said, I ran into a turret camper at the golf club the other night, and I was able to contain the ghouls. I just ran downstairs first thing and kept closing the doors.
---
okay Karen. 
---
Memes are the internet. Reddit is the frontpage of the internet. 
---
Says you. But Bethesda is working on what they feel is important not what you think is important noone said, hmm i know long tittied karen really wants turrets removed from the game. 
---
How long does the effect last for?
---
I personally don’t like this game but I stay subbed here for stuff like this. I like seeing people like this game and it’s refreshing after all the negativity.
---
Have you tried nuking somewhere else?
---
Possibly leftovers, but i just saw an aae handmade for 4k &amp; have seen be handmade for 6.5k, if prices keep dropping, then they are definitely still being duped
---
Good find, I think I've never been to that location in my 475 hours with the game, nor did I know that aircons were lootable. :-) 
---
There are two ponds directly north of Everett (Emerett?) Disposal, connected by a stream. The West most pond has two chairs set up with two fishing rods and a bunch of beer bottles. I have not logged in to try it, but maybe there?
---
I feel the same way as him but I do know that there is a lot to do in the game. The main reason I got bored is because in 4, quest givers would find you and in this game it’s the other way around. So I can see where he’s coming from, this style just isn’t for people like us
---
Thanks!  I actually didn't know either until trying to get inside the Armory the way I did in the video.
---
My jumpsuit, so I can show off my cleavage!
---
I went to Whitesprings on about my first week playing the game, and seeing as I was playing on release day, I completed the quest on my first attempt. All my golfers were outside around the course. It seems they need to adjust for players of lower levels. Since then I've seen 1 golfer, and I've been to Whitesprings every day. I'm level 149 and a casual player.
---
Bro do you need me to Smith you some ammo? 
---
Wrong. Anti-Armor/Explosive or maybe bloodied
---
Yep sure are there my fave so far. I hope they add lots more in game outfits it jus the best thing finding somthing u never seen b4.
---
Upvoting because you were able to more then me lolz
---
Sounds like a an overheating issue or possibly a memory issue. Download a utility to monitor GPU temp. If that ends up being the culprit; try putting the game in Full Screen Windowed mode and see if that helps.
---
Also are you using any mods?
---
My suppressor's deep dish automatic gamma gun. I have never needed to use it, but I keep it and some pulse mines on hand..just in case.
---
Me too, I enjoy the variety and trying to find them, it can just be a grind sometimes especially if it’s a random encounter
---
&gt; he is ~~not~~ standing right there and tagging everything on his own. It's a complete waste of potentially good spawns **for everyone else**
---
No one can fast travel in a nuke zone. He legit camps at the backdoor. No one can get to the back. You spawn out front. So before anyone can do ANYTHING, he always tags and has all of them running out  the back. Very easy for him to do this too. 
---
I got a quad crossbow and a quad revolver yesterday running the nuke zone at Whitesprings. 
---
I don't know about the best, but I primarily run Automatic Rifles with 9 points commando, 3 points Bloody Mess, 2 points each Tank Killer and Tenderizer and 1 point Adrenaline with most of the rest of my perks in weight reduction / increased carry weight for grinding and So far the best things I've found are:
---
TS Handmade with drum mag (on the handmade the drum mag gives 85 round capacity)
---
Quad Capacity Combat Rifle with Piercing Mag (80 round capacity, less damage than the handmade, but makes up for part of it by ignoring armor with piercing / stinging mags)
---
TSE Handmade with Drum Mag (It does the most damage, but breaks crazy fast and not that suitable for grinding)
---
I also run with 4 or 5 points in Gunsmith and repair all of them to 200%, and what I've found in use is that the Combat Rifle seems to hold up about 50% longer than the TS Handmade and the TSE lasts about 25% of the Combat Rifle.
---
One other gun that I found works great for crowd control is a Quad Capacity Tesla if you can find one, modified to Full Auto which holds 60 Rounds, but at the moment I can't recommend it as after the last patch it started causing my game to glitch to where I couldn't kill anything with a ranged weapon until fully logging out and back into the game.. I hope Bethesda fixes this as it was great for Crowd control in Nuke Zones.
---
I'm sure there are better items out there, but for the way I play even though I've tried others I keep coming back to the Handmade and Combat Rifle for general use.
---
Hey I was a partially right, and bloodied I’m assuming  is going to get nerfed, so idk what will happen with people who use only those weapons 
---
I didn't have much time to play yesterday, but I would be online now for the rest of the day (CET - 02:30 PM right now).
---
I've just sent you a friend request :)
---
My quad explosive hunting rifle. So satisfying getting headshot on scorched with it
---
I love these! 
---
The writing is amazing. Better then. YouTube!
---
Probably a cap and a half per kg then, I’d assume
---
Yh ive been hunting a bos hood for about a month now still no luck.
---
Good luck mate, are ya on Twitch?
---
Try the antique shop down by fort defiance I have managed to find it there quite a bit, if you still can’t find it let me know and we can work a trade
---
This is OUTRAGEOUS! it's UNFAIR!
---
I think I’m having the same issue. Seems to be the weapon your holding when you close out of the game is missing from your favorite list.
---
Over the top reaction with obviously zero insight on actual problem just for that tiny opportunity to jab at Beth. 
---
TSE's were the Bomb before they Nerfed them when both TS and E each gave +100% damage, then if you added the appropriate weapons perks and put 5 points in Demolition Expert you added another +100% onto explosive damage. 
---
Now post Nerf If I remember right TS gives +25%, E gives +20% and the DE Perk Tops out at 60% (which really didn't matter since when they Nerfed the E to 20% even if DE still went up to 100% it would still only give you an additional 20% damage).
---
So my thoughts are TS is still good, but with the Super fast breakage rate on TSE it's limited to being a secondary weapon, and anything that ignores armor for more effective damage is the best way to go.
---
Good story. Love it. We should all work together and ask people for items or help. Why shot other vault survivors. We are to rebuild America. Please don’t lock your doors have open arms for your vault family fight the scorched and mutants. 
---
See you in the wasteland my friends  
---
Nothing mysterious here. It was in the scouts, misbehaved, and got suspended...
---
Tnx i do check there quite a bit but nothing yet. And yh if you want to trade i might have something you like. what platform u on?
---
I'm lvl 21 and idk maybe 30 hours
---
Are you enjoying the game enough to put in more, or is this game something you're playing to pass time until something else catches your eye? 
---
Kl add me my psn is liquidlycan08 ill be on in an hour just message me if u want to trade.
---
It will be nice of you ever roll an alt
---
Wow!
---
Well after 1300 hours I would like to know what kind of activities you do so far?
---
He put that many hours in because he played it like a job... Wonder how he was supporting himself lol. If you believe that he *was* correctly banned for duping, then it's easy to see how.
---
I have over 500 hours now, play it every day when I'm off work and free. I play a seriously unhealthy amount. He doubled my time at the start of his ban, so he had to have been playing more than a 9-5'er.
---
Even his "farming locations" post was mostly bupkis and was mostly reworded common knowledge. I can't remember if there was any hint towards the ban wave the next day but it's a funny coincidence.
---
Apologies, I should have mentioned this in my post. Edited for explaining.
---
5. Perk cards presets
---
6. rename PA
---
7. possibility  to lock items in inventory
---
## 
---
how many days do u think we could go without one of these posts happening?
---
Thank you.  I buddy managed to find the jet pack.  Just looking for the calibrated shocks now. 
---
How do u check your hours played 
---
It is much easier alone tbh  but I'd gladly help out and do it with you. I'll inbox u my psn 
---
Yes. 
---
About 900h lol , been off since oktober waiting for knee surgery
---
I'll be on in an hour or so
---
It's in challenges, first challenge in character...Explore Appalachia for 7600 hours.
---
I'M SOLD
---
Actually it's a game I enjoyed playing it but I was waiting my friends to buy it and I didn't wanted to put too much time in it without them. With the roadmap 2019 I think I am going to play more 
---
funny, i do everything i can to get those private servers just or me and my homies.  theres never been, and likely never will be, a scenario in which i will live a private server to go to a laggy heavily populated one.  I even like PVP, but not as much as i like having whitesprings or SBQ to myself
---
It is to prevent you from start pvp by accident by shooting another player. It is not to stop other people from killing you and if you own a workshop then you are setting yourself up for pvp. Dont get mad because you dont understand how a game mechanic works.
---
Interesting I'll look at that. 
---
When re adding my favourites there is a whack-a-mole as other slots become empty until I've worked through all of them re setting to my liking. Not a huge deal but just a chore to have to do every time I play the game.
---
Don’t encourage it.
---
Result:
---
Very good directions, no problems.  Learned the plan, modded my current Tricentennial to Nuka, hated the dirty look, modded it back to my purty shiny Tricentennial.    
---
-11 STR
---
+6 INT
---
-4 AGI
---
-3END
---
All of which can change by +/- 2 based on herd mentality
---
Well the navy and orange one you can find at the top of the world in the little skiing houses. 
---
What would you say is the easiest/intermediate to level up?
---
I would say lore wise light and sturdy combat was for light Infantry and scouts and such.
---
Where do they even spawn?
---
PSN piwrecks, add me and we will launch one real quick
---
How the hell do you get that high. I'm still on level 15 and can't findl good weapons or anything to save my life. I keep dying and no stimpacks
---
I literally have never used bulking. And it takes minimal effort to think "I dont need 50,000 steel. literally ever. I'm gonna get rid of it"
---
i disagree entirely that it is easier alone than with a group to designate members with lockpick/hacking/radsponge as opposed to needing hazmat or power armor instead of radsponge, and needing to have lockpick/hacking instead of combat perks on a solo player.
---
It does ALMOST seem like the loot generator drops more meta items lately. Haven't seen many bloody guns myself but had 2 drop in the last few days.
---
Maybe it's just good luck.
---
You’re not the only one! I’m anti social too! And on ps4 :) I’m really bad at talking on my mic and even worry if I have it on sometimes. 
---
Too many enemies the more players 
---
done at least 40 silo runs and that is not my experience at all, ive been in a team and only had 3 robots spawn during launch prep, the final stage
---
I have two accounts at about lvl 150 and 550 hours played
---
Entirely situational but I quite like the Blade of Bastet, I often use it as a back up when fending off hordes of scorched, that said I love my hardened sniper. 
---
There might a terminal or two. But a lot of the lore seems to end around that time. And the ones that don’t are just telling what happened after the responders died, which seems to be the closest thing to when the vault opened. 
---
Yeah, backwards while still shooting forward at me at a breakneck pace.  Agile bastards.
---
You can bet people are duping whatever is in demand. So if you're buying it, they're duping it. 
---
I put swat separate. In some places they aren’t just police. And dyslexia wins again. Knew i forgot a letter. 
---
What u mean with craft and scrap? I dont have plans and if i have the plans i dont need to scrap it anymore?!
---
I’ll look into it. 
---
How did you join cult of the mothman?
---
You get caps for killing people only when they engage back. Wanted players would have a special symbol on the map and you'll be able to tell they are wanted right off the bat.
---
My weapon of choice in FO4 
---
Yeah... I meant to add it would be in Appalachia... 
---
Scorched should also be in PA.  Might make them actually challenging instead of just being a nuisance
---
45 was probably too early but I’m sure you can do it alone now. If you are going after the queen most high level players will hop in and join you no invite needed.
---
I still yearn for energy weapons being a thing :c
---
Here’s what you do. Deposit your scraps. Take a cheap and reasonable weapon. Destroy the turrets. If the player is nearby they’ll come running to repair and kill. You die you drop nothing. And got rid the turrets. Repeat until they leave or give up. 
---
Can confirm. Have one weapon that jumps from 2 to 3 every time, kicking the one out of 3 and leaving 2 blank. 
---
If I'm honest, I don't enjoy the game very much, but that's because the idea to me is fundamentally flawed. It's much like Destiny if you've played that, but without player hubs. Granted, the camps are pretty cool, but I think the servers are a bit too slow, the graphics are poor in comparison to frame loss, and you don't have such a nice stream of quests to do like in the other fallout games. Of course, this is my opinion and you can totally enjoy the game, I just personally don't enjoy it.
---
No, that's called smart! Sometimes, even deathclaws run away from me. lol
---
Nexus modding forums, I don't have any official announcement aboit it because it is still so far off, but if you hang out on nodding irc and discord channels you'll hear about it.
---
Thanks buddy lol I’m a noob 
---
Glassed cavern... When that scorch beast came crawling out of the ground... I peed my pants and ran for my life, hitting the quest marker on my way through. Didn't go back for 100 levels.
---
Having someone to hack the level 3 turrets off were a blessing. I would challenge Bethesda to make future areas even harder and include more things like that. I want to be encouraged to team up more.
---
I'm lvl 122 &amp; have over 650 hrs played. 
---
The wife is lvl 145 &amp; over 740hrs played. 
---
Maybe it's you.
---
I got 5 the first time i visited whitesprings, back in November. Never saw another since and i've scoured the place many times. 
---
I'd they made it *only* usable with raider armour would tie in, the military had access to proper weapons and didnt need to piss around with something so basic.
---
You have to go there as part of one of the main quests.
---
One time, I was navigating a cliff, accidentally fell, died, then the server crashed.
---
It’s obvious you’re upset because you’re not getting your way.  I saw a four-year old throw a similar tantrum at the supermarket yesterday.
---
I was teamed up with a level 10 who I made the party leader. We fast traveled to the golf club at Whitesprings, expecting to grind levels against high level hordes. 
---
There wasn't anyone else there, so all the monsters scaled to the L10 party leader. To my surprise, 10 ghoulish golfers rushed me when I spawned in. Without regard for my teammates quest, I mowed them down to finish the quest for myself without my teammate getting a single shot in. 
---
2 months later,he still hasn't finished the quest. I feel awful.
---
3* Pump Action Shotgun. Anti-Armor, +25% Fire Rate, +15% Reload Speed. With all shotgun perks maxed out and a durable stock that sends its durability into ridiculous levels. I repair it maybe once every 16 hours. It's my workhorse. Thanks Scorchbeast Queen, only good thing she's ever given me.
---
I’m so glad I killed 10 when I first started playing then
---
No cross play yet so you would have to start over. Keep in mind PS+ gives you free game every month. It takes a while to find your forever home but if your happy where you are then awesome. I a ranged guy myself but keep a melee weapon for when thing go to shit. From the posts I have read either PS4 has less players or crashes, it's hard to tell. I see a lot of post about playability issues for PC, less for Xbox, and even less for PS4, can't say it it's because of the volume of players or not.
---
That'll be my Instigating "The Dragon". Double damage to full health enemies although reload time is a beast. 
---
I agree. I don't think I saw one until I went to West Tek.
---
.308 hardened receiver, stabilized long barrel, full stabilized stock, medium scope, silenced, piercing magazine. " I thing that's all my modifications. Not currently logged in"
---
Quad crossbow with 33% VATS and 90% weight reduction.
---
If only Bethesda would fix the glitch where enemies instantly gain their health back after I shoot them in the head 3x. And some mods for the crossbow would be cool also.
---
I always do it alone, it's not hard at all.
---
basically yes
---
yeah, you're totally right. I play this game all the time and I love it, so I'm just looking to take a jab at Bethesda. Poor indie company. Small company with hardly any resources. I'm just always looking to criticize them and take a job at poor Bethesda. You're totally right.  
---
in all seriousness, there only problem is the fact that players are such douchebags to each other. and they won't do anything about it. They encouraged it. This is the kind of game they wanted but no one else wanted
---
People that don’t share kills are not griefers.
---
Had the same today with three legendary stingwings in Whitesprings. Never seen them there before so I was happy to take the legendary but they made me work for it. 
---
I did this. But he's using set cheap shity turrets that he just repairs them again and again every time. Makes it too easy. What he needs is to get banned from the game for doing this. Orbit as the two actually changed the game so he can't do this anymore and be a little twat to everyone else
---
&gt; Elon Musk is pretty self aware
---
Yeah, accusing people trying to save children from drowning in a cave of being pedophiles is really fucking "self aware".
---
The only place I know to get the clean spacesuit is the random vendor in Charleston 
---
Oh, I thought they were like some special ghoul even though I kill a lot of them.
---
He explains in the video why. Because none of the higher level folds give more food, better buffs, or lasts longer. So why not go with the quickest simplest way to farm food and water? When the low level food is just as good and easier to find than the higher level stuff there is no point in going ojt of your way to farm higher level foods.
---
Hey that’s his resources he’s burning each time sooner than later they’ll give up. I’d make them a carpet of landmines for their front door. Boom!
---
Downvoted him for saying "cucks".
---
If the player is camping there and tagging, the turrets make some sense (at least to him!), but they are mostly lame because of other reasons than you listed: turret kills don't give EXP or loot for non-tagged enemies, so if the douchebag is somewhere else on the map, no-one gets anything from those kills. And camping is even more effective after the blast zone has gone: the camper can just crouch downstairs all day long and by doing that lure other players to fast travel to a (seemingly) empty golf club, thereby spawning another ghoul horde that he can then tag before you're even fully loaded in.
---
In that case, you can try to give that guy a beating, or you just move on to the mansions and the service building to get the legendaries that this camper cannot reach. I know I will do that and just find me a better server afterwards. Can't be arsed to whine about some poor asshole all day long.
---
Do you recommend fallout 76?
---
He has done that to me too several times. I try to run up to him and open trade immediately without going near his brahmin or guards. Same with leaving, I try to back away from him quickly. It tends to work OK.
---
I have plague walker mutation and thought maybe I was accidentally upsetting the brahmin, but that's a wild guess, I haven't tested it. It doesn't seem to bother Grahm and Chally. Also odd they don't go hostile while I'm standing there with the trade window open if that's the problem.
---
The problem with a lot of stuff in this game is that it looks like its getting ready to tell a story than op! Everyones dead. You came too late.
---
My only thing about the turrets - and maybe I'm remembering this incorrectly - was that my Tesla Rifle didn't lock onto them.
---
It will with some turrets and not others.  It's rather annoying.
---
I haven’t seen them as primary weapons.  I’ve see n used in fissure site battles. One guy on a team with the friendly fire perk healing as well as providing ground cc on add mobs. 
---
Yes, people are free to use whichever weapon they desire.  You don’t know if the other player is in-game for 5 hours or 15 minutes.  The dick part is your sense of entitlement.  If you want more loot, that’s on you.
---
I finally got around to doing it at Lv. 124 and managed to launch it on my own.  You need to be mindful that you're going up against robots, and Colonel Gutsy in particular, so things that can give you a bit of an edge against them (like Troubleshooters equipment, Power Armor, flat damage reductions instead of DR/ER buffs) are useful.
---
That’s one great way to adapt to the situation.  Excellent work!
---
Those have nothing to do with the data mined atx boxes 
---
Furious + Executioner's Handmade rifle.
---
Each are useful in different situations.
---
&gt; This is meant as kind of a "snack sized" game 
---
Yeah.  Snack sized.
---
Explore the wasteland for 7600 hours: 210/7600.
---
yes many have. But in this case, it's the workshop.
---
In other cases, people become accidentally wanted, they accidentally hit someone with a bullet or punch, or they are teamed up and someone on the team flags. Or they just take slap damage until dead.
---
I completed this quest in the beta. Basically powered straight over to Whitesprings right outta the vault. Golfer Ghouls Galore. Completed it whilst collecting the holotapes. 
---
Watched my other half try and do the same quest at level 50 before I understood the levity of my accomplishment. 
---
NukaDark is pretty limited in supply though. I've been buying all the Colas every time i join a server and i only got like 10 or so. 
---
I want a nylon bag so I can scrap it for plastic.  I already have enough raw cloth, the canvas one is useless to me.
---
lol
---
Every nuke zone. I mean the nuke zones were supposed to be high level end game content, but most of them don't spawn enough enemies. Make nuke zones bring all sorts of baddies out of the woodwork and make them actually good farming areas in general. 
---
1 - No cross platform. You'll need to start a new character and new account. But there are plenty of players on PC. (I am on PC myself)
---
2 - That is a good spot for lower levels. As you progress you'll want to move your camp. I have been playing since the beta and I have moved my camp about 40 times at this point.
---
3 - If you like those weapons, then you should pick up as many of them as you can and scrap them so you can learn mods for them. For the baseball bat I like the heating coil the best. But don't get locked into one weapon or play style this early (though melee is a good choice at any level) because you will find weapons as you explore that may be different from what you are used to but would be a lot of fun to use. I played Fallout 4 mostly with a rifle as my main weapon, but in 76 I am melee/heavy guns because I found some fun weapons (Instigating Grognak's Axe, anti-armor 50 cal, 2 shot missile launcher, etc.)  Be open to experimenting with things that you find. It is a game after all, maximize your fun, not your stats. 
---
Nice. I havent seen this yet...
---
lol, I think you misunderstood what you were looking at. 
---
Everyone rewards caps if you kill them (despite what the other poster said).  Not just wanted. Wanted is an additional amount, or it overlaps until it gets larger or something, not 100% on this. But it is a different amount either way.
---
Are these buildeeds still viable I also am looking for a good melee build 
---
Experiencing a similar problem, but only with one weapon. My All-Rise ALWAYS disappears from its assigned slot after log. Problem started two, maybe three patches ago and still persists.
---
Ive had ghouls, desthclaws and yogi bears duck for cover, which is actually kind of cool.
---
My game time is often limited.  Sometimes, I need to be efficient as possible.  
---
I do understand what you guys are saying, in that it can be annoying to be in an area when someone else comes along and cuts through all of the enemies.  I’ve experienced that myself, numerous times.  When this occurred in a low level area, it was especially frustrating.  I still accepted it as part of the game, and carried on.
---
Legendaries?  Put your big boy pants on and get to business.  If you’re being outplayed, learn from the encounter and adapt.
---
Ruined YOUR game maybe. Not everyone. Doesn’t affect me in The slightest. Quit whining and go do something else. Maybe if you weren’t such a whiner, they wouldn’t enjoy it? Maybe it people decided to nuke other places, farm other places...maybe because you try to get it easy in one spot over and over...maybe that’ll fix you and your entitlement problem?
---
You created the problem. Someone built a better mousetrap. Now you’re mad lol
---
At Harpers Ferry, I had the legendary duck and cover, while 5 of his non-legendary brethren came at me guns ablazing.
---
What's your build?
---
I know right?
---
My guy! I’m 700 hours lvl 125 haha we are the true casuals ;) 
---
&gt; - Material: 80% Polyester/20% PU
---
Oh no!  You were scammed again! /s
---
I have one character and it's lvl 128 with 680 hours played
---
Oh oh me too! Haha I’ll trade you a random encounter plan 
---
I got a 2-shot on my main before the encumbrance cap made him unplayable.  Maybe someday I'll log back on to him, but the retroactive "screw you" from Bethesda had me rage-quit the game for a while.  Walking backwards in a circle with the Gatling chugging away and Excavator PA at a glowing Whitespring was fun.
---
I just server hopped and finished it no problem. There is a group of golfers that stand behind the long rows of houses you can go into, but people prefer to blow this mission way out of proportion.
---
You know, there's more to this game than Whitesprings.
---
I realize that's difficult for some players to believe.
---
So many anti-social players out there. I can hardly get anyone to play on a team with me despite DMs stating I would not bother them.  See, when I'm in a team my SPECIAL stats are off the roof. When they also have mutations, it's even better. I just can't ever get anyone to accept or respond to my messages. 
---
PS4, Nakanokalronin
---
I've come across another new issue since your last update. I couldn't tell what was happening until today and boy is it a whopper. When in sneak mode completely hidden, if I am in eye sight of an enemy at any distance and hit left to switch my weapon I am instantly seen going from hidden to danger. It happens with all enemies and all weapons and at every distance. I'm not moving, I have maxed out every stealth perk and wear chameleon armor.  This only happened after the last update. Please fix this as this is a major game breaking issue for anyone with a stealth build. 
---
Get a 2 shot explosive laser weapon. With a beam splitter, this is probably one of the top 5 guns. Granted, it only lasts about 20 shots. I always keep it on me in case someone tries to PVP.
---
&gt; I suppose it might be like scouts get light or sturdy
---
Wouldn't scouts get scout armor?
---
Nice
---
Maybe the suicider ai is becoming self, aware... 
---
Why wasn't this a thing at launch. A lot of people like playing dedicated healer but you're very limited on how you can do that
---
You can't use friendly fire with certain weapons
---
It's impossible to use it with flamers because they still don't know about the flamer ammo issue where it barely makes any ammo (you craft 5 at a time which is literally gone in milliseconds and takes *(10 acid, 2 steel, and 5 oil)*. I'd rather get the 100 fuel from building a new one.
---
A medic syrnigner would have been perfect. 
---
Look on the right side of this page.  There is a box with the Fallout 76 gear logo and numbers of subscribers.  Under that is a small check box that says "Show My Flair on this Subreddit".  Check that and under it is a small edit button.  You can click that and choose a flair.
---
Looks like you blew his mind!
---
(What weapons that? I just picked up the game about a week ago) 
---
I'd personally wait to see what the new content is like. I play everyday, though. It's fun. Good trading economy etc. Needs more ways to interact with people like text chat and an in game market. 
---
Na, the drum mag is the best. Both of the anti-armor mags aren't really worth it. And put the forceful stock on it, it vastly increases the durability. 
---
TIL you can do that.
---
Damn, man...
---
How can i find a purpose to playing this game again after platting
---
One of those mags give only 10 bullets, the other is best with armour penetration and 30 bullets per mag.
---
Not sure which ones which tho, I'm sure you can look it up somewhere
---
If you want constant fire, plasma flamer is better in terms of ammo production. 
---
As /u\/p1xelprophe7exe said, friendly fire + Flamer = AoE healing in Fissure Site Prime.
---
what perks or drugs are recommended
---
Yup. Much better now. I only was disconnected three times last night and only two screen freezes. One of those times was with the SBQ mid fight and had her down close to 50%. Wasted over 400 40mm grenades and other bullets for absolutely nothing. 
---
&gt; Teamed up with the same two people, and probably half the other 6 or so  people who showed up both times were the same. Mix of Level 80s through  2xx, with the average probably being close to right in the middle, maybe  a bit closer to the low side. 
---
nowhere there do you say it was the same amount of people both times
---
I read that those other mags ignore 40% target armor.
---
We did prime last night and mid way through the fight I got disconnected. Wasted over 400 rounds of 40mm for absolutely nothing. 
---
I love the idea, I two thought that the actual story of 76 was going to be made by the players, but sadly it will probably take two years before all this stuff is added in
---
It's much less common than in Fallout 4 but yes they exist. There is always one spawning during the penitentiary event. 
---
I'm on a PC and know I've gotten some a couple days ago from the Nuka Cola machine in the WS swimming pool area
---
Reading on after I saw that. I was killed at level 20 so I figured I’d come back later. But thinking back, when I was killed, there were a bunch of level 100+ hanging out near the clubhouse.
---
It’s a Radium Rifle
---
I has a TSE quad pump action a while ago. 
---
It holds 32 shots and before the nerf was godly.
---
Yeah 100% spawn rate at Wes Tek.  Also one of the better legendary farm locations imho
---
On PC, seems ok. Obviously empty if someone else in the area before you.
---
I'll do it with you. GT BLUBLXRedeux
---
&gt;blood pressure rises
---
Shoot, guys are selling at 100 now. I picked up extras yesterday just because they were so cheap. 
---
damn, PC here, you might wanna put the platform first.  I too am a friendly solo, I have had a couple cool experiences with randoms as well as a few negative ones, but I basically beat the game on one character and am willing to help others, and on the flipside I have a level 11ish that I am trying to level up, first character is the meta, a PA wearing melee tank running around in X-01 with a jetpack and calibrated shocks and a level 50 All Rise, the one I am trying to level now is going to be a stealth sniper, which is harder to do in this game but I'm up for the challenge.
---
First rule of fight club man...
---
Not sure if you are having same problem. For me its because i have same type of weapon in sequential slots.  I had machete in slot 1, shotguns in 2-3-4 and other weapons and chems after.  Slots 2-3-4 are always messed up but the others are good.
---
It's a radium rifle it makes radiation damage
---
That's why I can never play with anyone. It's not like I wanna talk to you or hang out. I just need to be on a team to stack my special perks. You can do you and I can do me and we don't even have to converse. Youre missing out if you don't team up while playing. 
---
I lost all my power armor once.  I thought I did anyway. It glitched into another frame somehow and anyway the next day (I still had no idea where my power armor went but the frame was empty) I scrapped the frame and got two of my power armor...so it like duplicate somehow or some shit.  It was just t-60 but it all had tricentennial skin 
---
&gt;Beth wants to take away the ONE THING we still have we love in this game and that's nukes.
---
*facepalm* so many things wrong with this.
---
1, when did everyone meet up and agree that the ONLY thing we still love is nukes, and this one small thing RUINS it FOR EVERYONE? I didn't. Many others wouldn't even know what this issue is all about.
---
2, you can nuke literally anywhere else on the map and won't find turret camper dick.
---
3, I want other more important things fixed alongside some new content before they focus on appeasing the people that grind out the same event over and over. Clearly you guys are happy with monotony. I say more people benefit from new content and bug fixes.
---
I've soloed the silo a dozen times and never worn pa or a hazmat suit.
---
Maybe he’s born with it
---
Don't think they are anti social for not wanting to team up. People just like to play the game in their own space. And some are genuinely afraid of traitors (raiders/griefers) destroying their camp.
---
I need one of those aswell 
---
I wonder if the concurrent players is even in the thousands at off peak times now. 
---
Well, if you like wasting a gazzilion bullets fighting the SBQ only to get disconnected before she is killed then this is your game. If you like running through white springs and watching your loot disappear before you can grab it, then this is your game. Game freezes are occuring more than the "disconnected from server" errors in the past. 
---
Level 185 
---
450 hours
---
Which is the same amount of hours I logged in Fallout 4 over 2 years of play. 
---
If we come across them I'll hit you up.  you need the pack or 2 shocks?
---
Do you need the pack or 2 shocks?
---
Im with you bro i got a quad explosive harpoon it beste everything 
---
Take your upvote. hahahaha
---
I've got them all but one 
---
Another shovel is straight west of the grave near a pit of nuclear waste barrels. The mobs that spawn there are random but there usually seems to be 3-4 there unless someone recently cleared them.
---
The shovel is right next to a red tool box.
---
Hey buddy!!! I was wondering if I could swap a jet pack on the torso, instead of stealth boy.
---
How are you doing? I haven't seen you lately. 
---
Why are you holding it
---
Talk to people first, I never accept random team invites from people who can't even be bothered to show up, or speak to me.
---
I've killed 1 so far, that was in November.
---
Killed 10 like my first time in Whitesprings. Didnt know others had a hard time with it:o
---
Thank you very much for the advice. I normally sell trouble shooter legendary items. Looks like I will be saving them from now on :) Is there points in the mission where the waves aren't constantly hitting you, where you can take a breath?
---
Only if there is an option to blame one of your teammates for bonus points. 
---
Thank you. I will add you as soon as I can.
---
When in build mode at the workshop build a resource collector on the "resource hole"
---
I always message thenm to ask first. "hey I need a team to maax my perks and mutations. I won't bother your gameplay at all" 
---
Still crickets. So I just play with negative stats all day long. 
---
My wife and I kind of do a lifestyles of the rich and famous kind of thing with peoples camps. We love seeing them and building new ones ourselves. Just thought it would be a fun and tiny idea. I was thinking maybe you could put up a terminal called guestbook or just have that option within like some people are able to control the lights. Seems simple enough. 
---
Well, with the griefers trying to loop you into a team to lure you sometimes or destroy your base ... yeah, hesitant. Be nice to have a LFG mechanism too. Instead of blind ask have a post and folks can join / subscribe.
---
You’ll need to find a node for whichever resource is at the workshop, build a collector on top of it, and power it. Over time (not 100% sure but check back every 30-60 minutes) the collector will fill up and you can transfer them to your inventory. If you’re concerned about theft, put a lock on. 
---
Before claiming a workshop, KNOW that this will open you up for pvp, no matter where you are on the map, regardless if you fight back or not
---
I killed 7 my first run. That was 30 levels ago. I havent seen a single one since.
---
"I love the idea, I two thought that the actual story of 76 was going to be made by the players, but sadly it will probably take two years before all this stuff is added in by modders."
---
Fixed it for you
---
At some point they made horde events useless. Previously when you went the horde would always spawn a legendary the same level as your character. Now the horde even spawns a legendary the level of the area it is in. 
---
XB1 and just pulled a quantum and cherry out of one last night.  
---
Last night they were going for 100 caps each
---
GT  meeshka x
---
Oh yes, forgot people don’t play these games for the actual game, they just play the games the modders can make with them 
---
Yeah. And it's only $80 and is a good source of plastic.
---
Ha, you never know if they might throw a new perk in the game at some point! I’m hoping for “mechannibal”, where you get food benefits from eating robot corpses...
---
Check the market or bazaar subreddits. Lots of stuff available for the right price
---
White springs with some help. 
---
Yeah I dropped a nuke on whitesprings in a empty server thinking I would get all the spawns. Then nothing ever respawned. Sad day
---
I would be happy to team up. I'm not big on talking anyway :) I am friendly. I just struggle in group situations. I'm ok for a while then it gets too much.
---
On PC, many were always empty for me but some are restocking: 
---
* Flatwoods Red Rocket station
---
* Vault-tec Farm
---
* Watoga Transit Hub
---
I hate big guns and I wanted to be a pistolero but you cant deny the beauty of the destruction it provides upon those its aimed against
---
On PS4 I pulled 3 out of the machine in the Watoga Transit Hub, including a quantum. Sounds like bad luck OP
---
We're back from the dark days of the "I quit" posts and now we're back to these great stories!​ 
---
Amazing work writing it
---
It's the only way to get legendary items in this game. the scorchbeast queen is currently broken and doesn't drop any loot other than furious rolling pins or other garbage drunk most of the time. So we have to resort to farming ghouls. In order to do that, we can't have some douche nozzle out here camping the back or sitting in the bottom floor waiting for people to load into they can kill everything instantly. It ruins the gameplay experience. 
---
I don't know who said anything about being happy with monotony. I'm literally pointing out something that's broken and needs to be fixed. Regardless of whether you like to do that or not, that doesn't matter. What does matter is that someone is exploiting
---
I nuked Fissure Prime today. Only 5 players showed up for SBQ. Then I ran and logged out. 
---
I'm having the opposite issue.  Picking up new dropped weapons sometimes sets them as "favorites" without any interaction from me, taking up slots in my wheel.  I only notice when I try to favorite something I actually care about, and all the free slots are taken up by common low level weapons.
---
You can do it solo I done my first nuke at lvl 112 its not that hard if you prepare ahead on stems and make sure weapons repaired to full. I run a melee build a long with a handmade to take out the turrets. 
---
Pretty sure R&amp;G Station has them
---
I'm seeing them all the time in Grafton, Welch and Lewisburg. It's called, for whatever reason, Lever Gun.
---
I've encountered this several times, maybe more. I don't always pay attention to player numbers unless it's obvious there are only a handful.
---
I like a full map of players, so I, too, will server hop when there are too few players on a map for my taste.
---
ive seen it in grafton station and camden park
---
I think it's the grafton vendor for around 1300 caps. A very good weapon.  Only issue is this weapon mirrors the handmade gun where you encounter very few in the world while playing the game.  You will have to craft and scrap to get mods most likely.  But still definitely worth the trouble. 
---
Yea, empaths a killer solo, and herd mentality.
---
I think it's the messaging that's doing it, don't you have a mic. Personally I like to hear someone's voice to size them up and give an idea of what sort of player they are.
---
There are times people will team just to ft to your camp and destroy it so people are wary of random team requests
---
Not sure about the mags but you’re correct on the forceful stock. Way better than repairing after every trip through west tek IMO
---
I bought mine at a station and yes even a 1* lever action is a great weapon. I have a 1* instigating and along with stealth perks can deal quite a bit of damage if I'm undetected 
---
Good luck, server errors are a real bitch.
---
I’m up to like 13,000 fusion cells. Some day....
---
I agree! It's a problem, and a potential cap waster. Either a timer, or color-code the event marker on the map. Maybe green for over 2/3's time left in the event, yellow for 1/3 to 2/3, and red for under a third.
---
Just a thought. 
---
I love when this happens. I get to play in peace and farm high level enemies for XP/Legendaries without annoying Lvl 10 characters running around scaling the enemies down, or other high Lvl players racing to kill everything before me.
---
Also get to go around and collect bunch of junk that usually other people pick up.
---
If I wanted to play on servers with more people, I would just server hop.
---
Played a little over a month so i dont have the experience of the bugs- the game now is great, i have so few issues it makes any there are very very bearable because i just love playing so much 
---
Does it have a certain level requirement to buy?
---
I'll sell you a one star bloodied hand made fully modded
---
I would love some different ammo types for the 40mm launchers, stuff like nuke rounds or incendiary rounds.
---
For sure how much
---
How does 1k sound
---
Yeah I’ll pay you 1.2k but I won’t be able to get in until tonight
---
There are weight limits on purifiers, so the big advantage of the industrial purifier VS a normal purifier is lost. Industrial maxes out at 5, normal maxes out at 3
---
There is nothing better than dropping a super mutant when he's giving you a speech of how tough he is.  However, I notice they still have the bucket head line (which I thought related to the gunners in FO4, with combat helmet).  Who are they talking about really?  Is it BOS guys in PA?
---
Also, I've seen 2 legendary scorched with the same AI "style".  They seem to be running, altering their friends.  They are the only legendary scorched I have ever seen.
---
I don’t know how I got lucky with it. I thought a 1.5 hour search was bad
---
What time?
---
If I remover correctly 
---
Stinging mag is 35 rounds and 30% anti armor and it is the best damage vs ammo count
---
Perforated mag is more Armor piercing but only holds like 20 rounds
---
So in a fight a drum would be like 8 shots on non legendary , sting would be 6 to 7 shots, and perforated would be 5 to 6 shots to kill.
---
The anti armor mags are better than drum because every monster has such high dr....
---
7:30 mountain time
---
I don't think that works with Xbox. I guess ny suggestion really only applies to console players. I assume you're playing on PC, right?
---
Instigating Grognak Axe + 40% more power attack damage and +1 strength.  1 hits just about everything in the game besides SB which it usually makes quick work of.  Only thing is it breaks quickly because it can't be repaired to 200% of weapon condition with the perk.  Not sure it this is a glitch or just not allowed.
---
Be awhile before you find a 2 shot. Just get one. With the right perks it will 2 shot most anything. 
---
Death Tambo. Nothing special, I just like that it jingles when I hit things
---
Damn I'm central and got school tomorrow rip but I'll see if I'm on then my psn is YoungSpud-san 
---
your right. I went in the middle. using the sting mag, so I have enough bullets and to little bit more dmg.
---
Nope but there is a lowest weapon level when you craft one. It is 15 I think.  Not 100% sure, I'm not in game to check.
---
To be fair the problem with that is both the expense and healing provided. Per shot/tap of the flamer you get 7hp in total. It's almost more efficient to play a medic with the stimpack sharing perk than a flamer.
---
So a jack and coke? Or dark and stormy?
---
I got mine from Grafton. The name of the plans are “lever gun”
---
but mah PVP, mah TSE in your back while I'm cloaked and hiding, mah OP build for easy kills whaaaa!
---
Solo nuke is quite easy with power armor. When solo, enemies are generally LV22\~LV40. Only 2 or 3 LV46 assaultrons or LV50\~52 colonel gutsies would cause some trouble. But they are weak against melee. Watch this video for walkthrough and do some modification to match your play style. I still nuke with stealth style.
---
[https://youtu.be/H969EhPHK7w](https://youtu.be/H969EhPHK7w)
---
thanks for that forceful stock tip. helps a lot.
---
They spawn in the box next to the cannon. There are always 10. Even after immediately taking the 10 in the box
---
I've got a 185 a 120 and a lvl 60 that are all full build, currently 600 hours deep. 
---
Wow that’s tough lol
---
Running bloodied/nerd rage makes you really watch out for your health
---
I just got it!  Server hopped twice and found low level ghouls.  Got my last five.  
---
My sniper run perf with scope .. my up close sting with dot
---
First crafting level is 25. I use this gun only
---
Lol I was wondering why I could never find them. Just figured I was doing something wrong
---
What’s the deal? Low spawn rate?
---
Oh fuck I gotta get the emergency protocol!! I never knew that existed!
---
Thanks for the clarification.
---
oh good,  thought  i was the only one with this never ending quest curse xD im 8/10 and i check daily D:
---
I think the sound of it surpessed lol
---
No problem. It's an amazing gun at any level and 45 ammo is relatively easy to find and decently cheap to craft
---
Level 95 and recently did all mine
---
I always thought that “bucket head” refered to anyone in Power Armor, but I could be wrong.
---
Also, I have NEVER seen a legendary scorched— I honestly thought they werent in game.
---
I love that it's a 45. I had a ton of this ammo without a weapon I liked to use.  Then I got the lever action.  This basically replaced my sniper rifle due to the reload speed and damage.  A great weapon.
---
Ah
---
Well, I found one, thanks to a Legendary Eye Bot:
---
  [https://imgur.com/a/V8SLeAE](https://imgur.com/a/V8SLeAE) 
---
Level 1! The game has humor I guess!
---
I’d love to represent the Responders
---
If I'm honest, I was skeptical about your claim initially! Just noticed I've got the plan unlocked too. I don't recall having access to it before disarming one. Then again, I didn't get a plan unlocked notification. Still, I find it odd that no caps or a lunchbox is required! 
---
Last night I died to 2 bloatflies and an ant in the asylum because none of my attacks were doing any damage to them. Like not just a little damage but zero. I was out of supplies and beat up from the scorchbeast event so I just let them whomp on me. Relogged and they were replaced by ghouls taking damage normally
---
I had an invincible glowing radroach follow me forever at a SBQ fight, it was ridiculously obnoxious. I haven’t bothered to nuke the queen or even show up when it happens because there’s always something stupid going on around her or with her. 
---
Turret kills give loot, but no xp. 
---
Found the place! On the eastern entrance to a raider camp called Knife Edge. Nicely found!
---
I had this happen to me the other way around.  About a week ago, I was trolling for legendaries, and realized I was taking no damage.  None.
---
I tested by standing still with a mob of SM shooting at me and pounding my skull in...net effect was my HP never went down. It was awesome, because they were trash talking me "puny human...so weak" lol,  but I also realized how boring that game would be.
---
Sorry about your experience, but  you never know in this game.
---
I have a nocturnal explosive lever rifle if interested
---
Yeah i can imagine lol
---
The Blade of Bastet seems particularly prone to this. I've never been able to pinpoint what causes this.
---
Theory: do you have your game ini files set as Read-Only?
---
"Wastelanders" sounds like it will change the game enough with "Choices and consequences that will impact the wasteland" as its description. 
---
As it stands now the main difference between FO76 and the others is dialogue options, or rather no dialogue at all. If that update patched that in the game would be entirely different. 
---
That's why I lol at any notions of NPCs until they redo the conversation format, because they would be like Grahm Rose and MODUS, repeated lines
---
Interesting. Also, it does not matter at all. 
---
Because we are not even talking about this guy, but about your claim that *every* player, *especially* the ones that are not cheaters, would be required to record hundrets of hours of gameplay and even comment it permanently - juuust for the case he or she receives an unwarranted ban. 
---
Because according to your thesis it is the *players* responsibility to provide the evidence that could exonerate him, not the responsibility of the accuser. In complete disregard of principles like the presumption of innocence, I might add.
---
I was not even talking about this one guy, but about your very stupid claim. 
---
Which is also stupid, as I've tried to point out, because the people at Bethesda would most probably laugh their asses off in case you would ask them to watch 900 hours of gameplay straight after an unwarranted ban. 
---
This guy has lied? Who cares, because even *if*, this would not change the fact that your claim is very unreasonable, very anti-consumer and in violation of the most basic legal principles.
---
I think this happens when you had previously favorited an item (for me shotguns). If you drop or sell the item next time you pick up a similar it will auto-fill the slot that this item type used to occupy.
---
I had modded shotguns in slot 1-2-3 then when I learned Weapon Artisan and GunSmith I only needed 1 shotgun as it broke less and repaired to 130%, but if I picked up any combat shotgun again it was added to the radial wheel in the slots previously held, I think the slot was empty but can't actually remember.
---
Neat
---
XB1, last night found a machine with 2 colas and a cherry. 
---
Unless they have a red cap symbol with a number on it as their icon on the map and above their head, they're not Wanted. It also notifies you in the top-left corner when you are first near someone that has a bounty. You get money for kills regardless.
---
The main reason it took so long to kill the guy is because he wasn't Wanted (and therefore isn't automatically taking full damage from other players) and he didn't hit you back. If he had, you'd both be able to inflict full damage on each other. 
---
And the third guy who took his stuff didn't 'steal', since any items dropped on the ground don't belong to anybody anymore. You only get a Wanted bounty for stealing items from locked containers in CAMPs, like water purifiers and ore collectors, destroying CAMP items of someone who isn't Wanted or fighting you or killing someone who isn't Wanted or fighting back. 
---
Plasma Gatling Gun...

---
Bethesda has already replied to a thread like this, they're looking into it
---
Wow, crazy! Did god-mode stop sometime or you had to relog?
---
You can see his poop sack too
---
All good info. Thanks so much 
---
I don’t have proof. But it’s a actual bug. Be careful with the event.
---
Happy that i could show u that :o) u will love it believe me, best torso mod IMO
---
They do.
---
You're seriously answering your own question here. When you relog you joined a populated server that was filling up, the same as everyone else. If your server isn't repopulating that just means new people are getting added to higher priority servers earlier in the queue as other people log off. 
---
Vampire Shishkabob+speed &amp; strength.
---
I see what you did there
---
Sounds like you still living in pre-TSE nerf world.

TSE is outdated like at least a month ago
---
You don't lose your weapon, the known bug currently at this event, when there are many players, the server lags and you can keep shooting with a broken weapon for longer than intented, but it will never dissapear.  
---
Trust me, if it was a real bug, you would see many posts here about it, since many players are doing this event every day.
---
Is it not worth upgrading it to the .50 cal?
---
I haven't unlocked it yet, nor do I have much ammo for it, but the hunting rifle is one of my favs.
---
Even worse for me. I was like 3 feet away from my bag when *my internet went out*. Can't even take it out on Bethesda for that time. 50lbs of junk: gone.
---
I swear! It’s a actual bug! It deleted my 3 star Gatling gun.
---
Xbox
---
That's when all the notes and terminal entries just stopped happening
---
**Is there any chance**, you dropped your weapon or sold it on the shop by mistake ? 
---
I have a plan if you want it
---
Hey,where can i find deum mag plan?
---
But with my 15 going... I max out at 45... I never need more than that...  i make and dilute a ton of stimpacks and still usually have 300+ purified water in my stash.
---
At one point I had 650 diluted stimpacks... at that point I decided to sell a few.
---
The marine armour helmet is a dev room item isn't it because I dont think it's in the game to found yet. 
---
Whats your username then Ill friend you
---
dydamas
---
^^^^55 ^^^^hours ^^^^level ^^^^30
---
Definitely! With rank 3 serendipity and ignoring 50% of all incoming damage I’m gonna be practically invincible
---
i didnt knoe the radium rifle was in 76, was one of my favorite weapons in 4
---
My favorite spot. Hot tip: start the fight out front with a sneaky grenade over the fence aiming for the fire pit. Often get a few kills but really I just enjoy the thought of super muties whinging about puny humans when BANG. "how you hurt me?"
---
Something similar happened just a half hour ago, this guy was at alpha forever then finally launched but completely covered C9 there were only 5 players on the server, a lvl 8, lvl 27, lvl 88 ( guy who launched a nuke) and lvl 140+ me and another guy. The levels didnt even bothered to join as i grabbed my furios AA 50. I looked at the map and said nope, stashed the 50. Back and the other lvl 150 guy f*d off to do an enclave event instead. Kinda felt bad for the dude though, he was soloing the queen for a good bit. 
---
No. All I did was drop a 1 Star legendary I didn’t mean to pick up. And it’s the weird lag thing where all the items take forever to spawn in your inventory so it took forever to drop.
---
Just added you as a friend
---
Unfortunately, you need to delete characters if you want to make more than 5. I guess they didn't think anyone would like the missions enough to play them repeatedly on new characters.
---
I had this happen to me last night with a legendary hermit crab... I was struggling to keep up with him as I was trying to avoid the attention of the scorchbeast circling above. It was super frustrating... 
---
Could do, not sure it would reach though. Camps only have limited height a depth. It's a tall cliff.
---
Usually it takes about a minute to load the option
---
Well i let it load for like 20 minutes last night and it never appeared
---
What happened is that you murdered an innocent
---
I did it with three total and the spawns weren’t any worse than alone.
---
Nope. That's what you're supposed to be doing. I think you also won't get if it hits any fissure site. I got mine the first time I was on a server where someone nuked Whitesprings. 
---
6hr
---
I have two..level 35 and 45
---
They're not too uncommon. Granted they used to spawn more frequently but there's two buildings in Watoga that have a chance to spawn legendary scorched, the stadium and the hospital. Super mutants sometimes replace the scorched spawns at the hospital, though. 
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I tried once solo and after about 3 hours in bucker and 4 deaths I gave up. Lvl 94 now, still haven't launched a nuke lol
---
Dang the longest it’s ever taken for me was like 3 minutes and that was when  my internet was acting up really badly. idk hopefully that was just a one time thing
---
There's one in the Ash Heap. Straight south from the MoM mansion. There's a pond with two diametrically opposite houses.
---
...they are using voice chat? Never heard someone talking since B.E.T.A. (PC)
---
I love the death Tambo. I recently switched to the power fister, but I'll always love the death Tambo.
---
Doesn't happen for me.
---
STOP! Serendipity sadly DONT WORK in Power Armor :( i had to learn it on the hard way and spend my self the points and wonder my self why its never trigger :/ after a short google search... REDDIT: Doesnt Work x( Bethesda forgott to make a Note on the Perk Like the other NonPA Perks.
---
I thought with Serendipity we melee are immortel XD but the game says: NO :((
---
Tesla rifle. It can hit a bunch of guys in one shot. Very useful against mobs of enemies.
---
My modded recon hardened suppressed short hunting rifle with fast reload..my little beast..maxed gunsmith perks on my alt character..I haven't used my main character in a week..I guess with my main is my TSE handmade
---
I've finally got it today! I've got it as a reward from defending Billings Homestead.
---
Thanks all for the help!
---
Yeah if they worked for the enclave. But in the regular armed forces i dont think theyd have the enclave scout armor maybe?
---
Sadly they don't care about people with disabilities. Look at how they didn't add in a text chat feature like every other mmo has. So people who are deaf or hard of hearing are basically stuck with having no way to communicate with other players. It is really quite eye opening and shows what Bethesda truly cares about ($$$) and what they don't care about (the players).
---
I just started playing fallout 76, that is the gun I am dreaming of. 
---
My name is TomTheBard, so I became very excited when I got all the musical weapons. I’m working on a Bard build
---
Did you miss the part where they have a disability that makes it impossible for them?
---
What kind are you looking for? I have a few collected in my stash box. 
---
I launched my first nuke yesterday (was lvl 39), and i made some tips for everyone:
---
All robots are pretty weak against melee.
---
For protectrons, cripple their arms and they will self destruct. (Also deals AOE damage)
---
For assaultrons, cripple the head first. Then go for one leg. Then cripple both arms and enjoy the fireworks from a safe distance.
---
For sentry bots, hit it from the back. If you cant, 3-4 plasma grenades (without any explosive perks) does the job just fine.
---
I didnt find an easy way to destroy gutsys. Destroying their arms will initiate a self destruct but they wont leave your tail so be careful when doing it.
---
I normally don't engage in non consensual PvP but that dude was just asking for it, so i threw a few orbital strikes on him then he tried hunting me down, he failed over and over and could not just get a clue, assassins/chameleon build with an assassins AA gauss with sneak and vats crit. I just stayed on the roof while he keeps hitting revenge, keeps spawning at the same spot so he had no choice but to server hop.
---
deconstruct handmade rifles.
---
I thought this was a new issue with this patch? Deathclaws and legendary scorched do it too. 
---
I'm told a 2shot exploding is what I need. If there's more info needed please let me know
---
Do you mean quiet as in no chat or no players on the server?
---
Marsupial might help you to cheat the system as it increases your jump height. Could also use a power armor jet pack.
---
Also I am also on PC and if none of those work for you I could do it for you if nothing else works.
---
They are pretty much useless at this point they really need a buff 
---
I stopped playing this game after level 50....sucks too badly to even be called a Fallout game honestly. 
---
The issue is they are disabled. Those other games most of the time offer settings in the options menu to help those with disabilities enjoy their games as well.
---
Those painted ghouls from Nuka-World would go nicely in any of the three theme parks in 76.
---
Just a regular Laser Gatling isn't all that great. If you get a legendary with a good prefix it can be feasible though.
---
I thought it took me a long time. Then yesterday I ran into 5 in one trip.
---
I must have gotten lucky I got the skull Halloween mask and costume early on from a vendor and never seen one sincs
---
I have two handmades.
---
1. Bloodied lvl 45 .
---
2. Nocturnal hardened which is 3* with 25% faster fire rate and 15% faster reload and a bayonet.
---
Make an offer if you want this instead.
---
I loved plasma guns in other fallout games and was so excited to get the Gatling plama for 76...then incredibly disappointed. Not only does the ammo seem sparse, but it just wasn't worth the weight it took up. Now, I haven't revisited it with any upgrades and my higher level, but I suspect it won't be any better. So no, I don't see many out there. Occasionally at nuke zones. Which may be smart to save up the ammo and keep the gun stashed until one visits a nuke drop. I may try this method.
---
Skull mask you can get at Freddy’s house of scares, costume can potentially be found at the lookout near red rocket 
---
I see them alot. I'm lvl 202. what's special about them?
---
Since Sneak builds enjoy rifles because of the damage multiplier another perfectly viable build is a tank rifle build. The endurance perks would allow you to not get staggered very often and take hits as if you were in PA at the cost of the sneak damage multiplier. So while a standing rifle build isnt super offensive it is still perfectly effective. 
---
Basically just trade in agility for endurance and boom you got yourself a super soldier with a rifle. Great alternative until they fix the detection code
---
Oh well, at least I have the extra damage resist inside of power armour
---
So far no, they just add to my scrap pile or get sold if they are legendary.
---
Well, I understand that, but I'm wondering why you would get caps for murdering innocents? Doesn't that just encourage griefing?
---
Just seems like all the side set ups from FO3/4. Remember the hidden bunkers in both where the families were dead? A quarter of Bethesda's story telling is dead people
---
its arguably the best mutation, and a must have for essentially any build. The HP loss (the negative effect) is minimal when combined with classfreak 3. And you make up for it by doing significantly more dmg (positive effect). so yeah you got a very very solid drop! However, keep in mind, the mutation works, its just that those who had it before the patch and haven't removed it yet aren't having theirs work. To get it to work we have to reapply it which is stupid. 
---
It lasted only 15 minutes..no server hop. It was awesome...
---
Quad Automatic Tesla 1* ,  with marsupial, glow sight , bloody mess, adrenaline, and commando, you can collect a swarm of ghouls , jump up and vaporize all them from mid air in a hot second. X-men style.
---
Over-repaired drill with the piercing bit is good fun too, highly recommend it. At max 2x repair it melts. Only weighs a half a pound or so too with martial artist. Good pocket weapon to go ham with if you are feeling a bit deranged. Use the melee durability perk to extend playtime.
---
I think I do. Lol. good catch.
---
You should make a discord
---
this!!!!!
---
Just want to try your luck getting mutations you want ? Go to the map look I believe near top of the world there is a big rig broken down go there. 
---
  You will have to kill some mole miners but once thats done enter the building in the back and you will find a pallet of radiation barrels also across from them is a rad shower. Get a mutation add startched genes lvl 2 hit the rad shower heal up repeat. BUT ITS ALL LUCK YOU COULD GET ONE YOU DON'T WANT.  
---
the fact that they haven't fixed it in a 2 week period shows lack of compassion. If you read the entire thing you would have caught on to my point. 
---
yeah same tbh.
---
Chased a legendary wendigo around the golf course once. These other players were just watching me. It was hilarious.
---
I never had one, so dont know the diff.  I get my dmg from perks and mutations.
---
Not the other guy, but I use the 50 cal regularly. You get slightly less damage for a 50 cal review than a hardened 308 of the same level. In exchange, you get a much more craftable ammo. I use it a lot just because 50 is so efficient to craft.
---
While this is true it was also supposed to be in the game already and was an oversight so they dont seem to care much. Even if you do have one it should only be removed like other plans and such have been wiped already if they ever plan to remove it at all.
---
When you go to input the codes and targeting site at the very end.
---
I think during the long corridors that connect the different areas, there's some downtime too.
---
The waves are infinite, but at least for a single player, they are staggered.  You'll get a group of 5-6 robots, then nothing for a minute or two, and then more will spawn.  If you can deal with that wave quickly, you'll have no opposition for a while.  New opposition is always given a "Summoning reinforcements" vox, so you have some warning that you're about to go into combat again.
---
It's really not that difficult - but the "nightmare scenario" is when you have multiple Colonel Gutsys plinking away at you, which is as dangerous as you'd expect it to be.
---
You're like the gaming equivalent of 40 Year Old Virgin. 😂
---
Yeah i havent done anything bad or glitched or dupped so it can be taken down cause of that
---
thats how I feel but better worded than the post.
---
Lewisburg station has them iirc
---
I have a TSE handmade that has gotten me out of plenty of “oh shit” situations but my favorite,  at least for the moment, is my anti armor switch blade with 40% faster swing speed.    I got swarmed at the golf club and by the end I was at 30% health with a ring of dead bodies around me.
---
I haven't launched a nuke, but I've read of several similar instances recently. I've noticed it freezing a lot when I FT to an event. Sounds like the caps get deducted, but I end up having to restart the game.
---
That's the dream weapon right there, nice!
---
3 since B.E.T.A., 4th last week. 
---
That sounds...perfect
---
I actually sucked it up when my camps starting getting attacked and put in some turrets. even maxed out the home defense to play around but either turrets don't kill stuff before they are destroyed or they just don't attack at all so I don't even bother. it's just easier to repair it all later and use my meager budget to add some lights to see.
---
and it's not entitlement culture when you (im not saying me cause I bought it for $80) spend $200 for a game that was hyped up to the extent it was and it being utter garbage and the devs still having their finger up their asses like 4 months later. It's inexcusable. 
---
Most guns have a 2 shot explosive legendary effect, what type of gun do you like using or are you trying to make a build around the gun? What's you GT
---
It was just a normal question about their product.
---
Maybe he fears to receive a cardboard Fusion Core with 2 rechargeable AA LiPo batteries inside which are soldered to an USB port. ;)
---
Yes, there is a few points as you push on where you won't be bothered for a few minutes
---
Quad Tesla is amazing. It’s so good for tagging enemies or taking down mobs. Found mine at uranium fever and become one of my most loved weapons
---
BWAHAHAHA damn you *wipes coffee off monitor*
---
The shocks
---
He’s talking about the enclave orbital bombardment beacons. 
---
What?
---
deathclaw, mole miner gauntlets, and power fist count as unarmed. 
---
The weapon of choice for my main character (a low level, 20-something, responder paramedic) is still the level 5 .44 somerset special that I've got after completing Final Departure, the anti-armor effect is too great to ignore it. 
---
Oh. I didn’t realize those exist
---
20 shots may be generous.
---
Joking aside, I have a few nice ones I wanted to try out. 3-4 reloads max before being pointless.
---
Ok just dont want ppl getting a ride on the banned wagon. 👍🏽
---
Yeah caps are taken away. It registers and saves server side that you fast traveled but it just goes haywire.
---
Thank you kindly for the reply and confirmation. This frankly sucks so I guess I won’t attempt a nuke launch again for awhile. 
---
Maybe quit and restart if it's taking too long.
---
The Atomic Shop is kind of a distinct entity from the game.  That's why there's a bit of lag before it appears on the title screen.  They have, in the past, taken the Atomic Shop down for maintenance.
---
It seems like several users reported general weirdness in the game yesterday.
---
I've played with the Tesla, and it can be a viable weapon in certain instances.  It's kind of fun using a gun you don't see too many others use, me thinks.
---
YES a preview perimeter and a window of time to place down just in case that doesn't "work"  I ended up moving 3 times in one spot yesterday trying to include stuff in my radius and just decided on another spot due to frustrations. and I did that the day before too.  
---
(as an aside, it really feels odd to not have a home home yet in game)
---
I’ve had the wendigo disappear altogether. I’d have to wait at the top of the stairwell in the clubhouse, wait a few moments and then I’d see him walking to the locker room, get a few rounds in him and he would disappear and I’d start all over. It took about 4-5 times of this cycle to kill it. And it dropped some legendary wood armor piece. 
---
Instigating Super Sledge; could be better but on that one but for the other two I’ve got +40% power attack damage and defense while power attacking.  Well yes, instigating isn’t so bad either depending on the situation.
---
They removed explosive energy weapons from the lengendary loot drop table.
---
I think I have one? 
---
I used them quite a bit on my pistol character before giving up on pistols near entirely and respec'ing
---
If I find more than 2 I'll let you know
---
Yeah, it took my caps both times so I know it’s saving server side at the time of the freeze. Just sucks so I guess I won’t attempt a nuke launch for some time now. Big waste of ammo and energy just for it to go to the gutter.
---
Thank you for your reply and confirmation of this issue. I greatly appreciate it.
---
I did it on my own at level 74. It was hard and I died more than once but I did finally complete the quest.
---
I just use my quad Tesla to tag all the ghouls at WS lol- wait can we just admire how all of us have this exact weird legendary?
---
Power Armor with all Rise and a Medic Pump and you can just meander through the silo. Having level 3 hacker makes it even easier, just turn the turret targeting restrictions off in each room.
---
I thought this was a PC only item so far, hmm! Do people have this on Xbox One?
---
Or just build two of the same / similar weapons...? 
---
But where are they?
---
No it isn't and this sub has gotten quite smaller
---
I hate to hear of people like you going through all that effort to go through the process.  But I'm glad to help.
---
Quad is a nice prefix in general.
---
I carry around a shotgun, not for damage, but for the Enforcer perk which has a chance to cripple limbs.  And let me tell you - having a Quad Combat Shotgun is the best thing ever for this because you'll never get caught having to reload.  I think mine holds 34 shells.
---
Also, I just love the Tesla Rifle.  It's not the most damaging weapon or anything, but it's the kind of weapon that you could probably build an entire indie game around.
---
Congratulations, Awesome job! I have only one question, how did you get to level 370 with only 700hrs game time? I have put in overtime at over 1000hr at this point, 10 to 12 hrs a day since  day 1 and I am only at level 231, just curious, I am trying to figure out what I am doing wrong lol! 
---
Sadly, my only 3* weapon to date(lvl 73) is an Ultracite pistol, lol.....and it sucks, like all the energy weapons in this game.  I cannot see the point in using energy weapons over ballistic, they're so comparatively under powered.  
---
Is there some benefit to them that I have yet to discover?
---
Laser weapons are great on Super Mutants, I’m pretty sure that’s been the case in most of the fallout games. I’m really trying to make my second character into an ONLY energy weapons character, but it’s really hard...
---
Just finished that after 2.5 months.... All for a few atoms. Very anticlimactic...
---
Level 160, 200 hours
---
AAE 250 DR pump action. Found it in a whitesprings nuke zone.
---
Less players.
---
So I have an assultron blade and I do get one from scrapping it. What can I use the circuit board for? 
---
PM sent
---
Yeah, that "weird lag" thing?  That's probably when you dropped it.
---
&gt;solved by making the different colors an Atom Shop unlock
---
Solves what? Why Bethesda would put any time into anything?
---
I stopped fighting her when they nerfed everything
---
Or a chance at low level adds dropping two shot explosive fire axe
---
One time when I first took over the dirt track on like day 1 or 2, I got worried that someone would try to attack. So I covered the place with machine guns and filled the grass with punji boards. 
---
980 hours for lvl 246 on my main, then one lvl 86 and my first character lvl 62. I wait for respec for these 2
---
Hah me too!
---
You both sound like my ideal fallout 76 dream team.
---
Bunch of mute players too anxious to talk to each other kicking ass and drinking nukacola with.
---
I'd team up.  Best part is I'm at the quest portion to launch a nuke and am too anxious to do it alone.
---
Just shoot it, this game is pretty easy
---
As of now? No. I dunno if that will (or can) change, though 
---
My favorites
---
Character 1: Quad, Fire rate 2\* Gauss. Dear god I love that weapon. Nothing else she has is nearly as much fun. Use an instigating gauss for sniping, but that quad is so often used. 20 shots is generally perfect for most encounters, though the club house I need to reload during ... and being a gauss headshots are nearly always kills.
---
Character 2: Nice collection of fire-axes including an Instigating / more PA damage / take less during PA ... also an Executioners / Swing Speed / +1 STR. I have two plain Instigating I use mostly for general use. She also has an under-level combat shotgun w/ limb damage (under level so does less damage, which is fine) combo'd w/ enforcer I can put most of white springs on the ground w/o killing it and let lowbies clean it up.
---
I have some nice energy weapons (in theory) but none of them last more than two encounters so I don't bother with them. They can sit in the stash until time is right.
---
At what point did we enter fantasy land?  I don't remember anything about the Scorched being temporally linked.  It doesn't seem particularly realistic.
---
Last two times I've tried to run a nuke (Never launched one, lvl 95) it crashed on me at different points (During the repairing the mainframe portion and the second time during the fixing the leaks portion) in the silo and also the second time made me completely invisible to my friend, no floating name tag even. So good luck, server stability is the true end game boss when it comes to the silo. 
---
It's not just super mutants. I watched a legendary deathclaw getting chased around Whitespring by a radstag last night, it was hilarous. Also annoying coz when I joined in they are real fast runners.
---
You can loot air conditioners? TIL
---
On PS4 and I find them regularly.
---
Sure thing, my name is 101001101100
---
Disappointing
---
Just kill shit, it is not that hard
---
TSE is still good, it just isn't ridiculously and far and away better than any other combination anymore.
---
I wish I still had my Quad Tesla...sold it when I found a Furious Explosive Tesla.  Though the FE weapon rocks even though it doessn't behave like a Tesla.
---
I DO have a workshop tower I slap down blueprinted and it's full of turrets lol.... it does nothing against players. and turrets at my camp do nothing against...anything 
---
I think Scorched would benefit more from PA changes, I mean they have been the main enemy this whole time yet they rarely use more than a pair of overalls or a pitchfork
---
Prime receiver if you can find the plans. Violet flux is really easy to farm.
---
I remember how everyone kept saying there were NPCs when they found Graham and rose, and while they're right, they're missing the point entirely. The point of NPCs in past games was interaction. You can't even hit these NPCs. Your shots go right through them. You can't talk to them or anything. You just look past them.
---
I don't think looking past a soulless on rails character is what people wanted when they said they want NPCs. 
---
The Bunker somewhere.
---
He was using a macro to exploit resource nodes getting three times the intended amount of resources from each node.
---
I think it's really an energy weapon thing.  Their durability sucks compared to other weapon types, and hopefully that will be addressed whenever that general "Energy Weapons revamp" happens.
---
It's just a suggestion. Or they could just make it the same as in Fallout 4 where you could go into the settings to change the color. 
---
Cola nut. Lol
---
Furious Explosive Tesla rifle.
---
Ammo is plentiful in the world, it's now a unicorn as it can't drop any more.  And it shreds.
---
He sounds pretty smart to me
---
Reminds me of Shadows of Mordor. 
---
Two Shot is actually very strong for pvp. It add's extra stagger/cripple percentages because of the 2nd shot. 
---
Anti-Armor Switchblade + Swing Speed 
---
Gauss Rifles and Plasma Throwers are actually pretty good energy weapons.
---
The plasma thrower consumes plasma cartridges like a hungry kitten eats wet cat food and breaks for me around 1000 rounds which are heavy, and the gauss has bad fire rate, inaccurate sights and crazy heavy ammo, but both do really good damage if you don't min/max like me.
---
They're both my friends.
---
Never noticed it, even when it happened. Was it like that in 4?
---
Seems like a huge oversight and really should be fixed. 
---
This happened on PS4 last night, I thought it was odd that I was the only guy left and no one else came on.
---
No idea, my brother and I have both experienced this as well on Xbox so your not alone.
---
Whats the deal with them? 
---
Bought the game so is a paying customer. Bethesda wants him to spend his money on atoms. So his voice is louder than someone that'll spend their money on atoms anyway. 
---
This has happened to me as well.  Not often, but at various points over the last month or so.  No idea why.  
---
I have an AAE combat shotgun. It kills stuff very fast. It breaks very fast too. Like maybe 15-20 minutes of gaming. It's not very hard to repair, but I have to stop playing, find a weapon workbench (or go to my camp), get out of my power armor, fix the gun, go back to playing. It's really not fun to do that... 
---
thanks for the reply! that's not too bad
---
In my experience it's about the same alone as it is in a group. And either way it's absolutely easy. Also, at what stage do you need any lockpicking or hacking? Unless I'm misremembering something I haven't used either in any of my launches.
---
That Slocum's Joe has always been there.  I used to run that path all the time on the way to Morgantowne because I'm a cheapskate.
---
Although I think it would be hilarious if Bethesda, every now and then, did things like this.  Snuck buildings and new locations into the world without telling anyone.
---
Very nice. I had a first a few days ago. 3 scorch beasts came at me at the same time. Two were level 50, and one of the bastards was level 80. I ran into a megasloth in the middle of all of that too.
---
... You know what? This might have been exactly what was causing it. I had moved my camp machine to build something and I don't know if I put it back where it was.
---
(Good to know for the free camp move though!) 
---
They probably didn't. Seems like Austin was really heavily rushed (despite the 3 year game time). Feel bad for those guys. Hope they were at least well compensated for this 
---
Meh, they die in 1 swing of the hammer or a couple bullets of my gatling gun. Either way they're certainly no more than a mild nuisance.
---
Ill help you out if you need a crew, Its not too bad, im 71, it took a night to get the codes and launch, I have 4 people, but really didnt need that many. PSN name mid_nite_2006, add me.
---
You can set up a personal map marker by clicking on a space on the map (so long as it isn’t one of the areas that come up as named locations on the map). You can place the marker close to a named location though. As far as I’m aware you can only have one personal map marker, and you can move it around or remove it completely. 
---
I've seen it happen a few times. Especially sad when it's a 3* legendary... You don't get the loot... 
---
&gt;a luck
---
definitely not OP :3
---
Yeah, I should have added Explosive weapons into that statement.

That's all part of the argument for why the Two-Shot and Explosive nerfs, individually, should be revisited.  Two-Shot is woefully inaccurate.  Explosive causes your weapon to break a lot faster.  Neither seems particularly worth it for what's now a fairly meager damage bonus.  I have a 3\* Exterminator's Combat Shotgun with explosive.  You might think it would have supplanted the Quad, but it didn't, because it's so unreliable.  It needs repairs after dealing with just a handful of beefy enemies, and that's with max Gunsmith.
---
Weapon degradation in a game like Fallout New Vegas was fine because you could just buy new guns or collect them, and repair your own as you moved along. Weapon degradation in a multiplayer game, where you have to stop and place your camp, or go find another bench is tedious and boring. Super powerful guns in Fallout 4 felt like you were discovering a treasure. You would find a nice gun and use it throughout your journey. Finding super powerful guns in 76 feels worse because you know that your gun will either break, or have to be repaired constantly.
---
No, THATS hilarious.
---
I think this might be an online thing. Perhaps your game loads a spawn, and then the server pings down that the spawn is supposed to be dead, so it dies. 
---
What do you think?
---
By that logic I'm already legendary, I always run from a fight I can't win to re-engage later on my terms.
---
- Power armor with reactive plates 
---
- psychobuff or other good chems
---
- craft the strongest grenade and spam them when you sneak up on him
---
- I don’t know if a wendigo counts as a ghoul, but some ghoul slayers equipment would help if it did
---
Hmm. I wasn't expecting less damage, that's disappointing.
---
They weren't thinking. Welcome to Fallout 76, get used to it.
---
There really aren't many "BIG" issues anymore.  Just take your time and enjoy it.
---
Also, once you reach Lv. 5, turn on Pacifist mode so you don't get bothered by other players trying to PvP you.
---
Yeah- I used to have a regular cap stash run, but it’s nearly totally dried up now. It’s fine though, because I can make way more caps doing legendary runs or nuke zone flora runs instead, and they’re usually more fun than emptying a bunch of cap stashes. But it sucks if you’re lower level.
---
The game is overall much more stable than it is on launch, I’m sure there are a few horror stories here and there but it’s gotten better.
---
As for content, we’re about a week and a bit more away from something new. 
---
ME BEST SUPER MUTANT
---
NEED NO ARMOR JUST BEEPING THING
---
DIE PUNY HUMONN WEEEAAK PUUNYY HUMOOONNN
---
(Oh god I'm...  Oh god why am I naked and holding a nuclear device? I- I want to explode it on this puny person but it'll kill me too, why god did you put me in this situation!)
---
AIIEEEEE DIIIEEE -slaps with mini nuke instead of detonating it-
---
All the other mutants stare on in utter confusion as to why their annoying pal, Jimmy, won't kill himself.
---
Honestly if I were to be completely new to the game now I wouldn't really see all the bad stuff people complain about until I got to a higher level and start XP and legendary farming.  Enemy corpse disappearing or health regenerating.  But as a new player I think you will enjoy playing through the main/side quests relatively bug free at this point.  I started playing the first day of the beta and there were numerous bugs with quests and much more.  Still enjoyed it, but can only imagine it's much more enjoyable now.  I think you will have fun.
---
It's possible the explosive trait is making it worse, yes. But it still kinda proves the point that weapon degradation is not fun. Well maybe it is ok to have, but let us fix guns faster.... Like weapon kits? Temporary buffs to degradation rate too? Something I can build and use to keep firing my guns without the need to break gameplay... 
---
Heart attacks. You're just too damn imposing.
---
What keeps bringing you back to the game? Me and my mates loved it for a few hours, did all the missions and launched the nukes, and we haven’t touched it in over a month
---
I have similar problems with it.
---
I have no idea why they are so unreliable compared to medical containers and Pharma Farma.  You can equip Pharma Farma after you've looked at a container and Search will be available.  Why that same logic works so inconsistently with Cap Stashes is anyone's guess.  But I make my Caps as a professional Civil War haberdasher now, so...
---
Yeah I've noticed that the Blackwater mine is usually dry, as well as the whitesprings. Legendary runs rarely pay off for me though.
---
Exactly! Maybe we could craft buffs that stop weapon degradation... Or weapon repair kits to quickly get the weapon up and running, not to stop gameplay... Just let me keep shooting Bethesda, don't force me out of an encounter for no good reason! 
---
Lame! It is bugs like these that make me wish the devs would just implement a fix before they solve the problem. Like maybe make the mentats that highlight living targets work on people that are invisible.  
---
I think this is the case many times.  Like when you first load into an area and see loot, go to pick it up but cannot.  Then a few moments later the items disappear.  Cause they weren’t actually there and they were spawned as placeholders.  
---
you've done 40 silo runs and haven't figured out that radsponge is not needed in there at all?  
---
it's typically much easier solo. i run it in about 20 minutes without lvl 3 lockpicking or hacking, and using less than 5 stimpaks.  
---
It's gotta be a typo, doesn't it? Should be 50 at the very least.
---
That is awesome dude. Makes me want to play this again haha 
---
Maybe. 
---
I believe what OP wants is multiple map pins. If you ever played Zelda:BoTW you could place around 50 pins on the map. These pins had different symbols so lets say if you found a good spot to gather herbs you could put a leaf pin and easily refind it on the map. 
---
This would be an awesome idea if we coild mark where we found bobbles, mags, and herbs so we wouldnt need companion apps. Wouldnt have to show up on the radar like a marker just so there wouldnt be clutter.
---
This happened to me! It's real my tse handmade poof gone in a queen fight 
---
Pvp is so fuckin broken because of that shit. I'm tired of being 1 shot whenever I have a bounty. Atleast give me a chance to out skill the other player. It shouldn't be skilless 1 shotting. 
---
il run a tesla for the chain if i know im going to areas with tons of weak mobs, otherwise i dont really touch them
---
I love it, but the supply is so low. I clear out whitesprings of Cola every time I pass through. Dark and Grape seem to be super low stock every time. Can never acquire enough to support my Cola drinking/donating habit. 
---
I’m hoping we can learn to make various colas eventually, with distilling coming up it’s not a huge stretch. That, or a few more ‘wild’ (Nuka Cola Wild pun not intended) spawns of colas other than normal, cherry and quantum would be appreciated. 
---
I think I’ve only ever found 1 dark and 1 wild in the Nuka Cola factory. Nowhere else. 
---
I need me more Cola variety. 
---
I forget what it was called exactly but it threw me cause of it being odd named. Basically i only knew what it was because i had already learned the small one. But a few of the side vendors have them sometimes like the hidden ones. I believe i got mine at either phoenix in watoga or more likely the one in harpers ferry i believe. 
---
And add the Ultracite Gatling laser to the legendary loot table!
---
The second nuke we launched last night was bugged. Got to the end and no security came out. Literally had to stand around for the 5-10 minutes while preperations were done. 
---
We usually do it in pairs, one as a hacker, one with lock pick. Each has a job to do while the other kills the robots.  It goes pretty quick after your first time. Havent launched at Charlie yet, but alpha and bravo were the exact same.
---
I still opted for the .50 cal receiver with a 2 star Ammo Smith perk card I craft 180 rounds of .50 Cal (vs 100 rounds) plus a Level 2 Bandolier petk card means ALL my ballistic ammo weighs 90% less so I'm carting around anywhere from 1,000 to 2,000 plus rounds of ammo for both of my sniper rifles. Finally a 3 star Scrounger perk card means i find more ammo 80% of the time. I collect ammo so easily I've given nearly, if not over 30,000 rounds of ammo away to lower level players since i started back in the beta, and i ONLY craft  .50  and .45 cal and 5mm ball everything else is environmental pickup.
---
This exact same thing happened to me. My lever gun was listed as broken in my inventory but I was able to keep using it to kill the queen. Then went and farmed at Whitesprings and it just kept going. 
---
It's busy work, to be sure, but it doesn't bother me most of the time.  It's just something you do before going out at the beginning.  And if it is a problem, then it's something you need to consider when it comes to that specific weapon.  Is this "high maintenance" weapon really worth it?  It should have some attribute that makes it so (pre-nerf Explosive, for example).  If not, then it needs one.
---
I know this was 73 days ago, but do you still have those stealth boys?
---
Good man! I was an Alpha and closed beta tester for both Anthem and The Division 2 so I almost feel like I should buy one of them, but maybe later. I like TD2 a lot but I put like 64 days in the first game and they dont feel different enough that I want to keep playing the game. For now I am gonna see how the next FO76 expansion shakes out in a few days and keep pushing to have a multi build character that is not over max weight. 
---
I’ll take yours if the other guy doesn’t go through with it
---
&gt; It's the only way to get legendary items in this game.
---
ridiculous. in an hour of play time this morning i got 8 legendaries and didn't step foot into a nuke zone or whitesprings at all.  
---
I found 2 invicible mutated hounds in Watoga high school. Pain.
---
How much for each of them
---
I got them doing the Tyler county track workshop after about 3 defend was a few days but also got an extra at bog town...
---
"Events" are a waste of precious ammo at low levels. Just leave the event zone. 
---
Cook food promptly or it'll spoil. Stimpacks weight 1 each, so limit the amount you carry. 
---
When you're at Morgantown airport, pick enough produce to start an adhesive farm (corn, mutfruit, tato).
---
The 10mm is garbage. Pipe revolver and shotguns are pretty good.
---
you don't know what 'game breaking' means
---
Haha you may be right. I did try once but didn't "penetrate" the bunker very far😂
---
Just one more of the know bugs that Bethesda has done nothing about. Players have been reporting this for months. At least is doesn't happen often
---
LOVE my tesla rifle!
---
What are the effects on the combat armor left leg?
---
Some random high level dropped a AA Gauss way back when i was almost level 50, been my main weapon for months now
---
I definitely agree with your final point, I hate the cards but trying to stay positive about possible fixes as opposed to just complaining about how the entire thing is flawed on so many levels. Not implying that is what you are doing, your post is very well though out. But yeah, first and foremost - knowledge and skills don't work the way the card system dictates it. I don't have to turn off the part of my brain that knows how to play the guitar and activate the part that knows how to drive a car every time I want to go for a ride. The perk system and perk map in FO4 was great. The perk system in Skyrim, also great. This cards system is just a drag.
---
I was using melee for a bit. All Rise. I was carrying backup super sledges, cause they kept breaking all the time... My gatling plasma breaks after 10-15 mobs (but it kills them very fast). I have a TS gatling gun and a TSE gatling gun. Both of them break fast... I have an AA .50 cal and that thing lasts maybe 4-5 clips.
---
Either I'm really unlucky or we're not playing the same game ;) 
---
I want my army of liberators. 
---
Nice I was in 3 different nuke zones at WS and I was able to get two TS a black powder rifle and a 10mm..not TSE but whatever I'll take it
---
Rad &amp; Stormy
---
Same ting happened to me there. Couldn't kill the insects!
---
Yeah I’ve noticed that with some different Legendary creatures. I chased a Legendary deathclaw all over the bog one time.
---
I assumed as much, thus why I opened with the apology. I hadn't seen it.
---
I use a lvl 45 Ultracite Gatling laser for Scorched, it Feels good man
---
Not on PS4 but I have found with my team that the endangerol syringer does work on her
---
Don’t be anxious! You. Can do it! Once you get the hang of it and know what to do, it’s simple. I do nukes alone now. Te best part is it’s not timed. I get really stressed when things are timed. I feel rushed.. 
---
i see low level golfer ghouls quite often on PC and im at level 155
---
if you go show up when there is only a lower level players at WS
---
ive had the club full of protectrons or liberators too several times too
---
And tell me - was that a lot of fun? Hell yeah! Not thinking about having to constantly fix your weapons or switching to backups = fun! Bethesda, make it a buff, make it a long quest chain and a new weapon mod type to apply to any weapons. Make weapon repair kits that can quickly repair guns while out in the field. Come on.... 
---
Now that’s an achievement! You can’t even abandon the quest lol. 
---
As far as the ama, what did the quest reward give ya. 
---
Yeah I like playing by myself sometimes and then of course with my bf but that’s it. I would like to have people that play this game but don’t require me to talk or be in a team all the time. I get it for other things of course. But when the player vending comes out, you should add me. I’m going to have things for cheap. Cheaper then the actual vendors :) I’m working on filling up my shop with a lil rare outfits and maybe some cool guns and plans for things! 
---
Lore wise even quantum being in Appalachia is a stretch. The others were only in nuka world or the west coast. So wild spawns don’t make much sense. But the brewing would be totally cool. 
---
Because people can spell out very bad messages, and Bethesda doesn't want that 
---
Ooo yes I like this. I’ve thought about this too. It would make it easier to find places as well 
---
please stop
---
I saw someone else say that and I thought they were trolling.. does it really??
---
I scraped more than 20 handmade with scrapper perk and no drum mag.
---
I think that’s why I waited so long. Most of the big bugs should be gone now hopefully 
---
Mom found the poop sock 
---
I found one with 100 so I’m not complaining.. 
---
I never use it due to reload speed but, instigating explosive harpoon gun with less vats cost, flechette rounds. Before the great nerf it would kill scorch beasts with 1 sneak shot.
---
My most used weapon is a level 35 bloodied explosive pump shotgun
---
I thought of this too and have made sure they are NOT set as read-only.
---
*Fallout76.ini - Fallout76Prefs.ini - Fallout76Custom.ini*   all set with read-only tick box empty.
---
Hoping this was the cause too, I'm wondering if **any** edits to the ini files with Fallout 76 causes things to become unstable. I've a few mods so have added to my *Fallout76Custom.ini file.* And I've killed the grass as my 750ti can't handle the graphics load.

Dang, I wanna see just s random super staircase up a cliff
---
Maybe they could add a little mini nuka park somewhere, or like a nuka museum or something. Some sort of smaller scale nukacola attraction where they'd have the other flavors available to try.
---
Hi,
---
Been sever hoping a lot for it, but can find it, any chance you could make me some, so i can learn to craft it myself ?
---
Think i already have the BoS mod for it, it unlocked when i was scrapping combat arms :)
---
Could trade you for some serum, or caps ...
---
1. 1.2k
---
2. 2.5k
---
I have noticed this sometimes, but not sure if I'm being too subjective and the numbers are really normal given the  max players per world Bethesda allow.
---
If Bethesda were more transparent regarding the number of players this would be clearer.
---
Are you ever going to lose your virginity?
---
Is 45 the max level for dragons?
---
I have 5 characters all finished nuclear.
---
I know the number of  server instances decreased because the only thing left for me is shopping. So I hopping a lot and always joined that same instances.
---
I already pre ordered the division 2 and busy with FREE beta now so haven't login for a week already.
---
I have 150ish friends in list, but only 2~3 are still playing last week. Part of me thinks it is the end and we should say so long and thanks for all the fish.
---
Sad fact, I'm a programmer and PM for 12 years, PhD in it.
---
I know shit around development, and from developer perspective, this game has no future unless they change the team.
---
Like the patches,  clearly incompetent developers with pathetic management. No version control system in 2019. 
---
And part of me think the game may embraces a bright new future this year.
---
Bethesda and their franchises are still my all-time favorite.
---
If I am Todd, I'd spend millions dollars to save this title and bring back the fan base who may played this title for decades.
---
But we all know it's not realistic in a big company.
---
It has always done this if you manage to be on a server for hours, even months ago. I used to use it as a trick to play coop with friends and avoid griefers, or get a full group for Scorchbeast queen without any low level randos hopping in
---
The upkeep for repairs is a bit steep, but then again it's a mostly different set of junk than conventional firearms so it can help diversify your repair costs at least, if you're finding you're running out of the same few things a lot.
---
The bigger repair issue is that they break *far* quicker than other weapons. Especially the high rate of higher guns like the Gatlings and Flamer. A .50Cal MG can fire several thousand rounds before breaking, whereas you're lucky to get through more than a couple cores for an energy Gatling (250-500 per core, so only a thousand or so shots before breaking, on a rough estimate).
---
But repair costs aside, they also don't have as good a damage as most other weapons. This might be in part because (afaik, and correct me if I'm wrong) most enemies have higher ballistic defense than energy defense. So the lower dmg might be because there's less defense to overcome, but that doesn't seem like very strong logic when you factor in PvP and the high costs of operating energy weapons.
---
Then again, Gauss Rifles are kickass, and I think they might technically be "Energy Guns", since their ammo is classified that way.
---
I know the feeling, but it’s a lot easier solo. As a team enemies do a fuck ton of damage compared to solo it’s more doable. I launched my first nuke with a friend just so I can get it done and it was a painful process given my trash armor and weapons. Then I did it solo just to see if I can survive and I did, not as painful but annoying.
---
Thank god because I just did a fight 3 or 2 days ago and one of my weapons broke but I still have it 
---
All I ever think of is players coming over from CS-Go, Fortnite etc and wanting to PVP in the same way just in a different space, I may be wrong.
---
Ah, I bet you are right.  That would make sense.
---
I can’t agree more. That’s just what I see. Tbh if someone wants to waste their fuel in place of a stim to heal me. Go for it. One less stim I need to pop. If anything its weapon for a play style that really no one needs to use. As there are so many other that just work. 
---
Watago vendors randomly carry the recipes.   Go server hop and buy them.
---
About 350-450 caps per I think. It’s not a bad deal.
---
Its part of being a fallout game
---
Right under the house's balcony, between the rocks, is a hidden passage where you find a safe on the wall. You use the passcode on the safe and find the key to the bunker there.
---
K I’ll be on 7:30 mountain time I’ll pay you for the bloodied one and maybe the other
---
It is, but only for ranged weapons. Cause Melee has the 75% anti armor Perk card and they do not stack to full potential 
---
Lol, yes we only ever communicate by gestures (like the hardest game of charades ever) and your welcome to visit my CAMP but you can't sleep over😂
---
&gt; just about every move they make is to make it easier for griefers to make the game shitty for the rest of us.
---
It certainly seems that way.
---
OP.
---
US or EU? 
---
Sorry, am new to Reddit, what does OP mean? Yes, I do know about the location marker and have played Fallout titles before. Cannot remember the game I am thinking of but I do remember a similar game where you can write notes to yourself. Doing some research I realise it was a MOD actually [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12581](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12581) or something similar
---
 Major/Colonel Gutsies drop them often in my experience, regardless of location/region. 
---
That’s a hell of a picture my dude!
---
There is a goddamn bottling factory and it's filled with mostly empty beer bottles. There should be nothing but nuka cola in that bitch, but noooooooo. 
---
Great story fun read! 
---
Thank you 
---
I notice this too.
---
My main weapon for a while was the heated pitchfork.
---
Haven’t played any of the others so I wasn’t sure if the mapping system was the same throughout the other games 😅
---
I didn’t know that! My primary is a DC gauntlet. Will have to re-evaluate my perks
---
They exist in game?
---
How did i miss that?
---
There is a holotape on the back patio of one of the mansions overlooking the dry lakebed, next to the corpse in the wheelchair.
---
I think there's also another one inside the Hornwright house, along with a key to get into their Estate.
---
As of today I bought light combat armor legs and arms plans from Harper's Ferry and Watoga Station -750caps each 0.0. It shows up in the armor work bench as light armor - combat armor. Not "light combat armor" just "combat armor." Its in the same section as leather armor. Hope this clears up any confusion.
---
Yeah man, good find!  Also, that’s a lot of hours!  Almost half way to that permaban! :p
---
I use Gatling plasma, as the cores are cheap, but I have to carry around 4 to finish silos and other longer areas.
---
Adrenaline or are you losing health over time?
---
This sounds intentional. As a way for the server world to refresh and restart spawns. Kind of a soft reset.
---
FF14 does something similar with the servers they use for their "Eureka" section for upgrading their relic weapons. The server will stop repopulating the world after a set time and let that instance die to reset all spawns.
---
Yeah, it should.
---
It's a fairly known bug and repeatable. 
---
I’m on the second to last mission but I’m only level 31 but I’d be willing to help. My PSLive name is the same as my Reddit name. 
---
Jeez it looks cool
---
When I first left the vault, a random dude gave me a bunch of stuff.  Not everyone online sucks! :)
---
Ha! I had spent an entire weekend building the perfect camp. It was awesome! The last thing I did was move the camp machine in place of a pesky rock that kept respawning. I never saw that camp again. I was totally bummed. So now when I see posts like yours I make sure people know. 
---
I think the reality of the 2/19 patch hasn't registered with him yet, and probably hasn't with most players. Basically workshops are now a way of forcing you into PVP. They always were, to an extent, but the 2/19 change makes it much easier for griefers.
---
In the old system, they had to interact with the work bench to take the workshop.  You could surround your work bench with turrets, traps etc. and even lock the place up so they had to  pick a lock to get to the bench, which would cause them to acquire a wanted level.
---
Now they can contest workshops from anywhere in the area of the workshop.  
---
It makes workshops utterly worthless for harvesting resources. They are basically now just shitholes for griefers to thrieve. 
---
Lot's of things effect melee damage.
---
It’s not whining or crying it harsh needed criticism that everyone should share.
---
This was a glitch in early November. It was kind of awful. My thing was invincible ticks. I wonder if the glitch opened up again? I know a couple patches ago they had patched glitches resurface. 
---
God damn if I run into another invincible tick that just follows my ass around spitting at me until I die I'm gonna lose my shit. 
---
I have my clown suit in the hot keys.  
---
You know Rifles have an Anti armor perk as well... 
---
Yes, does 3:00 Pacific standard time work?
---
Are they even rare? I've got like 5 of each.
---
Waaaait. I play on PC, so no achievements/trophies and I'm not aware of what's on PS4/XBOX for those. But they actually made a *reward* for being a griefer?! What the actual *fuck*, Bethesda!
---
Are you on PS4? I'll buy the plan from you
---
Same here. Level 80. I got close to getting all cards but never managed to launch a nuke. Kinda gave up over the last weeks. If anyone is in a similar position add me on Discord = BongStarGames
---
Wow you guys are so freaking friendly here 
---
I'd be keen to join you in taking her down mate. I'm in the level 130's but in the same boat as yourself. 
---
Sounds cool too
---
One of our favorite parts about doing our live events are the uninvited rando's who stumble upon a fully attended game show in the middle of the Wasteland. I don't think I've ever seen the "confused question marks" emote used so much. 
---
"...daFUQ?????"
---
I'm 355 with 625 or so in. I think it depends on your build.  I have high intelligence and use sneak rifles which is infinitely better for leveling up then like melee. I've seen very few people over 200 using melee. 
---
I have a sniper rifle that’s pretty good, not legendary but level 20 is pretty nice (I’m level 20 something atm) does like 80 dmg or something, I like it
---
Thanks. It's fun - just trying out a bloodied buzzblade. Looks promising.
---
I'm a PvP oriented player myself. Having an area where the players are protected will not dimnish my fun. On the contrary - if its protected there will be people.  If there will be people somebody will try to attack em anyway. Finally my dream playstyle thats based on hunting griefers would be possible.
---
Gotta admit it was a bit of an embarrassing way to die! The bugs got their revenge for once.
---
Plasma flamer?
---
They hardcore grind and farm low level xp to get better weapons and they slowly farm better and better mobs eventually killing scorch beasts and miurlek queens
---
There should be an event like Mama Dolces to give us the opportunity to make some Nuka Cola
---
Yeah, but there's still a good bit in circulation. One of the most common ones I see is an explosive charging tesla shotgun
---
not only is it not new but listening to the Overseer's holotape in Flatwoods puts it on your map
---
No it does not worth checking tho
---
Cool with me man. I'm hoping we can get a couple more people to join our cause and give it a go maybe this afternoon or something. My PSN is RickyLegend1980 by the way. Add me and lemme know it's about this post in the message
---
Its no where near as good. So why not use an anti-armor gun and not waste 3 perk points? 
---
I don’t see too many, but I haven’t played much recently, just got back on a day or two ago, but the few I’ve seen have had some stuff
---
Took me 3 times reading this and a handful of comments to understand it. Didn't realize how bad the quest was, I remember finishing it my second day playing, and was hoping for more quests like it since I leveled a couple times doing it.
---
Well, that's my girlfriend's favorite quest. I mean she is sending me into Whitesprings all the time to do it.   
---
0/10 after two months. Luckily she is a very patient lady. :)
---
I was really hoping there would be a mod for the Incenerator from Fallout 3/NV. 
---
The closet we got to shooting flaming projectiles is the new non-dropping Explosive Flamers.
---
Everything uses plastic...
---
And I use a shit load of plastic.. it’s the only thing I’m always short on (other than lead / gunpowder which I replenish via veins / workshops) 
---
It’s not a terrible use of plastic when you have 600lbs of junk in bulk in your inventory.
---
So with your theory. I should carry less overall junk to keep more plastic?
---
I’m not sure of the exact math... but I couldn’t imagine my 800lb stash with 600lbs of bulk junk to be removed from bulk.. I’d have maybe 1/4 of the total mats.
---
Just always pickup plastic and bulk after repairs and crafting.
---
Unless it's an energy weapon only reduces ballastic resistance
---
Hey, you are not anti-social. You might be shy or preferring ding stuff on their own pace, but that doesn't imply being anti-social. To the contrary, you seem nice.
---
I love playing the game solo. It adds to the atmosphere of the game. For 99% of it that's how I would prefer it. It would be nice if every now and again that 1% wasn't simply me handing over a few goodies to a lower level player. Walk around with them for a bit and answer a few questions they may have (that I can answer). I look forward to visiting your shop one day. I have never traded with another player and can't wait for the vending machines to allow me to without all the anxieties.
---
I like it. Solar roofs would be cool too.
---
I think most people find the *does action* kind of comments really annoying.
---
Why would they spawn when nobody was there?
---
I feel ya. I’d love to sling some flame at an SB
---
Plasma gun with the flamer mod.
---
I know, but just up to 36%, so the 50% armor penetration of anti amor is more useful to them as AA in total is capped at 90%. What use do I have for 50% anti armor effect when my weapons already have 75%? 
---
Then get a friend/family member to do it for them. 
---
Thanks! I'll check it out when he gets back online
---
I have a quad/explosive Tesla with a shotgun barrel and it is a beast. I cant wait till they allow anti armor perks to effect energy weapons because that think is considered a rifle and tank killer is gonna make it even more awesome. 
---
I only find ritual mask there. Is the hood/headpiece variant random?
---
I’d love to a daily timer in place. That way you can only turn in 1 weapon and 1 armour per 24 hours. 
---
They pitch a tent at Whitesprings and never leave.
---
That's something of an oversimplification, but there tends to be a significant level difference between those who do the Whitesprings farming (or aggressive farming in general) versus those who don't and just take the game as it comes.
---
There could be a lot of reasons for the discrepancy.  Bethesda nerfed XP a while ago, but in the early days XP was very easy to get if that was all you were farming for.  Plus there are different buffs/perks you can use to get more xp, especially if you are on team.  If you just do nuke zones, specifically the queen and whitesprings, you will level up more efficiently.  Try joining large discord groups.  They usually have a channel dedicated to users announcing that they are launching a nuke.  They will list their name and you can then add them and join them.
---
Maybe they could make the flies on the corpses an meat piles glow a bit to offset them.
---
Alts. :)
---
I can show you how to launch a nuke in about 5 min if you're interested. It will negate "needing a team".
---
Why shouldn’t they degrade?
---
This is genius. Just a cloud of flies that hovers 4-5 feet above the ground. 
---
I think I will keep that in mind 
---
Some people build there just to get people to go red. Get better at pvp and just attack 
---
Is there a level cap?
---
Good answer 
---
Wakonda forever!!! 
---
......n get this man a shield!!
---
I dont have adrenaline 
---
I launched my first nuke solo somewhere around level 50+/- 5.  At 150 you should have no problem doing it on your own if you prefer to be alone.
---
Oh my god same here. That’s why I’m so excited for the player vending. Before the roadmap came out I was just like “god I wish I could sell my stuff without me having to be here and accept trade invites.” But yeah that would be great! I’m not a pushy person and I’m definitely not the type to bother someone. Heck, i don’t even walk up to anyone’s camp that much. I only do it sometimes when I know I’m not staying on the server for long and they aren’t home 😂 
---
My psn is Queen_Of_Psychos (if anyone sees this and would like to add me, go ahead! I won’t bother ya!)
---
Sure man! I’ll be on in an hour or two if you want me to show you the ropes :)
---
 Not that It matters at all but I find my own stuff. Its part of my game. ;)
---
Haven’t heard of that I’ll look
---
Dyer chemical
---
Flamer Ammo is a none issue imo considering you can buy 100 Fuel for 200 Caps. If you hope to enough vendors youll have a decent amount of Fuel. With all the perks you produce 9/18(superduper) fuel per bundle. Its not to bad but requires a lot of Oil. 
---
Its true some weapons break way WAY to fast. Basically all energy weapons, flamers, cryolaters and dragons.... however they are kind of endgame weapons in the sense you want to stock up on resources for the Queen fight and use all those low durability weapons then. Theres a lot of a weapon bench beside the queen (or my house), where you can just repair, kill and repeat. 
---
Report this. I bet they’ll elevate your ticket faster than ever before
---
I believe as of right now there is only one mod for the super sledge anyone wanna conform that?
---
Going back to Fallout 4 after 76 is a revelation. 4 the weapons are designed to be fun and effective. The entire balancing of 76 was done to nerf EVERYTHING.
---
8 hour. Tut
---
Is the mask you found the skeleton one with antlers? 
---
Perforating is the highest Armor Piercing. 
---
Have the merchant use exclusive sunset sasparilla blue star bottle caps. Only from selling him legendaries, his sale prices are similar to base. But he only deals in blue stars for purchases. 
---
He would also buy other junk.. but those yield normal caps. (Does not take normal caps for legendaries he sells)
---
Okay, lego kiddy 😂
---
Yes sir 
---
Three nights ago, was farming nuked Whitesprings, and started running in to invincible glowing ghouls. My brother could damage them though, so appears to be a player issue rather than the mobs perhaps.

You can't win them all. And you have no idea what he was using and or doing. Sounds like you lost. 
---
Hover over a workshop to see what resources are displayed and can be retrieve with a resource collector that you have to build on the workshop itself. 
---
I get that, but a major role in the fallout franchise is buying and selling. I'm buying. 
---
I tried using them for long range with my melee build and ended up scrapping them since the voice of set 22 was more effective. 
---
Please do
---
I broke my combat shotgun on the Queen and the game allowed me to still use it. I think I got hit by an enemy that staggered me at the same time it broke
---
Fair points. I just wish miniguns and flamers were a bit more viable for average play
---
I do this too. Waiving and jumping, the old classics of gaming. 
---
Fantastic! Thanks!
---
I have a quad double barrel shotgun. 4 shots instead of 2 cripples most anything even when they are 10 lvls over me. 
---
Mostly use it when i get swarmed by bugs
---
Weird. My only negative experience was when I was on level 7. Some level 5 tried to kill me. :) 
---
Since then I was saved a couple of times, got plenty of ammo and plans.   
---
What works for me: always starting with a "hello". 
---
If they are waving back then I drop some of my already known plans. 
---
9 out of 10 times I either got new plans in return or some other item. Sometimes just a heart, but that is okay too. 
---
Once when I was wanted (level 23) a guy (level 127) came and killed me in the fire station. Then crafted a full set of metal armor for me. :)
---
People are just nice in general. :) 
---
 Any good game will reward being crouched when you shoot as IRL that makes quite a differences.
---
 Stalker my favorite, punishes standing shots with unsteadiness, and has 2 levels of crouch one of which is lying down. .The lying down shots are very steady with the crouched only shots slightly less so.
---
 Hits are hits but aiming should change quite a bit.
---
I get that, but a major role in the fallout franchise is buying and selling. I'm buying.
---
You can buy 100 fuel at vendors for 200 caps. 
---
With all the perks its 9 fuel and 18 with super duper. Not too bad. 
---
I think those are just players that don't have a mic plugged in. I've seen it too, and I think I've seen it on myself since I don't usually use mine. 
---
Nothing says badass like power armor and a broadsider. 
---
Dont think so but think it does that when they in a party.
---
*respectfully nods* I will keep that in mind
---
*Maintains steely eye contact*
---
I swear it.
---
You blew it
---
God bless you I’m always low on aluminum lol
---
 Really? I have played all the 3D games a lot and never bought a gun.
---
Jup got the same issue yesterday. And my adrenaline reaction is also still broken... 
---
would 20clip be viable to kill players and npc though? feel like i would run out of bullets fast idk
---
Yea, I have a Mutant's explosive tesla shotgun and it is amazing for close range destruction.
---
I agree, but not really great unless you electrify it. Kill gutsys to find the plans
---
Come on...
---
I'm antisocial any log off anytime another player waives. (oh, he saw me..........)
---
Well some hours ago i trashed one of those turrets camps,  It was so funny tbh .  I know people will judge this, but i think its really disturbing when i am doing a ghoul run, looking for legendaries (because thats all i can do in this game atm until new content is out) and some person just places his turret base directly behind the whitesprings golf club. I am like "where the hell are all the ghouls?". And then u hear it..  A bunch of freaking turrets firing.. . I went to the back and   I notice  this ugly turrets base. (like seriously?  A stairs, 3 or 4 floor pieces, some small generators and a bunch of turrets..  No walls, no creativity, nothing, not even  some nice plants...like seriously let your inspiration go wild!!! If u wanna make a turretbase, make it at least look cool)
---
So anyways, i jumped on the roof of the golfclub and start shooting turrets  (i should had taken a fatman with me... Dammit..) which gave me a wanted lvl 5 or something. I jumped down and i see this player running towards me with some melee weapon. I forgot to reload and   He  managed to  kill me with a sledgehammer .  I lost my wanted lvl and some caps but hey!! ..  No problem! So i respawned, jumped on the roof of the golfclub and started shooting on his turrets again. And i didnt get  any wanted lvl. (i guess its because pvp is engaged?) the owner comes looking for me. I start shooting him from above and he runs quickly inside the golfclub  building. So i wait on the roof and wait.... I get a bit bored and start shooting his generators and everything else that could  be destroyed. He comes out again, he notices me and runs back inside while  fired some shots... but hes not dead yet. Then i was like ohwell... I jump down on the tenniscourt and aim towards the door and shoot... 
---
Ohyeah baby i got him.. And caps, and loot... I teabagged his corpse and then he left the server.. 
---
LOL. I have one extra and I would not sell it that cheap. 
---
Are you on Xbox? And what lvl? I can make you one and you can try it out before buying the plan?
---
There is some holotapes in Morgantown. I believe they are called the history of and there are multiple parts
---
Forgot to mention I’m currently at Harper’s ferry vendor
---
Oh.  Well, time to stop tracking *that* quest.  '-'
---
Shame your x-box, I've got 3 of them (ps4)
---
Where are you looking for them? I found all those at the antiques shop near watoga
---
Teslas  are pretty popular in nuke zones and whitesprings runs. I always see a few players rocking them to great effect. I kind of regret seeking all of mine now.
---
Do you have the mats to craft a few.
---
Do you have a legendary one. ?
---
Do you have high perception ?
---
If yes then go for it.
---
Are you using a bloodied weapon?
---
Unfortunately, the best normal armor surpasses the best oower armor so much that the PA badass effect is severely suppressed :(
---
Try saying that again with the heavy weapons in 4. The minigun especially is one of the worst weapons in the game due to its pitifully low DPH and bonkers cone when moving.
---
[Try this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1e618bf&amp;d=p02pd2pk2pp2pl1ic4ld2lr2l12lv2a72a32a03a40ce0l71eu0la0ir2sg0eo0ee2&amp;w=&amp;n=) 
---
Lookout for legendaries with “bloodied” and “unyielding”
---
Eagle Eye mutation is a must, keep health around 20% 
---
Nope its anti armor 
---
Thats how my melee build was born. Mom gear was not my dude snipers cuppa and so i rolled a saucy red head for that sweet sweet sneak bonus.
---
Now i play melee almost entirely as its so over powered with my bloodied rocket sledge.
---
Lovely nuke textures...
---
I've only run into one other with one. That's interesting. Probably should have kept mine, but oh well.
---
I see no upside for Bethesda there. Player concurrency shouldn't make a difference, as they're still going to pack the same players per server instance more or less, and whether the game is doing well or not, any extra info is just giving ammo to the haters. 
---
This is so awesome! and hilarious! Earned a follow!
---
Thats important info! I will include that when submiting a ticket
---
Maybe better to show pictures. So the first one is the one i always find in the mine and museum basement. Im looking for the other 2. Hood and headpiece https://imgur.com/a/DjswHuI
---
 Its about 5 events a level. If I want one I will bang a few off. I don't care much but sometimes I want a level to move a Spec or try another card.
---
Its also non-refundable
---
for bear arms it should now, for the damage perks no
---
it took like 9 attempts for me but i was able to launch a nuke at lvl 49-50, it just takes a good crowd control weapon and alot of aid items
---
Yes, though it's not very effective. Ammunition is extremely heavy, damage is low, and it's outclassed by basically any TSE Weapon.
---
Wont lie. I used one on my sniper build well on past 50 untill i finally got a legendary rifle. 
---
Silenced and piercing are super handy
---
Yes but im looking for the head piece variants https://imgur.com/a/DjswHuI
---
I have never seen those before. Now I have to go find them. Sorry I didn’t know there were two others 
---
Lol yes i have been trying to find them with no luck. Let me know if you find the location
---
I’m just trying to create some diversity when playing, tired of tse. Plus I’ve got a 16 shot one so why not
---
Pipe revolvers dont have legendary drops?
---
*tips fedora*

Sorry fell asleep

Didiznutz 
---
Oh you bet. I’m not going to sleep until I FIND THEM. I’ll let you know lol 
---
Ok, I’m going to buy it. I suppose I can grind caps later on.
---
16 shot?
---
What are you all using aluminum for that you are running low on it? I don't recall ever needing it...
---
Three star Power Fist with extra swing speed, strength bonus and damage to low health enemies. Super useful for clearing whitesprings quickly.  For boss enemies I have another 3 star Power Fist with extra power attack damage, less damage taken while power attacking and more damage to low health enemies.
---
not that i have ever seen, i havent seen one on here or the market subs since launch
---
get out of the power armour when  its near then use the station
---
What defines "out of combat" anyway?  Are these things broken for the same reason the \[Caution\] state is?
---
I mean, music and fast travel seem to be operating on a completely different definition of combat.
---
That’s correct. Quad legendary effect + quad barrel
---
I've spent maybe 2 hours total at whitespring, and I finished the quest. Random?!
---
&gt;This quest is made by satan
---
I'll admit it, I laughed. 
---
Ok, that’s crazy. 
---
Moms gear will hold you with upgrades to 55ish. Past that it gets weak in the knees. 
---
I have a ghouls grognaks axe that i use for makin rounds in whitesprings. At lvl 35 im takin down the 68s that spawn. 
---
Also a bloodied rocketsledge for the pesky deathclaws. 
---
If you get out of it relatively close to it once you open the crafting menu in the PA Station it’ll just snap into the station. It can be like 10 feet away and it’ll still dock when you open the menu. 
---
I would help more but you're post is kinda vague. Booze? Chems? mutations? perks? str? addictions?, alot to ask.
---
Mine is similar to yours
---
Most are broken, pretty much given up now. Ironic since they pushed up all the prices and then broken the stash boxes, completely incompetent developers from this point of view.
---
Going to be making a ton of top hats, found the plan at Prickett's fort, they sell for 32-39 caps a pop and only cost 1 cloth to make and I usually have so much cloth I don't know what to do with it. Also each alt character gets a run at the 200 caps per vendor, so if you wanted, you could probably make a lot of caps just doing vendor runs and collecting cloth.
---
He’s seen some shit. 
---
You can also select it from your inventory and place it into the station 
---
OP = original poster. So you :)
---
I don't think so. It stores the vegetables if you remove the mat. After moving my camp several times with the indoor garden intact, I had a disaster last night, so I have to rebuild. Apparently a neon letter wireframe clipped to a light post, so the entire structure couldn't be placed 🙁
---
OP=original poster. Ah ok so actual note keeping on the map, would be neat to have that much detailing in the map but might be a bit rough of consoles having to tyoe with the contoller.
---
How? The assaultrons and col gutsy are so fucking strong how is possible to only need five stimpacks?
---
OwO
---
I know it’s been 89 days since this post, but it’s the most recent one I can find. Could I possibly buy one?
---
This is a quality idea and I think it would be as simple as having an additional currency icon, but I have a feeling they have not done anything like that. It is like 9 days till the launch of the expansion and I would think they would have said something about how things are going to work so I am just trying to get some viability on something that will become a huge issue if on day one we have guys running around in perfectly tailored legendary items from The Purveyor because they were able to turn in unlimited duped legendary's.  
---
Place the Power Armor near the station and then use the station.  The Power Armor will snap into it.
---
Note that you can't leave it like that, on display.  It will be recalled to your inventory eventually.
---
Yeah sometimes it is like  creatures are looking for you.
---
First 2 scorchbeasts meanwhile supermutants join the fight while wolfs are biting your ankles and then bethesda that disconnects you from the server.. 
---
Same!
---
What if they don't have any? Why must they have to be screwed over from playing the game because Bethesda decided to ignore disabled players? Other online games have options that can be used to help disabled people. Bethesda needs to fix the fact they have scewed over so many disabled players by not offering any type of help in regards to disabled people.
---
It's really really good dps and the tank killer perk works on it letting you stagger enemies.  However the friendly fire perk does not work with it :(
---
I can clear ws golf house by staying at the front door and bottlenecking all the ghouls there.
---
I haven't played much recently (game aside, I've been busy moving) but my boyfriend liked to tease me jokingly about me never just dropping stuff but always trying to find some lower level players to give stuff to.
---
Freaked some out once though. Spawned to them and the group of them like scattered around me and weapons drawn... I waved, dropped stuff, and backed up. After a moment they swarmed to it and picked it all up. Then waved.
---
I got bored and went go do something else though. They were playing together so probably a group of friends. I'm kinda a loner anyway. Which is silly cause I always lament not finding people with a mic to talk to lol
---
I've launched a couple by myself. Add me if you want : alexander8812
---
You are definitely wrong. Have you ever even played any of the games you mentioned?
---
Healing factor has been bugged a long time 😤 
---
I asked the same thing in the discord and someone said to wait until March 12th for the next update.
---
Love my 3 star multi purpose axe. 40% more power attack damage, +30% damage to super mutants and 90% reduced weight. Makes West Tek runs a cake walk
---
Great to hear! 
---
My character was taking a nap in In my Camp and when I got up there was a level 80 or so using my crafting stuff - which I had no issue with. I am as however waiting to see whether the interaction was going to turn negative.
---
Instead he dropped a bag of extra ammo in the room and I thanked him and we went our separate ways. It was the first interaction I have had with someone gifting anything and I am level 22.
---
I am always cautious based on what I have read but at the end of the day my interactions have only been positive so far. 
---
I feel this so bad. A flamer was my first three star legendary (also happened to be my first flamer). I was pumped for it, but got bummed out once I realized the step cost of making the fuel. It's been sitting in my stash ever since in the hope they make the fuel easier to make...
---
You get it around 58
---
If you see a high level player trying to get your attention with heart n follow me emotes standing near a paper bag they are most likely trying to give you a gift. Also you should look up information on the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. perk system when choosing your weapon type so you don’t waste perk points on unnecessary cards. Most importantly just walk around n explore the forest, ash heap n toxic valley before the savage divide, bog n mire. Train stations have maps with push pins hovering the crosshairs over the pin n tapping the interact button will reveal a location on your map. Lookout towers also will allow you to survey the area around you.
---
He should only accept drops after the dlc release
---
I just got the .50 cal receiver yesterday and after seeing that it doesn’t do more damage than the .308 receiver I was quite disappointed. I’m not sure why they degraded the .50 cal like that.
---
Take a bath you filthy vault dweller. Damn bo is deadly.
---
Oh yeah whats coming on March 12th?
---
I would love this for placing down markers at good looking camp sites to help out new players with.
---
Cool, I've added you. I'm online tonight if you're keen to give it a bash.
---
I love being in a server with just my friends.  Private servers needed to be a thing yesterday.
---
I have no idea lol. I was planning on looking up a YouTube video later today to see. Of course you don't have to wait and can always play.
---
ahhh and true 
---
3.50
---
Damn, I gotta look for that plan then, considering my mule acct has 1000 cloth
---
Ok. When a low level entered the area and triggered the spawn but didn't kill any of them.

---
Word. I'll hit you up when I'm able to get online this evening. Hopefully some more people will join our cause! I'll repost when I get back home later on too.
---
Dead people don't need loot.
---
It unlocks at 45. You don’t automatically get the perk cards when you unlock them but you can select them instead of upgrading an existing perk. I’m lvl 150 and I still don’t have all the cards
---
So what about the one where you get effects with heavy weapons + power armor?
---
Not sure if it was ever fixed but the inspirational perk card would work even if you were on a team with a guy on a different server so that is 15% exp and that would bump your level to the 260's and then if you were using a 5-10% exp boost food item as well then you would be in the like 280's, but it is more likely that others were doing that and grinding Whitesprings more often than you before the exp gained from level 62 ghouls was nerfed. 
---
I could! Im not level 100 yet but i could help hell ive done a silo solo already its easy though i do believe that its easier solo than with a team because there are fewer robots but id love to play with ya!
---
God been after that for ever want to be a walking sam site
---
Perk Card Loadouts.
---
So instead of switching off a level 3 perk for 3 picklock perks I just switch to a picklock loadout.
---
Same for ammo smith with super duper.  A crafting loadout.  A science loadout.  Hacker loadout.  Then combat loadout for solo and team play.
---
We NEED perk card loadouts, there's too many to switch out on the fly in a battle.
---
In other words, don’t die. 👍🏻
---
If they are physically incapable of doing a simple activity in the game I doubt they are all alone with no friends or family members. 
---
Alot less active then it use to be at launch (pc) but still enough to have a decent amount of encounters. Depending on how far you made it I would consider waiting for new content. Most all updates so far have been bug fixes.
---
Yeah, they removed them from the loot drop table. People that have one though still have it. So OP could buy one from someone.
---
Lmfao
---
Some of us don't peruse reddit a whole bunch, OP shouldn't have to be sorry for not being born with this knowledge.
---
Deathgod905 Psn. We do nukes sometimes. 
---
They are thinking that playing a spreadsheet is fun.
---
The question I have is what the fuck is this balanced against? Where is the amazing aspect of these nerfed weapons that everything else about them has to suck so hard?
---
Dude, I can't wait until they fix energy weapons. This 2shot explosive laser weapon will be a beast.
---
Yeah definitely, it would be good! I'm in the UK by the way so Ill only be on for next 4ish hours maybe. 
---
Hot Rod Pink painted Liberators 
---
Thanks... idea's still not setting the world on fire, but dammit, I like it.  ;\^)
---
You hit the nail on the head tho' - any "good" system for this shouldn't require additional actions for the best outcome.
---
If I decide to fix a weapon, I'm good with needing to find a workbench. It's a reasonable, real-world analog, it ensures that I can't perform such actions whenever I want or in combat and it improves the quality of exploration. So, if I decide to fix a weapon, I need to get to a bench. Fine.
---
But - and this, I think, is the key problem with this system - after getting to the bench I may either be 1) unable to fix the weapon without shuffling perks or 2) not get the optimal outcome without shuffling perks. Whether this is a "manual" effort as it is today, or a streamlined deck selection it *shouldn't be needed at all.*
---
I've already made the decision to fix the gun and I met the requirement for doing so by finding the bench. I shouldn't have to respec my skills (skills I've earned) for the best outcome.
---
We've not even gotten into weeds concerning non-perk buffs where, AFTER I respec my perks, I need to go to another area and decide if I want to take drugs or read a magazine to buff the action even further (in Skyrim both apparel and consumables could affect crafting which got even crazier...).
---
Basically Bethesda's systems are so complex that you're almost guaranteed sub-optimal results unless you spend WAY more time than you have to preparing for simple actions.
---
They are incapable of doing the agility course due to arthritis of the hands. Not something that will make it impossible to care for themselves,  but definitely make using a mouse for fine controls like that required impossible.
---
What about us legit players that have our stash full of 2 and 3 star light weight legendaries that have been saving them since the announcement of the new system?
---
Yep, if someone has been there before you you're out of luck. I find lots in the machines. 
---
I kinda like the duplicates, and see why they did it that way (more customization options) but honestly some perks should be sellable/tradeable for other perks or scrapable for xp or something.
---
I was only level 30 at 100 hours ..but once I got a hazmat suit leveling started coming extremely fast..my alt leveled up at an exponential rate since he got the hazmat suit as early as possible
---
Here we go, legend of the waste reveales himself finally. Never used a stimpak to I'm guessing... Killed a deathclaw with your Bear hands I bet. 
---
I find BoS lab coats all the time and receive them all the time for turning in technical data. So I'd say the lab coat would be worth a few hundred caps. Dont expect to get much for one if trying to sell. The med goggles I would say are a little more rare than the lab coat but still somewhat easy to obtain. I'd say you could maybe get up to 500 caps for the med goggles.

It’s better than b luck

Well it was about that time that I realized he wasn’t no bartender, he was just a waterborne lizard from the Jurassic era!
---
To bypass the reactor. One level 3 lock, one level three terminal and skip the reactor entirely. Also another door you can unlock that makes a shortcut to get back in, in case you bluescreen or dc.
---
Neither essential but both useful.
---
I’m doing a full respec of my character for it lol
---
What system you on?
---
There is one very specific, strong, viable laser build: centrated fire + automatic + vat crit pistol. But it's only viable more because of vat and concentrated fire. 
---
Laser pistols have separated superior crit capacitor. On things like 10mm there is only improved crit. 10mm has anti armor but laser crit stacks harder with perks and such and most of the times do just as much if not more damage when crit. 
---
If you want automatic crit pistol build, laser pistol is the best, in my experience. 
---
That sounds hella impractical, but also, hella fun. Best of luck to you, good sir! 
---
I've had the same perks for months today and I'm not using any chems no addictions nothing 
---
It's your Luck special stat, it determines conditions of found equipment.  Didn't think 2 luck would spawn so many broken weapons though, sounds like rng is being mean :(
---
Some of the buttons can't be reached unless you do the obstacle.
---
Keeps going up and is staying up? If it goes back down then what is its starting damage and were does it end? Also look at your perk cards and armor perks to see if anything adds strength like solar powered under endurance, nerd rage under intelligence, or the armor perk unyielding that adds 3+ to all stats at low levels of hp. 
---
The soda shop's tucked away in a little corner away from the other vendors, it took me awhile before I stumbled upon it.  Actually I didn't stumble upon it directly, I was running around and noticed a sign that said "Soda Shop" with an arrow and was like "what the what?". Bubbles has a few variants of Nuka that you can't find anywhere else, which are cool but aren't really game changing especially since they are so rare.  I wish she had recipes to craft some.  But I didn't know that Nuka Dark was affected by both perks, so depending on your build it might be worthwhile to check it out.
---
Im ok with players taking my dropped junk when I die.
---
Want a quad quad faster fire rate weightless is the dream
---
\+Karma
---
Life had the same persk as always I had to get off and when I got back on it didnt work but it went up to 1k
---
Well these would be ones where I was first in the area because it spawned my item sets. And I think it would be statistically impossible for someone to zone in while I’m still loading and grab them on EVERY one. What platform?
---
You know, it's a valid question in light of the things you *do* get Wanted for, but that's just how the game was made.
---
I don't think Wanted is the right answer, but I think the victim has the right to know *who* stole the bag.  Not simply "Your bag has been stolen."
---
If you get a decent auto grenade launcher, I'd suggest trying it out as well/instead. Ammo is lighter, and tends to pack more punch than the missile launcher.
---
None are approved/supported. So far nobody has been banned for using any though, so technically they are all allowed.
---
I can certainly see the utility in having duplicates, but yeah, we need a way to get rid of the ones we don't want.
---
I agree, give the death bag a few minute cool down timer where taking from it is a hostile act against the player that died.  If they don't make it back in time it's fair game to be taken by another.
---
Yeah it’s been weeks since I’ve seen a machine stocked. And I know I’m spawning everything in. Weird
---
All the colors!!!
---
Try shooting the floor near the enemy.
---
Read my post lol
---
I found one at appalachian antiques 
---
The vendor in Grafton the one in the train station, but the leaver action has poor range so idk why you want to make a sniper build out of it. I use mine for a vats sniper build and it is extremely accurate in vats and deals loads of damage
---
I also hope it’s 1 for 1 in quality of legendary. None of that 1* for a 3*. We already have inflated items as is. 
---
Out of combat is hidden
---
 Well I do sell them, they pile up. 
---
 Killed 4 high level Gulpers with my Combat Knife. Used one after that. Maybe I should try an unarmed build, but I just love my daggers. I have not yet, but I'm pretty sure I can kill a Deathclaw with my daggers. ;)
---
I consider it more of a bug of the sneak/caution system than an issue with the mutation itself, but it is really frustrating, especially since it cuts stimpack effectiveness. I hadn't really been using Class Freak, because it was simple enough to usually duck out of dangerous situations for a bit, but it seems to really vary from server to server, how bad the 'sneak' bug is. 
---
The ammo "weights" because you don't have a perk for it. Ballistic ammo weights considerably too if you don't have a perk.
---
that one i havent tested, normally i only have that perk on for sbq
---
Currently my eagle eye is bugged, it doesn’t show up on my mutation lists even though I do have it. When i take rad x it’s shows up as suppressed but after that wears off it’s gone again.
---
It's really not impossible to do it alone if you have the right setup. Level 45 might be a little too low to get the ideal setup to do it alone. I just helped a couple lower level players last night launch one. It was good fun. Send me a message if you're still looking for people to help you. 
---
Yeah rn it’s just quad quad, the fire rate isn’t bad but it works
---
International coalition man. If not today we'll make it happen soon.
---
I’ll see if these are working on Xbox, thanks
---
I used to use it, it breaks on 2 runs through whitesprings 
---
And some people , GASP, run with only the solo card in charisma, so would lose dr and ap regen by accepting.
---
I think this is the most common scenario.  If you don’t have a regular group, why would you pick the other charisma cards?  It’s just lose lose most of the time for the other guys.
---
Not always about you...
---
The soldiers certificate you get for completing basic training is tradable/droppable. I am at work right now but when I get on tonight (9 hrs or so) I can do the quest on an alt and give you the certificate and see if that works for you. 
---
My game name is the same as my reddit if you want to friend me if you can't find someone to help you before I get on tonight.
---
They are effective agants super mutants. As long as you have right legendary effects.
---
Thats the risk when u die. It doesnt bothers me tbh
---
Drop it near the power armor station, then use the station.
---
Cant you? I thought the factory outputted random Nuka cola if you had it
---
&gt;They are incapable of doing the agility course due to arthritis of the hands. Not something that will make it impossible to care for themselves,  but definitely make using a mouse for fine controls like that required impossible.
---
Then nothing stops them from having a friend or family member assist them. Or buying a controller and using that instead of mouse and keyboard if that set up is to much for their arthritis. 
---
&gt; Once again, you are missing the point  
---
I have not missed anything you are engaging in a what if argument based on nothing but what ever bullshit you want to pull out of your ass to support your argument. 
---
If I had a quad quad missile launcher I'd want to name it something cool, it sounds like one of those special named weapons like the Bunker Buster.
---
Only I'd probably call it...  The Missile Spammer lol.
---
They were balancing everything to only be good with buffs they were gonna sell in the atom shop until everyone flipped out about it being p2w. Just look back at the lunchbox loot crate shit they had in the game files at the beginning that people found and flipped out over.
---
This game was nothing but a cash grab and test to see how much the consumers would put up with.
---
It would fun when you get the 'collect your dropped loot' and the quest mark is linked to the person that took it. 
---
I don’t think anyone knows. I didn’t do it for that challenge 
---
Nice! I've been playing on and off all weekend and this is the first nuke I've seen....
---
i never said radsponge is needed, but its a useful tool for the lockpick/hacking step. obv there are other ways of dealing with radiation.  i didnt think i needed to be that detailed about every single possible way a player or team can deal with radiation.  i just pointed out the things that make it easier for a team.  whats the point of responding that way if you aren't even going to detail your alternative?  
---
Now that is actually a good idea.  "Player  X took your dropped junk"  That wouldn't be too hard to implement I think. 
---
There is something strange going on. My Luck stat is 12, meaning I should never find broken Weapons when looting, but last 2 days, I've been finding them occasionally.
---
My thought was this: if you die to a mob or environmental destruction your bag goes on a 5 min grace period. If you die to player griefing you die them killing you with continued slap damage then you keep your loot however if you die due to pvp your loot is fair game. 
---
Hehe Rainbow Liberators , im in !! :)
---
My friend has the same issue. I put it on a character that's never had it before and it works. I hope they fix it. This game swear they have no beta testers. Like it won't even save 2 of the same type of guns in favorites anymore. Anyone who plays would notice that right away.
---
Actually you only can have 25k caps 
---
Yikes, I think I bought mine for 1400.
---
If only they had plans to craft plans, I'd sell you a plan for 500 caps if I had one.
---
With the perk set I’ve got going it should do 127% more damage
---
I'm gonna find you all after death and steal your bags of wood scraps and beer bottles. 
---
Power rangers liberators new season. 
---
I know about luck vs condition but for 33 levels found maybe a handful of broken. Now i haven't found a single non broken weapon in maybe 8 hours of play. 100+ weapons all broke. Definitely not just bad luck. 
---
want a cookie? 
---
Make sure it’s “placed” and not dropped, dropping will make it a neutral item. 
---
That’s weird, not entirely sure why that would happen. If it’s your only serum, you could get rid of it and try to pick it up again by getting rads
---
This quest is literally the worst. They should add waypoints over the golfers head or something.
---
Sure? I got one for my alt char aswell, which ain't got a mutation at all. It showed like intended during the 40min or so incubation time, but an hour later it showed only -hp
---
I think Energy weapons arent that strong tbh but i never made a build for energy weapons.. 
---
So do you have 1 to sell? Or are you just here to blow your own trumpet? 
---
I don't think so. I can't unlock it, as it is not among the unlockable cards. I know that you can select new cards to own them, but this one is a no show. 
---
TSE doesn’t have the knockback the missile has. 
---
I understand that what I am proposing will kinda shaft you and I am sorry, but this game really needs a change that will completely reset the gear and currency economy. Also the prospect that the people that stayed playing and the dupers will not have an advantage on day one will bring back more players than will be mad.
---
For the past week I have also been collecting light weight weapons and modified armor to be ultra light so I could carry a bunch, but the bigger hoarder having the best gear is not how you bring players back to a game. Resetting the economy is how you bring games back to life. 
---
Unsocial. Anti social is like a person you stabs someone, or wants to commit violence 
---
I use a flamer and dont see all the fuss. Ammo creation could use a buff to like 15 fuel. 
---
Please bgs, don't make another currency. We got caps and atoms; don't make this one of Those games. Also, please don't make him one of these server hop till he appears wandering vendors. They're fun but not as helpful. 
---
As long as we have to trade in a few items to get one new, it should be fine. 
---
And I don't see the big deal about the legendary economy. Even with the market flooded with duped versions of it, the Tse shotgun was (and still is) going for trade only. 
---
i think it took me about 50 tbh with no scrapper perk. what does scrapper do agian?
---
How do you open the gate/door? I've had to jump over there with marsupine.
---
Also whats so great about aluminium, I've bulked it and sold to vendors. I have very little use for it myself.
---
Where was this? I need this info please 🙏
---
Slap on the hard bargin perk first 
---
Complete the Organic Solution quest line from Ella Ames bunker in The Mire region. It's a unique that only weighs 6lbs
---
Survival Mode Players hub is Adventure mode.
---
Using the station after dropping it, and it will no longer be neutral
---
It kind of depends why you stopped playing. If it was because of bugs, the stash limit, performance issues, etc., then maybe! Depending on your setup, some things have been fixed. I'm on PS4, and the game has always been pretty stable for me, so I honestly don't know how much of an issue that was for others. 
---
If you weren't sold on the gameplay, well, it is still the same game - I consider it like a B- version of a Fallout game, with the experience elevated at times because of the online aspect. If you have a couple friends playing, or if you're able to make some out in the hills, it's amazing how fun it can be. However, the rest of the time you are in a pretty, but desolate, environment. If you like exploring abandoned places and learning about the people that lived there, it's great, but you're not going to be bonding with companions or making tough moral decisions like in previous games. 
---
It still working on my guy. He's level 42 and has grounded, speed demon, carnivore, and adrenal reaction. I use him for workshops, bloodied sniper rifle. I can check again. My friend has the same issue though, but he already had the mutation. Waiting for them to fix cause he don't want to wipe them and take again.
---
There a few bottles randomly. I expected for a recipe to make home brewed nuka cola there. But it’s still twenty five years after the bombs hit. So plenty of time for scavenging. 
---
Miniguns destroy but require one man army and stabilized. 
---
&gt;Then nothing stops them from having a friend or family member assist them
---
They might not have any that play games. It shouldn't be a requirement to have to rely on someone else to play the game for them because Bethesda chose to not add in options for those with disabilities.
---
&gt;Or buying a controller and using that instead of mouse and keyboard if that set up is to much for their arthritis.
---
You don't know much about arthritis obviously, a controller would be worse for someone with arthritis. The issue is Bethesda doesnt let you map the mouse controls to keyboard buttons.
---
&gt;I have not missed anything you are engaging in a what if argument based on nothing but what ever bullshit you want to pull out of your ass to support your argument.
---
Coming from a person telling somekne with arthritis to use a controller. LOL You are so obviously the only one here pulling shit out of their ass to support Bethesda not including options for disabled people.
---
Why is it you feel it is the disabled persons job to fix the lack of support from Bethesda? When you see people in wheelchairs do you think places shouldn't have to have ramps to get into their stores and the wheelchair bound person should just have family or friends just carry them and their chair up the stairs?
---
Oh I went Whit springs so it was nice no one was there
---
Ok thanks for info.
---
I saw one a few days ago. Quad, two shot and 25% faster reload. 
---
It was about that time I noticed that Girl Scout was seven stories tall!
---
You can’t get a quad and two shot. Those are both main rolls. 
---
Hotly requested. Not in game, unfortunately. 
---
Would you not sell your level 35?
---
The perk doesn't have effect on that and 20 is not a lot. The gun has like more than 20 mods. You are not guaranteed to get a new mod when you scrap.
---
U would like to buy it?
---
With the perks I have and the armor I wear. I get no shake when zoomed. Most enemies my level and lower are 1 shot if I hit them in the "head"
---
All are "allowed" just don't expect any support from Bethesda. Their FAQ states that they may cause buggy and glitchy games but they don't say you aren't allowed to use them. Their Twitter account has even shared screenshots of mods being used.
---
It neeeds a major damage buff and 200 fuel per ammo creation.
---
Still not a lot.
---
Cool. Ill join it on xbox. Whats your gt. I dont play but id like to see how yours is set up
---
If you read the "I have 900 hours in game and got banned" story you will realize that there are people that create additional alts and additional accounts to hoard items and caps. Also if any 3\* item can be turned in on release of the expansion for the same type of credit at the new vendor then people with alt banks full of duped items will have more "currency" than people that have hoarded caps.  
---
Why make it more complex than it need be. 
---
If you die, only you get the marker to where your loot was dropped. If you don't pick it up before anyone else you lose it. Simple an fair. 
---
The world is full of crap, if you lose it then it's no big deal to find it all again
---
Even if they were extremely rare?
---
The corner shop down the street (UK) sells sodas imported from the USA. Nuka Cola was huge in the FO universe. I’m sure there’d be some folks in Appalachia that imported their favourite flavours. 
---
I know the quantum lore is pretty specific as to why that’s a stretch, but the other flavours? There are sampling stations in the Nuka Cola factory. Terminals with recipes for trial flavours. There is so much room for Cola dispersal in the 76 lore, but it’s only sold in Whitesprings. 
---
Again, I understand that Nuka Cola were pretty heavily invested/involved in whitesprings, but still. 
---
Must have been a Xbox bug then. Because I’ve see 3!things now that “aren’t” in game. 1 * pip revolver, 3* wood chest and the fat man. It would explain why the fat man couldnt be purchased 
---
On the contrary. There is next to zero random dying chance on adventure servers. There will never be incentive to go somewhere safe when everywhere is safe. The conditions in which you are at all times cautious and at all times feeling endangered will only be possible on worlds that have no PvP restrictions. Hence it is only there, on survival servers, where players hub can become a thing.
---
Hard bargain lvl 3 and a ton of water purifiers. 
---
Purified Water sells for 4 caps each. Hit each vendor and make 1200 caps per day. Minus some for travel you can hit 10,000 in 7/8 days. 
---
And make it so people that steal your loot when you die become wanted.
---
i dont know how the playstation achievements work but did only count collect caps or does earning caps by vendor selling count too? if its count its easy to come by (1200 caps per day if u have enough scrap/aid to sell) if NOT... the only way is then i think the capstash collecter perks an option but "FAST" is that NOT XD
---
https://imgur.com/a/CMh5X4P
---
When you do get your buzz blade, get weapon artisan perk so you can repair it above 100%. If the condition is above 100, it does a lot more damage. 
---
One of the statistics OP said was "Time in camp"
---
I wouldn't wanna join a server full of people who don't leave their camp, just because I'm a vendor.
---
I can confirm these things don't work as I've spent hours trying to build my own maze
---
I’m imagining the destruction a quad MIRV could do. 
---
Sure
---
Me too. 
---
Atoms are not an in game currency, they are for cosmetics, a reward for grinders or a sink for people with more money than they know what to do with, and so they don't count. The second currency does not have to be something like what you are thinking. Anything with a value can be a currency so they could make legendary's  break down into a new type of material like a new version of steal or anything for that matter so long as it can be stored in your inventory or traded.
---
Grahm has the long pew plans!
---
Got a mic but never get a response. I may just remove all my mutations and start over without the empathy and herd mentality. It's not worth the random chance I get to team up with someone. 
---
I always did it alone, its not that difficult tbh
---
Spend less quick 😅
---
At the risk of getting a “well it’s your fault for taking it then”, I wish people wouldn’t make assumptions about others.
---
I hate pvp, and I play alone a lot. But I take and defend workshops from npcs just for the caps, plans, and xp. I couldn’t care less about mining the resources from them. If you don’t see any extractors, it may be me. I’ve learned to not help other people at close range defending theirs, because they just attack me, so I snipe assist them from a distance and move on. I don’t consider it safe to move in unless they get dropped by npcs. Then I’ll move in and stim them.
---
I’ve learned to never accept random team invites, ever. People just do it to destroy your home. I’ve learned to never accept random trade invites. People do it just to see if your equipment before deciding to try and kill you.
---
Some asshole somewhere is reading this and getting hard, readying a reply of “REEEE IT’S THE APOCALYPSE REEEE GO PLAY ANOTHER GAME”
---
I wish they would just get rid of pvp in adventure mode.
---
Mine's 45.
---
Get the hard bargain perk and start farming food/chems and legendaries in whitespring. E.g. glowing meat steaks/glowing blood sells pretty well and drop a lot. 
---
Yes! Especially hairstyles! I get so excjted by the themes, like one day it was the theme with the Princess Bed and I was like bet so well get a princess dress or something, but no. Just sad stuff thats overprices in atoms. Id pay actual money for things in the shop if they were dope. Im a girl I love customizing in games and literally all I do on Fallout right now is decorate my camp amd other peoples, theres nothing else for me to do I did everything else LOL.
---
Were u asking why I didn't sell my 35?
---
He who lives and runs away lives to run another day.
---
No, we can't. The only copy of the formula is in Bradburton's vault in Bradburton's vault. (yes, I'm aware I said "Bradburton's vault" twice. It's accurate)
---
1. PC (i5 2400 CPU 3.1GHz, 24 GB DDR3 RAM, GTX 1050ti, although I doubt it's really related to the problem...)
---
2. EpicestGamer
---
3. Don't have any, might get some later
---
4. I can't trade with any robots on any character, I can go into their inventory's, see what they're selling, etc, but when I try to sell or buy I get error messages on both, slightly different. When Selling I get a message (for any item, mind you) saying that the item cannot be sold, and when I'm buying I get a message spewing something about weight limits? That's especially strange since I then tried to make sure i wasn't over-encumbered and made sure my stash box wasn't full, but alas, no dice.
---
This started happening after the update where all plans could be found in every bot, I tried to go to Watoga and get the handmade recipes with my main character and it happened, I thought it was some sort of session problem, so I ignored it. I stopped playing for a while after that, and now I've come back and started a new character that, for some reason, has the same problem.
---
I hope this gets fixed soon, as trading with robots is 95% of any trading I do.
---
Yes please
---
No ban - Bethesda settled on $50 refund so I paid $30, which is the current used price. 
---
 You want to buy a knife? No I'm not here to sell. If you look at the first post in this chain, I consider it part of my game to find nice stuff.
---
 It was a general comment about buying stuff in the game, as much as your efforts in this area..
---
To be fair. The legendary merchant won't be out for a while. The first piece is the nukashine portion.
---
It's from them having the in game voice chat disabled in options. I honestly don't know of many who even use that anymore. I think most people on pc are now using the text chat mod so the game has text communication like other games. Especially now that the mod even supports clan channels.
---
There's 7 different vendors.. Responders, Raiders, Whitesprings, Enclave bunker, Harpers Ferry, Watoga train station and Phoenix.. that's 1400 a day you can get. Hard bargin as previously mentioned is a huge help. You can sell the purified water, I get 5 caps each for them or you can grind out Fort Defiance for straight jackets.. I get 50 caps per jacket. 
---
If I think of anything else I'll come edit for you.. hope these help!!
---
I like that, but it should only work within whitespring walls IMO.
---
they carry the plans for bos or just heavy combat amor? I am a bit confused.
---
Are you a stealth build? Because if so, I am too and I just launched a Nike yesterday all stealth. I'm only level 36, but I'd totally be up to doing it with you!
---
Liberty Megazord Prime 
---
 You want the Lever Action Rifle.
---
Make sure you rank up Glow Sights to 3 and carry a support weapon. I have a maxed non Legendary Rifle build and I 2-shot the Bloated Glowing Ones in Nuked Whitespring. Would love an Instigating Hunting Rifle though. Don't get spotted too, my build falls apart without the Stealth Bonus. Could definitely use a buff though. Melee is OP and I appreciate that, but it shouldn't be out performing a bolt action stealth build
---
I don't see the point in having two.
---
Find the top hat plan at Prickett's fort or a plan to make helmets or something and just sell at vendors and make 1200-1400 caps a day. The top hat plan you need 1 cloth and sells for 30-40 caps ..
---
If you accept random team invite, the person that sent it can go to your home and destroy it. Rather than being a social function, it’s used a convenient tool for trolls.
---
Yeah I couldn't get rid of the 35 or even give it away..I never used it..and then last week I got another one (never had a TSE drop) and then yesterday at WS I got a TS black powder rifle ..so it's like I have 3 of them sort of
---
I’m thinking from a recollection POV. Think of a nuke zone. Nothing is more annoying than to die and come back to your bag to only find all your hardened mass and other goodies gone and some jerk took it and left you a toy car. 
---
So about tree fiddy?
---
Still disconnects and freezes for me at least three times per playing session. Not as often as before but still happening 
---
"Will" people be? There don't seem to be enough simultaneous players allowed on servers for a rich story world to be possible through RL humans alone. The game needs human NPCs whether you like it or not. Their absence is a design flaw. Bethesda can either support 100 players per server so that role-playing can create a thriving story world, or they can fill the story roles with human NPCs. Robots are boring.
---
She gave him a dollar!
---
Nice! I'm still too low level to go into a blast zone with much success, but when someone launches a nuke I usually travel to the 98 NAR Regional (just north of Whitespring) to watch it come in. The sound is really fun, too.
---
Is there super mutant behemoth in this game? I haven’t seen one since I been playing.
---
Speed Demon really does help.
---
Maybe you'll be able to sell it when player vending comes along.
---
Senpaiii plz
---
I completed everything in the beta phases of the game, so I had no trouble with these problems... except I didn’t get a full suit of ultracite armor for beating the brotherhood questline, or any other amazing rewards, because they were coded to drop during the beta.
---
Thats why you have multiple weapons. Sniper rifle for long range sniping and then switch to a lever action or handmade for closer in combat when you cant stealth.
---
I will just give it to one of my friends 
---
I'm only Level 25, and I didn't launch it, I just happened to be nearby so I could fast travel and get the shot
---
you won't get banned for having them.  
---
they removed the hunter's hood from the game, but the helmet is still there.
---
Rifle aren’t weak. Make sure you all the rifle man perk at 3 tank killer at 3 and I run tormentor for extra. Also range with rifles is top with the lever action. Yes it’s less base damage than the hunting. But all the others are ok. Combat is good as a DMR and handmade is good as a burst. And ugh the assault is just a small lmg that wants to be a rifle. 
---
If you find an instance of Nukesprings (or post), equip Green Thumb and harvest all of the raw flux you can. They sell for 12c for me. 
---
As others have said, farm Whitesprings for legendaries and craft glowing meat steak.  Water purifiers are great. 
---
I agree with the buff to counter melee 
---
Agreed, it's retarded. I am ok if they kill you and take your loot, but if they don't kill you, they shouldn't even be able to see your bag
---
If you get lucky with that, stay on that server. The way legendary spawns work in this game and legendary drops work if you are the only person on the server you will get legendary item drops like every 3 or 4 kills and nearly all the things you run into will be legendary. I've had 3 star legendary radstags show up because of this exact thing happening.
---
 Pretty much every single mob you spawn ends up legendary because it seems like the legendary numbers go off total on the server, so when you are the only person spawning mobs, all the legendary creatures for the server get spawned around you.
---
Good weapon to save ammo. But agree with you, it's made for sneak build. Try combat shotgun low level, pretty good. A sniper with a short scope and long scope gun is about as cheap a way to level imo. Handmade is much better, has 35 rounds but eats 556. If not grounded, the guass but it has to charge.
---
Ah, the “all people” argument. Gender-flipped twin to “not all people”, both of which are first cousins to “whataboutism”
---
I love stupid, desperate logical fallacy deflections.
---
It's piercing
---
I got disconnected last night after using 400 rounds of 40mm. That's crap isn't cheap to make ya know. 
---
Perforating is 10 ammo per clip.
---
Ok. And?..... 
---
If it was a cheat bethesda's twitter account wouldn't have shared screenshots of it being used. LOL
---
It's the thousands of other people that got let out of that vault stealing all our soda 
---
really? thats crazy guess i will stick to sting.
---
If you want to see what that looks like on our side go on down to r/creepyasterisks
---
The game never ends 
---
I want to have barn quilts and beavers pets. love those ideas.  
---
&gt;There is next to zero random dying chance on adventure servers
---
That is exactly why Adventure Servers are the hub for Survival Mode players and that is why it is not needed in Survival Mode. 
---
I just had a run in with the same twat.
---
Guessing it's a sneak build. You can one shot them with the sneak bonus. 
---
How did you do it?
---
According to a terminal in the nuka cola factory,it has methamphetamines in it too...should it not also be a chem?
---
Level 147. 290 hours.
---
Level 177 with 601 hrs
---
It was awesome... especially for the queen fight which gets a hole lot harder once my lever gun breaks. 
---
i want dogmeat :(
---
Um join me In Nuke
---
Wait theres a pet system?
---
I've joined dozens of randoms from invites, including several today. This has not happened once. 500 hours and I've only had 1 trolling experience.
---
Me too .. :(
---
lmao this .. no way you can die if you cant kill
---
Yep, for me, I have to use my instegating dragon or instegating black powder rifle on assaultrons or deathclaws in sneak to take them down to Chinatown but if that fails, it's 30 shots with the handmade. And that's including using my tse handmade that i just bought off the marketplace. 
---
Fighting level 64 super mutants drains my bullets very quick, it's why I've been maintaining 10k 5.56 for the past week; because I hate having to go scrounging for lead, steel and gunpowder/acid every day.  
---
I've been using the All Rise super sledge in whitesprings to conserve on ammo and that seems to work well.  But yes, I have to agree that a rifle-build is very underpowered even with a bunch of perk cards slated for that build.
---
I'm level 120 with 200 hours but I farm constantly 
---
My Suppressed Hunting rifle keeps saying I'm not high enough level (lvl 30 weapon to my lvl 46) to use on my slot 4. I have to un-favorite and re-favorite it.
---
Pick up and sell shotguns using scattershot, sell straight jackets and golf outfits, gold and silver scrap also sell for 2c a piece with hard bargain level 3. You can make 10k very quickly. 
---
No
---
I have a "two shot flamer" but as far as I can tell it doesn't benefit in any way from 2-shot. Not for the perks or the damage
---
I've been hopping between Huntersville, West Tek, General's Steakhouse, and Harpers Ferry. Do a loop, hop server, repeat. I'm actually doing it for the XP and not the legendaries, but they're dropping like crazy today. Since I made that last post I killed another 4 or 5 within an hour.  
---
At least half of the legendaries were at West Tek, though. 
---
so your saying the clip would only be 10? i think its 20 by default
---
Took you long enough to come up with that one, nobody.
---
Try harder. 
---
Build has a lot to do with it.  The xp nerfs more so.   I used to get between 575 and 700 for a high level glowing ghoul, now it's mid 200s and the odd one that's 375 or so.  When the nerf hit I was around 260 or so.  355 or so now with a bit under 650 played.  If the nerf hadn't hit I'd be well over 400. 
---
Best xp for effort now are the super mutants at west tek, Huntersville, harpers ferry etc. Also the sentry bots at white springs give me over 900 each and they always there because for some reason no one else is killing them. 
---
I always deposit excess stuff in the blue suitcase at train stations.
---
If you ever see someone holding 5 workshops, check watoga station's blue suitcase.  I deposit all my event reward plans I know there.  Once heard a guy go 'holy shit this suitcase has like 40 plans in it!'  I just thumbs up'd him and went to defend another workshop lol.
---
alternative? to WHAT? what radiation are you even talking about???? not a single radaway is used during a silo run.  
---
have you ever been in a silo before?
---
Definitely 10 unless mine is bugged or I have the name mixed-up.
---
YummyFortnut69 
---
No, I run in with melee and power armor and face tank everything
---
Nah
---
Don't drop anything in a laggy server, especially when big events are running.
---
&gt; So that those moments of player interaction are increased a Little 
---
How is this increasing player interactions? Instead of having to wave once in hour to other player, I now get to wave twice in hour. There is no group content, there is no danger from other players, there even no way to properly communicate with each other. There is literally 0 meaningful interaction between players and it is not because there is only 24 players, it is because they made too many compromises to F76 to cater single player audience.
---
I would be more happy with being alone in the server than being with 24 and higher count of players, not because I am running constantly into players and having blast doing spontaneous PVP. Alone I would kill SBQ faster than I would with 8 idiots under performing. Every nuke zone I wouldn't have to worry about someone killing legendary monster, without me getting to be part of killing it.  
---
only takes 2 hits at most to kill them with an instigating pole hook. 
---
You're just a hater 
---
AA rifles don't stagger enemies without Tank Killer.
---
I have 2 friends who have been comm banned by bethesda. 1 for a week and 1 for 2 weeks. They can play the game but can't join a team or party. Pretty fucked if you ask me. All we do is roleplay in the wasteland. Nothing devious or racist or anything. With that said I don't think your situation is the same.
---
I sell straight jackets for caps.  Gotta keep them raiders tied up somehow.
---
10 days of selling purified water to vendors with perk card equipped.
---
Yes. I wholeheartedly agree.
---
This has been hands down the most frustrating glitch in the game IMO. Been around for a month at this point and there has been NO mention and NO word on a fix which is disgusting.
---
I really liked how the flaming pitchfork looked, but I couldn’t handle that the “attack” with it is swinging, not poking. 
---
Can’t use a spear for the same reason. 
---
We can!! Let's do a list on everything that so great!!
---
I'll start:
---
Legendary enimies being track stars...
---
Thank you :) , theres so much potential with it.. Yao Guai bed rugs sound cozy.. 
---
I had the Opossum as a pet but he's permanently lvl one and it's inevitable he dies..
---
So like with Beavers and Cats , Foxes, Opossum - having a level up where we get to pick a few cards from a bunch to give them some attacks and a pet reviver craftable would be really useful.
---
We could also have CHR cards focused on pet bonding.
---
Reading your reply also made me think of Cats/Dogs in Top hats with a Monocle haha Thank you :)
---
We already are in them.
---
Oh I understood the concept, young 'un. I just thought that it was funny that you figured that it was happening here, in the bowels of 76's community.
---
I've been thinking about selling 5.56 ammo on the fallout 76 market on Reddit.  I saw a couple posts where people were willing to pay 1500 caps for 1000 rounds.  Just a thought.  Could spend a few days scavenging for lead, steel and gunpowder/acid waste and crafting ammo.  I usually spend my caps on plans too fast though to have any meaningful stockpile of caps.
---
 I think Stalker hold that crown, but its very good indeed. ;)
---
Not gonna lie, it sounded condescending.  Fo76 has a market.
---
In fact, OP, there's a fallout 76 market and bazaar sub.
---
Just go to: https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/
---
Make a post saying:
---
W: 3* Bloodied Handmade H: Caps and willing to Trade
---
There are many of us that enjoy helping low level players, even if they’re wanted.
---
I don’t need those 2-20 caps I’ll get for taking out a wanted.
---
I honestly enjoy it a lot and is one of my favorite games at the moment and my favorite fallout, close with 3 and NV
---
That’s amazing, it’s like a hall of fame roll for the axe. 
---
Get an executioners with the same minors and flip between them after the first hit, which would be a power attack of course, and the second power attack with the executioners, you’d finish off just about everything! 
---
Thanks for the upvotes...if anyone knows these guys, please let me know!  They stood around for 10 minutes trying to help me, as I screamed uselessly into my mic.  This game REALLY needs text chat or something.  They were inviting me but the game was bugged.  If anyone can help, please do! v
---
Level 276, 600+ hours 
---
 How would that be possible? Don't we need to be told what to do?
---
 Try a balanced build. It will be very rare at least. 
---
I don't understand why they don't just take the Beastmaster mod from Fallout 4 and apply it to 76. They might as well start "borrowing" ideas from the community.
---
It’s just for fun. 
---
What to expect... 
---
(1) Expect to be disconnected often. Not as often as before but often enough to tick you off.
---
(2) Expect for your game to freeze often. More often than before actually and usually happens when you're in the middle of collecting loot or clearing hoards of enemy. 
---
(3) Expect to play alone often. More often than you think. People just want to play alone I guess. After 95 levels, many people just don't like to team up. 
---
(4) Expect to build your SPEACIAL stats all wrong in the beginning. Every time you level up feels like your buying a house. It's a big decision and one you can't change until level 50. So know your perks.
---
(5) Expect to not get any 3 star legendary weapons or armor. If your wanting that two shot legendary, then you will most likely have to buy it. 
---
(6) Expect to not even try to fight the Scorch Beast Queen. It's a waste of resources for minimal reward. That is if the game doesn't crash mid fight. 
---
(7) Expect to be hooked initially. Like you can't stop playing day in and day out. But it does get boring eventually with no one to play with. You can only farm so many mats and areas. 
---
You only have what, a 5-9% chance to stagger? I'd rather just one shot them.
---
It's a mechanism to give dying some type of consequences, since you can just respawn at the nearest discovered location.  It does suck thought when somebody grabs your junk.
---
I lost my mask so no future content for me :(
---
Walked into Federal Disposal Site, had to clear a crowned glowing snallygaster to claim the workshop.  Aimed at it and it killed over, completing the clear event.
---
Not the first time, have also seen entire groups of ghouls all kill over at once.
---
Thanks Grim Reaper, you're looking out for me you loveable pile o' bones with a scythe.
---
Yep, it was from the last update/maintenance where they fixed a bunch of random things, that was one of them. 
---
Dj5150119  (ps4)
---
With Animal friend 3 and Wasteland Whisperer 3, aswell as Pacify you can also Tame creatures only from a random event spawn and you need about 10% spare Camp budget.
---
Its fun they're nice to have... But they will inevitably die.. My Snallygaster just dropped dead once for no evident reason so i assumed he'd ate a manky Tato from my garden,, i didn't feed very well :)
---
They only spawn for low levels. Go when there’s only level 20 something players running around WS and you’ll get it 
---
See your self out 
---
Don't forget some people abused the trap disarm experience bug for awhile before that was fixed.  Though I wonder if they got banned for having too many grenades/fuel/aluminum.
---
No never, just watched some streams on Twitch, I'm just guessing I know, I'll keep quiet :)
---
Happened to me last night. I won't launch any more nukes. Sick of my game freezing. 
---
Yes, I did, that way you can craft a bunch of them to scrap them and learn all the mods.  I had to craft about 40 of them before I finially got the armor piercing magazine mod.
---
Sounds to me like you’re trying to rush your exploring. Stick close the the vault and Flatwoods until around lvl 20 then start moving south into the Ashheap.  
---
Agreed. The hope is that camp decorating will come with an increase to the camp budget, but BGS has yet to say how this will be implemented, so who knows.
---
None of this makes sense. I can only guess you were looming at that players level.
---
That's goes to Diablo 2 Lod. 
---
F76 5.5/10 at best. It has potential but I don't see any indications it will ever be something great. 
---
I think what’s happening Is your loading into an area that has recently had or still has a person in it that killed a bunch of things. Your game loads and says “there are bad guys here, here, and there” game loads up the default models (this is why you used to get t-poses, that was the default) and then starts loading the stats, the stats show the bad guy is dead, and so it then marks them dead and does the death animation to transition. 
---
The only time I’ve seen a mega-sloth outside of a nuke event was in the mire, I loaded in, and it reared back and died on the spot, it was so sad! 
---
We definitely need a much better selection than is on offer at present. I’m holding out until some decent military or survival themed clothing and I flat refuse to buy any more camp objects until I can place what I’ve already paid for. Bring on the camp budget expansion that’ll probably never happen. 
---
I’m also concerned about the new work benches as I’m already at my camp budget limit and I’m sick of deleting objects I’ve spent money on. 
---
It’s gotten better since release. There are still issues, but nothing like at launch 
---
Be careful, another 200 hours and you might be eligible for a ban.
---
yeah, it's frustrating that bethesda's forcing the vast majority of us (by available console player statistics) to interact with the less than 10% of the player base that are griefer sacks of garbage.  
---
Workshops were always on my no go list, but now it's even worse. 
---
yes we can, i agree :) played from first hour of beta, on 2 platforms..  (PC / Xbox)
---
I also find it easier to solo, there is like half the robots vs with a team. Especially with the person I team up with. They are not very good at the game and tend to not be able to hold their own. Lol. I do not turn the turrets off or pick any of the doors. I have like 400+ energy resistance in my power armor so they just tickle a little bit. Nothing a whack from my axe won’t fix. 
---
Read what I replied to, dipshit. 
---
Highly HIGHLY recommend the Plasma Thrower, plasma gun with a flamer barrel mod.  With Tank Killer perk it staggers enemies.
---
Gauss Rifle is a good sniper too but both these weapons have heavy ammo, degrade fast, and the plasma thrower burns through plasma cartridges cause it's got 300 round magazines.
---
Still the plasma thrower is a great dps close range weapon and the gauss is very strong.
---
However gauss rifle in vats is nigh useless and it's reticule is inaccurate so use it in third person.
---
I highly recommend Weapon Artisan for 200% condition for those guns too, and armor piercing mag mods.  And don't overstock ammo, make it as it's needed.
---
Because there is no Anthem single player version that they just took and "Ohh f#cking, lets just threw online behind it and call it a day". 
---
What is Anthem's endgame? Do they also have as bad endgame as F76, where they basically have only 1 monster to kill? 
---
The scorched detection system is related to the radio towers. Upon completion of her quest, you should now see an Event called 'Always Vigilant' that pops up from time to time.
---
That would be fine with me as well.  I have basically maxed my budget building a player hub/trading Post right beside whitespring station so I'd hate to not be able to decorate it more. For example putting whisky bottles on the shelves of the bar.
---
You know, they might open those later.
---
There's plenty to do already.
---
I had to wait until there was no one at all. It seems so many people go to whitesprings and also nuke it that I could never live through the ghoul onslaught.
---
What annoys me is that there will be a ton of low level ghouls, but still a good handful of lv62 charred ghoul bullet sponges. 
---
Ah love the old stalkers.
---
Nuke zones will be impossible on pvp servers, which is the entire endgame currently. So that’s kind of unfortunate. One random with a mini nuke can just run up and wipe the group when the boss is half dead over and over. 
---
“I’m going to Disney world!” -OP probably
---
Doesn't make it okay.
---
yeah i will have to check. i think i can deal with a 20mag, but 10, 10 is too low
---
Hrmmm maybe me possibly I was toying with the idea of starting a new char and rping with it cause my higher lvl all I do is pvp now 
---
I agree even though i was on ps4 and never saw that mod.. I can imagine what involved from the title.
---
 i was watching a video the otherday on Star Wars Galaxies,, they had a whole class for Beast Taming and i thaught that sort of thing would be good in Fallout &amp; i'd been playing Rdr2 and Naming Horse that can (not inevitably but potentially) die makes players care and have investment in the pet.
---
I figure it's only a matter of time before legendaries start coming down in price because new ones keep getting looted every day and are getting dumped back into the game via the fallout marketplace, instead of getting sold to vendors for a measly 20 caps.  I picked up a tse handmade a few days ago for 2k caps and an instegating dragon for 250 caps, was amazed at how cheaply they we're already going for right after the duping ban.  The more time that goes on, the prices will keep comming down to the point that everybody can afford to buy legendaries.  
---
I needed a good laugh. It has potential... But insofar had failed to impress on any level. It's a mediocre survival game, it's a mediocre rpg it's got a mediocre story, it's got mediocre gameplay, it's got mediocre grind, and it's a mediocre Fallout game.
---
No, I want him escorted off the premises.
---
I've encountered a single one, when I was like level 35. I engaged that bastard and killed him. Good thing he ran right past me to thrash the Whitesprings bots...
---
The scope wobble and zoom makes close range accuracy pretty rough :/
---
Well you're welcome to join, if anything we could start right from the moment you leave the vault, if you'd be up for a little idea I have, go ahead and add me!
---
No. Wait till summer when they actually add endgame that got stripped on release.
---
I love being on a server with just a few people. It's a good opportunity to get loot from all the places that are usually heavily trafficked. 
---
Rifleman but depends on the receiver 
---
its receiver based
---
semi auto receivers use rifleman, auto receivers use commando
---
...and even then, it is high chances they will make it as boring and stupid as SBQ is.
---
I really wish the Radium Rifle did the kind of radiation damage that made sense to use against other players. I mean most of it's use is against humans and the radiation literally doesn't get through if your target is wearing power armor. 
---
If they upped the shit out of it all of those materials I used unlocking mods wouldn't have gone to waste =(
---
Wow, 933 gunpowder, must have been a melee build.  
---
Inb4 they nerf the perks now
---
Nothing I read about the lunch boxes when they were discovered definitively siad they would be loot crate style. It was all speculation and everyone freaked out. We do not know what the lunch boxes were going to be. I have not seen anything that has shown Bethesda had any intention of putting p2w stuff in the atom shop. I don’t think even they are stupid enough to pull that shit after they siad there would be no p2w. 
---
I am a completely solo player, and I agree with you.  I hope the"raids" bring this.    I want to play solo then team up when it is needed.  I love the concept, but I would really prefer the pvp elements inside 76 worked like division where only parts if the world where pvp combat zones.
---
Fixed in damage or durability?
---
I think they’re working on a big update, maybe then?
---
You have to a microphone. 
---
Ah. I’m level 20 now, maybe I’m over 20. I’ve never seen them before. I’ll have to go back and check 
---
I'm hopeful that the Survival/Adventure server split will make the game grief-free for PvE players. I get enough grief at work each day. I don't need to come home to it in my games so they will feel just as unfun as RL is, lol. Games should be an escape, not another source of unpleasant experiences. Still, I think, it is fun enough to play now. You just have to be ready to logout on a dime and go play something else if a bored "Raider" comes rolling up to extract their idea of fun at your expense.
---
This is an obvious question, but I thought I'd ask: are you currently "banking" a few levels?
---
Both.
---
Is that the March 12th update, or the other "big" updates planned?
---
The other flavors were also just being revealed with most of them being only available as part of promotions. Whitesprings has em cause nuka cola was a sponsor before the war. 
---
I think the brahmin pen is a good base for a repairable pet system. I could see having to build camp pet stations using cream/cat bowl or dog food/dog bowl, then having to repair those stations with those items to respawn the pet much in the same way you use razorgrain to repair and respawn your camp brahmin.
---
I'd be interested in this. I always give up after 2 hours in the silo.
---
I do pretty well with my laser rifle. Maxed 200% durability.  And just need to change the mods to make it stronger. Uses half a cell per kill. 
---
Idk I think and i agree with the “big” part
---
My Brother And I just started playing, And we notice when we fast travel or go into a building, 50% of the time one of us will go invisible
---
Yea we killed her noticebly faster with it procd
---
I would like to see text chat also. I don't always want to wear my headset. Even if it was local chat, something like in Scum. Emotes don't cut it.
---
Problem with the game in general imo - so many enemy types (go beth) but so many are so seldom encountered/used (boo).
---
You don't need to be good at video games to to the course. Literal 5 year olds have completed it.
---
Quad combat rifle , turn it to .38 receiver equip cards 100 per 38. With a huge clip 
---
My lever action has 109 dmg
---
Cool bro
---
I mean 3 wasted perk points vs a gun with the effect? Ill take the free stats. 
---
I'm on PS4 and my friends and I do nukes somewhat frequently, I highly doubt we'd have a problem with one more tagging along so long as you're nice, plus our group is kinda large so we may have to do two teams if we do it, but that's why we have Pascifist Mode and Party Chat.  If you wanna hang out I'll just warn you we're kinda crazy, we don't go around doing anything to other players, we just do weird shit sometimes, for example jumping off cliffs without power armor and seeing who will survive, or claiming workshops just to build weird structures.
---
Because it's in the lore. All V76 residents chosen from people who lost their ability to speak.
---
You saw the Flatwoods monster.
---
The second is a random encounter that's a Pied Piper of Hamlin easter egg.
---
Until we get an inside the vault previewing updates no idea.
---
So, best chance to get the BOS plans is the BOS trader Phoenix at Watoga or the Monster Mash Event? Can I get the Mosnter Mash event by server hopping or is this also random now?
---
Well my opinion. A lot of it is low levels who haven't seen the end game yet and low iq people who cry about everything probably. It's the bugs that are right in your face like not being able to save the guns you use as favorites because you have the same gun, different stats in the bar.
---
The bulk thing. I mean they had it where it worked but scrapping mods. Now it scraps the bulk. Someone explained it to me in another thread why. And the sbq, she's finally something you would call a end game boss and people who can't figure it out (who knows why) go crazy. The pvp imo is fun, but it's kind of lopsided pvp for people who like to pve only. Workshops have that surprise b feeling, which is funny for the pk but not for the guy who built his bed in front of the workshops bench.
---
That's not even my biggest pet peeve tbh. The green to red laser thing really is lame as fuck (I mean what's the point of having a sweet Chad dick level green laser gun that fires normal incel level red beams?) but what really grinds my gears is the fact that I'm pretty sure NQ laser rifles actually outdamage the Ultracite. I was shopping the other day and no joke, I saw a Laser Rifle for sale at 64 damage. I did a double take because I assumed it was double shot as my Ultracite tops out at 57 with all the perks in the world. Nope, just a regular ass Laser Rifle with Standard Capacitor, Standard Mag, everything. 
---
I should AT LEAST be getting the same damage as a fucking basic bitch laser available all over the wasteland without any upgrades seeing as I've dumped a monstrous amount of materials into unlocking Ultracite mods that are not easy to get en masse. C'mon Bethesda, get your shit together so I can Chad dick stuff more. 
---
Oh and make the fucking Anti Armor laser weapons actually lower Energy resistance instead of Ballistic. 
---
Nope just use one at a time the effect does not stack
---
I have seen that. It’s just a random junk item with that name. I don’t think it actually serves that purpose. 
---
Sure. Added you. IGN: jchamlin
---
THAT'S the Flatwoods monster!? I thought that was Mothman!
---
I just clicked downvote button but it isn't worked.
---
No you dont, and im not sure what you mean by 'half a cell per kill'. The best damage you can get from lasers is by having TSE or bloodied with a beam splitter, and even then it takes more than 1 shot to kill most enemies in the game. But, once you put the splitter on a laser the durability goes to 0 in a few rounds.
---
Anything you can do with that laser rifle, you can do much better with a handmade or combat or anything else. I have pretty much all of the good legendary modifiers for lasers in the game. Instigating, TSE, bloodied, ect., just waiting for the update. None of these compare to ballistic rifles, and they're certainly not viable if you have those other options available. 
---
Yeah that sounds like an effective an easily manageable solution to the Pet revival problem, i dig it!!
---
When i saw Cream for the first time i was hoping to make ice cream from it, it definitely needs to be used with Cats!!
---
Cats could special on AGI too :)
---
I still don’t think thirst and hunger should deplete while in build. So annoying to hear the water droplet sounds and exit out of what you’re doing etc
---
Sure. Added you (assuming you are Spawn3232 in-game). IGN: jchamlin. Add me and we can teach you the Combat Armor Helmet.
---
For the most part I’d say a rad suit but generally until say lev 30 don’t go in a whole lot just stay on the outskirts 
---
If you think stealth rifles are weaker than melee then you are simply doing it wrong.
---
Melee is definitely not as good as people think it is.  It's still probably better than pistols or energy weapons, and it certainly is the best in terms of the amount of skill required versus it's overall effectiveness, so to some degree I understand the appeal. 
---
The thing is, I do think that PvP isn’t essential to the game, but it adds a layer of interest to it. It’s not a constant thing that everyone has to worry about, but it’s there for those who want it. I’d like to every now and then, but I’ve had it happen too often where a player initiates PvP with a pipe weapon or something, then switches to a TSE. Makes PvP very one sided, it’s not fun in its current state. Maybe it’s for the best tho, the most fun I’ve had is while playing cooperatively, and not just with friends, but with strangers.
---
Ok good to know, thanks
---
Found a legendary gulper, it was level 22, I was  level 43 and over encumbered. I couldn’t kill it, i would sneak attack it, it runs away, i walk in that direction, i find it at full health, repeat until killed by a scorch beast
---
Flatwoods monster rush and kill needed for like 2 or 3 atom challenges.
---
Noooo! My GF will probably still hold onto it, along with all the damn teddy bears and what-not. *fingers crossed*
---
hey buddy, is your game/key still working ? I'm thinking about taking the risk buying on instant-gaming ... thanks
---
Avoid them for now. Unless you have a hazmat suit and a good group with rad-sponge you'll just die a lot.
---
Nuke runs are cake. If you can’t solo it your build is most likely the issue. Try to run a build that fits your play style. If you wanna Rambo but can’t land head shots / miss a lot run a melee build. If you like sneaking around then run a max dps rifle stealth build. USE TANK BUSTER. 
---
 Yes absolutely.  The amount to which it outclasses the hunting rifle is fairly substantial. 
---
Never once has this happened to me.
---
Watoga train station does and so do a number of others. Be prepared to pay 1700+ caps though. (Assuming no perks). 
---
Over by the monorail I found 4 cat bowls with empty cream bottles on the ground next to them. I always leave cat bowls behind for the kitties. Sometimes I drop a bag with mirelurk meat or cream nearby just for immersion's sake.
---
Nope. Mothman is literal giant moth.
---
We launched back to back nukes last night, the second process was started with about 15 minutes of life left in the first blast zone. Xbox 1 btw, game installed on a 500gb Samsung Evo SSD.
---
Launch 1 was Alpha to Morgantown. The fauna didnt all change in the area and we ran into 1 legendary the whole time. Good times. Got a great shot standing outside Morgantown just as the mushroom forms. 2/3 of us suffered crashes and had to reload back in the game while the remaining person (me) stood perfectly still, afraid to even open my pipboy until the other 2 returned. I crashed 4 minutes after.....
---
Launch 2, same server, was Bravo to Whitesprings to make up for the complete lack of anything decent at Morgantown. Bravo launch prep glitched, no security came out at the end. It was a long 8ish minute wait for the go-ahead to launch... I crashed out of that bunker just after the reactor fix and it wouldnt even spawn me at Bravo. I had to run from near where the missile comes out of the ground after 3 quick attempts. Post launch I lost all sound except for Xbox Party chat and the damn in game ambient music. 3 of 3 crashed within 7 minutes of touchdown. Managed to get everyone back in though as we crashed. 
---
I just want my own Buddy again, I miss him and his jokes.
---
I’ve got about 6 others 
---
Yeah and melee requires no ammo crafting either.  
---
well there is the happy camper card for that
---
+1 luck, weighs 90% less does not count as armor for chameleon mutation.
---
And has 20% weight reduction for chems food and drink 
---
I know this was posted ages ago but do you know where at mama dolches? I cant seem to find any there
---
3* vampire explosive lever action with 15% faster reload 
---
Skyrim was pretty bad-a but loving my 76 as well.
---
Are you on ps4?
---
I can down most mobs with decent amount of ammo. I have the focused mod on. And I use it to kill non legendary mobs just fine. Not everything needs TSE AAE to be effective. In fact my quad lever can do more than my TSE lever.   
---
Not to mention I’ve kill pretty good with a sniper barrel. So I’m not sure what your on about the damage. If anything the energy Resistance for mobs needs to come down. 
---
I thought about doing a musket build as well. Have a few explosive Dragons on switch, could be devastating. 
---
Depends on play style.
---
Looks like hundreds are buying them via the websites that you tubers promote...
---
I saw one during beta and it looked good. 4 black rifles 3 pistols. And 1 blunderbuss for pvp. 
---
With all that being said. Would you recommend a rifle build?
---
Any level requirement to find them being sold?
---
Chems are on the table with pvp update. Not sure about the adventure mode.
---
You run all rifleman perks maxed out, our just 1 on each card?
---
I said got-DAM you, paleolithic lizard!
---
Congrats. Soon you'll be slaughtering them no problem. 
---
Now i feel like a scruffy NerfHerder for seeing Cat bowls as 2 plastic :P ..
---
Im going to change my ways , you have shown me a brighter path, Lord Mr Pebbles will be pleased ;)
---
I always keep a Mr Pebbles picture up at my Camp!!
---
nice, this really helps. Thank you!
---
But it takes 40+ hits to chunk um down one stim worth of health, not really worth it unless they fought back
---
I am running fallout 76 on a 2012 iMac with 16 gab ram and a 1 go ssd Drive using on boot camp (Windows 10). It runs good, graphics could be better but works for the most part”
---
You need the helmet or prototype hazmat suit to reduce radiation also teaming up with a group that is sharing rad sponge and ghoulish would be amazing 
---
Yes, about 4 of them. I know i can't easily change it after level 50. 
---
Wasn't aware of the Blunderbuss, I'm guessing it doesn't spawn legendary?
---
Here’s my take:
---
Staggering is an action your body takes, not a physics reaction to the force.  That would be a pushback.
---
Last few times I went there, nothing was in the safe
---
It does. I just sold a 3* last night. 
---
Nice, more motivation :)
---
I don’t believe so
---
Okay, so you just went from 'half a cell per kill' to 'a decent amount of ammo per kill'. A laser weapon fully modded with a sniper barrel will not kill a fully scaled enemy of any kind in a few hits. The damage blows compared to ballistic weapons. If you some how found a way to make lasers viable that no one else has managed to discover then please show me. My IGN is Jayk. I'd be happy to see how quickly you can down anything with your laser weapon. 
---
Messenger (from what read) only spawns outfits depending on which region he's in. The heart of the swamp is kind of chunky. I agree be nice to have an event like down in the se where instead of just killing all the scorchbeasts for liver, you can get rewarded for bringing in bones or something.
---
You're dead. It's not yours anymore. 
---
I'd like this, I want a mega sloth but I live near blood bugs, gulpers, fog crawlers, anglers, rad toads, and a mirelurk queen although sometimes a scorchbeast visits me.
---
well now that I know that exists
---
I launched my first and only nuke solo at level 70.  I’m a stealth rifleman build and I didn’t have 
---
much trouble at all killing everything with sneak kills.  Having hacking and picklock at level 3 helps a ton as it lets you by pass a lot especially the whole reactor nonsense.  It also lets you turn the turrets against the robots.  I didn’t use power armor at all during The whole run and I  only died once because I forgot I wasn’t sneaking when I attacked a 40 something assaultron and she gutted me.  If you take your time and research the hacking/picklock shortcuts you can do it solo. 
---
If you're on ps4 I may be able to help you with such individuals.  I have a "business".
---
Damn, really? I hope its not gone the way of feed the people..
---
Oh I see that clears it up! I thought my pipboy was supposed to beep around scorched or something... 
---
While I definately agree with you, Budget exists to prevent lags, thousands of tiny little decorations is def gonna mess FPS and server lag
---
I thought all the girls online were actually guys. cwd's
---
I dont know If you would like it either. 
---
Yes I have a friend in Italy who would love to play but can't afford it, would love to give her a code if you willing.
---
The whole point I’m trying to make is that laser weapons sans the Gatling, plasma aren’t meant to be 2-3 shot kills. The fact that they can dust people/mobs make the point that they are weaker. 
---
&amp; and average cell can hold 27+ plus shots. I used 14ish a kill. Which isn’t that bad all thing considered. 
---
I keep finding Snallygasters frozen to the ground
---
Yup. They are ok. I’m not a shotgun person. But they can hurt. 
---
hmm that's a new one to me?!
---
So I login today. My broken AAE Gatling Laser is still equipped. Still can use it. Fun times continue :) 
---
It depends on what you want out of the Game. If you want to play Fallout and have fun and explore and scavenge then sure, make whatever build you want. I just explore every location and enjoy the Game. My build gives me what I need from the Game.
---
Nuke cola was running a special event at the whitespring when the bombs dropped so that’s probably why they were there.
---
Or cuck
---
You have to be near it
---
Enclave underarmor gives +3 Str so I typically go with that.
---
No npcs. Robots fill the role.
---
There’s a travel time the drone takes to drop. You might be too early
---
Yeah they stopped the safe from refilling. It was never intended to refill. 
---
Tank killer. 
---
I believe your resupply spot bit the dust in one of the last updates. I have seen it mentioned more then once. So I do not think you are alone.
---
Saying that "Fallout 76 is the best game of all time" is to have not played better games in your life, like I didn't hate it I didn't love but I wouldn't ranked fallout 76 that high it was just "meh" to me.   
---
Perfect Dark or Horizon Zero Dawn for me. Just my opinion though.
---
You can use them to collect rare resources, recommend you avoid them since you are so low level. The glowing ones in there can smack you into radioactive paste
---
Probably not. The game lacks the dialogue and skill trees and dialogue tress that make NV so great 
---
Just add me and I’ll be on later tonight (ericrpowell)
---
Smoking pipe crew - pipe weapons double as a bong.
---
I think I might be done with the game, unless they change the workshops back.  This game already had its share of frustrations, but everyone has their limit.  
---
I think Bethesda crossed the line here, at least for me.
---
Gonna be honest, I feel like the reason they're so rare and expensive is because we all know what people will spell out with them.
---
Take drugs, kill with a pipe. 
---
The scrapping in your inventory has been a problem since the last patch. Haven’t heard of the weight issues though
---
That and I believe you actually have to be in the "Circle of Influence" for it to drop, as I believe the supply drops are now singular and noninstanced, they want the owner to get to them first.
---
RP what? PSNid Enterres
---
I think so. Once the owner opens everyone can loot otherwise it’s stealing. 
---
What you guys saying that got a ban?
---
We need a bot ran bank. 
---
Prestige is coming probably addresses this. 1000X posts about it so i downvoted you. Reddit should be for fun please take it to Bethesda official.
---
Nah some of it is crying and they have gotton nothing but harsh criticism seeing this is refreshing 
---
There is a bulking and scraping issue. I bulk as many items that I can then put the bulked items in my stash. The next time I "scrap all" the only things that scraps in what I am carrying. If I want to sell the bulked items. I crab them from the stash and sell or trade.
---
Started about a month-and-a-half ago, and haven't seen any issues yet. Or bugs. I've only been disconnected from the server literally one time.
---
So you can keep bitching, or realize that it's a lot better for other people. You have just been playing too long and maybe you should take a break there buddy. 
---
Every time somebody gets to the end of a game they start whining about it because there's nothing left to do. Just move on.
---
I've had loads on Xbox over the past few days, sounds like you've been unlucky
---
Man, I had that quest done in the first few weeks of the game, I think....
---
I still feel like they should have left them instanced but I guess doing so would have allowed for people to basically just stockpile things if they're with a group of friends(not that a lot of them give anything good, though I have had a fair share of maxed out weapons coming in, usually shotguns or sniper rifles).
---
Speaking of which, do you know where the best drops come from?
---
Oh ok, good to know. Thanks
---
Ughh why am I a magnet for rare and horrible glitch’s.. well it’s good to know it’s not all just me, thanks 
---
I’ve had good luck with the one that cover the whitespring the tower is south in ash heap?
---
And you can’t stockpile them because you have to first take the first one before the computer will take a new holotape 
---
Well I mean, why would you bother?
---
Getting there! I have already amassed 1600 shotgun ammo, so that permaban is surely dangling above my head. 
---
The data-mined changes show them altering that specific safe in the last big update.   
---
I tried to link nukes and dragons but can’t figure it out. 
---
The three lvl 3 safes in Pleasant Hills Cemetery (near Lewisburg) often contain plans for uncommon weapons...
---
Burning wires, Cracking lenses, Snapped trigger, Moving parts jamming, overheating. 
---
Those are my reasons for having weapon durrability on energy weapons.. besides every other weapon does.
---
If you don’t have any food/water producing at your camp nothing will attack you, so I have my barn mansion complete with a garage annex at the side.
---
.001% of you are role playing and .002% use reddit to organize PVP. Like me. You all hate it. You insist only on attacking randoms.
---
Until the roleplay subreddit becomes as possible as whiney suggestions... no. OP didn't even give contact info wut is this a karma farm.
---
Bethesda and obsidian both utilize different parts of fallout best. new Vegas has great quest structure. 3 and 4 have great environmental storytelling and exploration. 76 is even more focused on exploration. It may not be for you. 
---
Only Aluminum and Lead bulk to produce a net reduction in weight. Bulking other items is only useful when it facilitates selling to vendors.
---
I'd say, get at least an Excavator Power Armor if you want protection from damage, Hazmat if you just don't want to take rads at all.
---
Get some friends who have rad sponge, let them share it with you, or vice versa and share with them, helps protect the party a lot while taking in rads.
---
Stockpile on Rad-X, nondiluted, Radshield, lategame, albeit rare so maybe just Rad-X.
---
I'd say wait until you make an Excavator Suit that's level 45 just so it can take a few more hits.
---
Power Armors that aren't Excavator are good too, better infact; T-60 is good all around, Ultracite is good against ballistic damage, and X-01 is good against energy.
---
Try to find some Calibrated Shocks for your suit to gain an extra +50 carryweight per leg.
---
Excavators CS can be found at Lewisburg and Welch stations for about 233 per shock if you have level 3 Hard Bargain. If you apply those to the Excavators you'll end up having an extra 200+ Carryweight overall because the suit naturally supplies you with 100+ though be careful if any of your pieces break, which is why it's good to have shocks for the legs in case like your arm or helmet breaks.
---
I feel bad for them, the Megasloth just wants to chill :) .
---
They should add Baby Megasloths to list of Tameable aswell they could grow when we level them up :)
---
It does; it was a lot more noticable before the blanket nerf to two-shot damage.
---
Previously it was essentially two taps of a flamer or cryolator for the cost of one ammo. Both being weapons with incredibly awful crafting ratios on their ammo, as well as being energy weapons. It was the only way to really make both of them viable.
---
I guess it did end up like feed the people then. Thanks for the info.
---
Yeah it looks like it. Thanks for the info.
---
Rifleman perks
---
Yeah it was giving people like11 stims a day. Not ok. 
---
Of all the other things that need to be fixed, they go and mess with that. Thanks for the info.
---
If you like exploring, following quest lines, occasional intense fights with much stronger enemies than you're expecting (due to a level 100+ player nearby), but a generally friendly player rolling in and helping or dropping supplies out of the blue, you might enjoy it. Working out what perks to work on, hoarding like a kleptomaniac with OCD tendencies, and building bigger and better bases. I kinda like it ;)
---
Works well with my quad homemade, 70 round mag instead of 10.
---
Why would you try to make a point about the gatling laser weapon while mentioning laser rifle mods and saying rifle in your comments? Obviously the gatling version of any gun shouldn't have the damage per bullet that a rifle variant has.   
---
The laser rifle should kill targets in a comparable amount of shots as the handmade and combat rifle. As of now there is a significant difference in damage between an energy rifle and a equivalent ballistic rifle. This is pretty much an understood consensuses with all of the FO76 community, and the reason behind nearly everyone using ballistic rifles instead of energy rifles. 
---
It would be interesting to see the actual outcome of what we can see as the intended canon story.
---
It's very apparent that it's meant to end with at least one more nuke being dropped on Appalachia to stop the Scorched Plague.
---
How that's meant to effect the long run, I'm not sure.
---
I got this today.  I assumed its because I had killed the other super mutants and he was the only one left.  But now I'm thinking its probably triggering the 'flee' AI too early.
---
Not likely.  I'm guessing you love New Vegas because of story/ choices. This game has none of that.
---
I like to share my experience through my stories. I do not advocate for or against pvp and I have no intentions to do so with my stories. 
---
Although, feel free to vent your thoughts about it. I honestly have my own views as well against certain elememts of it, but I really do find the pvp to be a very dynamic part of the suspense I find in fo76. Ofcourse, engaging pvp does require a perfect build and a good knowledge of counters for each build. It does take alot of trial and error, but that is the fun part in my opinion.
---
Play fo76 however you like to play it. You make up your own story within the wasteland. Enjoy it however, you can and find ways to maximize what you like doing, and avoid doing what you don't. As simple as that.
---
Cheers
---
If there weren’t a counter to VATS that’s all anyone would use in pvp. 
---
I’m tired of debating. Have a nice day. \/,
---
No time to buff energy weapons or fix adrenal reaction. Plenty of time to “nerf” one specific safe.  
---
I love NV, I also enjoy 76. That having been said, the two games are very different in terms of how they're structured.  I like them for what they are, their own series of quests and features.  It's difficult to predict if you'll like/dislike the game with out playing it first.
---
I have actually found I have more game time in 76, than I do in FO4.  Mostly because in 76, I can play with my brother at the same time.  I would say barrow it, rent it or something, but the only way to really tell if you'll like it. Is to play it.
---
Pretty sure the real end game is organizing 25 players to do wild and imaginative stuff. It's disappointing when fans don't have imagination.
---
That's a seriously bad idea lol.  Stat tracking sure, for the simple fact it's what is usually used for balancing games and fixing exploits.   Proper stay tracking should have been part of the Net code implementation on level of importance when they pulled the code from FO4.
---
But separating players based on that is asinine.  Not only have I only rarely encountered griefers in hundreds of hours, which based on the fact you list killing players twice I'm guessing you want PVP off the server your on.  With how rare griefing occasions are it's so simple to just log off and back on a different server.
---
You will already get your wish in some regard with the plan to have servers with open PVP, but as others mentioned if you force everyone who does only the same stuff onto a server, the player experience fails outright. 
---
Hood and headpiece are dev room items. They haven’t been released yet and anyone who has them either got them illegitimately or got them from someone who got them illegitimately 
---
Well, I kinda treated it like the vendor bots. You have to wait a day to get more caps, need to wait a day to get another stash of stims. It's not like they don't get used, going for SBQ just once would eat that up for me. I figured it was a feature, not a bug hah.
---
Also explains why we can use caps. 
---
You can use a recon scope to highlight them before they pop it. 
---
All three maxed, 3 tank killer 2 in concentrated fire.  Swap tank killer for glow sight in ws nuke zones.  Agi at 15 with 3 sneak and 1 escape artist and I can sneak effectively in power armor with no stealth mods.  Don't bother with weightless, wood etc as sneak is so good you don't need them. 
---
Alrighty, I'll check there next time I'm on.
---
And right, you can't keep summoning them but back when they were instanced people use to basically just give all the weapons to one person, basically they only joined in to give one person everything.
---
Thank you!!! Its been killing me and i just wanted some confirmation
---
Same I thought it was too. I bring 5-8 quantum’s for the queen 
---
It’s a quality of life fix. 
---
I still have yet to see a baby, I've played since beta and my camp is in the middle of the mire but I've never seen the babies before.
---
I mean if you read my comment properly you would have seen i was talking about the perception of the game doing better and basically performance as i know there has little if any content added the game since i stopped playing besides microtransactions. Question though, if you're that unhappy with the game why are you still playing?
---
'Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right?'
---
Nah, maybe it is worse for gatling weapons but durability for guns in this game is just sheer nonsense across the board.  Guns simply do not break anywhere near that easily, and it doesnt even make a fun game mechanic.  It's a deliberate time sink, and nothing else.
---
I mean the weapons weren't too great or anything but like I dunno how to feel whether it was a good change or not. Depends I suppose.
---
I have a buddy that would appreciate it, after I twist his arm out of it's socket, due to him being a tight fisted unit he won't pay for it, even if he gets to play as a long range sniper player while I'm up front with a combat knife and a bad attitude. I've told him he can be my guardian angel. 
---
I like the Xbox. Version one a little then pc. Easier to pick ups and play and not have invest time to play. I can play a quick season without booting pc or loading programs. 
---
Not officially supporter, due to a cash shop,  they will always control the servers, and we will be lucky if we ever actually get supported mods that dont set you up for potential bans.
---
The Roleplay is never anything specific, ideas are always welcome but it's more of playing or exploring as usual but adding that improvised roleplay to the mix. My PSN id is posted above. 
---
I’ve gotten a few legendary from them. It’s mostly for me to scrap for mods. 
---
It does help, Speed Demon makes my Two Shot Dragon take only slightly longer to reload than my Medic's 50 Cal.
---
I'm gonna be honest, I really wanted to say this while T-posing at my coworker last night but I don't think we would've understood it.
---
Yeah that was my only concern hopefully they add to it, because in my opinion Bethesda and more specifically todd howard made it seem like they were able to add content prety quickly. So i would have hoped for more quests etc. I was surprised to see the new vaults being added so long after launch as they made it seem like they were going pretty soon after launch,but maybe they changed their design goals for it at some point because now it says vault raids.
---
That's correct. You go in wearing power armor, kill stuff that needs killing with melee, ignore the trash mobs, and break out heavy weapons should things get dicey.
---
Silo solos aren't hard if you go in prepared and know what you're doing.
---
Thanks for the info. I'm a melee build bit I have spare perk points and will invest them in the hacking perk cards:)
---
I will always say pc but that is what i am most comfortable with.  The menus are not pc friendly so if you are equally comfortable on x box i would almost say go x box.  The menus are that frustrating.
---
How much Thirst does it fill up with both maxed out perks?
---
I didn't even realize they had legendaries. Well shit. I just used them for temp weapons but theyre usually so decked out that I can't keep them.
---
It’s rare. 
---
Damn I was hyped to make another Fallout Friend and then I read the "PS4" and died, I'm on PC. 
---
There's a random event with one, im not sure if they're limited to random event spawns, certainly not a common sight though..
---
I remember the youngling Deatchclaws from NV aswell, i think they should be in 76 aswell :)
---
I always drop stuff in cases near overseers cache cause I assume newer players will find it
---
Done
---
I have all of those
---
You lost your junk?
---
I made 30 bulk oil to sell and it increased in weight, was 150 pounds over.  then I got dropped and they all disappeared and left the weight behind :(
---
I have played in all the closed tests besides the first one and the beatas for the division 2 and in my opinion while it is much improved in the open world of things it's still up in the air for the rest of the game. I think fallout in general has such a strong community behind the game will thrive either way  maybe not as successful as bethesda was hoping because of the launch but im sure there will always be those people who play regardless. I think once mods get introduced if they do at all still and if they aren't gimped in their form because of the atomic shop etc fallout 76 could see a huge revival because of that alone.
---
I wouldn't say you were debating, I'd say you were just trying to be the devils advocate when there's absolutely no room for the argument that laser weapon damage is OK as it is. You just stopped making sense after digging into what you were trying to prove. The offer still stands, please send me an invite and show me this 'good' damage for a laser rifle.
---
The damage of energy weapons need to be buffed/fixed.  
---
Nothing to see here, just swamp gas from a weather balloon trapped in a thermal pocket reflecting the light from Venus.
---
Sorry I am fairly new to reddit. I only joined because of fo76. People post great advice here. I will add more relevant info at the top next time :)
---
I generally dislike not having text chat in any game like this that i play , ive been playing anthem and with only 4 people per server  in freeplay it just feels more like a barren wasteland than i think the devs intended for it too. Atleast fallout 76 has icons on the map for it's events in the world even though few people come from what ive seen.
---
That's to be expected with Anthem just coming out and unfortunately with the game not receiving the best reception at launch i was expecting much worse when i logged on and checked the reddit.
---
If you are level 36 you have yet to unlock the master rifle perks..I know this cuz my alt is also level 36..similar build
---
Any mod that is learned though plans can not be learned though scrapping.
---
In that case it will already be using the most valuable "currency" in the game: legendary items.
---
 All I want out of it is a place to dump legendary items I don't want but still get something out of it. 
---
With that gear, I'd probably max out blocker, junk shield, barbarian. You can take out ninja too, you don't have the gear to run it effectively. Incisor is maxed. As long as your happy with the weight reduction cards too. Towards end game you'll probably be carrying so much stuff. When switching to heavy, a lot of that str will be used to support the gun. Stabilized int is a must. One gun army for cripple. I see your perception is nuked.
---
Not too shabby though, gets the job done. Oh yeah, probably go with the vtec suit for more luck if the bos is overkill. Have to play it out and see though, you probably one hitting everything right now you can tweak that down especially since you run a combat knife, just one extra stab.
---
Nope wait until the Wild Appalachia’s update comes out play it, then wait again till the next update 
---
Bodyguards for player shops?  What’s next, protection money?
---
“That’s a nice Decontamination shower you got there. It’d be a shame if someone dropped an orbital strike on it”
---
yes, but it's unreachable
---
Breaking news! Something In Fallout 76 isnt working the way it's supposed to! In other news water wet! More tonight at 11!
---
What are you on?
---
So every vendor sells it? Or specific vendors will always sell it?
---
nothing
---
I don’t know if you ever had your shop greifed but it’s though pointless very expensive to fix so having security is a good idea
---
Go to watoga shopping..hazmat suit is 150 caps..get at least a short hunting rifle..to be somewhat effective there..you will be fine 
---
Now I kind of want to set up a shrine to his furriness, Lord Mr. Pebbles. ;)
---
You can buy the plans at either Harper's or Watoga, can't remember which. It's fun, but the radiation damage is useless against 90% of the enemies. 
---
I'm streamer, so it's my job
---
Right, they wouldn't just hand you a legendary weapon just like that.
---
This.  And also, yeah no kidding.  They'll probably get a good helpful response and personal support from a real person within minutes.
---
It’s like 1/10 for me 
---
I RP as a mad engineer, blow shit up and build it up better and more efficient. Stoked when I found the engineer uniform from Forbidden Knowledge.

I used to pretty much main a .50 Machine Gun but, heavy guns being lackluster as they are, I dropped it in favor of a TSE Double Barrel I found a while ago. Always keep a 10mm (Quad legendary) and Bowie Knife on hand as backups, as well as a scoped .308 hunting rifle for longer-range engagements.
---
Love it!
---
That sucks. Didn't you see the player's icon on the map when you fast-traveled to the silo?
---
Doesn't sound too bad, thought the tapes seem to have gotten rarer nowadays and no one is gonna just sit there and go to relay towers and farm them.
---
Picked clean 25 years will do it. 
---
I’m siting on. 150 taps. 
---
Is there actually a limit on how many caps we can have? That's kinda wank.
---
The game’s not perfect, but what is?
---
I’m really enjoying FO76.  I take the time to fully explore the game, seek out unusual occurrences and essentially soak it all in.  I don’t rush to the endgame.
---
They're aware of it, but they haven't really been too clear on what they'll do.  They might increase durability and slightly increase damage, or they might only do one of those.  We don't really know for sure, so everything is a 'maybe' at the moment.
---
One of the biggest reasons why energy weapons stink is partly due to the way armor-piercing is king in this game.  Something like the laser rifle doesn't get any mods that pierce armor in the same way a  combat rifle, or handmade gets a perforating magazine modification.  
---
One of the underlying issues with energy weapons is due to the way defense works. Enemies have a ballistic and energy damage resistance.   Most higher level enemies in the game have an almost equal rating for both, which means using one type of damage type of the other isn't going to offer an inherent advantage, you instead pick based on which does higher damage, and if whether one has armor-piercing capabilities.  
---
I used to have like 90 on an old character but I started giving them away, only have 19 on my current character.
---
Play in party with inspiring = 15% xp
---
Cranberry snack = 10% xp
---
Sleep = 5% xp
---
Berry mentats = +5int = more xp
---
Launch 15 nukes per day and mark everything with shots
---
Bloody mess, the perception cards including tank killer and glow sight. Tormentor is nice too.
---
Xbox sry
---
Had this happen but with 3 scorched beasts and mobs of scorched while my friend stood hunkered down in a tent watching me god-mode everything.
---
For a guy who one hits everything with his powerfist, he was finally jealous of me lol.
---
Quad lever for normal use. TSE for big game. Anti armour gauss from really big game. And western for backup. And going to using a revolutionary sword for melee. And a laser rifle when on scrap runs. 
---
Yeah passing through I tend to avoid em. I looked around at first but wasn't interested 
---
I never thought about the white springs bots I was always intimidated at low level and never considered taking them on now
---
That makes sense if the total number of players are declining when you play.
---
Yeah, mr. Furious is sitting in my stash till I have adrenal reaction back. I think that's the one to have.
---
I’d say yeah.  But only if you wear clothing of that faction. 
---
That's the point lol they don't want people to be able to have more than 25k caps er character.
---
what's your handle in game?
---
Agreed.
---
 Get a grape mentats if you can first. Knock like 150 or 200 off the price
---
I have both rifleman and expert rifleman perks that increase the damage
---
Silky.Johnson
---
At level 42 the master rifleman card becomes available 
---
Have a good weapon. And back up with a back up. Should it run long. No need to struggle. 
---
Pack food to replace stims. Food first stim later. 
---
A team where everyone has rad sponge level 3
---
Honestly, 76 would have benefited from a chat system. Players could arrange for trades, ask for help, etc. 
---
I remember the baby claws, so cute, cutest deathclaw I've seen in 76 was one I pascified in a cave and it decided to take a nap.
---
The nuka factory doesn't have a workshop.
---
That's a good idea for bringing food to heal in addition to stims. 
---
P-
---
Okay, plenty of words start that way
---
E-
---
Alright, field's narrowing
---
N-
---
...uh, okay

S-

Phew
---
AND SHIT
---
There it is
---
Quantum’s are amazing. 
---
If you're on xbox and are using t60 I'd be happy to throw a jet pack on for you. 
---
That’s fair to be honest. What do you enjoy doing in it? I wanna play more but I just don’t feel like I have a purpose to do anything, I can’t wait for the new updates tho and my level 112 character is going straight to prestige
---
LOL - true that
---
certain vendors sell it, certain vendors have plans that others don’t but for the most part it’s static. sometimes you may have to server hop but not too much 
---
Ah yes, this shop must have a lot of plastic in store.
---
Thanks for the info. Good to know sneak is effective in power armor. 
---
Hey thanks for the thoughts. I’m just gonna pick your brain a little if that’s ok?
---
Ninja-I do sneak a lot even tho with heavy weapons it’s maybe counterintuitive. I guess more of a snipers perk? It’s kinda fun to sneak up to a group then unload on them. 
---
I rarely us PA, which I think is required for stabilized. 
---
Many of my weapons are weight reduced as the 3rd star. That’s why I’m able to focus less on weight reduction perks. 
---
You think my perception is “nuked” what would you take from and give to perception?
---
I use the BOS suit and some of my armor to increase my END. What would more luck do for me?
---
I was thinking of removing 1H damage perks and puttin then into heavy damage perks. 
---
Your thoughts on any of this?
---
Pretty sure I've got one if you're on pc.
---
Same ign, be on in like 20
---
yes they are - I burned up the ones I had in the last nuke zone I was in. very useful.
---
Not until the Wastelanders DLC apparently 
---
yes it is part of the game to find nice stuff but it is also a big part of the game to trade. Hell there's a SPECIAL stat dedicated to bartering.
---
Weirdest thing, it allows me to start a new character and play without kicking me out but my level 66 player is screwed
---
Nuke zones will be way outside your capability.
---
Farm whitesprings with a higher level friend.
---
Being well rested with inspirational, you'll level up quick.
---
As someone who uses miniguns as their bread and butter weapon, I agree: miniguns wreck. Their main drawback is that they chew through ammo like a fat kid at an open buffet, and you need to have a proper build to make them work, but when they do... they're great fun.
---
What platform you on? I've been hearing about this bug for weeks but never seems to happen to me on xbox.
---
&gt; Violet flux is really easy to farm.
---
Only if someone nukes the queen. 
---
B o b b y p i n s = c a p s...
---
For me it wasnt just daily, I could server hop and get 8 each time, I ended up with way too many so im not surprised they fixed it
---
You suggested a reasonable workaround for the OP’s whiny complaint.  I provided a further supporting comment to your stance, in that one-shotting legendaries is not in and of itself griefing.
---
My last feeling was just crushed by your needless attempt at an insult; I will forever be changed by this encounter.
---
My first big goal was to collect all serum recipes. i love to find new good places with rare plants, so i'm able too cook powerful food and chems any time i want. Also i spend all my weekend to build indoor farm, had to rebuild my camp from scratch, but it was worth it. Now im waiting for new content, survival mode, prestiging and raids!
---
I know you want to level up fast.  And I've heard the   school of thought that low level enemies don't give much XP and are a waste of ammo. 
---
The problem there is that being a low level character, low level enemies are all you can handle.
---
You gotta take it slow because the game kinda forces you to.
---
Anti-armor gatling gun. Still a boss even after the martial artist fix and sounds like thunder when you fire it. Absolutely beastly against most everything, including the scorchbeast queen.
---
Are you joining? My game glitched and I can’t do anything in my pop boy. Need to log out then back in but don’t want to lose my nuke.
---
If you server hopped you could get hundreds per day
---
Yes it does.I have a clean white one exept the hat. I collect them too
---
You think the nuka cola shop at the white springs couldn't get a hold of quantum? it hosts senators, presidents, and the enclave.
---
Cat bowls, Cream &amp; Space Helmets ;)
---
 You think the nuka cola shop at the white springs couldn't get a hold of quantum? it hosts senators, presidents, and the enclave. 
---
Anytime I visit the cola factory, I encounter at most two dozen ghouls.  
---
Do you know where to find it?
---
Um. Can I ask what is PSA stand for? Noob Q. Thabks
---
No only hardcore fallout fans allowed 
---
Wear hazmat suit in the power armor so if you accidently exit you dont die instantly of rads.
---
Im on ps4, thank you so much though. Badguy over here is my buddy and he is probably one of the nicest, smartest power horse there is on PS4 when it comes to power armor. Probably also one of the only guys that I met that i can't 1 shot.
---
Thanks for the offer. U r awesome just for suggesting it.
---
But we can finish it...
---
I had no idea it existed. I’ve only found Nuka Cola, Nuka Cerry and Nuka Quantum. 212 hours and I’m still learning new shit. Love it.
---
Forceful stock gives you a lot more durability with only a slight hit to accuracy. Also, stinging Mag is a good trade off between the AP of perforating and the size factor of the drum Mag.
---
Lastly, unless you really need Suppressor for a stealth build, take the muzzle brake for increased durability and lower recoil. 
---
I’m dumb. Forgot I don’t have the caps lol. When I have the caps I’ll ask again
---
I save all of mine. I’m at like 90 right now. 
---
I dunno, I have lots of stuttering and there's no option for GSync in my Nvidia control panel -- guess my monitor is too old and doesn't support GSync.
---
So an on cue stagger effect from eating one type of food?
---
Next thing you know we'll have a bathroom meter we need to empty at a toilet or porta potty before we soil ourselves.
---
Text chat tends to be overrun with bots anyway.
---
At least he didnt see you. 
---
I think i know the cave :) ,,, on a random event theres one (misslabeled perhaps) as a 'Travelling Merchant' but it isn't Trading, wich is a shame if you've seen that random event.
---
Thanks dude! Awesome story btw. Good luck in the Appalachian wastes 👍
---
Requires a plan. See my post here for what you can learn by scrapping and what you have to use a plan for:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/
---
Nah its bullshit, been used once and never since. Just gathering and gathering and gathering ammo.
---
Bullshit.
---
Both give a significant damage bonus compared to other legendary affixes, to the point of making anything else else useless in comparison
---
I think I might have seen that travelling merchant, I know I've seen a Responder Merchant who was travelling but I was farming the Hunter's Long Coat and didn't care at the time since this wasn't the right protectron.
---
Do u think the tank perk is necessary? I have a rifle build and I didn't use that card yet 
---
Nuka grapes. Heals rads and health. Especially with cola perks.
---
I have one (ps4 but not selling anyway, sorry) and it is very good but I was told an AA one might be better, haven't gotten my hands on one to test out yet.
---
I wonder if there's such a thing as a two shot AA legendary one.
---
there is a lot of different tastes you can buy in whitespring only
---
Nice to know I'm not the only one. Not super social, and I have no mic so I rarely team up with people. I'm level 82 and still haven't launched a nuke. I've been wanting to try it solo or otherwise, but kind of wanted my first launch to be fissure site prime. I figure I should at least wait until they fix the SBQ since there are all these reports of issues with her at the moment.
---
What system are you on? I'm about to get home and log in on xbox, so if you want a tour guide send me a PM with your GT. 
---
Yes!   It makes it so much easier. I can hurt armoured mobs with ease.  Plus it stakes with the anti armour legendary effect. I believe 
---
Thx bruh..gonna unlock and max the card
---
I have a spare plan I can sell you on PC. IGN: jchamlin
---
Can confirm.  Shot a mothman on a cliff that staggered it back.  It fell down the cliff and died.
---
I was like 'wtf?? YOU CAN FLY THOUGH!'
---
As far as grinder/finders, 100%.
---
If theyd just hire their mod community, increase spawn density in some high level areas, throw us a few new boss fights, fix the loot loading/disappearing bodies issues... you get my point.
---
Could be really fun, just rushed out of dev. Beta game, 5/10. fun, but def not best ever.
---
Ah a supporter of the Responders I see.
---
Have fun. It’s a good perk. I also run suppressor and and the other charisma perk that runs with it. One reduces their resistance and the other reduces their damage output. 
---
Of course! I was a Minute Man, and here I’m a Responder. I want to help people
---
Get rad sponge or ghoulish, and try to find a team mate to share with. 
---
Because you're still clicking it.
---
Downvote/remove downvote x1000
---
The highest armor piercing mag on a handmade is only 10 bullets.  The (?)stinging mag that gives some armor penetration and magazine size is 20 bullets.
---
It *is* ridiculous.
---
Thx..my alt character has all the gunsmith perks unlocked and my fave weapon is a modded short hunting rifle
---
Ymmv but I think that quest procs for 10,000 lifetime caps rather than having all at once? You might unlock it sooner than you think esp if you are grinding to lvl 100.
---
It unlocked for me after completing a power up power plant quest, I was like OMG did I get thousands of caps for this quest? No... I didn’t have near that many on me at the moment so either it bugged out completing it for me or it’s lifetime caps rather than inventory. Also was a sad moment of how many caps I’d wasted seeing my actual wallet vs apparently having made 10k throughout the game...
---
That makes sense.
---
There's a expansion coming out on the 12th, so I'd say wait until then.
---
I didnt carry any with me when I went into the fight.
---
How?  I was planning on farming flux for my first nuke I launch.  Is there a specific spot worth checking out in the cranberry bog?
---
I used to use it crazy. But the fire rate got me killed. 
---
Ok good
---
&gt;A team where everyone has rad sponge level 3
---
You only need one person on the team with rad sponge who can share it and everyone benefits. 
---
I figured they would come out of the Stash, but would take budget to place/store (like you store things if you move base). 
---
I also Hope we can place Power Armour so we can have a set of each on our base, and maybe manikins that we can put Armour/costumes onto as well. 
---
I use the fast reload mod and always mutated with speed demon
---
Tank killer shreds them. 
---
Hows it feel though
---
I got lever and never looked back. 
---
Yeah...i think the fact that they are all travel points inflates expectations.  I feel like if it had all been one "location", it might have felt more appropriate.
---
Well yea but more people more rads healed was what I meant
---
Only gives additional material from scrapped armor and guns.  It is apparently your intelligence that helps you unlock mods from scrapping.
---
I'm at 8 intelligence, I rarely get a mod from the first gun I scrap, after that first one though I start getting one each scrap.  Definitely craft with super duper as many handmade's you can and scrap them slowly one at a time.
---
If your collecting flux make sure you have green thumb perk for extra yield and good with salt perk to stop it turning into inert flux before you can sell it to a vendor or craft the stable version. There’s a blackwoodsman magazine that gives 50% extra yield from plants too. If you are unlucky and your flux becomes inert before you sell or craft to the stable version don’t dump it just drink it, it rehydrates with the bonus of disease prevention
---
Ahh yeah, did you manage to get the Jacket ? He sells a few other outfits too.
---
Longshoreman - Clean Spacesuit - Clean Straight Jacket - Clean Ranger hat - Clean Ranger Outfit - Skiing purple and white - Skiing red and green - Halloween Witch - Halloween Skeleton and the Hunters Longcoat is all i've seen him sell.
---
And the two Clock Plans.
---
i got an ultracite laser just a few days ago. Only two stars, but it was nice to find  I'm just biding my time waiting for them to finally re-balance energy weapons. Until then plasma throwers are the only energy weapon that gets real love from me even though they go through ammo so fast.
---
I just got them..I love them..so fast..I realized they need a suppressor tho lol..i need the plans so I can craft and then scrap to learn all the mods
---
Whatever mods suppress recoil.  I think you have them all on already though, that build should have near recoiless shots as it is.
---
Public Service Announcement
---
Best way is if you have a crit built up, use concentrated fire and miss the first shot on the fusion core, then crit the core.  They will die to any gun in one hit. 
---
If your one Xbox I have a spare. 
---
Bloodied swingspeed guitarsword. 
---
Bro go play fallout 3 or I'm telling 
---
I got the clock plans, the Hunters Long Coat, the Ski Outfits, Witch Costume, Skeleton Costume, the Union Cap, and trade the Clean Space Suit to my friend because I only found on coat and I wanted to give one to my gf.  I need that Longshoreman outfit though, might see if I can get some friends together to farm him again later now that I have caps again.
---
Games like Fortnight and CS-GO are generally well-balanced for everyone, with only their weapons being different. 
---
Fallout, like most MMORPGs have a lot of customisable options and as such makes balance very hard and people play differently (for example my build has no damage buffs yet and all the Weight perks). 
---
Play that funky music vault dweller.
---
AA Grog Axe, AA war Drum as backup, 3* bowie knife for small game, Furious handmade to knock cancer bats out of the sky, and a TSE cryolator for SBQ fights. 
---
I'll hire you, but you have to fight me first.  If you win, you get the job.  Psn skyhumper.
---
It’s not bad. The vats cost is good for sprinting 
---
Can confirm it's lifetime, not having to have 10k on you at one time. 
---
I've noticed the simple act of crouching makes it impossible to be targeted by VATS.
---
Very good actually.
---
This is the best heavy weapon you can get. 
---
Thx bruh but I'm ps4..i have a ghoul slayers level 45 coming to me (just solidified a deal) ..that with glow sight card maxed..I should be one shutting all the glowing ones at WS
---
If you can't get it below 20$, don't bother. Yes it is Ok when you start playing it, but so is chocolate when you start eating it, but you can't eat it long. Just like Angry Joe told:"Once the newness wears off, the game is boring and shallow".
---
Ok I’ll  need to repair my weapon though if you have spare plastic I can repair it it’s AASS Deathclaw gauntlet  
---
So thats kinda what Im getting at. The npc takes off upon seeing me, before Ive even engaged it or its comrades.
---
❤
---
👍
---
-a typical interaction between vault dwellers- lolol
---
Then ban bots on sight. 
---
Game is in a really good state. There's less lag, dc and bugs.
---
Content is pretty much the same until the first update in a few days. 
---
&gt; If your friends were permabanned, they were cheating.
---
Or they had too much ammo.
---
You can change your reputation with time, but your actions have consequences and effect on if you see the wold get better or worse, plus this would only be when applicable, at the end of the day you get whatever server is available, but when there is a choice the game puts you in with other like people
---
Good luck. 
---
Having multiple doesn't actually seem to help. From what my team has found, you're better off with 1 person with rad sponge, 1 with inspirational, 1 with glow sight, and 1 with bloody mess.
---
Constant rad healing, 15% bonus xp, 60% bonus dmg against glowing mobs, plus 15% bonus dmg against everything.
---
Or they were duping Ultracite Ammo. 
---
Which they were banned for 
---
Or 
---
having 100k of an individual item. 
---
And then youd find an interesting character many other times. Hidden bunkers more often than not didnt have a marker on the map.
---
Brilliant story, really enjoyed it, thanks for posting.
---
Yea that sounds nice
---
At that point it's just salvaging, not stealing.
---
Public service announcement
---
Same, my bigger concern are the endless gutsy's and sentry bots apparently?  Those colonel gutsy's slaughter me as it is even at 350 damage resistance.
---
Still if you say so, I'll have to look into the silo layout but from there if it is soloable I'll definitely be launching nukes more often.  Gotta get them flux and legendaries!
---
Damn. That's probably the best roll you can get on a heavy gun with the current meta. 
---
Best open a Support Ticket sounds like your main need sorting out, if they can.
---
They were around 140 caps, i grabbed a few for trading at my clothes vendor when we get those $$, might be worth picking up any extra Longcoats aswell :)
---
I had 2 today. One one fissure prime, and one on the crashed space ship. (Yea, I don't know why either) The game crashed on both of them... 😒
---
Well it could, plus it can be weaponized too. The enclave is right underneath, of course they’ll take a whole stash of weapons grade sofa. 
---
It’s also why turrets and lights take up more budget, they take up more resources.
---
Hopefully that means that as things continue to improve they’ll up the build budget like they did stash storage 
---
Yeah, gonna hopefully find some more so I have a reason to check out some PS4 communities
---
I stumbled across one. 
---
I closed the door than proceeded to tear apart their turrets LMFAO 
---
Turret farm needa be patched no fair 
---
I ran into the same invincible festering ticks at camdon park tiday, two of the motherfuckers on one of the daily missions. I was able to run away from it though. They just kinda disappeared and I was able to finish the quest.
---
I feel lucky for once then. This is my every day head popper. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/S7y84eH
---
That’s been my reaction at least a dozen times until I went online and checked out all the different perk cards
---
150% how can you no have such an iconic gun like the 1911, and not have it in fallout 76
---
Level 111, around 270 hours.
---
I think it kind of has too to prevent lag. It's all well and good to think life is infinite, but everything has a limit.
---
Yup, praying i find a trader selling the elusive BOS Mechanic Jumpsuit that drops from the Guided Meditation event :) 
---
You’ll be able to decorate with junk soon, so I’d keep hold of it if you like it. 
---
Good luck!
---
I can barely scratch a Queen with my AA's and Heavies can barely use VATS.
---
Damn, thanks for your reply! Glad to see it’s not just me.
---
Yeah, just got the All Rise a few days ago, it rules at Whitesprings.  I also like the handmade.  Instegating dragon for sneak shots on assaultrons and deathclaws.
---
Holy hell you just had a crash fest didn’t you??? Thank you for your reply!
---
And I just got a bounty for unlocking one. Do they "belong" to the player who did the request now?
---
Ghillie suits, raider styles, ponchos, period correct 101sr Airborne battle fatigues and the icing on top, clothing dyes. We cannot have these things ...yet. Fingers crossed BGS.
---
I'm trying to sell a 2* AAE combat rifle, looking for at least 4k for it, would like more if possible. You interested?
---
Totally down I’ll dm you 
---
I feel you on the vats thing. Takes too many action points.   
---
What are the legendaries on the weapon
---
All the bugs I kept hearing about when the game first came out are pretty much non existant for me. I started playing about 3 weeks ago. 
---
Anit armor and explosive
---
I'm curious about this as well.
---
1-Serrated Combat Knife 2-Combat Shotgun 3- Tesla Rifle 4-Handmade Rifle 5-Gauss Rifle 6-Fragmentation Grenade
---
I was like two hours in when I encountered the first one just walking down the road. Scared the shit out of me ngl
---
Tesla Rifle and Gauss Rifle, love them both.
---
We’re wondering if people steal your items do they get a bounty? Are your items locked? Maybe can only be put in the display cases??
---
Duping is cheating. Collecting 100k of an item is not.
---
Yeah, I mean I see why they can't do this (first hand, with how often servers crash or lag). But I'd rather them allow larger budgets and cut back somewhere else. I'd take the trade off of a few more in-game buildings having loading screens to create a better camp.
---
I just started this myself I'm level 37. It's events so just keep checking on your map and hover over every event and it'll say if it's a enclave event or not
---
It wasn’t possible to collect 100k of an item without duping. 
---
Nice fucking try though LOL. 
---
They don't really pop up, you just have to check the map and look for Enclave events like bots on parade and dropped connections.
---
Alternative options are killing legendary mobs. Uranium Fever guarantees 3 of them if you see it pop up. Most horde events will have at least 1. Violent Night also has a legendary at the end. 
---
Hrmm does luck affect drop rates of these raritys..
---
Thanks!! ,, here's the real kicker i had a psn friend who had the friends beta code but never got 76,, im 99%sure that was the item that dropped for him in the beta and i remember replying to him offering me it saying " no you keep it, it could be rare" 
---
Taking lazers to the face like a champ yeah I'm glad he didnt see me.
---
If you scrap enough combat armor pieces you will get a notification you learned the bos mod, but what you actually unlock is the bos skin for the combat armor helmet. Youbhave to find the plans for the limbs/chest.
---
I'm just saying that quite a lot of Bethesda's story telling was always setting up scenes in the environment, there were always hidden stories in exploration, little snippets of people's life before they died that you can find
---
Em I think 4K is way to much caps for it considering it is only a combat rife 
---
Top floor above the other shops.  There's a bar vendor then a nuka vendor named bubbles with a hella sexy accent.
---
Yes that's what I play, rifle build, no sneak, no PA

LOL. Nice fucking try though. LOL
---
What are you looking for? Melee? Rifle? Heavy gun? 
---
Well, I was told to not accept anything less than 4k for it, so if you don't want it that's fine.
---
Must visit the nuka factory now!!!
---
After you finish the missions for Rose. You get the missions for the Brotherhood. Then you will start the enclave missions. They are not a level quest. Just how fast or slow you complete the previous quests. 
---
Didn’t know the pied  piper was an eyebot 
---
Would you be willing to share some screenshots of this player hub? I'm very interested in these kinds of builds, I have a not quite player hub build, but more of a roadside truckstop and bar, and I'm always looking for that inspiration
---
Despite being level 92 I still fall back on the level 35 powerful auto handmade I found a long time ago. Thing is still really strong. Slowly unlocking the mods so I can craft a max level one.
---
I also run with an instigating railway rifle for one shotting medium tier mobs. 
---
Occasionally use my double double barrel for close range but lately been having a ton of fun with shredder miniguns. My baby is an anti armor + bash damage.
---
Lastly I always have a Missile launcher, grenade launcher, and fat man ready to go for crowd control and what not.  
---
4k is ridiculous, but I'll give you 2k for it if OP doesn't want it. 
---
I’m mostly a melee build but I would be willing to buy an explosive legendary weapon 
---
I’ll buy it for 1000 caps. 
---
So farm Watoga vendors?
---
Congratulations, you made your Wisdom save.
---
LMFAO. 
---
Stop there was a giant thread about this and it’s just not possible to accumulate that many bullets without cheating. 
---
Also lol@ your shit for balls source that means nothing. I can go write an article right now on how everyone was duping who had over 100k. 
---
Fool 
---
Sometimes it depends on the server your on, try server hopping to find some. 
---
I'll take a Bourbon with my Nukacola.
---
Again...was told to not accept anything less than 4k, so I'm not accepting anything less than 4k. Thanks.
---
Anti-armor effects are generally the most effective.  Max them out.
---
 sorry but that is just too much caps for me 
---
Tanagra town north of harpers 
---
I don't have any explosive weapons to part with, but I have an anti armor baseball bat you can have. 
---
What does "cwd's" mean here? I'm pretty sure it's not "Chronic Wasting Disease," so my Google-Fu has failed me.
---
9 days
---
Mini Nuka shaped like a mini nuke but glows red.  Need.
---
What did you do‽
---
Hope they convert that factory into a workshop with a processing plant that bottles nukacola like the food factory.
---
That food factory is missing a lot of food items to produce though.  I want my potato crisps damn it!!
---
Less players = less server lag. Don't complain, just enjoy!
---
Until?
---
Same. Been on a break since Christmas 
---
First DLC content
---
I got a ton of stuff from the same suitcase last night. I was in desperate need for materials to do some repairs due to dying all the damn time thanks to my crappy choices in perk points. Thanks random player!
---
Is this he own video?
---
The story doesn't permit human NPCs. Adding them would (and I'm not being dramatic here) literally ruin the main quest line. The entire idea of the game is to see what happens when an isolated population of people are dumped into a world where every living person is dead. It's the driving motivation for the Overseer's mission. It's essential to every single quest in the game.
---
You want to know what would happen if this "design flaw" was absent? You'd arrive at Flatwoods, meet some NPCs who are very obviously NPCs due to their names, voices and movements, and then the credits would role as Ron Pearlman explains how the Dwellers of Vault 76 joined the Responders and rebuilt America, etc.
---
There is no story if humans are added. It's not a design flaw, it's a design feature that you happen to dislike. The game would certainly suffer if you met a single human NPC.
---
And I don't see how robots are boring. They usually have more personality and better designs than the generic humans you meet. Wadsworth was always more entertaining than Billy Creel, Wellingham was a more fun bartender than Cooke. 
---
Unless Bethesda just scraps 76 and makes an entirely different plot, then there is no conceivable way that a single human NPC could ever have any benefit towards a single aspect of this game.
---
It's not Fallout 5, it doesn't need the deep role playing and immersion of the other games.
---
The discord has been made. I’m not sure how to get the word out for it is not allowed in this sub. 
---
Yeah. It's my video
---
Message me the link 
---
Ohhhhh
---
I finally got needle spine last night from a pack of albino anglers.  Not sure about the other two, those are the last ones I need as well
---
I was on the edge of the map near Point Pleasant, looking from the bridge across the river and I noticed about 7, then more and more spawned. In the end there were 13 just circling. 
---
No one joined me to try and get them, I have 5 spare cards atm so I didn't waste ammo going after them either
---
Alright. Good luck. 
---
Probably 'Chicks with Dicks'. 
---
That seems to have fixed it, thanks!  I closed the launcher, used the task manager to kill the monitoring process, started it back up and it was fine
---
 Oh for sure. I just give stuff away but I could use the trade window. 
---
 Going outside the game I won't do, but I realize its just me. Its why I said it did not matter, in the front.
---
 My Instigating one does 128. ;)
---
I'll send you a fee quote :)
---
I liked that they're an easter egg, but they were lacking even more because of that.
---
Give me six plastic please I need to repair my weapon that’s good
---
Is it free?
---
It's not really dlc, it's a content update. I'm just saving you from heartache before you say "that was the shortest/crappiest dlc I have ever played" haha. To answer OP's question in a more open answer, it's a moonshinin' update, we'll have a new quest, small location, and crafting ability. After that we'll have two more larger updates coming a month later between
---
 Never seen that on PC.
---
Check map for players, check holotape for silo status? 
---
Anti armor + bash damage minigun with shredder barrel. Cuts through scorchbeasts like butter. Fav gun I own
---
Hmm, do you happen to also have a level 50 hunting rifle in your inventory?
---
A hive mind doesn't really need to be THAT deep. I really think that what you suggested would be far too silly. And we're talking about a game where you fight and kill the Mothman, here.
---
There's radiation in the reactor room.
---
I am Having the same problem on PS4
---
You coming back, or did you leave after I killed you?
---
I’m trying to get plastic
---
I love giving away things
---
It’s unfortunate that it won’t work
---
Here on mobile the videos thumbnail loads in along with the post
---
I ran the course last night to double check, and I'll run it again after I type this to triple check. Apart from that last one where you need to climb a tower, I think they're all accessible.
---
Rick explains it best.
---
The Gauss Rifle straddles the line between energy weapon and ballistic weapon and I like mine pretty swell. The rest are garbage- especially the big gatlings which take forever to spin up, do barely any damage and break before they even reload. The one exception is my personal legendary vampire plasma flamer. That guy chews through plasma cartridges but melts charred ghouls like nobody's business.
---
Sure thing! I was gonna probably post it on here anyway.
---
It's found at the Pleasant Valley station and is labeled as a tool chest. You might need to server hop a few times for it to show. 
---
Right click your Windows sound options and make sure your mic is the main communication device?
---
It was posted just for you to show your insecurities and take it out on random people...
---
Ok done deal I'll be online in about 2 hrs just give me your psn I'll add you and we can do a deal 
---
It’s a trend. Hate with others. That most people that hate it now are players that played it. And the other have never touched it. Because person X said so. 
---
No mods at all? Or not mods that you are looking for?
---
AAE has to be fixed before it can be nerfed, ha. Unyielding, probably Sentinel too will be nerfed, possibly Assassin's as well. For weapons, Bloody, maybe Swing Speed takes a hit
---
You need to go to the Armory.  It is only accessible after you get promoted and is beyond the Miltary Wing thru Command. 
---
alot of people told me gamers can't form their own opinions. Maybe that guy is right 
---
Yes - Normally, my vampires super sledge is  in slot 1 and a nocturnal super sledge is in slot 6.  
---
But recently, every time I log into a new server, the nocturnal SS gets put in slot 1 instead of 6, and the vampires SS doesn't get put into any slot.
---
In the favorites wheel, it sometimes still shows the vampires SS is in slot 1, but it is actually the nocturnal SS.
---
Oh, I thought there was only one vendor in the production wing. I'll try to find it, thanks!
---
I keep a piece of chameleon in my stash, so when the one I'm wearing breaks, I can finagle my armor to wear the back up. Love chameleon armor, but never have the mats to repair my stuff, so a spare is nice.
---
We certainly found a way to keep the sandbox fun, didn't we? :)
---
Consider yourself invited for our next event!
---
It says that only -50 hp. No dmg gain in the buff section. The weapon dmg can variety through perk cards like nerd rage, bloody mess and that kind.
---
Indeed, that must be AMAZING to stumble across
---
I agree on unyielding and sentinel. For weapons I’m seeing a lot Furious lately. 
---
And some of us are “farming” it for raider armor plans, so don’t be surprised if we show up and complete it ;)
---
Thanks for letting me know about the wheelchair one. The one in Hornwright was the issac talking about the sloth right? I already found that in the giant tunnel near watoga. Do you know why they put the same holo in two different places no where near each other? It seemed kind of odd.
---
We need an attitude like yours in the audience of our next show:  [http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ps4+sale](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ps4+sale)
---
Dang, wish I was on PC so I coulda falled for that.
---
I love me a good rick rolling
---
Yeah but it doesn't need a nerf. They only wanna nerf one-hits because it takes away from their game, as ammo and repair costs are supposed to be factors. Currently they aren't
---
You are clearly a person of high intellect and strong imagination. You've very HOA.
---
All these metas are simply symptoms of a much larger problem. the game was built with the expectation of people using VATS ALOT, and the useful weapons are TUNED for VATS. 7/8 of the player base refuse to use VATS and plays the game like an online shooter. All these metas are centered around finding edge case scenarios that buff damage of the online shooter crowd. simply put, there is almost ZERO damage progression for the casuals.
---
Ammo I assume.
---
I think it's easier to loot the tin can chimes from super mutant areas, they drop steel too. 
---
Fair.  Lot of people are still on the single player only kick. Many are on the give fallout back to obsidian.  But yeah a lot is just trend now. 
---
You should make us a sandwich...
---
...and maybe help us make a discord, too.
---
The moment I hear this I smile as my prey has revealed itself
---
They must see a big mass of dots at one location, and think, "Oh man, something needs killing!" and then they show up, gun in hand, only to find themselves on "The Price is Right". :)
---
I think it comes from retailers lowering the price to get rid of FO76. 
---
I think the retailers are taking the hit not Bethesda from lowering the price of the game.
---
It's a great weapon.  As far as the queen, I don't know what to tell you.  People say she's unkillable after the TSE nerf, but that isn't true based on my experience.  We killed two after the nerf.  But more recently I have been seeing more fails. 
---
Part of the problem is people (myself included) don't bother to show up.
---
I have an Anti-Armor 50 cal  I use on her as well, but when we are "successful," I get more plans for rusty knuckles and a life saving wooden chest piece.  That's my reward for burning through about 1,200 rounds of ammo that I spent time and resources crafting. 
---
And I have participated in killing at least 10 of them (more than that but I can't say how many,   I lost count after 10). 
---
Overwhelming drain on resources for underwhelming rewards. 
---
Xb1? 
---
Demolition expert max and rifle perk max. (auto rifle or non auto rifle)
---
And sadly Genadier doesn't work on legendary Explosiv Effect :) 
---
Yet. Someone will find a way to make need some. 
---
Why?
---
All this annoying nerfing is just happening because of PvP. In pve players can decide if a weapon is too strong for their liking and just use something else.
---
Of course
---
There are two small lakes just south of 76, past the moonshine shack, towards the old lumber mill, one has a jetty and a fishing rod, just saying
---
Thank you lol. I was waiting for someone to actually give me info instead of these weird one liners. 
---
I agree 100%
---
I get this if I travel to Grafton Steel or Harpers Ferry while wearing power armor. If I'm not in PA I can travel to these places fine.
---
I have them, but I'm not currently logged on.  
---
How much do you think they're worth?
---
Having saw the 76 post on the front page, it made me want to check this subreddit and see what people are saying.
---
Everyone has their own complaints. But the game got the huge hate boner for the broken release.
---
We see it happen in a lot of game, and gamers are generally sick of it. Don't release a game with the intentions to fix it later.
---
There's a guaranteed spawn of one in a pond near Twin Lakes. Travel there and follow the river down the mountain and you should run into it.
---
Unless you're willing to play Skyrim 76 - not yet. Wait for the big patch and then for the patches that fix the big patch and maybe then you'll do decent without a sledgehamma'
---
Because shitting on this game will get you lots of upvotes. It desn't matter if you have played it or not. I commented something like, *The bugs were super frustrating, but overall I liked FO76* and I got like 50 downvotes in just a few minutes.
---
Got the plans for optimized bracers today. Let me know if you still need them.
---
Deathclaw gauntlet with extra claw.
---
It’s also pve Head into a nuke and count the TSE being used. Yes people can decide but WILL they. 
---
So your friend can afford it, but won't buy it because they are cheap? 
---
I have carnivore serum. 
---
Sadly I have no others.
---
Yeah I don't wear PA and that part can be kinda tough for me even with radshield
---
The legendary scorched are even worse.  They will not engage you whatsoever.  I was chasing down a lvl 47 for a solid couple minutes until i got annoyed, pulled out my backup pistol and slowly shot it to death.  Auto-stim trapper leg.  Totally worth it.
---
Meh, my toon can do both and i also never will.
---
This is a great move for Bethesda, a title that sells so little copies is certainly bound to keep having a server paid for! /s
---
They should make it where if someone steals whatever item you have on display it gives them a bounty and u can loot your item back from them after killing them . Also is should forfeit your stolen item to you if they leave the server.  
---
No prob, mang. Here's a link to the next 100 days on the road map. Other people are probably just tired of answering questions about it. It's important to note that these are small updates spread over time, and the Wastelanders patch sounds like an overhaul.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps
---
Cool I'll check It out 
---
In the last few years hate is just increasingly popular in USA. Doesn't have much rhyme or reason.
---
What consol?
---
No idea I think fallout 76 is a hell of a lot of fun. Sure it has its issues but every game has those. 
---
I’ve seen it, glitches are great
---
The queen is just a bullet sponge. 
---
&gt;. Their main drawback is that they chew through ammo like a fat kid at an open buffet,
---
Yeah it's why I use a Gatling gun instead.  Does decent damage with the same perks, and the 180 rounds that you get with ammo smith goes a lot further with the Gatling. 
---
  
---
I wish they'd do something about he light machine gun. I have a furious light machine gun I'd like to use more often, but in the ammo crafting bench, you get only 21 rounds with ammo smith.  
---
That's a joke for a heavy weapon with a high rate of fire. 
---
I’m on Xbox
---
Yes just like the blue water in the bathtub inside the prison lol hilarious 
---
This is what the pvp servers will be, all day every day
---
Gronak axe, All Rise, single shot explosive Hunting rifle and Handmade.
---
Most ,if not all, shouldn't have any recoil at all.
---
Yep. On Xbox. Trying to find a stable server for the last 30 minutes. 
---
Its a very welcome change of theme. I vote it stays and maybe add other "hot rod" styled crazy colors.
---
yeah, I'm not editing that one
---
Charleston seems to spawn one along the Firebreathers Course. 
---
lol i will let them know, i assume your in game name is what you posted as here? ill keep an eye out for you in the game.
---
We always have problems with the mics in game, 
---
Oh this has me hopeful. I tried to tough it out for as long as I could on this game but there just wasn’t enough endgame to keep me interested. 
---
Glad Bethesda’s continuing support for this game. Thanks again though!
---
1. Whatever one handed melee I can find.
---
2. Revolver. Always.
---
3. Combat rifle or any 5.56 rifle. No Big guns.
---
4. Hunting rifle with a red dot and bayonet. The knife is super helpful for saving ammo, give em a good bash.
---
It can be a very good game if it gets steady support while there releasing the dlc . The reason why it’s had so many problems is because it was developed by an newer and less experienced studio from bethesda. The potential of this game is phenomenal. 😎
---
all the plants around, then you have to convert them to pure. if you don't convert them fast enough or don't have enough, they spoil.
---
I don't recall what the Hornwright one was about.  I think it had to do with one of the Hornwright offspring looking for a safe place to hide or something.
---
I havent seen the water. Ill head that way. Though its a dumb glitch its a fun change of pace and as soon as I saw it I stopped in awe.
---
Dont waste your money dude. 
---
Rifle/vats is my favorite build in the game by a wide margin and it can hold its own in all phases of end game.  If youre looking for the absolute strongest build overall, its probably not it.
---
i've managed to stay on for 5 minutes!!    it seemed to start when i went to watoga, could just be confirmation bias or whatever, but i've left and, fingers crossed, it seems ok. 
---
I'm having the same problem 
---
Haters love to hate. Everyone here likes the game tho so your free to delete r/gaming and join us. There's also fo76 that is mostly decent
---
You likely used the trap disarm to cheat a ton of fuel if you honestly think its fine
---
I thought so too, I just wanted them to come out and say it do I could call them on their BS
---
I got all recipes on xbox
---
Personally speaking, when I drop off stuff, it’ll generally be in the register for vendors, so always check those cash registers! (Or overseers cache)
---
It's going to very likely require budget, for a few reasons-- not the least of which is that using budget lets Bethesda control and track how much impact a camp is having on servers. If they let us place as many objects as we like things would get messy real fast. 
---
I'm personally just hoping for increased budget. 25% would be good enough for the feature, I think, though 50-100% increase would give me something to celebrate. :-p  
---
Just buy it somewhere if it's that cheap. If you dont like it your not out much
---
I dont want a world chat but I do want a bubble over my head or something or use the subtitle system once your close to another player.
---
CD Keys has it for like £8 in Europe and MidEast
---
Looked through other posts and figured it out. Next to rose is a holotape. Listen to it and while its playing talk to her and the quest advances
---
I gave up. I’m not wasting my limited game time on it tonight. Going to play Crackdown 3. :)
---
Lmao I'm always saying shit about how obsidian shoulda handled fo76 for real tho.
---
     We killed her twice last night. 1st no problem. 2nd took a while. 
---
     I hip shoot her with 50. Till she lands then I build up a crit with the All Rise. When she takes off I use that crit with the 50. Then go back to hip. 
---
    Rinse, repeat. Melts her hp away. 
---
Just wait till you get banned for buying it.
---
I assume it is low because .308 is the most common ammo?    
---
Crafting Shotgun Shells sucks because it requires 10 Plastic to create 12 Shells!
---
Feels cool
---
All day today the game has been laggy, frozen or disconnected me. Haven’t had this much trouble before...
---
That's pretty much it in a nutshell, but they are hesitant to buy a game that they don't know if they will end up enjoying it. If it doesn't have a demo they're a freakin' hard unit to sell to. Heck I had to buy them PUBG, with a condition they would pay me back if they ended up liking it. Got my money back there. Doesn't help that it's around NZ$60 on special for F76. He's seen my playstyle, melee Power armor build, but is more the pick 'em off at a distance type player. Doesn't understand how we could play together with such different styles. 'I'm the bait' is my usual reply, you can pop shots off while they chase me. I'm good at running like a scaredy cat when I need to. 😉
---
I have 20 clip with perforating.
---
From the glassed cavern,whent today and got a bos heavy combat left arm,sometimes there is more than one piece on the body and if you get there and the scorch beast hasn't spawned run past the fissure and the body is on the right next to a couple of dead besties once you get it carry on forward and there is a lift in the end cave.
---
I'd say jump in now and start capping up for the next update! Roadmap looked dope AF. Lots of fun stuff coming and it's a good time to start prepping to hit the ground running
---
Chicks with... Something?
---
Let's leave it at that...
---
Common yes, but  enemies drop  them in the single digits.  To make the gun viable you'd have to kill around 500 enemies carrying .308 ammo.  It doesn't help that one of the patched nerfed .308 drops.
---
Get super duper as well as ammo smith. It certain ammo is great to craft and others arent. 
---
Yeah, I feel you. I just found fun in running a shop and farming my own legendaries. It's gonna get a lot more interesting, it looks like
---
switched my stock to forceful with a small hit to accuracy for more durability.
---
switched my drum mag to perforating, 20 clip but ignores more dmg.
---
and switched my muzzle to muzzle break for better per-shot recoil and a little more range.
---
thanks everybody so much!
---
But OP was looking to give his extra away to someone who couldn't afford it. Not someone that is just too cheap.
---
So if he's farming him for caps and the minimum cost to initiate a claim is 25 caps, at best he makes 20 caps per kill. If he's level 126, that means one death voids 6 kills' worth of profit. Really the only way this gets extended out is if your friend keeps seeking revenge. 
---
If you don't want to get farmed, don't seek revenge.
---
The problem is, while super-mutants have less energy resistance... no armor reduction effects work on energy resist, so ultimately with most weapons you’ll still do more damage with ballistics, because unless you have zero perks/legendary/mod effects reducing damage, they will usually have less DR than ER after reduction. 
---
Tse still has more dps bro, what's with this meta nonsense. I'll stick with strait up math.
---
Then you shouldn't be surprised when you receive a thumbs down angry face double emotes! The harshest retaliation we can manage!
---
I do... but only for RP purposes, and even then the only way I make it viable is with my low-health build (I have Bloodied laser and bloodied plasma gun.) 
---
Laser rifle with Tricentennial colors works fairly well with Nuka-Girl outfit! 
---
I have them both. The max output for .308 ammo with both of them is 21 rounds. 
---
For minigun ammo, which has an equally high rate of fire, the output with those perks is 180 rounds, 360 if super duper kicks in.
---
.308 drops in much smaller quantities nowadays.  It’s terrible for the LMG.  Far less effective than any other use.
---
Yes! But with far less and different mods on it.
---
Like i said, it sucks but its how it is.
---
Yep, it’s been pointed out countless times, .308 was a bad choice for a heavy weapon.
---
Counts for bear arms; damage comes from demolition expert; Stabilized reduces DR against it. 
---
My main weapons are:
---
* Combat Shotgun (3* with Instigating, +50% limb damage and +25% reload speed).
---
* Anti-Armour Lever Action
---
* Furious Handmade
---
* Two-Shot The Dragon (I have two of these; I found one and my wife found the other).
---
Other weapons I have but aren't the mainstays:
---
* Vampire's Combat Shotgun
---
* Two-Shot Pipe Bolt-Action Rifle
---
* Blade of Bastet
---
* Furious Gauss Rifle
---
All are modded with Hardened Receivers and Perforating Magazines where applicable.
---
That sounds like me last week, exactly that had just over 2k caps, then met Grahm on the road. he made me an offer I couldn't refuse, well it was what I have been saving for. even though I cannot make one yet lol.
---
I’d vastly prefer different ammo types to different magazine types. With a select-fire for single-full auto, to boot! Would be amazingn.
---
Just go kill legendaries.
---
That is true, as I said before, he's a hard sell, short of giving him my disc and waiting for him to get around his reluctance to try new games, I don't see him getting it for himself. Might have to give him FO4 and see if he plays past the point of the first Deathclaw without complaining about it.
---
Yeah I know it's been point it out.  Just doing it again in the hope that someone will get the message lol.  If they don't people having 180 rounds  for sniper rifles or whatever, then why can't they just make light machine guns run on 50 cal or 5mm ammo? 
---
It is a way of tracking how many hours you have played. 7600 is just under a year of in game time
---
There are four. ;)
---
PS4, taking longer than usual to load in right now.
---
Because it's bottom-tier trash
---
It's not real achievement. It's there just to track how many hours you've played.
---
You don't need to get your commendations from enclave events, you can get them from normal events, providing they have legendary enemies.
---
[It is](https://imgur.com/gallery/NPfEDTR). They don't have a check next to their username when commenting but they do on their page.
---
K
---
I see plenty of legit retailer discounts for consoles but non for PC.  You can try ebay (?) or sites such as cdkey (???) but buyer neware.
---
7600 Atoms shoul be the reward imo.
---
I dont cheat actually. I have 800 fuel on me right now. The flamer isn't a main hand weapon like people want it to be. Its a spur of the moment weapon that i only use for queen fights. Like i said, i dont see the fuss. Its not to expensive to craft alot if you have the materials. 
---
10 Acid, 5 Oil, 2 Steel. You just need to hold a workshop that produces both for awhile. Abandoned bog town has both. Federal Disposal has both oil and acid as well. 
---
To be honest the only thing expensive is the Acid. Which you could have your base setup permanently on a resource collector for acid. 
---
Then you can buy 100 fuel for 200 caps at various vendors. I have 15,000 caps laying around. So i've started buying all the Fuel i see. Same goes for Nuka-Cola's. Theres nothing to spend caps on anyway. 
---
He wasn't seeking revenge lol. 
---
I can explain it easy and simple. The sniper was just trolling him lol. 
---
He could have deposited the stash in a stash box in the work station. He didn't really give a shit. However, because the level 45 wasn't seeking revenge. He was using the workshop as a way to initiate pvp regardless.
---
It seemed like he was just toying with him. Seeing as he couldn't pick up on what was going on lol.
---
If you are doing the SBQ then all the participants of the event are put into party, so no violence as long as the event is taking place. Anyway the endgame content of the game = other players.
---
A good ass game, that's hella fun. Don't worry about all this crap, especially the comments about disconnecting and the game freezing (if you have a good computer that is) just enjoy it, there's not much of a learning curve. It's pure fun that's fairly easy.
---
Not arguing with you, but are you sure about this ?
---
I have read before that more chameleon pieces makes it work even better ? :/
---
Is there some way we can actually test this out ?
---
Walked up to a pack of scorched along a road and shot one in the head and his three friends around him dropped dead, I thought they were playing possum at first.
---
Weapon degradation really does suck. I have a double capacity explosive combat shotgun. 16 rounds a mag. I fire 3 mags, and barely into the 4th and I'm broken. Very silly. Not sure if a weapon is explosive, it has more degradation?
---
i will just add that i started as rifleman, but went commando later.  my tse auto combat rifle still does above 110 or so, and i dont think i have the best receiver yet.
---
that being said maybe spec into shotty for option #2?
---
Why not just make a circuit of whitesprings, server hop and repeat until your inventory is completely full of legendary gear?  I agree that the endless waves of ghouls at Violent Night is cool, but it's not the most efficient method.
---
If you're a rifle/pistol/shotgun guy, complete the main quest line up to I Am Become Death, equip starched genes and buy marsupial.  Run through the area, grab all the aggro, jump on top of a roof and fire at will.  A tesla rifle with an auto barrel will help your tremendously when other players are around, allowing you to "tag" all the mobs and get loot and xp.  Set yourself to passive mode, shoot at the guy in power armor blocking the golf club doorway, and the shots will arc to everything in a certain radius.
---
That reminds me I have a lot of gunpowder I need to offload. I'm glad to see from your post and the comments that people look in the suitcases.
---
Right in front of the Capital Building, 2 - 3 snallygasters spawn there consistently, you must of seen them.
---
Also in the dried lake bed in toxic valley if you want higher levels, 1-2 always spawn in the area consistently.
---
Toxic Larry’s meat to the west of Berkeley springs has 3. 
---
Hemlock holes has 2. 
---
There’s usually one just west of the capitol building as well. 
---
Hemlock holes golf course near the downed helicopter I think, and Toxic Larry's Meat and go east of the savage divide near Seneca rocks.
---
Worth noting, despite the new announcement on the title screen, this is still the DB Technical School jacket from Fallout 4.  It's not the varsity track suit from VTU.
---
Just something to follow. On another community someone tried their hardest to convince people that a TSE hunting rifle 3* star with 25% faster fire rate was worth 21k. Solely because it was TSE.  
---
After finally firing a TSE I don’t see what the big deal is. I feel I have more damage with my quad lever. 
---
I know this post is old, but I just found the tower after following the tracks/road and clearing the Freak Show first. I was sad and confused when I found Rufus and Dave in the raider cage (not knowing the back story) but I absolutely lost my shit when I got to the top of the ranger tower later and read the note. Annnnd now I'm crying. Gutted me and made me miss my irl baby...RIP Butaa &lt;3
---
If you need acid Abraxo cleaner and industrial solvent are all over the place at Whitesprings.
---
I could care less. BGS should have just hired the team from NV
---
&gt; 800 fuel
---
That is about 160 seconds of fuel, and that recipe only makes 5 at a time
---
People would just dump caps to greif without fear of cap loss
---
Actually its 9 at a time. 
---
Gauss rifle would be better unless they nerfed it in the last month.
---
so i thought i would post my current build so you guys can compare. all my rifles are running max armor pen right now. i would use a lever action but there's armor pen mod for it. [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f847c5&amp;d=s01pd2pk2pp2pl2pe2sb2ej4eo2c72ic4ar2ao0au2l71lt2a04ia0i30&amp;w=&amp;n=Mister](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f847c5&amp;d=s01pd2pk2pp2pl2pe2sb2ej4eo2c72ic4ar2ao0au2l71lt2a04ia0i30&amp;w=&amp;n=Mister)
---
and yes his name is mister.
---
Depends on your build, of course. I go with shielded raider underarmors, because of the per/agi/luck boosts they give to my Bloodied Vats Sniper.
---
On my Power armor, crafter main, I go with shielded Casual underarmor, because it’s all about int/cha/luck boosts, which I make use of when crafting selling, IE, only time I’m out of power armor.
---
I was referring to the "golf shirts" that you find in the clubhouse.
---
It’s a Missing or corrupted game asset/texture. Just a glitch in your game.
---
Biggest gripes I have are pathetic legendary drops, lack of good legendary loot spots (there were decent places but Bethesda gimped them),  server still horrifically unstable, stash and carry limits still too low. As others complained Bethesda needs to stop gimping and actually buffing drops and events otherwise it feels like you really aren't doing much but grinding for crap endlessly. There are times I have to stop playing because it feels like I'm in a dumpster diving simulator where everything has been picked through alreay. Whitesprings has gotten old two months ago. Still playing but getting bored with the lack of loot and really bad server issues.
---
Less effort, easier to accomplish at a lower level (for the EXP), doesn't require server hopping, and all the non-legendary loot ends up in a neat little pile. 
---
&gt; Actually its 9 at a time with perks...
---
So 5 at a time, possible to get 9 if you buy all the perk cards to make more.  Shows that you are doubling down on bad game design.  9 fuel takes 2 seconds to burn
---
 Good for 'nades though, worth having. Who knows they might fix it some day. ;)
---
I see that happening sometimes.. I think it's just lag.
---
Then it won’t show. You have to spend the perks to unlock the higher ranks. As far as perks go, the system treats you as if you’re level 42
---
So this Radial Wheel behaviour may be cross platform, that is always interesting to know.
---
Not sure where it's silly. Hope you don't mean time travel. It's honestly a cliche, but I think it would fix a lot in ways nothing else can.
---
Your not wrong. Crafting Fuel is stupid. It should be 50 Fuel. Doesn't help the flamer breaks in like 400 Fuel. 
---
I know that the gauss rifle is better but I’m currently to low of a level to use or find one.
---
What platform are you on? As this looks like a cross platform issue.
---
Had a feeling. They have some kind of bug affecting when the game goes to find an item in your inventory. Ever notice when you pick up a legendary item, if you already have one of that same type of item in your inventory, it shows you that item first?
---
Also, I've heard many people have a bug where you can't keep two of the same gun on the quick wheel. Try keeping that level 50 gun in your stash and the issue will probably go away. Pretty sure one of the community reps said they were aware of the issue and would be fixing it.
---
NV was my favorite. Played it over like 3x really heavy. "Love &amp; Hate" were my bread and butter bro.
---
My friend quit playing the game over this specifically, he ranted on here a few times about how terrible it was spending 700 times longer to get mats and craft to make ammo for a weapon than it does to use that ammo
---
What really needs fixing so bad that you would introduce the fourth dimension and time travel like this? No offense, dude, but it's absurd.
---
PS4 
---
😭PS4 
---
I’m buying one tonight or tomorrow I hold onto. 
---
Gotcha I think u have to be 35 for it and 25 for the lever 
---
Hmmm ok
---
To be honest being a bloodied vat snipers myself  fighting other sneak snipers  is the most hard and balanced fights I have in this game.
---
You can't use vats since both are mostly crouch and who get spotted first is dead due to the low health aspect of the build. So it all comes to strategic postining  and good aiming.
---
I have no problem making .308. I craft ammo in amounts equal to the current guns mag count.  I apply that logic to all my guns. 
---
I'm sorry to hear that.
---
I had the opposite experience today.
---
It was just my accounts in a server for about 11 hours.
---
Best 11 hours since Bethesda started strictly  enforcing the fun/hour limit.
---
I even powered all three power plants and took over the munitions factory just because.
---
As someone who sunk weeks into the game and is Lv.110 it is because the game is pretty garbage. I mean for $60 you got a lag filled game with 0 end game content. 
---
I mean honestly most people expected more from Bethesda that’s what it comes down to, the game seems like a beta, the devs are slow on fixes to exploits, and they don’t listen to the community. 
---
This is my personal opinion and I know I’m gonna get downvoted to hell for speaking against the game but I’d like to answer your question from the point of view of someone who dislikes the game. 
---
Yeah but the damage was around 120 before adren. It's working even though it says it doesn't. That's a bloodied lvl 10 sniper.
---
0/10 do not hire.  Died then left the server.
---
Not the original commenter but I usually hack all the computers and turn the robots against each other
---
Only 316.66 days to complete playing 24 hours a day, I don’t even think I hit that back in my WoW days 😂
---
Hey man, have you tried a ghoul slayer? If so how does it stack up compared to your others in whitesprings? 
---
Exactly how i feel about it. The fight dragged for so long lol and it was sweaty in its own sense.
---
Yeah the server issues are what is really driving me away. fact that these angry fan boys will defend but that's the in light of constant server crashes and Game closing out randomly with no warning in the middle of fights is just hilarious. We're at fault for playing the game and being annoyed? Hahahaha!!!
---
Nice!  I've been ok fo4 about 20 min now... really strange
---
There is no risk on buying on instantgaming. The key still works because is a 100% legal copy as all they rest of the keys they sell. The problem is that people confuses instant gaming with web sites like G2A or Kinguin. I have bought hitman 2 battlefield V, Fallout76, Metro exodus and 4 or 5 more games I cant remember now and all of the work perfectly. Check the score of the website on trusted reviews to convince yourself.
---
They should have a .308 magazine for LMGs that act like cores do for laser gatlings. Could also work making tanks for flamers.
---
Nah. Only while you remain “undetected”. It’s weird, but once they tag you with a bullet they can VATS you now.
---
Always carry a PA frame. Place it on the top edge of the hole and enter it.
---
I have quad lever and tse lever and the difference is about 30-40dmg. That guy is an idiot it's worth 15k max. Rifles benefit more from crit traits than tse or explosive combined tho.ffr on rifle is dumb since there bolt action mostly. There's a reddit post here somewhere that breaks down the math between tse and AAE which are arguable best rolls in game. Tse won by a small margin against queen who has highest dmg threshold. Everything weaker than her has weaker armor further enlarging the dmg margin between the 2. Funny couse I have .50cal of both best guns in game supposedly but I'm rocking a bloody fir axe lolz
---
Jump back in! Much more stable and it’s better to level up before the updates. Game is great and so much content!
---
Lmao I didn’t leave I was trying to get plastic which is something I asked for repeatedly and you ignored me you also were offline so I couldn’t find you so don’t come at me like that saying 0/10 when your ass took my caps then dipped reported
---
I always put stuff in the ice machine in front the Whitesprings golf course clubhouse. I am where I am in this game because of random acts of kindness. So, I try to do the same. I was trying to trade with a guy in his base today. Dude got made I wouldnt come off of the weapons he wanted then tried to kill me and then locked me in his base. I wrecked every single thing I could then server hopped and messaged a low guy I played with earlier to come and kill me. Dude got a stack of caps for almost nothing. 
---
My tse version is gathering dust even as we speak.
---
I would always make a new character for a different playstyle. 
---
Most haters played the beta for like an hour. Also much of the negative reviews are from people who have never actually played the game. 
---
I have two characters, a stealth rifleman and an alt power armor melee that I'm actually having way more fun with.
---
The rifle guy (lvl 150-ish) has an instigating/vats-acc lever gun for long range, and a lvl 35 2shot/explosive/faster reload handmade for quick engagement and close quarters interiors.  The lever gun has a medium scope, the handmade has a dot sight, and both are modded with stabilized long barrel/stock, hardened receiver and suppressor.  I'd mod the handmade with aligned or true mods, but 2-shot hipfire accuracy is horrid.  I just aim at everything.  He also has a last ditch instigating/+40%swing/90% less weight combat knife with a stealth blade for mole rats and low level critters, so as not to waste ammo.
---
The melee (lvl 130-ish) has an anti-armor/+40%swing/+1ag super sledge and a backup 2-shot/vats acc .44 pistol for flying scorchbeasts and pesky enemies on ledges.  I also carry a mutants/+40%swing/+15% blocking fire axe just in case the sledge breaks.  The sledge has a heating coil mod, the axe has a sharp mod, and the pistol is modded with a hardened receiver, stabilized long barrel/grip and a reflex sight.
---
Love me some kraken 
---
I'm not coming back till there's a significant content update. So most likely vaults in the summer.
---
Same basic issue, at some point in the past my favorites wheel locked and it resets every time I restart the game to that point. I don't use one of the weapons any more so it's annoying.
---
keep 5 bulk, sell the rest. they’re everywhere
---
Thank you. I was pretty sure I farmed out most mods, and wanted to check in case these would be the next screw farm. 
---
Isn't the entire Fallout series a Vault-Tec simulation for Vault Dwellers to prepare for life in the Wasteland? Or was that retconned?
---
yeah they hang out there i dont think they have cargo on them though
---
Yeah, theres a weird closet in sugar grove too.
---
"Reported"
---
Oh wow, now I really want to hire you.
---
Don’t worry kill them in survival and make them drop em all when it comes out 
---
I just found a non legendary blunderbuss that does insane damage. I also found a sick non legendary ultracite laser gatling gun....dropped off a level 80 diseased scorch beast. 
---
The survival mode itself is said to emphasize on PvP. From my previous experience in online fallout games (I played thousands of hours in some unofficial online fallouts), the fact of being able to be killed by other players anytime have had tremendous effect on PvE, it made simple action of grinding exp thrilling and potentially risky. Survival servers will be like this, bud I'd love for it to be not only PvP grindfest, I'd love them to be a place where PvE oriented people can get a distilled survival experience with some serious sons of a bitches raiders that yoy have to run away from. This is why I come out with the proposition for making Whitesprings a safer (not safe, just safer) area.
---
Best friend of Both Sides.
---
Im running 3 melee weapons only.
---
Zealot Meat hook (3 star-take 40% less damage, +30% damage to scorched, +50% limb damage, with a extra hook mod) this does 1440 damage for me
---
Vampire Switchblade (3 star- Take 40% less damage, 40% more power attack damage, gain health with every hit, and the serrated blade mod) this does 300 damage for me but one of my most powerful weapon
---
Furious Machete (4 star- 40% power attack damage, targets bleed and are poisoned, damage increased after every hit, 90% reduced weight, with the sacrificial blade mod)  FYI IM CURRENTLY TRYING TO TRADE OR SELL THIS ONE... IF YOU HAVE A 3 STAR BLOODIED MELEE WEAPON YOU WANNA TRADE FOR THIS LET ME KNOW    this does like 800 damage for me
---
Im running a low health stealth vats melee build
---
I have a level 40 2* gronak axe.   (Bloodied and 50% returned when blocking).
---
Any interest in it?  
---
I use them in my head, along with plenty of loose screws O\_o
---
Stormy Daniels?
---
I've had numerous legendary enemies fall through the made. 
---
Lack of NPCs, lack of purpose, content (for those that have played through the 'quests'), lack of any real hope. Game would be ten times better if following the despair of having to relive tragedies, then being able to do something about them and fix things before the region is ruined, because that's what it is, ruined. 
---
We explore hopeless ruins. If the game was meant to give us a sense of rebuilding, then it failed. There's not enough server capacity, not enough roles players can fill, etc. It doesn't work. Good attempt, and I get it, but they couldn't execute. Time for a ret-con.
---
I’m sorry for my ignorance but could you explain the legendaries on the weapon?
---
*Cough*, what about the 900hour guy 
---
900 guy needs to give me some incite
---
I guess you guys talk over psn and not discord eh? 
---
Because i would love to join but my setup right now is kinda based arround using my headset on pc while playing ps4. \^\^"
---
Sleep is overrated -\_-
---
There is no need for a player hub if there is no risk. There is no reward if there is no risk. The only possibility of players hubs to emerge are to create risks for not participating in those players hubs, and create rewards (i.e. being able to participate in survival mode special rewards that were kind of announced) for this paricipation.
---
I have about 680 hrs in.  Have a 190 and a 55.  Have spent a lot of time building, otherwise I would be well over 200 on my main and have 2 50+ guys
---
I did this quest in the beta when them shits actually spawned. Question is, why didn’t you?
---
Well I have no idea, I mean some people have a lot of time in their hands and I guess still like getting leggies/maxing their characters out
---
The same thing happened to me, go to it while you're in game as opposed to on the main menu.
---
On PC, I've been playing for hours at a time without a disconnect, this does show that different platforms are experiencing their own unique issues. 
---
I'm assuming they are not working and have a lot of time on their hands
---
Again, you can go on recent pe in fallout 76's social place and friend him there
---
yeah we did that too.
---
Bloody mess in luck
---
The game or r/gaming ?
---
Alright, all I had to say 
---
How does it taste?
---
Unless they changed the drop rate probably around 1-2K caps.
---
Thank you :)
---
Lol not how in that sense.
---
Six patches in nearly five months? No wonder this game is dead.
---
Welcome, stay safe in Appalachia 
---
gears are used in a lot of melee weapon repair. like the super sledge and mole miner's gauntlet &gt;!(atleast i think so)!&lt;
---
I'm lvl 275 to be at that lvl you have to be in the "looter" mentality , like playing diablo who hasnt done every quest there is to do in those games but you play it to get better gear
---
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn
---
Your idea is ridiculous. Every half-baked plan to insert human NPCs into this game so far has been ridiculous. The entire game would actually be ruined with your idea. Your idea would ruin a game that isn't that great in the first place.
---
There _are_ NPCs. Human NPCs would be just as bland as robots, because you can't talk to them. Your character is silent, so any human would be exactly the same as a robot in every way, they'd just look like us. The purpose is to survive. It's not the greatest purpose, but it's there. I can't argue against the game needing new content, but this is not the way to get it. 
---
The lack of hope is intentional. All the Vault-Tec propaganda about rebuilding the world, and your character is met with hopeless ruins. You want to play a game about rebuilding? Play Fallout 4 again. Wanna bring life to the Wasteland? Replay Fallout 3. Want a proper RP experience? Play Fallout: New Vegas, that game never gets old, imo.
---
Don't throw stupid ideas that wouldn't even work in a Lovecraft novel. The game needs content, not humans.
---
There's no main quest if there's humans.
---
You want to change the entire identity of the game. If you want it changed that much, you gotta ask yourself if you even _like_ the game in the first place.
---
I’m still maxing my makeshift warrior perk card. I’ll be farming lead forever so I’ll keep that in mind before I start a respec. 
---
Cept for nuked areas right? 
---
Damn shame
---
I’ve had many different favourite weapons in my 100 or so hours but currently my go to is a Supressed Two Shot 10mm with +33% VATS accuracy. I like to sneak around VATS killing everything with sneak damage.
---
For tougher mobs I have an Instigating Black Power Pistol. Its hella fun one shotting mobs with VATS crits using this old school pipe pistol. 
---
For Whitespring specifically I use All Rise because it’s just easier than trying to use a gun on the hordes of ghouls. 
---
Last week, I was grateful for the hate the game attracts when I was buying my mic from a nerdy store. The sales guy asked me what game I wanted the mic for, I told him it was for 76. He rolled his eyes, sneered and proceeded to give me $45 off the mic because he felt sorry for me! 🤣🤣🤣
---
You come across as so far up your own ass your tonsils are blocking the view.
---
Yes.  It does.  
---
But you do not have to keep doing them.  Just skip to Glassed Cavern and go to the last one.  The others are just back story audio.  
---
There are many people in the world who are sick and on welfare or have their own money, who find playing games of any sort relaxing and therapeutic, much like reading or listening to music. Something you can do in your own home and when you feel up to it.
---
We would not think it odd for somebody to read dozens of books or listen to hundreds of hours of classical music, a symphony can be 2 hours long operas longer.
---
I kind of think socializing online inside games is more stimulating to the mind than watching hours of trash TV. Just my opinion.
---
Are you serious? I can just skip to the end?
---
Didn't you also grief two low level players in a mine at one point? Maybe you should stop being a hypocrite. 
---
Nope, but thanks for the gross assumption. 
---
Yes.  They just guide you to the area.  But each transponder is not required to complete it.  The last transponder is the important one.  So run inside the Glassed Cavern and enjoy.  
---
Never used VATS in Fallout games, doesn't suit my play style and seems like cheating.
---
Yeah, after being in the same scenario I just went straight to the end, and it works
---
Oh my goodness, thanks for the info. Still frustrating since I have to go through the cavern with enemies again but better than what I thought.
---
Have a nice day ☺️
---
Yep. Visited twice and never again.
---
That just grinds my gears. 
---
get out more.
---
Legendary three star sir quite jelly 
---
Seriously, look at the comment chain you're replying to.  But since you're not willing to do that...
---
I replied to "... There is no room for raiders in MY Fallout!""
---
 With "Yeaaah. Some of us "aren't sacks of shit" so when we see griefers, we're not fans?"
---
To which you replied "People that don’t share kills are not griefers.". Completely missing my fucking point. 
---
Killing ScorchBeasts or anything with a knife must be more fun than 1 shotting them and just buggering off. Being OP unless you need to kill other players to get your thrills must just make the game dull and pointless.
---
I've not owned any OP weapon so this is my assumption.
---
You could avoid bounties and players kills penalties that way
---
When I first started this game, I used to fear Super Mutants. Now I just shoot them in the face and walk away. Laughing at their threats.
---
How many * does it have and how much will it cost?
---
How was the pvp initiation if I may ask?
---
Were you wanted and he came at you, or did he hit first and you responded or was it the other way around?
---
Once you figure out this game, it’s almost like a massage. All you do is log in, kill some ghouls, grab some stuff, transfer it to your mule, get out. 
---
I don’t really play the game hardcore anymore but I repeat this process at least 10 times before I stop playing the game, so about 45 mins, and I get anywhere from 1-3 levels each little session.
---
I do this about twice a day, and started doing this about a month ago.
---
I’m about level 160 right now and I started this process at level 120.
---
You can be quite casual and gain a lot of levels fast since level doesn’t really matter or change after 50.
---
Never heard of that before. Have heard of 76s experiment being that they put America’s best and brightest into a simulation. Not every fo game tho
---
Yeah I read that this was an intentional change. I dont think its for the better though. I find myself accidentally scrapping some bulked junk I had recently crafted to sell. If you got back all the plastic, no big deal, otherwise you need to go on the hunt for more plastic which is hard to come by. Bethesda, please return this to how it was. :'(
---
Exactly. I so lever action as long range and handmade with a dot sight for close(r) range. Perforating mag gives you 20 shots and reloaded fairly quick. Double bonus that both .45 and 5.56 ammo is so much cheaper to make compared to .308
---
I did the same after following r/fo76 advice, got to make my ultracite PA and have never worn it, wish I could display it in my base :(
---
What's more annoying is a sent. Assassin in stealth boy.
---
Only counter is staggering, which I need to get myself a good build to counter it.
---
I watched him kill a lower level guy (49), then I made finger guns at him.  He hit me, then I hit him, then he died, demanded plastic, and left.  I could see him on my friendslist but nowhere on the map.  Idk why he was crouching all the time, but I couldn't give him any plastic because of it.  I fast traveled to his location and made some follow me emotes.  Then he left the server.
---
Didn't know this, thanks.
---
Now, if we could just get them to start begging for mercy and wetting themselves, it would be perfect.
---
I've found that late at night here in California, a lot of Japanese and Chinese players are logging on. Saturday nights seem to be the most dead, sometimes I'm the only one on the map.
---
I don’t watch youtube or any tutorials on fallout. I’ve just never seen anyone with the outfit, or anyone on reddit
---
Spoiler FTW ;)
---
I have one too ill post sometim
---
this is a really good idea, thx
---
For lore consistency, it'd be important for a Nuka cola to cost a single cap to craft. But as a player who hoards the stuff. I'd want nothing more than to be able to craft it.
---
Probably a troll but you never know
---
Its not too hard solo, just be prepared. Def bring power armor becsuse the amount of robots is stupid af
---
I mean, i just put about eight hours into building, tearing down, re-building, tearing down, and re-building my pumping station. Just as a for example. 
---
I use to start a fight or end fight depending on the enemy. 
---
Lol
---
Me and my buddies like to do free trial pvp in monster mash. Because the pvp is open for both.
---
I noticed he said he was using a deathclaw. A body gaurd would definetly need a larger arsenal to deal with any encounter. Esp. With all these high end game builds. 
---
Melee weapons are great for pve, but in pvp. Your opponent wouldn't be waiting for you to close the gap. He should have a larger arsenal ( That isn't broken as well)
---
As for the pvp initiation, he should have known who ever hits first is more likely to lose. Because you obviously had the first shot and followed with a powerful blow to end his career.
---
Although, killing wanted players as a melee user is quite easy. They can't hit you and it only starts when you are best situated. So there is that. He could possibly be useful for your employment if need be.
---
This game needs some major work i agree. Its crazy that simple number changes take so long. Energy weapon balancing is taking months. This is standard for Bethesda games, its no different over at Elder Scrolls Online. 
---
Pretty sure in the VDSG for Fallout, Fallout 2 and even Fallout 3 the game was described as a special Vault-Tec simulation to help prepare for the future. That might have just been marketing, however.
---
