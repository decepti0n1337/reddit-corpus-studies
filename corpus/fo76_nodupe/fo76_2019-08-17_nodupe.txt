Camp on an acid node ;)

---
Acid: Snallygasters, wendigo teeth, rat poison, occasional loose jars, cave crickets, bloodbugs.  player vendors, antifreeze containers.
---
Gunpowder: super mutants.  Scrap prewar money and burnt books for cloth, cloth + acid = gunpowder
---
thes more sources, but those are what I remember off the top of my head

---
The only turtle neck outfit that springs to mind was the communist outfit from the atomic shop but I don't think it's available anymore. Unless you purchased it.
---
Sure it is. If I log in once a week for 7 hours for 10 weeks I'm playing just as much as the person who logs in 7 times a week for 1 hour for 10 weeks.
---
It's the exact same amount of time committed. 70 hours. Just as active.
---
I'm looking forward to Watchdogs and Cyberpunk, so I can leave...
---
Why would you exclude players like that tho?
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
That's a lot of complaining when people can easily grind away with just an hour a day gameplay. 
---
BETHESDA EVUL. REEEEEEW! is running rampant. What surprises me is suppsed adults bitching like 3 year olds
---
Hmmm...it‚Äôs an ok shitpost. Elizabeth Holmes approves.
---
I prefer a fine powdery flour.
---
Same here. I have a low level but my 2 main characters are at level 205 and 300. And it takes a bit to level my low level, and I don't want to waste game time playing just to grind a low level up after reset and miss out on doing stuff with my 2  mains.
---
The only ones I have done are the place camp. For those simply join game and let it start and run to a clearing - enter pipboy - select place camp -  turn 90* and repeat two more times and your done
---
I‚Äôm not excluding anyone.. just explaining the season as it‚Äôs designed. It‚Äôs not a participation trophy.
---
I mean I skipped 2 weeks, and im 2 behind and will probably be ahead when double score comes, but go off.
---
I'm in the same boat as you.  Never worried about specific build.  Now I am beginning to work on a heavy gun build.  Got all 3 heavy gunner cards maxed now I'm saving points to fi ish the rest
---
Who the hell down votes this? Dicks
---
1000 levels will give you 3600 perk points, that is enough to levelup 7.2 cards, 6 cards will require 833.3 levels
---
Don‚Äôt we awl?
---
That‚Äôs what I thought. Thanks
---
Tent is extremely nice.
---
 If you would buy atoms anyways, its actually cheaper for the atoms (198 atoms/$1). 
---
Stashbox has ways to reap benefits without more than 1 month subscription.
---
Private server is great for farming without people ruining a run.
---
I'll let you decide if it's worth from that. Some people find that worth, some won't.
---
So, before the daily challenges would give you Atoms. Now, you can use real money to put atoms into the daily challenges (and move on in the board)... And we have to accept that... Sadly

Yup I loaded into nuke zone today and nothing happened except taking rads u till I could hop into power armor
---
The problem with EA tricks from Bethesda is that they can‚Äôt balance between the dedicated hardcore players from reddit and the casual majority and in doing so they screw both. EA on the other hand would always strive due to FIFA and other sports games. FO76 is another theme and the approach of Bethesda chosen for development and support of the game may cause the Fallout series to die.

Wow it's my first cake day

---
If you dont get enough mats to stabilize it all, no worries - when the glux goes inert, you can drink it, and its lighter than purified water.
---
I also only play about an hour a day, maybe more if I'm lucky. I also didn't start playing until about a month in, and I'm not that far from the rocketship. I pretty much just accepted that I won't be able to get every reward, but aren't these battle passes designed so not everyone can get the highest reward? Every other game that has them, I was always under the impression that not every player is meant to get every reward. And if you really want to get them all but cant put in the time, then you have the option to buy it.
---
Not offended at all...I just think ppl like u r pathetic....you just want to.horde the world and have the company accommodate your petty wants. Part of the game is weight management. Sorry, but not sorry, that u think I'm a rude little cunt, but sometimes the truth hurts. I actually take pride that u think I am such, means I hit a nerve. Still made me smile üòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
If you zoom out there's a scorched plinking away at the fuse box with his pipe pistol.
---
I‚Äôll give you 17 steel, 16 lead, and 23 copper scrap for all that flux.
---
But saying it's only for dedicated players which I guess you mean daily players and having the battle pass catered to them is excluding other players.
---
I guess I must have missed out on him jumping ship. I started playing again in late April and have stayed current on news from around then. Haven‚Äôt done too much digging into the historical videos - but I do appreciate the info! There‚Äôs much to be learned from the opposite perspective
---
Maybe it seems like that if you aren't actually playing it, but especially with the extra daily score and a second double score weekend coming up soon there's been more than enough to go days even a week without playing and not fall behind at all. 
---
I get pretty busy and there's entire days I couldn't play, most days I knock out the easy stuff everything but level up and nuclear winter in under an hour, most in about 30 min. If I have time I play a bit more and knock out some weekly and extra XP to get my level. I'll only do NW if it's incredibly easy like drop camp or use stimpacks. 
---
I have zero doubt I'll get completion on this and even if I had missed even more days you get enough free atoms just playing through the score run to buy 10 lvls if you wanted meaning you could just get to lvl 90, buy the completion with the free atoms and still unlock everything. 
---
Yeah if you just play once or twice a week it would be difficult but there's people out there who power leveled through XP and got completion already weeks ago based mostly on just xp farming so if someone really wanted to they could probably do it just playing on weekends or whatever.
---
If he's a really close friend you can do the primary/secondary account deal where all he has to do is just download it. One of the few games you can have 2 different sessions playing with the same game on 2 different consoles. Lot of trust doing this though

Vampire .50 MG and a lot of ammo. Tank all the way. Come at me Bro!
---
I work 11 hour days im level 82 in the legendary run and have been working through the pandemic its not hard to to do at all the dailies takes me 15-20 mins to complete and the weeklies usually get done on there own via doing the dailies. Weekly challenge is usually to capture 5 workshops and do 10 events and complete a a gold star daily challenge plus like one or 2 other ones including the repeatable. Daily challenges usually involve capturing a workshop and/or completing a event  so not sure how your struggling.
---
You know this is based on a 1950s society right?
---
Ahhhh... This is fine
---
My first reaction to seeing clumps of scorched falling down in front of the siren. Lol!
---
yes, if you keep the gold for yourself (all of it) you still get this outfit.
---
Yeah. It's noisy. Thought a YaoGuai was attacking this one camp.
---
Honestly, same.  I technically don't qualify as a Fallout fan but...  yeah.  This game is like having a love/hate relationship.
---
This reaffirms my choice to go back to World of Warcraft over FO76
---
WoW has some grinds, but they are realistic grinds.
---
It not the event. Its the way the legendary loot is given out. It should b like end-game. After U kill the legendaries, legendary loots r auto added to ur inventory less the rest of the normal stuffs
---
They can't nuke Flatwood, so I think it's not a problem.
---
Agreed. More variety is always good.
---
I don't trust anyone enough to do that.
---
Again. Not a battlepass. 
---
And I didn‚Äôt design it. I don‚Äôt like the idea of seasons.
---
I'm on Xbox, unfortunately. :(  But thank you anyway.
---
Yep that‚Äôs the point of unyielding.  Stack INT with it, foods etc and use lunchboxes well and you can get some crazy XP per super mutant kill.  Double XP weekend was nuts.
---
In my opinion the benefit of unyielding varies based on your spec.  I‚Äôm melee and not a sneaky one, I kill stupid fast and train through places at max speed.  Not being in PA and wearing normal unyielding armor and having to keep my HP low makes me painfull squishy.  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fantastic for all the bloodied build people used to having to survive in a delicate balance and spec‚Äôd more for it but not worth my time I determined after trying it a couple days.  I earn XP faster in my PA and focusing on speed than having to slow down and get XP per kill.
---
This. The douche jumped on the hate train when it gave him views, and when it didnt't he started to like and praise the game. The guy is also a clickbating douchebag. And listening to him for more than 5 seconds makes me want to cut of my ears. There are several better fallout76 tubers out there.
---
Start scripting them or do what I did was just find a level 50 character and drop them a bunch of it
---
it will help a lot that now we have new updates to look forward to every quarter!  but to be honest there‚Äôs no online game where you play that hardcore where you won‚Äôt run out of new content eventually... i‚Äôve played over 200 hours and i‚Äôm only level 101... so if you‚Äôve played enough to be 250-300, you‚Äôve played more than most people, so you‚Äôre bound to eventually run low on content... but at least now you have a roadmap and know what to expect!
---
Fair enough lol. I'm sharing with my brother and vice versa.
---
Or just don't do them? Game shouldn't bend to everyone's needs, shit happens, they gave us somthing for free, we don't have to pay for at all,
---
Either manage ur time better, don't do the dailies, or shut up and realise not everything revolves around you.
---
Bugs do not just arbitrarily "get worse".  
---
Some days you might happen to hit the conditions to trigger the bug more often, some times you happen to hit those conditions less.  That's it.  Whatever bug causes this to happen isn't getting more buggier as time goes on, you're just encountering it more than usual.
---
I agree with this. I sell mounted heads because they sell well along with any camp plan tbh. I try and only sell the cooler ones. I mark them up to 150 caps (I used to sell them at 250).   
---
I found camp location does matter. If you're more central on the map, close to a well traveled area, or close to a free spawn point people will come to your camp just out of convenience. Just like real life, location matters.
---
... that‚Äôs on top of my 300 of regular gear, and only 200 lbs left in my stash
---
These are fantastic ideas.  I‚Äôm fallout 1st and consider myself somewhat casual.  I‚Äôd like to be more casual but feel forced to get my legendary dailies done every day.  I‚Äôm currently 95 so it is possible but expecting casuals to play every damn day is silly.  They should do what you said and make them all weeklies to accommodate people not being able to play every day.
---
Man this is the biggest of moods, its so much fun, but at the same time...not?  
---
Like I just hit level 150 today, and I always log in, do my dailies, and I have the fun with it.  But every day I always think "what am I doing here?"  I see everyone so high of level, and I wonder what they found to do that kept them playing so long
---
Coined and minted...been there, coined that.
---
I don't play everyday, which is my choice. I am at lvl 57 on the board. I know I am not gonna make it. I have to be okay with that. I am not about to dump 65 bucks in it to get to the end. Sure, I'd love to have all the things but, gotta be real! Btw lvl 61 player which has taken me about 400hrs to get to. I hate the grind lol
---
all the melee characters thank you for not letting it land...
---
Yep, gave up, didn't have the time to complete it. Guess I'll just wait for the prizes to be released with a different skin in the atom shop.
---
The thing is these things reward active players. 
---
You will still be able to do the weekly and what not and that will propel you up to the 50s to 60s ( just from the weekly )
---
All your missing out is cosmetics due to the fact you can buy the stuff from gold bullion vendors at the end of the event that affects gameplay like the ammo converter and chicken coop.
---
All your having is FOMO.
---
I'm stealth sniper (non-bloodied), where half of my build and all armor legendaries are focused on weight reduction. Instigating Hunting Rifle is the only legendary I really treasure. And with this non-min-maxxed build I breeze through the game... I can one-shot any supermutants or a nearly any non-boss enemy. The only issue I have with this build is sometimes to deal enough damage to SBQ (to be eligible for her loot) before some asshole wipes her out from the sky in 10 seconds with his glitched weapons...
---
I cannot imagine how easy it actually is for the optimised builds. That must be a cakewalk.
---
Your camp can look cool loading into a nuke zone.

I work 40 hours a week and it's been fine for me. I'm 33 married and have a kid. I do have the advantage of finally working from home, so depending on your job I can see why it could be difficulty. Everyone's situation is different, but it's not how the run is ran that bothers me, it's the fatigue and burnout on like the last turn.
---
I'm tired if all these games pushing this damn gold star everyone is equal crap. What is the point of leveling if you just scale everything... Where are the games if old where progression is about being able to kill things faster and take on more challenging enemies?
---
Ah aight
---
Pretty much a battle pass tho
---
Thanks for the advice everyone. 
---
Having read all your comments, I think I'll hold onto it until I get a good replacement, and then display it somewhere inb CAMP
---
As of today (2020-08-17), it requires 100 + 150 + 250 perk coins to rank up the legendary perk card.
---
Very perk card is scrappable for 2 perk coins per level.
---
You get 9 perk cards for every 5 levels (4 of them are given every 5 levels),
---
180 for 100 levels, so multiply by 2 points for every card, 360 perk points for 100 levels, that's 139 levels for single full level legendary perk card?
---
I don't know.. I beat it three weeks ago. I only bought 9 ranks and didn't play every day, only three days a week. I only did the deploy a camp NW challenge, no others for that mode. I took well advantage of double XP weekend, and the rest of the time just focused on XP grinding. Put on about 100 levels doing it too.
---
then why would they allow you to throw money at it to get the stuff?
---
No right now unless you count The Crater and Foundation.
---
I played beta and preordered tricentenial, ended up playing for about 2/3 of the year then came back for wastelanders. Been playing everyday mostly leveling up new characters to 50 again. Its a good game now but there is so much potential.
---
awesome response.  thank you!
---
Not the exact problem I have, but it's worth a shot just to check and see if that fixes my problem; thanks!
---
I also think  that they should have a thing with the lv ups ones. I‚Äôm lv 280 and it takes a long time, so I think it would be good to have this , gain___ XD or lv up.
---
yeah i'm trying to get badges again and i need to keep server hoping to find some that stay...so lame
---
Try participating on the scorched earth event whenever you can
---
I thought I had lost out on looting the imposter sheepsquatch because it disappeared on me, so I went around looting all the robot piles.  By the time I had made a circle back around to the shack door, the imposter had turned into a robot pile and I was able to loot it.
---
Still happening 3 months later xd

---
Jen was stuck on a rock and I had to punch her until she moved off it
---
Steel yard has super mutants.  The place adjacent to the workshop
---
Will do. If it pops up.
---
Wonder if they could make modular clothing, that way we can mix and match?
---
Crater and foundation are comparable to covenant, a little bigger. 
---
There are city ruins in Charleston. It‚Äôs WV so there aren‚Äôt a lot of large cities to begin with.
---
The fancy shotgun is magic.
---
Yeah we had some angry gods shut the power off with flying trees last Monday. Utter shitfest. Donno if it's being reported much but there's tons and tons of destruction. Thankfully, and insanely improbably, we were the only house in the neighborhood to avoid damage. 
---
I think it's because I named our tree. My wife disagrees.
---
Again it was a suggestion not a complaint, for a LEGENDARY PERK CARD, you know the thing people are saying won‚Äôt even be worth grinding for because they are so hard to rank up, an endgame solution to an arbitrary problem. I respect the concept of weight management, it‚Äôs immersive. What‚Äôs not immersive is that I can build a whole ass house but not extra camp storage, and I end up having to dump loads of scrap, it‚Äôs a joke. Even then if that‚Äôs the route they wanna go, fine, I‚Äôm simply asking for the ability for players to choose a ‚Äúhypothetical stash storage increase‚Äù over other benefits if we want to, as opposed to the many other benefits provided in legendary perks. I phrased this suggestion in the most neutral we possible, and you were triggered by it, I‚Äôm simply looking for more choices and ways to play, again if that offends you I am sorry.
---
The only time this happens is if you've opened up a card that has only one tier and thus no need for ranking up or duplicate cards to exist.  Yea, in retrospect to the legendary perk system it sucks that it's possible but it's not exactly like it happens to every extra card you already have a copy of.  You only have something like a 13% chance of opening one of those specific perks every time you open a pack.  Any other cards just keep stacking up single copies, I have some untouched perks with five or six rank 1 copies just sitting around.
---
Are you aware how trivial this complaint is.
---
"Oh boo hoo my video game geared towards teenagers doesn't make time for my job and adult responsibilities", get over yourself.
---
And besides you can complete all the dailies in an hour and a half, plus a bit extra on weekends for weeklys, it's really not hard.
---
GT? I can hop on real quick
---
Would love to see a statue machine in future atom shop updates that Basically uses saves of a loadout in a slot. Choose an element type. Hit manufacture. Would be perfect for something like this.
---
PC master race
---
yeah, its the same system warframe added almost 2 years ago. i stopped playing it. I had zero issues putting the time in and getting everything. its the persistent pull to do it every day or else i'll miss out that's disgusting. i want to play a game because i want to have fun not so i dont' miss out on points to pay the bills for items i want to get.
---
Tbf, I doubt you can buy the season 1 poster with bullion (at least I hope not)
---
I can help, join me. GT is the same name
---
Rainbowbean01 my camp is left to the monorail elevator. Or I can go to yours
---
Great more clicking simulation stuff. Bethesda is killing this game.
---
Have done it in about 5-10 minutes before when the breaches were easier, full legit run without lockpicking is 20-30 minutes roughly for me

Everybody gets a trophy.
---
You know that there were real-life pants for women in the fifties, right? And that this is also a fictional, futuristic alternate version of the 50‚Äôs, and there are already plenty of pants *in the game* for our deathclaw-slaying, power-armor-wearing, radiation-surviving, heals-with-eating female characters, right (casual outfit)? And nobody is complaining purple hair (as one example) is anachronistic. 
---
Women scientists in the 1950‚Äôs wore pants, I promise you. If you want to argue about traditional 50‚Äôs gender norms, they‚Äôre already bucked throughout the game, just as they were in Real Life (TM).
---
It‚Äôs an exploit using placement of survival tents. I‚Äôm surprised Beth didn‚Äôt hot fix yet.
---
There hasn't been a tuning pass yet. All that's on the PTS right now is the formula change.
---
So long as people keep paying and playing everyday nothing‚Äôs gonna change, ward never changes.
---
You can do OK like that but as you try to expand out and do everything in the game you run into a wall where you need a team or you need to get your character more powerful than a casual build. Not min-maxed where you've sacrificed things for the sake of sheer damage output but a good powerful all around combat build based on a specific class of top tier weapons.
---
People confuse all bloodied and junkies builds as being min-max but most aren't and are actually just all-around combat/scavenger builds.
---
I also play several characters that purposefully don't use any legendary gear just for the challenge and realism of it, usually on a private server though so other players dont effect the spawn levels. These builds are fun but there's a lot of the game I can't play with them (some because it takes too much stims and ammo that I don't want to have to replenish for no good reason, not because it can't be done). They still aren't haphazard builds though, they are setup with a special allocation that lets me make use of several ranged weapons by swapping perks so that I can use more of the ammo I pick up.
---
I mostly run with a bloodied character though because that's the only one that would give me the ability to to hard events without a team. I'm not trying to impress anyone, or "be a god" or any of the other crap I've heard on here lately.
---
When you're pretty new to the game or only play it casually it's easy to be busy enough with everything else the game has to offer that you don't consider someone might be bored or done with that stuff and want to do things like take the scorchbeast queen down solo, or pass the vault 94 raid solo (RIP), or do Encryptid solo, or solo Project Paradise, or any other hard content they sparingly put into the game up to this point. With the team system now it's not even easy for people to recognize that some people still want to play solo.
---
So yeah, even those of us with guns that can hit for 3K+ damage per shot in full auto "just play the game".
---
Hence the post. Like I said it‚Äôs a niche build so I wanted to draw attention to it.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that would fall under cosmetic. So It shouldn‚Äôt be buyable. ( hopefully ) 
---
What I can see them doing though is shoving the some of the already ended seasons cosmetics into the atom shop for the people who want to buy it for a limited time.
---
Different color variants perhaps.
---
oh please don't send them money and support this kind of business model.
---
With the season pass, it does now. Usually just log in for a little bit at the end of the day to play. Now if I want the good stuff, I have to play longer, sadly not enough time in a day.
---
The responders bot sells them at Grafton. He also sells the BoS mods.
---
Uh I work 50 hours a week. Wife and a kid. I missed two weeks at the start and the only atoms I‚Äôve put in are the ones from fallout 1st and the board itself. I‚Äôm level 90/100 atm.  I‚Äôve missed a day here or there too. 
---
It‚Äôs not that bad.
---
There is still 3 weeks left too. There will more than likely be a double SCORE weekend as well between now and then.
---
Given how many people are literally arguing that there were no pants for women in the 50‚Äôs, it‚Äôs not a safe assumption.
---
Some yes. My two shot explosive minigun was 'Ol Painless. My instigating two shot combat shotgun was Shotty Too Hotty. My fancy pump action shotgun is Fancy Pants.
---
Lol, only balance breaking if you manage to hit what you're shooting at in VATs.
---
I can head over to you I‚Äôm loading up now
---
I have someone helping me now, thank you though
---
So many people triggered by the thought of women in pants, when there‚Äôs already precedence for other outfits.
---
I have good results with tesla rifles but maybe just an explosive legendary weapon may be better.
---
You, sir, are a madman.
---
I'm always impressed with people running berserkers. Love seeing you guys running around a queen fight in your underwear.
---
Yup, gamertag is Bl00dyMaria. Or option 2 is play some events or join a team, you'll find someone In need. First option is easier and I'm constantly looking for people to play with, even if it's to accomplish a certain goal.
---
I feel like that poster is a trophy for completing. I think that and the stein should be limited to those who finish. Every other cosmetic can be bought with gold or atoms, I don‚Äôt really mind.
---
Thanks man
---
I do the same, I spent my point on lone wanderer, it‚Äôs weird being teamed up and losing that benefit.
---
I don't really understand not being on some kind of team at all times now. You get so many benefits and nothing is required of you.
---
I agree.
---
I‚Äôve seen so many comments about how the old daily and week challenges were better, how we got atoms for completing them. I have over 1800 hours played and never was able to complete a daily challenge more than once or twice. I‚Äôm finding the new system much easier to understand and complete.
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be what they were using, but it‚Äôs not uncommon for it to get mixed up when you loot them.
---
I agree with your point of view. When you think the game mechanics are unfair, you have another choice: use glitches
---
I hate having to log in every day but I think you can get most of the challenges done in 30-60 mins (maybe less) if you know where to go/what to do to rapidly fulfill the challenges and ignore the revive nw challenge.
---
I have a standing desk with a treadmill underneath so I use the excuse to exercise to buy some time to play.
---
All the loot is RNG so you get different weapons, especially from human npcs
---
I like the news / rumor coverage he provides, but he doesn't have much of an opinion on it.
---
He probably doesn't want the outrage from one side or the other.
---
And I'm supposed to care?
---
Still works but damage is lower so some magic weapons will take more shots he tested the magic shotgun and couldn't one shot robots anymore but still a two shot weapon on basic mobs but he attributed some of that to server lag he did mention that shotguns would need a buff without magic damage
---
The game is designed that way. You're bit supposed to get the same weapon that they shoot you with when you loot their corpse. Something to do with preventing the game from being too unfair with the loot pool or something idk.
---
I guess the point is that if you aren't doing events you're better off on a building team.
---
Thats what happens when you make an mmo with a decade-old engine made for single player games. At least the other fallouts had console commands so we could fix what they forgot to.
---
It blows my mind that some people aren‚Äôt getting that you don‚Äôt *have* to earn everything. 
---
There are plenty of people that have been perfectly satisfied with getting some of the early rewards.
---
This is a reward for those players that are able to log in daily, but it‚Äôs not even required to log in daily to complete the season.
---
Not every player will get everything available. The Mountain Scout Uniform isn‚Äôt available to players that started after Wastelanders released. The Battlecoat isn‚Äôt available to players that didn‚Äôt purchase the bundle last year. And so on. 
---
You‚Äôre not going to like this statement, but: *No player has an inherent* **right** *to have access to all aesthetic content.*
---
By your logic, players that can only play for two hours once a week should have the option to jump up to the same XP level as a player that has played four hours a day since BETA. 
---
That‚Äôs not reasonable.  And neither is expecting that a player that is only able or willing to invest a smaller amount of time gets the same rewards from this season as a player that invests a larger amount of time.
---
I used several weapons with this character: The legacy, a magic minigun, a normal Ultracite Laser, and a gauss minigun. All of them were from my non ptr build, and were junkies. All of them were okay experiences (I swapped mostly to test the weapons, and when I ran out of ammo). I shot things, they died in reasonable time. Maybe a touch longer than on Live, but nothing horrible. I suspect that you'll want a proper build and preferably some sort of decent legendary, but it seems entirely doable as a group, and possibly even solo (although it'll be rough as hell).
---
My Junkies Fixer is named Daddy's Juice
---
yea it's still "cheating"
---
What‚Äôs your gt btw
---
Ohh that's unfortunate. So you get to choose-- either a good fast travel spot or a good pet spot.
---
Really? Damn then i get unlucky a lot Dx
---
This sounds right. I always just assumed it was something to do with the way loot pools interacted with the instancing of the individual players.
---
They seem to have stopped doing that in my experience.
---
Some people will do it just to collect from the harvesters/resource and then leave. It happened to me a lot when I was a low level
---
That's actually pretty smart. I'd buy it
---
Why do you have to grind anything?  Will society shame you if you don‚Äôt have all the legendary perks?  Will the president have you put to death?
---
The grind whine is getting stale on this Reddit sub.  No one is forcing you to be 100% at anything.  SCORE, Legendary Perks - it‚Äôs all FOMO and a desire to be first.  None of it is real
---
They are same legendary perk cards, and you can have only 6. It is still up to 30 additional special on top of base 50, so that's a lot of budget if you'll go that path.
---
I only have 1 PER and am usually about 95% to hit within 15 feet of any mob with this gun. It's ridiculous.
---
Best part is no double score, Boycott the BOS event. It‚Äôs bullshit and unfair.
---
Right! A fuckin ghoul too!
---
Yea, it sucks, but it‚Äôs a live service game. I prioritise 76 because of FOMO, but then I miss out on ESO, Diablo and Borderlands events, it is what it is, unfortunately.
---
The good news, is that in the PTS, some of the biggest rewards will be available to buy with gold once the season finishes, so people won‚Äôt miss out on everything.
---
Even with it, I couldn't manage. 
---
Calling it tedious feels like an understatement. I still have the icon and photo pose at least.
---
And the Vault suit. Gotta love that.
---
I've never even been clear on what Magic weapons DO.
---
Do they just have game-breaking damage from weird interactions in their effects?
---
I got one of the Shotguns from those tickets a few weeks ago and just hung it on my wall, along with the Pistol.
---
There's a good one Southeast of the South Mountain Lookout. Follow the monorail.
---
No problem! Sorry just saw this lol
---
let me know in a year how you enjoy this system. there aren't very many people in games that have these that enjoy them long term. most people have no issues doing it, its the persistent pull to have to keep doing it constantly that will burn out many players long term.
---
Thanks again, I‚Äôll take this post down since you helped. Thanks for the diffusers too!
---
I didn‚Äôt even have any harvesters set up. All he got was the little bit of junk in me and the workshop. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I remember playing melee most of the time due to ammo issues. Cuz investing in str gave melee dmg and carry weight - p import stuff starting out. And when i cant melee stuff, i just used a 10mm smg which imo is a gr8 starting out commando weapon
---
Sounds good. After all Diamond citys population wasnt that big either. Thanks for the reply!
---
And Ive seen Charleston already. I kind of miss Boston already but at least it has tons of bigger buildings around
---
This story is so amazing and has a lovely back story. You probably brought tears to many eyes reading the story. I rewarded this post with gold as I saw how much they meant to you.
---
Keep your head up, he will always be with you and his family
---
Aw. New to the game, and reading about these magic weapons is pretty disappointing. I wanted to use revolvers and shotguns in my build, and now I've got to avoid certain legendary affects? That's not very cash money of you, Bethesda.
---
Does it not suffer from that bug then?
---
Florida would be awesome. Have a meth crafting  bench.
---
I have all day to grind since I am a student lol. But holy fuck the grind is terrible for me too, there's nothing to do in-game.
---
you can add giant grinds without penalties to those that don't play a certain way. its not that difficult, many games do it. they're just hopping on the latest fab that's falling apart in games that have had it for for more than 18 months.
---
I'm wondering if we can get the emote again. Dying for it.
---
Make a new recipe: Omelette
---
There are several omelettes ingame already (radscorpion, radtoad and deathclaw), so the textures are already there.
---
OK?
---
I hope you find one. I've been having a similar issue.
---
Same, sent support a ticket but I doubt it'll get fixed before the content is online on the main game
---
I never seem to find more than 6 Ghouls in a nuked whitesprings anymore, it's so hard to farm flux stabilising materials anymore....
---
That level 1 instagating hunting rifle could last them most of the way to 50 if they play it right. Nice.
---
I‚Äôve turned in over 20 of those so far....all western outfits, clean ski hats and outfits..... wish I could get one of those
---
Honestly I wanted to write more. I didn't expect such an amazing response. I find it difficult to articulate what I want to say so I'd just dilute the purpose of the post I think. 
---
Thank you so much for the kind words and the award! I really appreciate it. Thank you, I'm doing my best and staying strong for him
---
I dont know if people are burned out or what but lately Im seeing a poor turnout on a lot of events that would normally have a good roll up. I even solo'd Uranium fever a few nights ago. Thats one event that usually has a heap turn up to it because of the convenient loot/scrap and 3 possible legendaries
---
Which challenges are causing problems? I can get all my dailies done in like 30 minutes usually. The hardest one I've encountered yet was the "collect a bobblehead" because I went to about 15 different locations that were "known" spawns and there wasn't anything there. It took forever to find one. Otherwise, I've had no issue getting almost all of my dailies done fairly quick ‚Äî I even get most of the weekly ones done around the same time.
---
Like destiny 2?
---
I think it's more or less because Bethesda feels that it would be unfair if people were constantly getting good weapons from the enemies they defeated. Plus I swear they said they hated the fact that in fallout 4 you could loot the exact same weapon you're being attacked with from the dead bodies of raiders etc.
---
No problem.
---
A large amount of atom shop items still don't have any pictures!
---
It‚Äôs a fun part of the game but it should make the other player wanted
---
A shotgun makes the critical hit one incredibly easy since each pellet counts as a separate crit. Add 4 leaf clover to the mix and each pellet will also have a chance to fill your crit meter.
---
You really want even more junkies? I see plenty of them even here in WV haha.
---
Yeah they pussies vs players. Shoot you in the back. PVP should be when both players want to fight each other, not shoot you in the back when you not paying attention.
---
I guess as soon as the workshop is theirs the turrets is theirs, I would think the turrets should be yours until it is fully taken over, but maybe it passes a certain percentage.
---
Data miners! the assets are stored in a very easy to view manner as the game is almost identical to Fallout 4!
---
I use my phone to take a few quick pictures
---
It's fun watching them play Frogger trying to stumble across the road. They get run over a lot.
---
And this is why i don't use consoles. They are full of 12 year old children.
---
Casuals with no legendary gear should be the baseline they work from. Not everybody has the inclination or ability to get legendary gear. The level 50 weapons and armor should be enough to tackle content
---
I've never played D2 but I was thinking Doom or Gears of War.
---
The one directly behind the icon for the South Mountain or the one a little behind it?

To gain her trust, you need to complete the quests Flavors of Mayhem and Key To the Past.

Here is a guide to help you out

---
B. But check them out yourself.
---
Oh, -that- bug. Well I just went through Charleston Capitol and the Burrows with this thing. Didn't miss a shot unless there was some physical object in the way. It doesn't seem to affect me.
---
Exactly :)
---
Theres gotta be specific perks that make that easier ya know? I feel like I probably don't know which ones to use to maximize what I need, and with the legendary/perk coins coming whenever I don't wanna waste cards in the meanwhile
---
Same here. I've already told myself I just won't get all the rewards. Sucks but at least I can still get some I guess.
---
No risk there. I don‚Äôt sub, nor do I play anymore.
---
Which part is fun? It‚Äôs definitely not fun for me.
---
Claim posidion power plant, there is a fusion core extracter there. Lock it and check back to collect.
---
It‚Äôs tedious because they‚Äôve buffed enemies and nerfed players.
---
The more visibility this gets, the sooner Bethesda will fix it (I hope). As nice as it is to have a weapon that breezes through content, it does make your build kind of pointless.
---
there are plenty that don't involve forcing players to play regularly. go have a look at the thousands of games out there. if people had an issue with grinding ridiculous amounts of time they'd have left FO76 long ago. something as simple as more weeklies would help alleviate this situation but wouldn't remove it. 
---
its the same thing warframe did to try to keep people liking this system. it worked somewhat but people are still burning out and getting fed up with this type of system.
---
Definitely overly repetitive some times. I picked up a new toon for Wastelanders, maxed out my reputation, got my score completed, and had nothing else to do . I finally launched my first nuke today, it was fun and I‚Äôll probably do that until the next update. PS4
---
Ok cool thanks. They are close enough that I only have to fast travel once.
---
I would also appreciate a notification sound for it - if I glance at my phone or something I could miss it and not know there's an event going on
---
As someone who gets an hour or two to play, the legendary run basically made me quit. Haven't played in about a fortnight at all.
---
I think you get 8 cores an hour
---
Then don‚Äôt claim workshops
---
I just want a way to raise meat for my carnivorous alcoholic raider.
---
I can grow crops let me slaughter my cows and chickens for meat Beth.
---
To reiterate LOCK IT.
---
I‚Äôve told my friends over and over to do this and they keep forgetting and whimper about not having any cores when they check back.
---
Of course, it could get contested. I may be guilty of contesting a workshop a time or two.
---
Lol I don't even trust my brothers. We are a bunch of assholes to each other
---
No need at my camp, unless I've made a mistake.  Have it set to require standing on a plate before it fires.
---
Why do you think it‚Äôs fun though? Are you a player like I described? You think it‚Äôs fun to attack other players when they can‚Äôt do anything about it? I‚Äôd like to understand what‚Äôs fun about that.
---
Pointing out an observation. I asked for neither your approval nor condemnation. Nice attempt at snark, though.
---
This explains it:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKo\_8XKVqGQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKo_8XKVqGQ)

It's loading for me on Xbox.
---
If you're buying most or all of the atomic shop items and/or subscribed to fallout 1st you're a whale to the devs. Granted not as severe as games with lootboxes but still
---
Edit: just realised that was a joke about literal whales
---
I mean, people who are logging in every day are finishing about now, 3 weeks early. I mean I hear your point but it allows you to skip days too
---
I had like 3 tickets when i saw a post about how fun a fancy shotgun was. Got it on the second ticket i ever cashed. Good times.
---
As someone who raided in WOW, yeap, pretty much the same
---
No it‚Äôs fun to fight off other players. It‚Äôs fun to have to fight an actual person who is challenging to fight
---
Buy a lottery ticket. Lol. I test it out when I finally get it. Seems I've had everything but the shotgun and pistol from there.
---
Perfect. didn't realize those were required first, thank you
---
I fixed it, just reloaded the game.
---
I guess this happened because I left it in the atom shop and when logged back on it bugged out.
---
No problem! Have fun!
---
not everyone. i stopped warframe because of it even though i had no issues getting everything. by the second season i was sick of it even though they did less dailies and more weeklies it wasn't enough to get rid of the persistent pull to keep logging in to work instead of play. huge turn off for me when gaming. i haven't played fo76 since a week after this started i knew where it was going and i'm not interested.
---
My beloved pipe revolver rifle carried me from level 1 to level 560 on my main character. At the moment I'm running a Bloodied Pipe Revolver Rifle with 33% VATS chance. Initially I was hoping for another buff as I hoped Tank Killer perk now applies twice to the Pipe Revolver Rifle as the perk now effects rifles and pistols. Also I hoped to complete my build with the legendary SPECIAL perks as including Gunslinger and Rifleman perks does not leave much space for quality of life perks.
---
But seeing this huge nerf and also that stealth is useless in the Daily Ops missions, I'm not sure if I'm really willing to change my weapons, my perks and my whole playstyle.
---
Nope, me and my brother haven't touched any of that either.
---
Yep. VATs broke for PvP during Wastelanders and kept getting worse for PvE stuff. Now some weapons don't want to work in VATs during PvE at all.
---
I sell those tickets for 76 caps most of the time. Good luck, Wastelanders.
---
At the risk of sounding stupid, how does one ‚Äúrun Whitesprings‚Äù? I haven‚Äôt done all the missions yet. Does it mean a bunker?
---
Ok, well that‚Äôs very different than what I described.
---
Nice!!
---
Working adult here.
---
I'm currently one space behind Zorbo. Haven't done the nuclear winter challenges and don't prioritize those level up challenges. I get em if and when I get em.
---
I spread out my weekly challenges, try to get one a day. Combined with the dailies and regular play it takes me less than an hour to earn a rank. Yesterday it took 26 minutes. I've managed to maintain a pace of at least one rank a day, without too much grinding, even as the score per rank has increased to almost 3000.
---
You're breaking your back to hit every challenge when less than an hour a day will get you 95% of them. And all it's got you is an extra 4 ranks more than me. As much as I could buy with the atoms I've earned from earlier on in the run.
---
Yeah, you gotta play everyday. But us working adults can find 26 minutes in a day.
---
They sell to vendors for 5?
---
You can do this at all power plants.
---
You on PC?
---
! remindme 1year
---
Lol
---
not when they add features like this. gotta do your chores in game A before you have time to play game B. but if you decide to pay game B for a week, you shoot yourself in the foot with game A. horrendous system and it will definitely turn off a chunk of the player base no matter your stance on it.

**Stan:** ‚Äì I want to get rads.  
---
**Reg:** ‚Äì You want to get rads?!?!?!

**Stan:** ‚Äì It's every man's right to get rads if he wants them.

**Reg:** ‚Äì But you can't get rads!  
---
**Stan:** ‚Äì Don't you oppress me.  
---
**Reg:** ‚Äì I'm not oppressing you, Stan. You're a ghoul!  Where's the rads going to accumulate?  You going to keep them in a box?

*(Stan starts crying.)*

**Judith:** ‚Äì Here! I've got an idea. Suppose you agree that he can't actually get rads, being a ghoul, which is nobody's fault, not even the Synths', but that he can have the *right* to get rads!

**Francis:** ‚Äì Good idea, Judith. We shall fight the oppressors for your right to get rads and protect yourself from them, brother.

Boomers are the ones who started the whole "participation trophy" bullshit in the early 80s because they couldn't handle the fact that their special little crotch spawn wasn't the best at everything and didn't get a ribbon.

Fallout is idealistic 1950. Women didn't wear pants per se at that time afaik
---
This is an MMORPG, we need something to work towards. If you're not happy with your job start working from home and play games all day like I do. Become a YouTube or Twitch content creator.
---
Oh yeah we can't get that anymore. It  would be cool to get that. I only did one raid, so I only got The Mask and the Jumpsuit from the raids
---
The easiest downvote of my life.
---
That would be helpful too!
---
Oh nope, I'm on PC. The type is all over ;) haha

Not really, how else would we know that the corpse next to vault have lvl5 gun instead of lvl1 and it takes 10+ to kill a liberator?

My blowhole erupted when I read that!

I‚Äôm 38 and I cringed hard
---
Any complaints made about the game can be made trivial if your mindset is already set to that standard.  
---
Boo hoo scorchbeast queen won't land. Boo hoo they took away our double sided walls. Boo hoo there's so many bugs and glitches and duped items in the game. 
---
Boo hoo so what if the game caps your progress by limiting how much caps/scrips/ gold bullion you can redeem. 
---
But its just a video game geared towards teenagers so who cares. 
---
Sure dude. Sure. That adds nothing constructive and just works to devalue others opinions and invalidate their complaints. You can invalidate anything with a mindset like that.
---
I mean if a ghoul takes too many rads they‚Äôll go feral
---
Oh crap.
---
u/chrisaed was pointing out something known across all platforms. There is no need to shit on him/her for that. 
---
You posted. Therefore you sought feedback. JFC.
---
BoS eunt domus
---
that's what people dont' understand. i get there's some that can't finish everything and it really sucks but that's not the worst part, its the burn out that'll get the majority of players. give it another year and most people will be sick of it if it doesn't change. it happens in every game that has this system. even making the weeklies and a dailies or two being enough to complete everything only alleviated the problem for one or two seasons.
---
Here is the stealth rifleman build I used before I went to a bloody build.

I take few shots at every miner and leave them so they follow me to give others a chance to shoot to get experience, experience is highest commodity after all.
---
The game needs to be darker at night . I know the more is dark but everywhere needs to be  closer to that darkness . I loved the game where it was fake , for building camps and for gameplay üòå
---
That's... Huh. I've heard that about the forest, that's where my camp is too. So enemies are level 25 as well, but not higher, right? I can't decide if this makes it harder to keep them alive or not... It sounds like they'll be on even ground, but my level 21 sloths have been killed by groups of low level mole miners and supermutants. Groups of evenly leveled enemies sounds worse than it is now...
---
Living in the mire was something I avoided for obvious reasons but maybe it's a safer bet now. Not really sure that tracks though...
---
Please edit this in 24 hours with current downvote total.
---
I mean, hell, you met me through this game. Admittedly you weren't griefing me, instead you turned me into a pack mule. But still. üòÇ Love ya, babe. üòò
---
I'd like sneak attack finishers if ima sneak behind a super mutant and id one shot anyway I wana execute him
---
Two-shot gauss shotgun does wonders. The ONE TIME you want a huge spread :)
---
They‚Äôre making it easier to level with season 2? I kinda doubt that. Where did you hear it?
---
Wait what? We get now paid by Beth?
---
Your sense of reality is skewed, you should go and see a specialist.
---
Love ya too. You were better irl then in the video game. And yes I turned you into my slave/packmule when we met.
---
This might be a frame rate thing when you're inside. I had the same problem until I saw someone post a tip. Use Rivatuner to limit your framrate so it doesn't go sky high. 
---
The engine was linked to framerate previously and, while they delinked it, there are still issues. Since I limited mine to 144 fps, I don't get magically stuck anymore.
---
Really if they left it at 2 but added the ability to get 5 from gold cards again I would be happy.
---
It‚Äôs a shame they listened to the people crying that they felt ‚Äúforced‚Äù to do it. 
---
I have so many duplicate gold cards it‚Äôs insane.
---
I understand what people are saying, but I‚Äôm coming from the destiny 2 circle where you don‚Äôt progress at all unless you give in to the bounty circle jerk. At the very least I personally can get on, do the dailies and then move on. Rank 82 on the game board, haven‚Äôt bought any ranks, just did the dailies and weeklies.
---
you should run a maxed Blocker in Str. 
---
Ignoring 45% incoming melee damage is huge in this game..
---
I have few 8ths?
---
PTS patch notes. More Path XP per challenge to level it faster.
---
I made a small memorial for my kitty when he died rip Smokey
---
I joined an event team once with the intention of hoping events but I then got distracted by something.
---
Pretty sure I ended up leaving the group after a bit though, but there's one reason why it happens.
---
Didn't down vote you.
---
Workshops are PvP zones. Don't like it? Don't stay within the parameters of the workshop.
---
Purified Water?  Absolutely. 
---
You can sell most things to vendors for up to 25% of their listed Base Value. 
---
Purified Water has a Base Value of 20, so you can sell it for up to 5.
---
The Fixer is a beautiful weapon, but a Handmade is almost as good and can be equipped at 15. Super Mutants often drop them. They take 5.56 ammo and, if you scrap every one you get (after your first one, of course), you will learn more and more modifications that can be done to them once you rank Gunsmith (in Intelligence) high enough. 3 is usually good enough for modding. I always use the Powerful Automatic Receiver on both weapon types. The Commando perks in Perception help out with automatic rifles.
---
You can also do events, the event rewards power cores occasionally.
---
It usually only takes me 30 minutes. Sometimes I skip Nuclear Winter and I'm currently at rank 96.
---
I think it's just venting as Bethesda nerfs damage output to increase farming resource time. Most of us really enjoy the game but not the farming so much üôÇ
---
I've taken so many high levels down on a lowbie toon before. It's really easy especially if you have a trash build.
---
I too have not done the NW ones and I am at rank 82...so like 3-4 spots.
---
you mean playing a game for fun is more fun than playing a game to do chores? whodathunkit?
---
Things are timed because they explicitly said that they want people to log in every day. It‚Äôs arbitrary bullshit.
---
Remember that the Austin team are mobile devs that Beth brought in to do 76. All they know how to do is design grind. They‚Äôre applying mobile design strategies to an actual desktop game. And it seems that they are incapable of understanding that *it doesn‚Äôt work the same way on regular games*.
---
You can build stupid amounts of grind and daily logins into a mobile game because we carry our phones everywhere and have free time during the day to do daily things. You can‚Äôt do that with a full blown game (maybe unless it‚Äôs on the Switch).
---
It seems that the Austin crew is fundamentally incapable of understanding this. So they do the only thing they know how to do: endless grind and forced daily logins.
---
refunded me for the junkyard skin not giving rad resist, so perhaps not
---
You don't really need more than 1 in bandolier if you're not carrying more than 20k of ammo, so you can swap some of it for something else.
---
Could be a player nearby shooting stuff.
---
Could be that your presence spawns some opposing enemies and they're duking it out to see who gets first dibs on your camp.
---
I use an explosive handmade, barely have to wiggle my joystick.
---
You can do something about it if you have any idea of what to do.
---
It's Bethesda's way of saying here have some shit you don't want you can put this next to your faster reload deathclaw gauntlet
---
Nah, I‚Äôm on ps4.  I‚Äôd grind the event as long as it took to get the drop, but I‚Äôve had a hell of a time trying to hire decent players to hold B and C for me.

If you don't like being shot in the back I can shoot any of you in the front. Add me any time, build up your workshops. I'll even stand in plain sight and do a countdown till I tap it. Add Ign Nekrosias for all your shooting you in the front needs.

it already takes a lot of shots to kill things

When I create an events team I will kick people for not participating in the Public events I've joined on for the past one or two events.  This may seem rude but I often get someone else to fill their spot fairly quickly who will the join in, sometimes a solo player in the public event with me.  They deserve the bonus XP, not the person who has obviously decided to move on to something else and forgot they were in a group.
---
Not sure where you live but it did it around 12:30 this afternoon. Needed glowing kills haha. I was shocked at the lack of people that joined so I started harvesting the glowing mass. People don‚Äôt nuke WS much anymore
---
Huh. I have a Two Shot Bashing Damage Gauss Minigun in my Stash.
---
But doesn't this not work on Consoles (I'm on PS4)?
---
I can attest to the fact that he will indeed do this. Ask me how I know.
---
I can‚Äôt tell if this is meant to be satire or not. Surely you don‚Äôt think simply because the new progression system is called ‚ÄúPerks‚Äù that they are meant to be non integral parts of the gameplay. With a look at Bethesda‚Äôs idea of balance from the current PTS the new Legendary Perks are going to to be vital for most players to keep up with the increasing requirements it takes to just grind out daily gameplay objectives.
---
Collision Course. 100 pre-war money. 
---
The Professor‚Äôs house just north of Summerville has almost 300 books. 
---
Tyler County Fairgrounds; go play janitor and walk away with almost 200 cloth.
---
There is nothing to spell out when I clearly enjoy the challenge of being the lower level. Eventually those higher level cards will pop up. I may or may not use them. If you want everything to be more equal go play anothern game because this is how THIS game plays. Cry the rivers you have to work your way up, and get better perks like the ones before you. Come up with better strategy and take down the giants.
---
Not my fault your ass is so yeetable
---
Pre-war money and cloth (from many, many sources) is so common. Just loot Camden Park, Tyler County Fairgrounds, Wavy Willards, or almost any cash registrar.
---
Having to use more bullets to kill something does not make it more challenging to kill. Why do people think it does?
---
I thought it might be a player, but no.
---
I‚Äôm thinking there was a nuke zone there before, and the sounds are still playing
---
My deathclaw almost got killed by lv5 super mutants on the main servers the other day... I was not thrilled because I almost didn't make it in time
---
And my alt character who lives in the mire has to deal with scorchbeasts attacking his camp several times a week and lol at my deathclaw surviving that
---
And yes enemies in the forest seem to be capped at lv25 atm haven't seen anything higher but since it's the pts that might change
---
This whole thing should be scrapped and tied to levels. But it won't. 
---
I really hate to say it but this isn't going to change. It's not the developers fault though, it's the management. 
---
Devs have an idea, create a business case, go to management for approval. Management only cares about how much money the idea will make and how much it will cost. 
---
Management approved the perk coin idea, the bulk of the work in coding has gone into it. It doesn't matter if the devs want to change it, management will not admit they got it wrong. Management will not allow that cost to be sunk without something to show for it so they can get their bonus/keep their job. 
---
They'll force it through and, eventually, when the game dies due to management decisions they'll blame the developers and stay on board in their cushy positions. 
---
It sucks but every single company is like this and it explains why you get so much garbage support for "games as a service."
---
I would hope that they will adjust based on feedback.
---
So, I'll wait till I see it on the live servers. And even then, it'll be adapt and move on with life.
---
Working dad here and I completed mine about 5 days ago. Just a counterpoint. I understand if you have other things to do and that‚Äôs totally reasonable but passes like this aren‚Äôt for casuals. They‚Äôre for the guys that put in the time as a reward for playing. It‚Äôs like that in EVERY game that has a pass system. 
---
You‚Äôre correct in saying you don‚Äôt have to pay and I would encourage you not to as I didn‚Äôt have to pay and finished with weeks to spare. My buddy who plays a lot more casually just got the secret service ghillie paint tonight but will still finish with a week or kore to spare. You‚Äôve got 24 hours in the day to do challenges which generally take about an hour or two. And you have a full 6 days to do challenges which even might take 3 days to complete if they are harder like leveling 3 times. That‚Äôs not difficult. I guess I just don‚Äôt see the issue with the way the system is set up. It‚Äôs fine if others do and that‚Äôs the beauty of different opinions but I wanted to at least post this counterpoint.
---
That jacket is why I no longer buy items in the Atom Shop. They intentionally cropped the photos so you couldn't tell that it's a jacket + underwear outfit and you dont find out until you've spent your money,.
---
The burnt book place is great.
---
Posting something *does not* mean I'm directly seeking feedback. That's a rather broad assumption. And no, it's not well known. What you know doesn't pertain to others. Again, you assume quite a bit in arrogance.
---
Low strength? No problem, the bat comes with ROCKET BOOSTERS (THIS ISN'T A JOKE) that lets you swing it effortlessly.
---
No worries. My question was phrased a little weird :)
---
I would feel sorry for you except for the fact I've met enough people with full time jobs and social lives who can also max out MMO characters to know that it's always possible, just gotta embrace the grind when you can.
---
Not really if you have the right build I‚Äôm a heavy and killed the behemoth with non magic weapons doing a magic weapons test with a be flamer in 5 seconds
---
That is also true. 
---
(But I mean, also hella tapable. ;))
---
I had a settler spawn in camp shooting at one of my turrets.... back and forth.  Another player was in my camp and I was looking around with no clue what was going on.  To make it stop I eventually shot the settler dead.
---
I'm a tiny griefer queen in game. But yes, much kinder irl. No "super bitch voice."
---
That‚Äôs just the scorched
---
People are misinterpreting. This sounds like a full on war. I know how Fallout‚Äôs weapons sound
---
Found a similar one that is a sickle and pool cue over the course of my gameplay.
---
I still have it to this day selling it for 10k caps each. No one bought it yet lol.
---
The reason it‚Äôs so high is that I want to keep them but a part of me wants to get rid of it.
---
Does this have a custom skin? And if so, can the skin mod be learned and put on any other pump shotgun?
---
Can't upvote you enough, mate.
---
That'll only get me one extra point üòÇ
---
Looking forward for fix of formulas using max health instead of adjusted max health
---
If you have Escape Artist equipped, you are already silent so muffled does nothing. If you have the speed demon mutation, you are already at the maximum speed and sleek does nothing.
---
Or maybe you should be happy that you have so much of a life that you‚Äôre behind the people who no life this game.
---
&gt; Posting something does not mean I'm directly seeking feedback.
---
Then you either talk to yourself a lot, or have no one else to talk to.
---
Yup. Been a greasy week.
---
no, you don't
---
Cloth is pretty easy to get, but some people may not enjoy wandering low level areas looting junk for the BOS challenge. So I‚Äôm letting people know there is a way that could be a bit more engaging.
---
Definitely the tree being appreciative of the name. Sorry about the crazy storm and hope power returns soon.
---
My Arktos coat (PS4) is a skirt.
---
They did. You literally start FO4 in pants.
---
Why?  I would have designed the Season differently. And I‚Äôve recommended that the higher level rewards make a return as lower level *alternative* rewards in subsequent seasons.  For example, make the Rank 100 Dark Matter paint a Rank 75 reward in Season 2. You can either choose the new Rank 75 reward or the Dark Matter paint. Not both.
---
What if your camp was somewhere else? Is it level 25 due to the forest being capped at 25 maybe?
---
Definitely does. Magic Gauss Shotgun and I'm on Xbone.
---
Also, not saying there can‚Äôt be a skirt version?
---
And it‚Äôs a great way to push through the 180/256 loot history list.
---
You don't need to be Allied with both before doing the "Choose" mission. It's do both sides until both sides are at the choose mission.
---
This is so you get the rewards easier. You can still get them if you didn't do the missions, but it costs gold.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
After the vault raid, it's grind for gold to buy plans from each faction. You can still raise rep afterwards through daily missions.
---
Gold vault raid will let you start earning treasury notes from some quests and events.
---
Finishing the Taggardy  doesn't really open anything up other than her room at Defiance.
---
I don't see the need to hold off, as what you are doing now, is basically the same as what you will do after you finish the missions.
---
Ah I have one of heavy gun perks at level 2 since single point into bloody mess give you more benefit, unless you're looking for every single point of additional damage in sacrifice of QoL
---
&gt;Posting something does not mean I'm directly seeking feedback. 
---
Ok little man. 
---
You win.
---
There hasn't even been a tuning pass or an attempt at one yet.
---
Because of how DR works having a system entirely out of multiplicative damage bonuses is impossible to properly balance and frankly it's taken them way too long to make this change.
---
People are jumping the gun way to quickly on the first wave of testing. Once we get closer to live and certain changes aren‚Äôt addressed, then maybe I‚Äôll consider packing.
---
Love it. I really liked how you left out under the stairs with the water. Looks really nice.
---
Would love it! I could imagine the difficulties of different outfits clipping into each other in different ways, but that could be half the fun!
---
I've seen this in pictures, and it's absolutely mind boggling... On XB1, ours is the lab coat with a bit of shirt/skirt poking out and some form of long black pants/tights/leggings. I wonder why the difference?
---
As a 46 year old who has played the franchise most of my adult life I want to agree so hard.
---
I laugh a lot reading through here and seeing the gripes.
---
I don‚Äôt put that on any generation, I put that on individuality.  It‚Äôs just the way the world has become.  The way personalization works in daily life has shifted the thought to having the game the way YOU want it.  That oddly conflicts with how this MMO works.  
---
Think about the mechanics of the game if they had to account for several hundred thousand personalities on 3 major platforms with no cross platform play.  Now add in the complexity of Bethesda‚Äôs dev cycles.
---
Add in demand for new content and keeping up with the community and its a recipe for a chunk of disappointed people.
---
I am just happy to have a game I can play my way.  I am glad I can play solo or with other people.  I am happy about building and variety of missions and landscapes.  Builds and diversity in builds and a nonlinear quest line.
---
I won‚Äôt blame folks for wanting more personalization but at what point will it meet peoples wants?
---
Wastelanders....yes, pick one side or the other.  Game doesn't end there.  Still have to grind your way to full Ally reputation to be able to get good gear.  This can be done on both sides after Vault 79 mission.
---
Enclave....launch a nuke then that opens up different Enclave events
---
Also try to complete all your Camp Ally quests for the Commander, Beckett and raider(s).
---
Yes to the first, no to the second.
---
I‚Äôm on PC. Let me know if you want a hookup. I‚Äôve got... well, a bit of everything. Scrap, ammo, aid, equipment... just say the word
---
Sneak commando here. I'm finding it unlikely I would miss 15 shots with a 95 percent hit chance. It's very annoying.
---
I get what your trying to say here, but maybe using a BE framed isn‚Äôt the best way of going about it. All the explosive legacies are flat out broken when it comes to damage output.
---
Yeah, i found light set in Grafton, but cant find other ones.
---
I'm on the like side since everything I've encountered is pretty easy to kill.
---
I've have many a Bloodied stealth commando, bloodied melee, bloodied PA heavy energy weapon, Anti armor / furious PA heavy Ballistic, Junkies stealth riflewoman.
---
Even my new level 20 run and gun 10mm pistoler is doing damage.
---
It simply doesn't fit with the time period. Idk why this is so hard to understand. Fallout is not set in politically correct 2020.
---
Get a padlock for your belt just in case!
---
Ha haha ....they are making the enemies more difficult, do you think they will improve drops?
---
Less than 5%.
---
Bloodied will still be the best dps build and reasonable players see that. The ones who will stop playing are the ones who enjoyed being over powered. 
---
It won't be an actual loss to the community.
---
True but I take whatever is available when I get on a server. If I am playing a character with 25 int the building group isn't as useful.
---
Ah okay. Was going to offer you my spare Stimpak Diffuser plan if you were on PC.
---
I can't imagine having to grind that event for it. No one knows what they're doing, I stg.
---
That's like everything except heavy weapons. How do you do that?
---
I probably should have taken that biology class...
---
Wasn‚Äôt that the original idea behind the nuke zone? Lol ‚Äúthe endgame‚Äù
---
Never seen any in player shops, will check tomorrow :)
---
Laughs in Final Fantasy 11
---
*dancing* (safely)
---
Good call good call
---
And a partridge in a pear tree
---
Them leaving might even make the game better
---
5min with the glitch
---
I have bloody mess max and a few perks for WoK. My build works for me if I play right and stay in my power armor üòÇ outside of that I'm meltable
---
Well then. I guess I've been sitting on Gold this whole time.
---
I'll need to test this one.
---
I have to scroll for ages to see how many treasury notes I have.
---
The drops will always be lvl 50 with one wasteland. As long as your not in flat woods or ash heap which is 25.
---
At least you won‚Äôt experience what a lot of people hate seeing. A god roll lvl 5 piece of shit.
---
This is a truly honorable way to remember your friend. I'm sorry you have to go through his. May his soul rest in peace.
---
I saw a suggestion on another post that we should be able to craft clean versions of the clothes by using the dirty version plus abraxo plus water. Would love that! It could even be a new plan or an atomic shop item, a washing machine that actually works.
---
But if it works it works.  My go to is a be .50 and bffr15rl lmg I was just playing around with the flamer although be cryolator freezes the queen quick
---
I mean, there's just the slight possible chance it's actually not as good as you think it is.
---
That's a vault suit. Completely different set of clothing. I'm just stating what the time period was like that the game is set in.
---
It adds 60% to the explosive damage.
---
Since the explosive damage is 20% of weapon damage, it adds 12% to your overall damage. For 5 perk points, only take it if you are minmaxing or are leveraging other explosives (auto grenade, missile launcher, thrown explosives, etc)
---
Yes!  I would love that!
---
Yes because 12 year olds can‚Äôt play pc
---
Never said they were; I just said I want to be able to wear the pants version. Mostly because I hate the shoes on the skirt version :)
---
There should be a larger window than 24 hours to complete challenges.  Ideally all challenges would be weekly, but barring that, make daily challenges expire after 72 hours, barring the "do x a day" which should stay 24.
---
I‚Äôll be checking every day until it comes back!
---
This question could easily go for Modern Warfare, ESO, Apex, Pubg, almost any good game with PvP.
---
Probably a mod for that.
---
Explosive shotgun works great when they get nearly insta killed. I can usually get 1200-2000 xp per group.
---
Because I would wager the team making the game was pretty big, and the the team maintaining the game is probably medium at best, and it's possible they are two different groups entirely, so the quality between pre launch development and post launch development could be much different.
---
They nerfed my pants into a skirt?!
---
They do a lot of "well I guess im done playing today" stuff.  It's pretty bad.
---
No idea who down voted you. You made a solid point and I'm taking your suggestions into consideration as I tweak this build.
---
Not very many because once they actually play it they‚Äôll see that it isn‚Äôt a big deal. Assuming the current calculation is even final, which it probably isn‚Äôt.
---
Most 12 year olds don't have or afford high end pc that this game requires. Parents are more likely buying consoles nowadays instead of expensive pc's. That is why there are more adults playing on pc, and why consoles are full of kids yelling, screaming and threatening to rape your mom.
---
They say they are up in Reddit looking at what we want, and trying to implement it.... But ...so far just the ammo convertor.  I've seen lots of amazing suggestions pop up since BETA.
---
How about you start role playing with your character?  Create a story arc.  Give them your own missions.  Who says you HAVE to grind or do any of the silly time gates or legendary runs.  There are days where I‚Äôll plan a route for my character to walk from the forest to Cranberry bog, no fast travel, limited supplies, with the overall goal of assassinating the blood eagles crew and then walking back.  I like to role play my character as a deep cover Enclave Agent who secretly performs tasks and altering the balance of powers with the new factions.  Watch our Brotherhood of Steel!
---
It makes things stay fresh.  I hope enough of us Enclave agents band together on Reddit one day to give daily missions to each other.  Could be fun
---
Sure
---
*insert skyrim intro*
---
OP is still learning the nuances of actual logical discourse.  So,let him get past middle school and, hopefully, learn language and debate.
---
That seems like a lot of strength for a commando/rifleman build. How many weapons are you carrying at any given time?
---
Other than that I would lower adrenaline to 3 and add escape artist, also look into switching some of your luck perks for better critical, grim reapers sprint, four leaf clover, or critical savvy. These are game changers for either rifle build.
---
I doubt it would be that high still. They always come back after licking their wounds then complain about the next big update.
---
This has nothing to do with PC2020? I just want to wear pants. I can wear any other clothing item in the game and the clothes don‚Äôt change based on sex.
---
Just watched angry turtles video on sneak and he confirmed everything you said. Ultra light it is. Just wondering now if some secret service pieces will be okay since they can‚Äôt be shadowed. But I like the built in rad resistance they have
---
No, FO4 you start in your house with your spouse and baby.
---
It‚Äôs not designed so that you get them all at once! I don‚Äôt see why people don‚Äôt understand this!
---
Stop wanting everything handed to you immediately!
---
Well, pistols basically rely only on agility, and my stealth rifle build has 15 agility. For rifles it‚Äôs pretty well optimized, but 15 perception is a bit overkill on the pistol side. The damage output with pistols is still incredibly high though. And of course switching between commando/rifleman and guerrilla/gunslinger is just switching the damage perks out.
---
No, because even at max level the monsters you run into 99% of the time are still very easy to kill.  I one shot max level super mutants, I know it's build specific, but that's an issue with weapon balance.
---
Thanks...Did all of Beckett‚Äôs and Sofia....Forager hardly gave me missions so I booted him. Enjoyed Raider Punk til his started repeating. I got settler wander hanging around now.
---
Wendell the hickory tree lost a bird feeder, but that was our only damage. Well, aside from a jalape√±o plant that had to be splinted back upright.
---
We have power back as of yesterday afternoon, but there's still tons and tons of people without. 
---
We gave our tent to a family sleeping on the lawn of their wrecked apartment complex. But according to our mayor, "we don't really need the national guard".
---
We kinda do.
---
Probably continue with your old character if you don't want to repeat quests.. it sounds like you went pretty far down old main quest.
---
Legendary perks for lv 50+ are coming soon too.
---
There have been so many new things added that I would just try to jump in.
---
Also, don't throw out your old gear before checking if they're any good, or possibly even legacy items
---
I have 3 gunsmith, 1 Weapon Artisan, and 1 Luck of the Draw - this allows my weapon to occasionally repair itself so that I need to repair around once a week (for non-explosive).
---
Power patches is completely useless
---
I‚Äôm holding 10,000+ cloth so I often forget where to best farm this. 
---
I hit the books when I‚Äôm passing through.
---
 ‚ÄúOh yeah, there is a butt-ton of cloth here‚Äù is my typical response.
---
Enclave events? Like events only after scorched earth?
---
Bethesda: you weren't supposed to do that
---
Bethesda simply isn't worthy of our time or money anymore - the sooner people realize this, the sooner they'll start hurting and realizing what a bad company they've become.  Its definitely become just another EA-wannabe, and they're totally pathetic already in their pedantic push of trying to promote NW in hopes of copying Epic's success.
---
300 burnt textbooks on repeat.
---
You are still an absolute saint for the thought.   Been trying to get this recipe since waaaay before wastelanders.  And yeah, seems like 80% of people either don‚Äôt put the venison in, or just spend the whole time looting the building
---
Yeah it feels almost impossible to get anywhere on the board. I quit the game for 10 months, came back a few weeks ago, figured I might be able to beat the map. Hah, nope, I'll be lucky to get half way. You can complete the Wastelanders updated content in less than a week. Back to being bored and fighting the inventory cap constantly.  Being over level 200, there's still not much to do anymore. It's basically: do dailies, server hop, do 3x SBQ runs, server hop, rinse repeat. At least back in 2019 Whitesprings was fun. They nerfed that to hell and there's no replacement.
---
Edit: grammar and added more
---
That's a shame. I have an explosive pump shotgun that I'd like to put a nice skin on, but the only one available I can see in the atom shop is a Responders skin.
---
For solely an explosive effect on a weapon only, you would stear clear?
---
It takes 20 hours for those to reappear and there is only 3 days.
---
Just an update that I didn't find any Cave Fungus in The Deep. Just Fever Blossum, Starlight Berries, Brain Fungus and regular Glowing Fungus.
---
Wrong sub, mate. Try the trade subs.
---
Yes, the mire I believe can cap it at 100 but enemies will be 100 too. It might be 75? But still. This is better and worse than I thought.
---
But they're really good at it. üòÅ
---
What I‚Äôm wondering is, why did it take so long to decide on a massive restructuring of damage output? 
---
When and if this goes into effect it‚Äôll be nearly at the two year anniversary of game launch. Most online gamers are well aware that nerfs, buffs, and general build tweaks are inevitable within the first few months after game launch. Hence the TSE nerf and absolutely no one being shocked by it. By the way I personally agree that TSE was way overpowered back then, don‚Äôt think it needed to be nerfed as bad as it was but oh well. 
---
Anyway, here we are almost a full two years later. A majority of the community has their builds perfected, and most are content with the current situation. Yet we‚Äôre now looking at a massive balance change. It really doesn‚Äôt add up. If people are unhappy with certain builds being too powerful in their view then why not buff up other builds or add newer ones? 
---
Remove certain legendary effects such as nocturnal and maybe consolidate others. Combine hunters and exterminators effects so they‚Äôll do more damage to all wildlife and insects. Combine assassins, ghoul slayers,  and zealots so they‚Äôll do more damage against all humanoids. Buff troubleshooters and mutant slayers. 
---
Point is, there are other options to make decent damage builds available to other players fairly early on. All without severely nerfing the few viable builds that are available to players right now. 
---
At this point in the game, with it being nearly a full two years after release a negative balance change of this magnitude will most likely anger more players than it will satisfy. Especially those players that have spent a few hundred hours in this game and continue to do so all trying to prefect their builds. 
---
Rather it‚Äôs from perks, mutations, chems, or armor &amp; weapons they‚Äôve grinded or traded for.  They‚Äôve all spent a lot of time and money to get their characters where they want them, to make them as strong or resilient as possible only to have the rug pulled out from under them unexpectedly and make all of that time and effort seem for nothing. 
---
I can foresee a lot of these long term players leaving the game shortly after this goes into effect (if it does). For a lot them having to deal with the constant game issues that have been present since launch (trade bug, fast travel bug, total lack of an actual trade menu for some inexplicable reason) only to see their builds damage being gutted, all while the issues that seem to actually be affecting them are still there is just obnoxious to say the least. 
---
To summarize, instead of a massive balance change that will most likely anger the current player base, can we not have buffed up builds to match, add more options for new potential builds, and overall just add tougher enemies/ fights?
---
They are quite powerful, if you go with special cards alone, you can get up to 30 additional special on top of base 50, this is huge bonus, not to mention ammo perk.
---
833+ levels on top of 50 levels to max out them is rough
---
I think there‚Äôs a pretty simple way they can fix this issue. Keep the dailies and weeklies, they work fine - but make it so if I miss out on a couple of weeks I can go back into challenges and select ‚Äòweek 2‚Äô for example and go through day 1-7 challenges and the weekly challenge. Once I‚Äôve completed that I can go on and select ‚Äòweek 3‚Äô and so on. 
---
Let me do it in one sitting, I‚Äôm still putting the same hours in to complete it, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm doing it on my day off instead of squeezing it in every night. 
---
Logging on everyday is a fucking chore when I work a full time job and have other, real life commitments, other than this game. I love it but god damn it shouldn‚Äôt be like this.
---
Are you saying you don't want to contribute some plastic for a couple of bottles of booze, purified water and some psycho?  \[Yeah, me neither\]
---
Trading exploiters for code injectors. Don't worry, you get used to people with beam splitter handmades and god mode in NW.
---
I can see them running events for bonus perk coins, but as far as receiving them like you do treasury notes it‚Äôs probably going to be a big no.
---
üôÇ
---
Breezing through content... The need for that may be a problem in it's own right. It reminds me a bit of GTA : Online and the Oppressor MK.II glitch. People loved it when it was first discovered because it made grinding the content so much more convenient, but it also kind of soured the experience as using anything but the MK.II just wasn't nearly as efficient. PVP was always a mess in that game, but it was an absolute distaster after the release of that vehicle. In co-op, it kind of destroyed the ability for players to work together as a single character on that vehicle could finish entire missions on their own before players were able to get to the objective through other means.
---
It's kind of surprising to see how many people are against changes to these sorts of issues, though. You'd think they'd advocate for it, as having these issues fixed properly would allow for greater freedom in game when it comes to building characters, not having to rely on glitched legendaries/perks. You would hope that PVP would be skill based, not exploit based, but it just seems that's the way games are these days.
---
its almost like capitalism is unfair to the actual workers
---
or something
---
these sorts of posts are so /r/selfawarewolves sometimes
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted... Cyberpunk seems right up most Fallout fans alley.

Well...we got the nuked wendigo coming...but how long will that last?

Pft. Stadia is obviously a better.

That‚Äôs not a bad idea although they‚Äôd probably cost around 200-300 bullion.

What platform are you on?

You can alternate between a public and a private server to refresh it once I believe.
---
This 100% sums up the thread.
---
Or other PA headlamps existing at all. Sad t65 and excavator noises.
---
A 1 star medic rolling pin if anything
---
Then why are you here?
---
i think it just because we want it to be good cuz we enjoyed it, but in the reality it is undeniably bad
---
Your build suggests you like carrying lots, or have issues with weight.
---
Have you completed tadpole missions for the bacpack?
---
Assuming you are at small BP (+30 weight), by completing tadpole and also buying/farming a high capacity mod, you can up your weight by another 90.
---
Then you can drop strong back pack rat and such, and put at minimum 6 pts into something that does *anything* other than carry weight
---
I also don't understand your logic for thirst quencher. Care to explain? A water purifier at your camp should make this perk very questionable
---
Well shit. Now i dont know? Im questioning now if maybe Ive confused it with Gut Shroom or something else but I dunno. I feel like I have seen it because I remember remarking on it to a friend at the time. I just cant remember where :/ It came in with Wastelanders so any of the cavernous areas that got added or a makeover could possibly be it. Maybe even Carleton Mine? Ill check out a couple areas myself later and if I find any Ill let you know
---
Um nope. That's not how junk items on servers work. For a public item in the world there is a 180 item list. After 180 items, the game forgets what you picked up. after 180 items you can jump servers and loot any item you took before that 180 items.
---
There is absolutely NO timer on junk looting. I run a junk run, end it with 300 burnt textbooks, and then run the whole thing again.
---
Ugh I figured. You think they'll ever bring it back :(???
---
Ps4
---
Maybe they could allow us to upgrade the level of our gear using legendary modules or something.
---
I like lvl 5 god rolls. The leveling process has never been easier
---
You most likely wont get epic rank 100 season PA and such, but you can still get at least ammo converter from score rank.
---
I only know the shotgun magic effects. Don't know if they apply to the minigun.
---
The body regularly despawns from the sheer amount of robots that are spammed into spawning. Or the corpse gets launched across the vallies!
---
But then it's body drops the same loot as any Legendary assultron, and rarely more than 1 star so the event rewards are more important personally.
---
Trash build for pvp, great build for pve.

There's going to be an Armor Ace skin for the Pump Action in the next Season:

It's points like this when I think they should out source to modders. Think I have seen modular clothing mods for fallout 4. Have also noted modders tend to put more polish on their products before releasing.
---
It's just a bad system. Fallout 76 isn't a job.
---
Well I suppose for new players. Never really thought of that.

I'm on the Xbox.

Can't speak for them above, but for me, I pop the Sentry Bots and Assaultrons there for a big chunk of XP. All the more so if you have any XP buffs going

You can alternate as many times as you want as long as you spend at least 15 minutes in a public to reset your private world. However, that has nothing to do with item resets. Its just that more items will be available in a private because no one else has looted them.
---
Northwest of Harper's Ferry is a spot where you can have junk node and a few water purifiers.  I have used it before.
---
GaaS is generally not very consumer friendly, which is why MMOs are the only games with this problem.
---
The experience is more or less the same.
---
I‚Äôm sorry that you feel this game is more important than your family
---
You can try using the camera,  but yeah legendary bodies unlooted should follow you to the nearest train station
---
I didnt know PA plans had any value these days. Is that a very rare drop or something? Are you sure it‚Äôs worth even 500 caps?
---
Seriously, if amateurs were fixing my game and putting out better products than I put out, I would just hire those people right away.
---
Ya dang millennial!
---
Yeah I was doing the same thing. I played every single day just to quickly get the dailies done. The game lost any kind of fun parts to it for me. A few weeks ago I just flat out quit. It‚Äôs been 3 weeks and I haven‚Äôt touched the game. I‚Äôll check it out every now and then, but they really have no idea what they‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs a joke of a team that‚Äôs working on the game
---
I‚Äôve got to the new arrivals quest level 20 and It still won‚Äôt work for me been 4 days now getting annoying
---
Seems likely just based on everything else that's brought back for a limited time, just keep an eye on the atomic shop. Might even be discounted as well.
---
Best of luck to you!
---
Apparently the queen has a 1% chance of dropping it when you kill her. I posted a previous post about the plan a few days ago, and read about how people have launched and killed the queen over 100 times and still haven‚Äôt gotten it.
---
I can't imagine putting in that much grind just to be slightly better lol, thanks.
---
I haven‚Äôt played everyday and I‚Äôm level 86 for the legendary run. Maybe you‚Äôre being too emotional?
---
The scaling was mental and completely out of control.
---
the difference between no build, a half build, and a min maxed gun, and min maxed melee build was 100 : 200 : 1000 : 20,000
---
That is far too egregious to ever reasonably reconcile, people should neve have been able to get even close to one shotting the queen, but that's where they were.
---
and it's not like you could close that gap by increasing the floor, because everything else built upon that floor.
---
As a step 1. I am very glad they brought the nonsense multiplier stacking shenanigans down, now they can more easily tweak and tune the builds, guns, and perks without causing mad run away effects.
---
For example, now they can buff weapon specific perks from 10:15:20 to 10:20:30, and other changes to make things stronger without completely breaking the high end builds, as the difference before the change between three 20 and three 30 perks would have been 173 vs 220, but now it is 160 v 190, which is far more sensible.
---
Edit, mathed wrong, 220, not 210
---
I would love some variation in seating posture.
---
Just did a quick test run on the Super Mutants in West Tek. Compared to my Vampire's Gauss Minigun, it was absolutely melting them.
---
I should also say I like Camden Park/Tyler County Fairground for looting as there are few enemies plus chances for magazines/bobbleheads in addition to other materials. 
---
Camden park is by far easier IMO as all the junk is not hidden by grass.
---
Ah yeah I had to do some looking up too. Well, good luck! It sounds like it's possibly worth a croc bp or two
---
What is the downside to removing time gates? Content done too quickly, the problem is that there is little content so they put shitty time gates to artificially lengthen the game
---
"PvP should be when both players want to fight each other"
---
Okay. Well claiming a Workshop then hanging around it is like wearing a sign that says "hey come PvP me!" Every single time you claim one it tells you players can contest it and open you to PvP. Not just the first time. Not just the first workshop you claim in a server. Every single Workshop you ever claim. 
---
When you enter a Workshop, and especially when you claim it you are basically agreeing to PvP.  Don't cry about getting killed by another player because "you didn't agree to it" when no one else is putting you in a situation that opens you to PvP but yourself.
---
Thanks mate.
---
I don't know why everybody got so precious about a simple suggestion. I'm not the one running around griefing.
---
You know I've had almost nothing but positive experiences in the actual game. People there are nice and helpful and interesting.
---
This sub is toxic as hell though. What a contrast.
---
Unlikable? Sounds like projection to me. Personal attacks instead of consideration. People bragging about wanting to grief people.
---
You're a hell of a charmer yourself there bud.
---
Just your ptsd acting up. No worries.
---
Ya
---
40 year old working Dad here.  I play an hour a day, but I‚Äôve missed maybe a weeks worth of Dalies.  I‚Äôm level 85, never felt like a grind.  I rebalanced my too time be a low health, unyielding, stealth, mele Junkie.  I‚Äôve brought INT to 12, strength to 15, Agi to 12.  I have herbivore mutation.  I rock Brain Fungus soup, Berry Mentats, Cranberry relish, and lovers embrace.  I‚Äôve really enjoyed the event.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll need to buy out at all
---
Sorry. I thought you were the okay when I said that. Lighting problems is the thread topic after all.
---
It is as far as I know through their respective dailies. You'll just reach max with the one you raised with much sooner since said raid gives a good bit of rep/affinity to that faction
---
Yup. Just keep doing the dailies.
---
Include the ‚Äúrandom‚Äù settler/raider encounters and that thing where you turn in mirelurk meat at Ohio River Adventures.
---
Probably just for the inspirational perk card to get 15% more XP. Maybe you should get so worked up about something small.
---
You need some wwr armor pieces or start going through the garbage and get rid of it that's what I did its totally changed the way I play now. I dont keep anything that I'm not going to use why keep stuff on you that you are carrying around unless you are becoming a trader if not start scripting or dropping or selling cheap
---
If you are working, then you are paying. Bethesda rule #3743091
---
If not, why release this game with microtransactions versus unsufferable grind wall?
---
I don't know I haven't moved my camp on the pts and considering your pet has to run to the new location  I'd rather not do that
---
Ask on a trading sub
---
The dailies take 30-45 minutes most days. If you warmly the cosmetic crap from the end of the run you can find a few minutes to do that. If not, you're not entitled to everything in the season and you need to accept that.
---
We get quite a few God Moders in NW on XB1, annoying but not too awful. A beam splitter handmade sounds both hysterical AND terrifying, though... The sheer amount of things I've seen spawned watching PC stuff is mind-boggling.
---
I can confirm by repeating joining and making sure you go to the terminal first to analyse the blood sample before the T Fuse it bypasses the glitch just have to keep trying
---
i used a chunky body :D, nothing changed
---
Like I said I‚Äôm not trying to sell it here. I just wanted to hear opinions and ideas on what it might be worth. I‚Äôm still undecided if I want to sell it. Or just learn it myself.
---
Did that. It‚Äôs just stuff to trade, issue is I can‚Äôt scrip it at once and I don‚Äôt want it to go to waste. Maybe I‚Äôll give it away so I can move
---
Really feels like you are forcing this idea of only playing two hours a week being sufficient to complete the run into what OP is saying. I feel like these posts are more about coming up with a mechanic so that if you can only play for 12-14 hours a week on Saturday, you don‚Äôt get less progression than someone else who plays only 7 hours a week, an hour per day.
---
Tesla will definitely get you hits, but it turns too many of the bodies to ash piles which fucks up grabbing loot for not only you, but everyone else. It also makes the game lag like craaaaazy since this last patch. I did it once and felt like a douche halfway through and switched to a garbage tier grenade launcher dropped from one of the scorched.
---
Another reason why I switched to console. The only thing that can happen here is duped gear.
---
Hire would be best, at minimum freelance them for a project, some do 3, 6, to one year project contracts. If they made a good mod that could be converted in to 76 as a feature, pay them to do it. Either that, or sponsor mods like wildcard does. Think Modders are what is keeping ark around.
---
you dont, though
---
i just finished it yesterday and i skipped heaps, never set foot in nw for example
---
They are good changes, it‚Äôs just that people don‚Äôt like seeing smaller numbers. It‚Äôs that gratification feeling from games. The ‚Äúone wasteland‚Äù update is looking to be a big patch that really needs to happen IF Bethesda does the scaling well and it doesn‚Äôt break everything more.
---
Here's a question: where's your camp?
---
Now, where's the closest car that can explode?
---
Third, do you or one of your close by neighbours have tank and nuke sound making statues that are available in the atom store now and then? 
---
It's going to be one of those things. I've never heard of a bug that just plays war noises and it sounds like neither has anyone else. Record a video next time, perhaps.
---
I've turned in about 40ish so far and have gotten a 1\* two shot fancy revolver, not a bad wall hanger.
---
No, I'm the sand!
---
I bought it. I like it. It is a bit loud but you can turn it off.
---
Have you spent all your levels? You can't bank levels to skip lower-level perks.
---
üëèüèª‚¨ÜÔ∏è
---
My favorites are the orbital strike minigun and the unyielding/AP refresh/Sentinel power armor .......yeah.....the hacks are endless on PC.
---
Well yeah, It's a bluntly positive change that allows them to actually balance weapons. With how DR works multiplicative bonuses end up being stronger than they appear.
---
Hopefully it means some of the less loved Big Guns get some attention.
---
I promise you, it‚Äôs none of that. It sounds like the sounds of a nuke zone.
---
PC :(
---
Yes, dailies and random encounter areas around the map. It takes FOREVER but you can do it. Most people used exploits to reach max reps because it takes so long to finish them
---
I have nothing to spend the extra levels on besides some action boy and lone wander ones other than that I don't need the others. if that is what you meant.
---
Yeah but I know some only get to play once a week, it would be cool if they didn't have 0 chance of completion without cheating.  And yes there is a way to complete it in a day, this is Bethesda we are talking about. InnovSurvivalist vids will confirm I am not making this up.
---
PC
---
Yeah it‚Äôs an event reward
---
It's not worth what your asking. You can guaranteed calibrated shocks for other (some might say even better) power armors. 
---
The alligator backpack plan was EXTREMELY rare, with bids going up to legacy god rolls and multiple max cap values. 
---
BE handmade and miniguns are top tier, you'll need more then an ultracite plan to snag them. 
---
You MIGHT be able to barter up to just a bloodied version of the guns you asked about but you'll need to find someone who's just itching to complete the plan set for ultracite.
---
everything ultracite I drop the plans at the end of the fight. thought about keeping and trying to sell the last couple of calibrated shocks plans but ended up dropping them like everything else.
---
I never said that. I specifically said that you don‚Äôt *have* to get all the rewards.
---
You‚Äôre a victim of your own FOMO. 
---
I never suggested or even implied that two hours a week is or even should be sufficient to compete the entire season.
---
I haven‚Äôt logged in every day and I‚Äôm at rank 88.
---
There‚Äôs pros and cons to this current system. Same goes for every time-gated aspect of this game.
---
Reward from uranium fever?
---
You should ask for opinions on the trade sub as well. That's where you'll find people that have an idea of what it's worth.
---
Watoga is also a city in the game. And grafton.
---
Well that stinks, Why does building sites or leveling guides list it at getting it at that level, oh well If that is how it truly is I'll just re-roll the toon its only level 10 don't take long to get to that.
---
Thank you for being honest. This is the type of response I was hoping to get. 
---
The backpack is something we tried really hard to get. But we didn‚Äôt have any luck. I know there are people selling it for real money. 
---
The weapons aren‚Äôt something i desperately need since I‚Äôve been using my same 4 weapons for the past year. 
---
But I know those are weapons my gf and friend have been looking for.
---
I will
---
Or perhaps I understand the concept of saying something into the void and not needing anything from it. It's a wonderful mindset to have, I recommend you try it. ‚úåÔ∏è
---
For the Emmett event?
---
Yea I don‚Äôt know what is going on with that lately. It‚Äôs funny when people say the atomic shop never has bugs. It‚Äôs super bugged right now.
---
You hear tanks and artillery in nuke zone? I hear a background "burning" sound but that's about it. 
---
Where. Is. Your. Camp.
---
Why are you certain it's not any of the things being suggested? Please be specific.
---
When you say war sounds, you did mention tanks, artillery. What about planes? Jet or rotor? Machine guns? Propaganda blaring in background? How long did these sounds go for? Did you search for it?
---
Did the sound grow in volume as you walked one direction or another? Did the sound stop only when you fast traveled away?
---
This is what I mean by being specific.
---
If it makes you feel any better, most of the rewards will be available in exchange for the Gold Bullion after the season is over
---
If you're looking for survivability and not running PA, you have enough in endurance for maxed ironclad for +50 dr and er.
---
I'd drop happy camper for strange in numbers and travel agent, but keep Charisma at 3 so you can swap in maxed out hard bargain.
---
I'd ditch woodchucker (and junk shield, but that's just me, keep it if you carry a lot of junk and want the boost) for class freak so you're not losing as much int when it's already kinda low (higher int helps with XP gains)
---
I'd ditch the flat carry increase from strong back for an extra rank of traveling pharmacy and the two ranks of bandolier to reduce ammo weight.
---
I rather have that then overseer rank or kill 6-9 creatures. 
---
It could take a lot of runs to do either. I ain‚Äôt got time for that shit.
---
Edit: look here removing that would make killing creatures and overseer rank  more likely for daily challenges. I do not want to run 2 to 10 20-30 min runs trying for them.
---
The last time I did kill creatures it took me 6 good runs for 3 creatures because RNG hates me.
---
Just like having something rare irl that plan is worth a buttload to the right person.  Not talking the moon and stars here but enough to get a decent weapon or armor piece.  May even get a low end legacy if they want it that bad.
---
Hmmm
---
Same here. I‚Äôm not a vendor. I don‚Äôt even have one set up in my camp. Whatever plans I already know I give to my gf and my friend. The rest I just drop in the overseer‚Äôs camp box.
---
Thank youüëç
---
Unless you‚Äôre minmaxing damage, yeah. Same reason to only take 1star Adrenaline and Tenderizer, (both of those get the majority of their benefit from the first point)
---
That being said I run a HW/EXplo build and I do minmax, I have full ranks of all 3 of those ;)
---
This.  I'm not even bothering.  If I start trying, I'll feel the need to grind it... and I just don't have the time in my life with everything IRL going on.
---
Yea you‚Äôre right. Didn‚Äôt think of that. Thank you.
---
Oh sweet merciful Interloper, I saw that one yesterday during a stream, peppering down on the SBQ and rocking the world like a meteor lol
---
They are guaranteed to appear at their listed level. They just won't appear if you have perks saved up: if yo stop picking perks at level 3 for example, you'll only see level 4 perks each time you level until you start spending the levels you've been saving.
---
If you can't get the dailies done in like an hour and a half each day you playin the game wrong. The "Legendary Run" is for aesthetics. The things for your CAMP can be bought from the faction vendors.  I'm rank 82 as of this post and I got glitched out of the entire weekly challenges twice. If you can't get this done you just aren't trying and this grind wasn't made for you. Downvote me.
---
Just give it to a level 50 player I always ask if they are starting out then I drop everything
---
Very true.  I know there might be a person out there willing to do anything for that plan. While other people might not care, or they do want it but don‚Äôt want to give away too much.
---
I've got 4 vendors stacked with plans at 25 caps each but pa stuff never sells
---
Some food can cure addictions, so look out for those.
---
thanks man!
---
You don't have to re-roll, just spend the levels you saved up. You'll have to choose some filler perks while you're leveling up.
---
But #gamers are the most oppressed people /s
---
But you don‚Äôt have to at all. You can buy your way through. Would not recommend though
---
Honestly, your best bet would be to make a post on a trading sub and gamble if anyone wants to take you up on your offer. If nothing comes up, learn it yourself, or buy some serum plans to lighten up your camp wallet and list it in a vending machine.
---
The croc backpack was no joke, I opened hundreds of ornate pails and only got one plan.
---
The sound did not change in any way, until I logged off and in. Then it was gone (I only heard at my camp).
---
My camp is in literally the nicest, quietest northwest corner of the map. There is NOTHING hostile nearby.
---
I say war sounds, but it was really just assorted explosions. It‚Äôs hard to describe.
---
I often hear these in a nuke zone. It‚Äôs not in-game noise (caused by any one action). It‚Äôs ambient
---
and move them once I hit lvl 50 ??
---
Lol bullshit
---
Interesting
---
Nah, a better analogy would be more like to get that one "free" coffee you've got to sacrifice your paychecks and tips for the next 3 months. When you finally get the coffee, your boss tells you he spit in it. To get one with less spit, you've got to do the same for 4 additional months. And so on.
---
The grind is unbearable, unfun, more work than actual work, and the effects are largely boring. Regular perks are more desirable than these "legendary" perks, which is why the SPECIAL legendary perks are going to be pretty much the only useful ones. As a level 430 player with 1,600 hours on this game, and two other level 100+ characters, this system is trash.
---
I think people have always wanted more.
---
Historically, it lead to war, but complaining online is faster, easier, and cheaper.
---
For real. I'm also a heavy build. I use power armor and a gauss mini gun and melt almost everything immediately with almost no threat of dying. Only the Colossus and the SBQ last longer than a few seconds, and I'm not impressed with the Colossus. You shouldn't be able to solo an end game boss monster in a minute or so. The games difficulty definitely needs to be dialed up a few degrees. I also wouldn't complain if they added player factions or guilds or clans or tribes or something. I like helping low level players fresh out of the vault with food and water and maybe a little ammo if I have it or can craft it easily. It'd be nice to be in a group dedicated to helping the "little guy". I'm going way off topic here, so I'll stop.
---
It'd be better than scrapping perks.
---
I think I deleted the comment by mistake but thank you for the help
---
I‚Äôd hate to see those poor chickens try to pass a radscorpion or radtoad egg.
---
More settings in general regarding event notifications would be much appreciated. Maybe an option to turn them off completely (mainly for youtubers and content creators), and also an option to turn them on for ALL events, even the smaller ones you have to pay to fast travel to (like AWOL Armaments).
---
Hm. Weird. Okay one more question. 
---
Did the sound appear as you were loading into the camp area from fast travel/login, and did it continue after for a bit?
---
The only thing similar I can think of is after latest patch, when I fast travel to camp, or log in at camp, sometimes my camps objects explode.
---
It looks and sounds almost like my camp is being destroyed, but a few seconds later all my camp objects will load in.
---
I would agree the sounds i hear are "explosions" of sorts, wooden, splintery explosions.
---
I am on ps4.
---
I feel the same. I just want to play the game, so let me play it. Time gates feel like a punishment for playing too much.
---
I can understand becoming allies with the raiders and settlers will take time, and I think that plan works well. However, I can only sell 150 scrip worth of weapons a day, and only have a max amount of 1000 scrip on me? Why?
---
Some endgame items, rare plans, rare outfits, etc can be sold for more caps than I can carry. Can the settlers at foundation open a bank to store my excess caps in? Or perhaps I could put them in the safe that is at the foot of my bed. I've got 800 lbs of gear in that safe, I'm sure I can fit some caps in there.
---
I enjoy playing fallout 76, but I only play on the weekends. Let me have a good time grinding away for the 12 hours I get to play on Sunday instead of punishing me for being able to play for more than an hour or two.
---
Radiation Rumble
---
No, from Radiation Rumble. They're often confused.
---
Uranium Fever is the one with the mole miners.
---
Idk about others but I don‚Äôt do every event..  just public events and umm manhunt

There is a ‚Äúpump station‚Äù skin available, but it‚Äôs not quite my taste so idk if you‚Äôd be interested.
---
No, I‚Äôm not hearing anything like that. Like I said, these are all ambient noises, not linked to animations or anything. And it continued for as long I was at camp
---
it‚Äòs fixed in the next patch.
---
I mean, Nekrosias has a trash PvE build that he uses in PvP for shiggles.
---
After you beat the main story, enclave events start popping up is what he means.  I was in the same boat pretty much just doing whatever and not finishing the quests.  my advice is finish the main quest before finishing Wastelanders.  More of a complete story.  Neighborly is one tier below Ally, friendly is 2.  so you are close but not too close.  it takes like 6000 points between the last two tiers and you are earing 225 a pop so it takes a while.
---
You called me a hacker for using select on my controller to cap a workshop my dude. If you made a band it would be Syndrome of a Downs. You were the first to start making personal attacks. And lemmi tell ya, it's telling that you a fat neckbeard keyboard warrior. Feed me more of your salty tears fatboi
---
That‚Äôs too easy. They have to complain and get imaginary Internet points to feel reassured about their opinion.
---
Yes, it's there plan all along
---
Yeah. Also you don't have to raise the SPECIAL of whichever perk you choose. Just level up the SPECIAL you want to upgrade, and then check the filter buttons at the bottom of the screen to look at perks from a different SPECIAL stat.
---
Yeah but once it breaks, it‚Äôs impossible to repair.
---
I might be wrong, but I thought players couldn‚Äôt try to take your workshop away while the ‚Äúdefend‚Äù event is up and running. 
---
But yea, like you said yourself. It‚Äôs part of the game. It‚Äôs the only place people that like to PVP can guarantee a fight. Instead of just shooting a person on pacifist, or one that just walks away.
---
Yes please!  I don‚Äôt think I was around when that dropped but it looks very cool
---
But they are easy to make. Let the ghoul keep his suit. Come by my camp and I'll make it for you.
---
True
---
Applaud....
---
How? Or are you one of those from the degeneration nation that have no regard for others and just want negative internet points to match the amount of friends you have?
---
I can‚Äôt fast travel and don‚Äôt use a mic, so idk how

Fortifying Whitespring Bunkers:
---
We bring resources to clean up &amp; rebuild the destroyed sections of the bunker, which then become a separate instance from the main bunker and has rooms for the up to 24 (IIRC) players that can be in any server at a time.
---
getting flashbacks to when one tamriel was announced for ESO
---
it turned out fine and extended the longevity of the game
---
i am looking forward to it, it makes farming lower level events viable for high levels, more levels=more xp
---
I posited that idea, because I didn't know about a feature of the game and you were being smug instead of informative.
---
Ricochet is great! The dr you get from evasive is not much especially considering how damage resistance stacking works
---
Angry Turtle shows a way to blaze through this (comparatively) without any cheating or glitching.
---
And this was a fully modded Vampire's +10 Aiming Damage compared to a Two Shot Bashing Damage with no mods.
---
I'd say checks out.
---
I am fine with the current model. At 319 on my main, this gives me something to work toward. Also, if you are wanting the maximum number of perk points as quickly as possible, do not rank one card up before beginning the next. Rank all six to level 2. Then level 3. Then, finally, level 4. You will obtain far more points far earlier that way.
---
I had also just been talking to a guy who was actively discussing how he hacks around the bans on the PC implementation so that he can continue to grief people.
---
So I confused you with someone worse than you, but only apparently slightly worse than you.
---
üëÄüòò
---
Yeah XP grinders are set on this AngryTurtle covered the mechanics in a vid... But.. you knew that was coming.. XP grinding for those who play off peak hours where servers are emptying\dying it is tough to grind XP.  I am guessing you are hearing the venting of players that just can't grind like that.
---
Oh wait I'm sorry, you suckered me back in.... You actively admitted to hacking bans.
---
You really are obsessed with me if you keep on responding after I quit until I forget that I have stopped talking to you.
---
&gt;Or perhaps I understand the concept of saying something into the void and not needing anything from it. It's a wonderful mindset to have, I recommend you try it.
---
No. You do not seem to understand this because, well, Reddit is not ‚Äúthe void‚Äù as you want to use that phrase.  Reddit allows responses/replies. That‚Äôs common. 
---
If you don‚Äôt want feedback then just yell in your house (your void) and hope your neighbors don‚Äôt hear/respond.
---
My response to that was one sentence, that it was the select button on your controller. I was straight up informative about that. I am smug tho, smug you still called me a hacker. That's why I murder people with melee and a jetpack, they can't claim haxx
---
I never really got into pvp with this amount of complexity in builds. Halo, cod, titanfall im all over pvp. This with the ability to one shot a player that may or may not realize he is in pvp at the time, not much for it. I know where the pvp zones are and i just dont go to them. I have enough to do without it. I dont knock on players that want to kill off a guy in one shot just to pick up a small amount of junk and...not really sure what else. I just dont fet involved in all that and dont have a build made to handle or deal with it.
---
You responded to my girlfriend so she linked me dumbass. I'm just here to remind you to suck my nads and only speak when I give you permission. Does your wife's boyfriend know you're up past the bedtime he gave you
---
Thanks!
---
Also I never hacked bans my dude. Had the same account since beta. Only discord bans me
---
Any forum is 'the void', no matter how much you want to deny it. Posting something does not inherently mean feedback was sought, or required. The fact that you think otherwise shows both your arrogance, your overblown sense of self-importance, as well as your immaturity. Kindly sit on railroad spike.
---
The nerf is aimed at the wrong target. The biggest issue is unyielding armor.
---
Isn't the fact - that people are completing it a month early (without buying atoms) proof that you do not?

I think there is a lot more wiggle room then you give it a credit for.
---
I'm listening
---
I have not had that experience in 76 on PS4. I've ended up on public teams with people that sound young, but other than being into talking about glitches/exploits (that they couldn't get to work) they were fine.
---
Ran a silo, SBQ, farmed mats.
---
You very clearly state:
---
&gt;By your logic, players that can only play for two hours once a week should have the option to jump up to the same XP level as a player that has played four hours a day since BETA.
---
&gt;That‚Äôs not reasonable.  And neither is expecting that a player that is only able or willing to invest a smaller amount of time gets the same rewards from this season as a player that invests a larger amount of time.
---
OP never says that the person who is only able to log on once or twice a week is only playing two hours, yet you pulled this number out of thin air and used it as a major point in your argument. Posts I‚Äôve seen about this are almost always from the perspective of the weekend warriors who clocks upwards of 20 hrs a weekend in the game. Why should they be punished by the ‚ÄúDaily Quest‚Äù system when they are more dedicated than a lot of the players who do say that they log in everyday to complete their quests?
---
I understand that grinding is a part of the game and I am fine with that, I have five full build characters on Xbox and recently started playing on PC aw well. I know the grind, BUT Bethesda is actively punishing players who have IRL stuff that means they don‚Äôt always get to put time into a game daily. This is the same as people asking for daily limits being switched to weekly. These are artificial limitations that have no real meaning other than driving up the daily returning player number for their reporting metrics.
---
Like I said, I just started playing on PC about a week ago. I may not get all the rewards for this season. I‚Äôm fine with that. But if there is a player out there who has put in 140 hrs (10 hrs per day on the 7 weekends since the start of the run) who may not finish because they don‚Äôt get the benefits of the daily quest SCORE, there is a real problem with the system.
---
Go to a different server.
---
I'm glad for him, though actual PC bans you can't hack around. So he's lying to be an edgelord, which I get. He can do him
---
Do you have dodgy? If not I'd recommend it in place of evasive I run dodgy and the 30% resistance is awesome I run it with Action boy and it seems to refill my ap enough in between getting shot to let me kill everyone before I run out of ap. I'd also recommend barbarian i dropped 1 rank from each slugger tier (15% less damage) for 80 DR I think its pretty worth it
---
&gt; Really feels like you are forcing this idea of only playing two hours a week being sufficient to complete the run into what OP is saying. I feel like these posts are more about coming up with a mechanic so that if you can only play for 12-14 hours a week on Saturday,
---
But let's split that a different way.  What if you could time to play over the weekend, and could also slip in one day during the week to do a few ?
---
I feel like that would get you pretty close - if not all the way there.
---
Yes
---
Yeah, I have dodgy and action boy to keep AP flowing into it. Sounds like ricochet is the way to go, especially for those super mutants and robots blasting away at me while I‚Äôm closing the gap.
---
Today I was in the middle of battling some super mutants in a defense event when someone started taking over the workshop. I was pretty busy so didn‚Äôt notice right away. 
---
Yeah, I know, and Maybe it‚Äôs fun for people that play pvp, but it isn‚Äôt for those of us that don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs pretty crappy actually. I‚Äôm no slouch but I don‚Äôt do pvp at all and always get my butt handed to me. I‚Äôm just not built for that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I'm sorry for your loss:( Losing a pet can hurt so much, I mean they have such a special bond with their owner. I recently lost my dog, he was this dopey English Springer spaniel with so many health problems. He lived for 13 years but it still feels like it was way too soon.
---
There are 2$ accounts on g2g and other places though, so I mean, that's a way around bans.
---
I didn't even think of that last part. Good catch!
---
His name is BoomrrDoomer thank you :)
---
This sentence is like jibberish. I have a lot to learn. Thanks, friend!
---
Basically, waiting till a higher level to spend the points doesn't help in any way.
---
If you can't find anything useful now, and you don't spend it, it'll still be the same next level. You won't see anything new till that point is spent.
---
ghosts, probably.
---
The fancy shotgun has a hidden bonus of 50% increased mag so 12rounds and a bonus to reload as well but seems to work when u fully empty it it then seem to reload faster.  Some one had posted shotgun  had increased50%mag and 15%reload from data mining, also the pistol had 25% FF and 15% reload as well.
---
Yup, get ready to grind the second faction for a month to get to ally status.
---
It‚Äôs free too. Other games battlepasses require you to not only pay, but complete and play a lot more than just doing an hour a day of dailies.
---
Yeah I'm moving points into the special now, just not placing the cards lol
---
Yes. Both western outfit and western outfit w chaps were mega rare drops from Toxic Valley events. Chaps outfit was rarer out of the two and would go for max caps or more before wastelanders dropped. I only ever got the western outfit once as a legit drop from toxic Valley dailies. Now I see them all the time in vendors for 1k.
---
That‚Äôs my point with saying this isn‚Äôt a battle pass
---
All battle or season passes exclusively reward dedicated players. 76 seasons are no different.
---
I can understand where you're coming from. NukesAndDragons has a great build creator, and if you scroll through PvP discords, you can also get tips there. But I see how it can be daunting.
---
Personally I run a quantum/commando build. But that relies on getting quantums from friends in high places.
---
Very kind of you to say so, thank you:) Honestly it's difficult but I the reality still hasn't hit me. I feel like I should he feeling more than I do
---
WHAT???? Are you playing the same game???
---
Nice! I do like it.
---
So this happened to me as well but I'm not sure my reason will fit yours , I started on bethesda launcher and switched to steam so then and only then did it start counting for the achievement so for example I had like 66 done when I got the achievement so possibly if achievements only came out with the wasteland update you might need to do more depending on how many you had done before the update .
---
I'm sorry if this is hard to undersand its very late and I'm typing while walking home .
---
Not sure if achievements have always been on ps4 or are they new like the steam ones. But this might help so here you go.
---
I‚Äôm just happy that explosives like the mini nuke and nade launcher will not be as crappy as other weapons now.
---
Well mini nuke still pretty bad due to weight.
---
This whole idea of timing out the dailies and weekly's is crazy.. I hunted frantically for something to do to move ahead on the legendary piece board but nothing left to accomplish until the reset. I ended up chasing down the ingredients for a cranberry meatball grinder but there wasn't any scorched beasts to shoot down save one I managed to get because I fast traveled to a blast area and took the last few shots at a secondary target, man that really pissed everybody off.. lol
---
Ah I understand better now. I agree with you.
---
I‚Äôm not sitting around either of my systems at the moment, but the easy math says that you are missing out on roughly half of the available dailies(3 days vs 7 days, 3/7). I know that when the run first started you could only miss a few days before you fell a significant distance behind the curve. You would have to do the math, but I feel like even with the extra dailies you would still be cutting it close and very dependent on double XP/high score weekends.
---
If I remember after work I may run the numbers and see exactly what the disparity is.
---
In a sense, you DO level up legendary perk cards with exp...there are even exp milestones...
---
Unfortunately they are called levels...
---
But, jokes aside, the answer is "because that wouldn't be nearly the huge pain in the ass/time sink that using levels and converting perk cards will be." :(
---
"But only apparently slightly worse than you."
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Aww u/Nekrosias, babe, you're not the biggest baddie it would seem. ;) Jk üòòüòòüòò
---
I‚Äôm Tazier, have him add me :)
---
That‚Äôs an analogy. A player that plays for less time shouldn‚Äôt expect to have the same XP as a player that plays for more time.  It had nothing to do with SCORE. It was a comparison of reasonability. 
---
The ‚Äòtwo hours‚Äô was not related to the SCORE. Notice the part where I compared it to someone playing fours hours a day **since BETA**. 
---
The Legendary Run has only been around for less than seven weeks. It did not exist in BETA. So how did my ‚Äòtwo hours a week vs four hours a day since BETA‚Äô imply I suggested two hours weekly could complete the season?  I was talking about XP overall, **not SCORE**. 
---
Let me make it *very clear for you in no uncertain terms*; **it is virtually impossible, short of glitches or buying ranks, to compete this Season by only playing two hours each week.**
---
Or, even more simply:
---
Someone that invests less time in an activity should not expect the same results as someone that invests more time in that same activity. 
---
That‚Äôs simple and basic logic.
---
You made a horrible inference and assumption and took the comment out of the context of its own sentence.
---
from /r/all and thought this was about real animals for a second
---
Not sure what the quantums on high means. Guess ill have to look them up. I have a large stock of them for making nuka shine for my intermittent addiction to the walk of shame. Maybe im using them wrong.
---
God please keep your vendors easy to see, I hate looking for them, I am going to fast travel away, and my Dad taught me not to follow weird guys waving me into the basement or upstairs or over the cliff so don't bother.
---
Biggest issue is the amount off buffs low hp builds can use and stack.
---
Never have been. I am a very defeatable endgame boss, I always kept my build defeatable because steamrolling ain't my style. If you shoot me I die. People usually can't hit me though
---
 just imagine being a developer that works for these people. they don't  have a choice on most matters that revolve around monetization. it would  be such a depressing job to work on a game you love and have it ripped  to shreds. i wouldn't want to be a regular dev in the gaming business  today, not for a large company.
---
My complaint with it isn't the effort required it's that it's boring and repetitive and they could do it a lot better by adding new randomized daily radiant quests or new events to award season progression and not just generic "go do this and this  and collect this and build this"
---
I finished it a month early without buying any ranks and I have a full time job and am married with two kids, a bathroom remodel in progress, and I have a bunch of other active hobbies.
---
It takes like a half hour a day to do the daily and weekly challenges.
---
If you JUST do the challenges you will finish it with 7 days to spare.
---
If you use XP buffs like... foods (5-25% xp buff), lunchboxes (25-100%), building team (3-12%), Egghead serum (12-24%), INT/leader bobbleheads (5%), well rested (5%) and mentats/berry mentats (6 or 15%) it's super easy to get 50K xp a day just in the process of doing the challenges, which will leave you with 2 weeks to spare.
---
If you spend an hour grinding XP  with those buffs you can easily get 100-300K xp, even if you're a casual food build.
---
100K xp per day finishes 3 weeks early.
---
300K XP finishes 40 days early (that's a 30 day completion).
---
So I agree the whole thing sucks, but I don't agree that it's so hard for busy people to finish it.
---
That is true. You a jumpy motherfucker. 
---
(Shove that aerial superiority up your ass, baby doll. ;) üòòüòÇ)
---
I agree with this one. The other challenges aren‚Äôt a problem IMO, but this one doesn‚Äôt make sense at all.
---
Yeah I always play a SCIENCE!-themed character in fallout so it was a must-buy for me.
---

I get large shipments of quantums from friends. The quantums are stackable, so I can keep my HP pretty high by spamming them. Hence making me a tanky motherfucker.

Shit is hilarious to watch. I'll just stop what I'm doing sometimes to watch you do it. The fact that you survive with no broken bones is great.
---
&gt;	Posting something does not inherently mean feedback was sought, or required. The fact that you think otherwise shows both your arrogance, your overblown sense of self-importance, as well as your immaturity.

Damn...that‚Äôs funny and ignorant at the same time.

Props to you for both trying to make a point on a post while arguing at the same time that counterpoints are not ‚Äúsought, or required‚Äù and that and doing so shows ‚Äúarrogance‚Äù, ‚Äúoverblown sense of self-importance‚Äù, or ‚Äúimmaturity‚Äù.

Oh man, I thought speed demon stacked with sleek, looks like I‚Äôll have to make a few adjustments to my armor. üòÖ

The changes are not really that big a diff from what we have now.  But if you can get on the PTS equip Awareness perk card then take a look at vats you might see why there isn't much change
---
Is the wife wearing pants? Sorry I confused fo4 with 76.
---
I use the final word as well
---
I haven't tried it yet I have a couple questions actually 1. When the ricochet effect occurs do you still take damage or is it all deflected? 2. Does it count as a "tag" against an enemy and give XP/Loot?
---
Has nothing to do with randomness. You need to select it when you go to level up. Every level you get the option to pick a category to level up and a new card. Every 5 levels, you also get additional bonus cards.
---
Idk. Like I said I'm talking about the time period of the game.
---
Wow, that seems really broken :p
---
I've been on your account. I know. It gives me cursed vibes. Esp cause your inventory is 50 shades of stupid fucked.
---
Fuck perk coins. Me and my homies hate perk coins
---
I thought they fixed this?
---
Nevermind the lights on the ad posters that completely wash out the images. The oil lamps are nice but they don't fit everywhere. Best I could do for the courtyard of my base was put a construction lamp up high so It shines properly on the area.
---
That only happens to me when I‚Äôm carrying way too many items that don‚Äôt stack such as notes, holotypes, legendary gear for script. It happens even if you store them in stash.
---
Ever since I dropped them all I‚Äôm loading in much faster and my inventory much smoother.
---
The damage changes are a good start. It doesn't impact the early to mid game and for end game combat, all it does is clips the ridiculously high end. Not just for bloodied but for all builds that exploit it.
---
I get the initial backlash because people were "muh damage!". However, once you understand what the changes actually do, it's perfectly reasonable change. You'd have to be unreasonable to think otherwise.
---
I hope that Bethesda don't call it a day on combat balance. This is a decent start but there's more that needs to be done before the game is in a healthy and balanced state.
---
Leveling up a low toon is real easy. Take 3-4 workshops an be in an event team. You get 600+ xp for each defense and its pretty constant. You also get some decent rewards for little effort. I can gain 5-10 in a session. Most times i just let them get overrun and clear them after as its faster and easier and about the same reward.
---
Oh I know. I‚Äôm not a fan of PvP either. When survival game mode was available I tried it out. It was fun. But also crappy if you went against a team. Constantly losing caps and aids bummed me out. So I went to story. 
---
I‚Äôm level 360 at the moment. I don‚Äôt really PvP unless somebody tries to take my workshop. Sometimes I win. Sometimes I lose. Doesn‚Äôt bother me to lose a couple of caps since I can just sell weapons to the vendor to makeup for it. But I don‚Äôt like it either.

How far can you get doing weekly challenges?

So did i

I wonder how long it‚Äôll take for them to get to the Gauss Shotgun Bug lol

im getting insane rubberbanding this week, running towards a mob and suddenly i am 100 yards away again, mobs health resetting mid fight etc

Don't forget to give them .45 ammo xd 
---
That stuff go quick.

Nope. But you can convince the ‚Äúformer raider‚Äù to join the settlers if you get that daily.
---
has anyone heard from Riflegaming? I like angryturtle as well but rifle was the first fo76 youtuber I followed and he seems to have been silent for awhile
---
The only negative impact is unarmed though, they now deal too little damage. Needs some balance for unarmed.
---
They need to just set pets as essential again man. They're hard enough to find...

Just because of that alone, I won't even make any eggs.
---
‚Äùway easier‚Äù than what?
---
Sounds good thanks
---
I heard they don't actually run. You just fast travel yo your camp and wait. There's a predetermined timer that counts down before they appear.
---
I‚Äôm done with this sub. 
---
Thanks for your insight, helpfulness, and just being nice.  Too many ass-hats here. I‚Äôm done.
---
Let‚Äôs see here. 7500 score per week, that‚Äôs 75000 score.
---
2500 score per day, but since it started halfway through let‚Äôs take the average of the whole season 2250. 2250x70 days is 157500 score.
---
Add those up and you get 232500 score. We‚Äôve already had 3 days of double score and we‚Äôre getting 3 more soon, that‚Äôs 13500 more score. 246000 score out of the approximately 220000 score needed. You can miss 26000 scores worth of days, which is about 10 days worth. 
---
If you want to miss even more score, you get 1500 atoms during the season, and 500 at tier 100. That‚Äôs 13 more days of score you‚Äôre able to miss.
---
If, next season, they keep the 9 daily challenges, you‚Äôll be able to miss an additional 17500 scores worth of days. About 5 days.
---
So no, you do not need to play every single day to finish it. This season you could miss approximately 23 days of score and still finish, if you spend the atoms you earn. Next season you can miss 32 days of score if you spend your atoms.
---
If you look at the list of games in the sidebar, 76 PTS should be listed as a separate game to download and install. Hope you‚Äôve got some free HDD space!
---
All I know is I missed a bunch in the beginning - and fell behind.  (I started the game on July 4th, and didn't pay attention to score at all the first 2 weeks).  And I'm sitting on level 92.
---
And most days - I miss 2 daily challenges;  the NW, and one random one I just don't bother doing.  (because I know I'll clear it in plenty of time).  On the flip side, I've generated a ton of the repeatable XP one.
---
Could also be coming from his neighborhood.
---
Returned to work (University) after 4 plus months of furlough. (Covid-19). It's been a unfulfilling experience. Been grinding 2-4 hours a day for the first 60 levels. Since returning, 1-2 hours a day after work. Almost done, (10 more levels). I found having multiple characters helped with needing to level up daily. Did none of the NW challenges. Combination of reputation increases and legendary run is wearing me out. On all four characters. Might just use my free atoms saved on next season. (18k held over)
---
Take a break. Go play a different game for a while. No game deserves full devotion forever. I cannot tell you how many times I've taken breaks from WoW, Diablo 3, ESO, FFXIV and even FO76. There's always something interesting and new happening in \*some\* game I've been playing off and on. The moment one of them starts to feel like work, I know it's time to pack my backs and do something different for a while.
---
No, you really don't. I missed about a week and a half and am 2 away from finishing
---
in warframe they solved this problem by storing the old missions you didnt did so you could do them after you're done with the ones you got. so players can catch up with the points.  
---
but the challenges in warframe are weekly and there is only One daily that do not repeat if you miss it.
---
And they also gain the speed of usain bolt in the proccess

Sometimes I like to come to Reddit to read conversations like this, then crack myself up laughing at what random people write to each other. Up vote for making me laugh!!!

---
Good for HP, doesnt explain the one shot, and obviously not going to be used in OPs described stance of using a workbench when there is no fear of retaliation.
---
The auto grenade launcher is also pretty good to use now since it‚Äôs TS doesn‚Äôt work multiplicative and the only thing that buffed it‚Äôs damage is explosive perk.
---
Edit : any explosive such as missle nuke and canon. Not just this weapon.
---
Depends really. If you have good high DR gear then I‚Äôd go ricochet. If not then evasive. I recently made a bloodied unarmed build and I‚Äôm running barbarian and evasive maxed. Without those perks my DR is right around 200. But with those perks it jumps up to over 400. So i like having evasive. At least until I get full SS armor. At 400 DR plus nerd rage, dodgy, serendipity and moving target activitating when I‚Äôm running towards an enemy, I‚Äôm extremely tanky at 20% health with not so great armor.
---
Now if I had as much lead as I do steel, than that wouldn't be an issue. Lol.
---
Whenever I get eyebots at the clubhouse I grab one of the golf clubs inside the front door and start swinging. Right tool for the situation.
---
Until you hit 50 and have a your build nearly done, it‚Äôs just going to be like that. Low levels just have a hard time, but in my opinion it just makes it more fun and worth it when you get to 50.
---
If you want, I can try to place something at his memorial. It's not my place, I know. I hope I don't upset you by asking.

I guess I'm one of the few lucky ones who works from home and has a light workload enough to grind the LR.
---
As someone who likes nuclear winter, this daily doesn‚Äôt bother me. I completed the daily naturally in one game. In another game, I had one set of teammates take turns reviving each other, then they continued playing. For me, this daily wasn‚Äôt an issue.
---
I was more annoyed with the picklock challenge, not because there‚Äôs anything inherently wrong with the challenge, but because players would spawn away from the team to chase their one safe. I played many games with just one teammate nearby, and the other two at separate spots. I wish fill team defaulted to off so I would have useful teammates.
---
No they won‚Äôt. Once they ghoulify they‚Äôre immune to rads. Going feral can only happen during the process of becoming a ghoul
---
Make sure you also slot Escape Artist as it will reduce their ability to detect you when you are running in stealth, which most people usually do without realizing it as "run" is the current mode of movement if you are not sprinting or deliberately walking, which is very, very slow.
---
There are super mutants, cryptids, scorched, yet we can't be creative on how radioactive chickens reproduce?
---
I agree with you.
---
It's all them plans I accidentally learned
---
I think many of are worried that farming time will increase if our farming runs cost more and our damage output is decreased. Math, decrease my damage by 40 percent = resource framing increase of 20%.  The new Earl is said to be more of a bullet sponge than the existing one in Adventure. That cost me so much. It was a two player take down but still, and the drops were a joke.  I hope if they do nerf damage we get ammo loot in addition to what you would normally get, and if the ammo is 0.38 a vein will pop in my head üôÇ
---
I'm really sorry for your loss.

I've lived through the same situation, and I know exactly how you feel.

If you need someone to talk, about anything, don't doubt of dm me.

Yeah

But I‚Äôm done here. The shit posts are enough. I‚Äôll let OP think he/she has won.

I‚Äôm done. No more. The ignorance is too much.

All games have grinds.  People have been complaining about the fact that every grinding in Fallout 76 is so RNG they hate it.  Then they decide to put in not one, but two grinds that give you the ability to make measured progress every time you play and people complain about that too.  Make up your minds!
---
That's online games, man.
---
I agree fully.  But games as a service is well on its way to be the largest distraction method for a majority of games.  Like music as a service with deep personalization and TV streaming services have both changed with way we consume media once rich personalization comes to games, it‚Äôs all over.
---
I think Microsoft has the best angle on it and has slowly moved the needle that way.  When all that‚Äôs left is the rendering engine on the client, it will forever change the gaming landscape
---
No but settlers get more reputation from the daily quest than raiders. Raiders have to do the mirelurk meat turn in to get equal amount. So, settler rep is easier in that regard. You can check out the dialogue choices and their effects on rep gains here -&gt;

Is the level shift due to PTS not having level 68 or your level influence on the enemies? If I totally missed what you were saying please explain.

"Accidentally"
---
I recommend deciding on which type of weapon you plan on using early on so you increase perception for rifles or strength for everything else but pistols. The Wayward questline should teach you everything you need about the early game otherwise.

I'll donate ammo if your giving out fixers for noobs

More people would be using this perk if there weren‚Äôt any cushioned mods for fall damage.

Everyone who uses SS with jet pack I seen uses cushioned or has a legendary effect with 50% reduce.
---
Bethesda isn't pushing people to cheat. That's on the cheaters. It's like saying that some woman invited sexual assault because of what she was wearing.
---
Hacked weapons seems like a non-trivial problem to solve. It's not just enough to delete them. You also have to address the underlying reason how hacked items could come into the game in the first place. You don't deal with the underlying problem, you're effectively wasting time and resources.
---
Beyond that, what do you do in the instance where a hacked weapon was sold to an unknowing player? I don't mean the obviously hacked weapons but ones that aren't so apparent to a layperson. Is it just sorry, we delete your item and you don't get your caps back? How do you appease or compensate a person in that position?
---
I just want them to fix the Gatling Plasma Splitter. Either turn it into a Plasma Flamer or an Auto-Shotgun. Either one is fantastic.

I use a junkie's level 45 handmade + commando perk cards + psychobuff and berry Mentats. It's not impossible to one shot.
---
I gave up and went with the scrubs for this reason.
---
Have you tried to mess around with the ini files? If so delete fallout76prefs and fallout76custom if you made one. If that doesn‚Äôt work then maybe see if other games have this issue? Could be something changed on your pc
---
Likewise, bud. It's difficult but the most we can do is keep strong for the ones we lose. I appreciate the offer, that's really kind of you. Also your English is perfect
---
I took like a week and a half off of not playing and when I farm back I still managed to catch up to Zorbos  so it‚Äôs possible to finish it without playing everyday

Im having an issue also. On xbox

Most of the dailies don‚Äôt take much time to complete either. 
---
Join a group. Take a photo. Eat some bubblegum. Build 10 things. Kill a glowing creature. Kill 10 Super Mutants. And so on. 
---
Could the system be improved?  Absolutely. That‚Äôs true for practically everything. 
---
Is it insurmountable?  Not at all.  You‚Äôve proven that. As have many, many others.

chameleon is actually more stealthy than even 50 agility, bar the fact you can't move. the CSS is about as good as 37 agi as well.

edit: q1 changes
---
I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs 100 percent true. I rarely have to repair my armor. I repair my guns a lot right now but that‚Äôs cuz I‚Äôm trying to burn through my repair kits. Ammo I make every few days, it has to get done but it‚Äôs not a hassle. I‚Äôm a true food build, I spend more time crafting food items then anything else in my camp. With herbivore I get 20% experience boost from cran relish and now I have egghead. I‚Äôm not knocking bloodied unyielding cuz its cool but you can still burn through lvls without it. I can easily lvl up 2-3 times a day with putting in a lot off mental effort. I‚Äôm like around lvl 120 and I‚Äôve only been playing 2 months
---
I've started a throwaway character exclusively for the level up daily challenge. My level 240 kicks out the others (although I do the camp building challenges with my throwaway because he's got a ton of budget).
---
I *was* gonna say you're wrong and that if I can do it anyone can do it. (I've been doing 60 hour weeks construction and I'm almost done with the board) but fuck dude you are right. It is fucked and games shouldn't be **More** work. Upvoted.
---
I'm only like 33 thus far and well  
---
How in the shit do you even get non-boarded up wood windows in this game??
---
The only problem I see is if they nerf melee too hard compared to other weapons. Melee should hit harder than any other weapon given the fact that you have to put yourself in a dangerous position to attack enemies. Nobody is going to use melee weapons if the damage output isn‚Äôt worth the risk of dying. It definitely needs to be nerfed some. My level 60 unarmed build is doing 5k+ plus damage per hit when stealthed. Which is ridiculous but there‚Äôs a huge trade off especially in things like Scorched Earth where a melee build has to be right on top of the queen taking Rad damage and melee damage from her compared to a stealth commando who can just sit back 50ft crouched and hidden.
---
I‚Äôm done with this sub.
---
Thanks for your insight, helpfulness, and just being nice. Too many ass-hats here. I‚Äôm done.
---
Huh didn‚Äôt know that either.
---
The problem isn't the perk coin system itself. It goes deeper than that. 
---
There's a fundamental problem with management and probably the lead designers who have no idea how to develop a worthwhile system of progression and reward.
---
They illustrate it time and again. Faction rep, bullion, legendary gear, legendary run, daily/weekly challenges, some ridiculously low probability rare item drop rates. It's just history repeating. Same shit, different game system.
---
Bethesda really has to let go of the notion of punishing players for not playing daily and substituting grind for meaningful rewards and content.
---
Do I have black hair?
---
the CSS is better than just level 3 sneak. people usually parrot bs like 'I can sneak up to a group of super mutants with just sneak 1, my underpants and a stick of gun' but fact is, you need to invest in sneak if you want it to be effective.
---
even *with* the CSS I'd argue you need sneak 3.
---
What level are you? I might have a gun I can give you to help you in your journey
---
idk maybe you hit your head on the way down and black out for a week. 
---
It's just something for gameplay, like how shooting a ghoul and leveling up magically gives you more muscles if you pick strength. It's just something nicer than going through a menu.
---
Sorry to see you go, friend. I haven‚Äôt always agreed with you but you‚Äôve always been civil with me, as far as I can remember. 
---
Best wishes. I‚Äôve enjoyed our interactions.
---
That would really hinder how quickly melee could kill things... it would be a sizable nerf
---
It has to be at the random encounter location. The animal has to be the one that spawn by itself, not other random instances for example lone megasloth (tamable) vs megasloth with dead baby megasloth (untamable); lone radstag (tamable) vs radstag with a hunter trying to hunt it (untamable); etc etc.
---
And none of that is factoring in the repeatable exp?
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to hurt unarmed as much as people think. The damage numbers are a lot less but even as the game is now, my unarmed weapons are doing a lot more damage then what the pip boy says. So in the PTS where it the damage might only read 400, I guarantee you can still be hitting enemies for at least 1 to 2k damage at times. But I haven‚Äôt actually seen video of someone using unarmed in the PTS so I could be wrong.
---
I‚Äôve seen indications that it *might* be 255, but either way, stopping by that house is a great way to refresh the cycle.
---
I get your point. I have a full time job and a family, but you'll get a lot of comments from people that have all the time in the world after working each day and don't understand that gaming is not a full time job, and it's supposed to be fun.  FYI - I'm a pretty old school gamer. My first gaming system when I was 4 was a Vectrex. For most of you, just look it up in Wikipedia or play the emulated app in an iPad.  
---
You have grind games that cater to casual players and then you have games that don't.  This one is the don't kind. I get with a game like Fortnite, that, because it's free, the season grind costs money to start, but, granted you sink a ton of time, it pays for the next season, and it even gives you a couple of weeks to take a breather.    
---
On the other end, you have something like Star Trek Online where they drop a free ship 3 times a year, the grind for it takes a whole 5-15 minutes a day, and is completely painless. They have other grinds, but frankly, even those are doable playing 15 min a day and done way before new content is dropped so you can enjoy the game outside of said grind.  They still make money out of subscriptions and all sorts of ships you don't really need to do well anyway.   
---
This game unfortunately feels like Fortnite and it sucks because I paid for it.  It should have been designed so that by the end of next week, most people logging every day (and not having a bug related setback) would have gotten to the end giving a nice break to actually play the game or enjoy life. At this rate, I'll probably make it to the end just as the season is ending.  Only missed 3 days of vacation and 2 days when I had no power due to Tropical Storm Isaias.  Add to that I hit a bug during the double SCORE weekend and missed a day.  Feels like a damn chore, specially half the NW challenges.  Today's challenge, I tried for an hour, and couldn't get it so I gave up on it.  In my opinion, the NW challenges should be limited to "survive X minutes", "place CAMP", "use stimpack", or "picklock", because, for the casual player, the rest are potential annoyingly long time sinks.  
---
So to the original poster, you're not alone feeling this game's particular grind sucks.  The game went from fun and enjoyable to feeling like an annoying daily chore.
---
You also need at least 10% camp budget available.
---
If you move your camp near water you can make more water per production with bigger purifiers
---
The alternative is make more small land purifiers if you have the camp budget for it. A bit of camp budget to trade for 3 perk pts is a no brainer for me!
---
Trust traded my lvl 50 today. Loved that weapon
---
I have to agree with you there.. I just really like playing this game and it's frustrating to see changes that make the game less fun to play, I couldn't imagine what it must feel like to the dev that this has consumed their life for the last 2 years or longer.
---
It‚Äôs not designed to played it‚Äôs designed to be purchased. That‚Äôs why they let you buy your max rank.
---
It‚Äôs quite deliberately designed to be enough effort to prevent anyone casually playing the game from finishing it. Then give you a method to buy each rank out.
---
Glad that someone in the community has their head on straight
---
&gt; But saying it's only for dedicated players which I guess you mean daily players and having the battle pass catered to them is excluding other players.
---
You aren't being excluded.  There are 100 levels - 100 rewards along the way of varying significance.  That's not being excluded.
---
If you got to level 98, with nothing to show for it when the season ended?  That would be excluding casual players.
---
This is one of the easiest challenges to get done, why don't you like it?
---
I‚Äôm so glad I got the badges I needed from this before they changed how events triggered.
---
thanks! I guess I need to get twitter lol
---
Most of the game can already be completed by casual players. There needs to be something for the people who log on daily to grind for.
---
Seasons is that thing.
---
I'm not against them adding maybe 1 more weekly to the pool, but anything else would be too much. I think they should probably focus on adding score rewards for people who completed all of the season. Maybe lunch boxes, fireworks, caps, repair kits and perks packs on a loop. 
---
The reward is just a poster. Im pretty sure the rest of the rewards will be purchasable for gold bullion anyway. That's how it looks it the pts right now.
---
Don't mind if i do.
---
It take me not even half an hour a day to complete those. It's not really a grind and you don't need to be high level to complete it and in my case, without grinding much i'm 82 and will most likely be done next week.
---
But I agree about the broken patch and the false delay. This isn't acceptable.
---
Good ones. In fact some of the best mods of all time.
---
That's fair. Being locked in a melee animation for even that 2 seconds could cost kills/get yourself killed. Didn't think of that. Thanks for the input. 
---
Melee just seems to be missing some flair for me, and that's the only thing I could think of.
---
If it was a thing I bet there would be a bug where if 2 players did it at the same time it would bug out both of them.
---
Stuck forever inside each other hoping for the torment to end.
---
Absolutely positive. Did the event a few minutes ago and yesterday. Got badges both times.
---
Shot, I‚Äôd love some presents. Just sell them in vendors or open them for the caps. Plans are basically useless unless (like me) you don‚Äôt have them all yet.
---
You know it would happen. Lmao
---
I started about a week late on July 16th/17th ish and the first few days I did not complete any challenges. A FEW Days around the double exp weekend I played 6+ hours a day. Since then I have been playing 1-2 hours a day. I also lost  3-5 days when the patch came out due to slow internet. I am about a week behind according to the google doc. I am confident that if I continue to play 1-2 hours a day doing each daily I will surely finish the run.  
---
I feel like if you can long a few good sessions each week you SHOULD be pretty close to completion. Between the double exp and score events I feel like s Bethesda is pretty generous with letting people catch up and get ahead. You can also (Rather slowly) get the 100 xp daily which DOES make a difference.
---
A pretty good distance, yes
---
Why don't you say which weapon. Wastelanders added a few. 
---
Due to lack of information how should we know? I can tell you I just bought a sniper barrel for a plasma caster today, and as a result so should *you*, because you have given us nothing else to work with.
---
recipes with frog eggs could be changed to chicken eggs
---
What would you suggest?
---
But losing Perk Points by moving SPECIAL points instead of getting perk cards, and pushing the next legendary perk further away lengthens the grind, and is therefore "content".
---
Right, Bethesda? üôÑ
---
Tell me about it. 
---
I spent considerable time and effort yesterday to launch a nuke at the SBQ. Went to join the event after impact and everything locked up. Luckily I was in a team and eventually managed to get back in just before she was killed. It took me 3 attempts to get back on though. 
---
Come on Bethesda. Lift your game !!!!
---
Lol yeah I should have been more specific, the best mods for each
---
A different color would be good, like high contrast color
---
Something that I can clearly identify as mine without having to check. Or at least make other player camp icons smaller
---
A full set of Unyielding and shielded road leathers turned my 1 Perception character into a better sniper than my 15 perception sniper. But people are downvoting you.
---
Chuck grenades at em when they spawn.
---
They're changing the formula as a platform to rebalance the game. They admitted in one of the Quakecon podcasts that the rebalance pass won't be launching alongside One Wasteland.
---
This change is not the final product and I wouldn't count on this change being pushed live until the rest of the balance pass is completed.
---
The same way you can pull walls and roofs out of your ass, and can change your gender and appearance at any given moment you choose to - it's a *game*
---
I‚Äôve missed over 2 weeks worth of days so far.
---
I‚Äôm still 5 spots ahead on the board.
---
We have a repeatable XP challenge. Just take advantage of That. There‚Äôs events that if you‚Äôre efficient with tagging (and have a decent amount of bonus XP; I only rely on Unyielding, most of my characters are around 20int, and get 15% from that group perk, and that‚Äôs it) you can ding that repeatable multiple times in the event. Guided meditation and line in the sand come to mind.
---
Do you have a magic shotgun?
---
Something like a message on the map saying *This is my land!*
---
I don't know who in their right mind would actively want to waste 2 to 5 times as much resources and deal 25% to 50% less damage. in a game that's essentially a singleplayer coop at that.
---
just remove your damage perks if you enjoy playing with bb guns.
---
All the gauss and the plasma caster there you go, sorry I thought it was obvious
---
Awesome, I just flew from the wayward to the pleasant valley ski resort... wonder why it works with the springboard launch but not if I just jump off of something high....
---
Interesting idea. But someone would be putting those in their Punch Bowl on Day One.
---
Nope
---
My friend who just got the game and was around level 17 got a BSS+1S fire axe and it was level 15. F
---
I‚Äôve *heard* that they both have hidden bonuses to.... I think it was reload speed and fire speed? 
---
That came from data miners and I haven‚Äôt investigated personally.
---
I mean the whole game lacks flair, but there‚Äôs no way to put complex animations into a multiplayer game
---
I think 3 sneak pts + escape artist + 1 piece chameleon is about the same or better than CSS by itself, or even CSS + 1 sneak point.
---
Yea. I got sneak 3. Just tired of the same old CSS armor look. üëé
---
I can see that. Maybe have your son camp not only be yellow, but have a different border around it.
---
Better not let it happen then.
---
I‚Äôd be happy to. Check ur DM I sent u my gamer tag
---
Cause this game sucks.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm over 400 for most damage other than radiation.
---
I have yet to find a build that has a hard to one shotting stuff... just kill stuff that's all you gotta do.
---
You still aren‚Äôt getting it. No one here is saying someone who only plays a few hours a week should finish the run. That is something you decided to force into the conversation. You are so fixated on thinking that players who only get a chance to play a few days a week are all putting in less time than players who do log on every day to grind out dailies that you are missing what we are saying.
---
**You shouldn‚Äôt have to play 14 hours a week strictly spread out as two hours each day. If your IRL situation dictates that you can only play 7 hrs a day on Saturday and Sunday you should not be farther behind than the person who is able to spread the same playtime out.**
---
14 hrs of gameplay should be equal no matter when you are able to fit them into your week. Why is the daily grinders time more valuable than the weekend warrior? I know players who only play once a week and when we play I will hear them eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner all in front of their Xbox to keep grinding, then I will have to kick them from a party when they pass out and start snoring after 18 hours in game.
---
Your argument is completely based on your own notion of what OP means when he talks about players who are only able to play a few days a week. The bottom line is that the system is currently based majorly on the number of days you are able to log in when it should be based around the actual amount of time put in.
---
Daily logins should not equal score.
---
Playtime should equal score.
---
I‚Äôve logged in every day just about and grinded the double weekends and I‚Äôm only rank 89. I‚Äôm close though. And it‚Äôs nice to know I could finish it off easily with atoms if I wanted to. But I‚Äôm going to unceremoniously finish this thing legit. Not going to miss that daily level grind though.
---
you need more than just sneak 3. stack as much agility as you can, with the mutation and shielded raider underarmor you get +7. unyielding armor if you're bloodied and don't forget escape artist.
---
there's also the 'harder to detected while sneaking' 3\* legendary. it doesn't stack so you'll need one piece. also shadowed and muffled mods for your armor.
---
and the fixer itself.
---
Remember how they sell you an infinite stash box for scrap that you have to pay monthly for even though you paid full price for the broken piece of shit this game was at launch, remember how you can buy a robot that's essentially a 2nd junk extractor, remember how they promised us a canvas bag and gave us a shitty nylon one(which I have btw)
---
It's you blind fanboys that need to fuck.off.already
---
Alright. Will you be online in like half an hour? I'll be there. GT is HPD99.
---
Its also possible they will drop for the Stings and Things repeatable too but its not a super common drop for any of them. I may get two in a row then nothing for a good while before another will drop
---
That‚Äôs cool. 
---
Disagreement is fine. This game has a lot of stuff that most players don‚Äôt know don‚Äôt understand, or don‚Äôt realize alternatives. 
---
I get/got fixated on my ways.  But you were always there to let me know my errors. Don‚Äôt get me wrong...my old ass forgets sometimes. That‚Äôs fine and appreciated. 
---
I‚Äôm just done with others.
---
I know you say you didn‚Äôt... but I‚Äôm betting you did and didn‚Äôt realize it. Do you ever spam transfer stuff? Sometimes it ‚Äúgrabs‚Äù something else when you go too fast.
---
Yes, this is a bug, it‚Äôs not like you did it deliberately or Anything, but I‚Äôve never had anything vanish on 4 characters with.... lets just say *a lot* of playtime.
---
Damn that‚Äôs some damn fine advice. 
---
*came back with a mini gun that has a rad gun barrel attached to it*
---
Did I do good?
---
God I cant handle that comparison, but ok. And the thing is no matter what brought the hacked items into the game, the priority should have been delete them. They alredy put a stop to the tool used, but never removed the items. If a player buy those with caps they know what they are buying, players aren't dumb, and even if they dont when they accept the conditions by creating the account they (should) know that this could happen, and actually it is not that bad, of course people who got items deleted will cry, they should be thankful not to be banned.
---
I repeat this and put emphasis on it, people isnt stupid,hacked weapons are easy to detect even the newest player can realise that.  
---
People use the " I didnt know" excuse to get rid of trouble, but continue the abusing until they can.
---
No kidding, I stopped taming them after losing each one to the random death bug; taming is fun and awesome but horrifically buggy.
---
I won't sorry bud:( it's 4am for me
---
Yep, I've been doing that a lot recently. Though if I'm not close to leveling up I don't even bother with that daily sometimes.
---
Also member the cosmetic only promise, I memberüòÄ
---
If you go bloodied unyielding, you can go all 8 and still be a great character (23 all stats except Endurance) + what your +1 pieces and underarmor could give.
---
My bloodied commando is 5 15 3 3 5 13 11. He rocks. He could lose 3 points from Luck into Agility and Endurance, too.
---
Wow. I'll try to hurry this up. I'll ask again  in a bit.
---
combat knife has a nice stealth mod. as for 2handed, probably the super sledge. but I'm hardly an expert in melee, so.
---
So just like the deep pockets on Secret Service... non existent.
---
Well.. they definitely didn't nerf Stalkers for melee, cos they have their priorities in order!  
---
Stalkers melee will be the new meta!
---
That is an incredibly educated point of view, I like it. 
---
I completely agree, seeing a combination of the effects you mentioned would bring a much greater balance to the game while not destroying or making irrelevant all the effort people have put into grinding and trading, many since launch. 
---
One of the worst parts is this major Nerf is happening at the same time as a new end game boss is being introduced, especially if we are limited to how many people can join an instance at the same time. 
---
Thank you for adding your thoughts to this discussion, I believe it has given a lot of us food for thought.
---
if thats not active im not sure what is. i guess you have to be jobless from covid and play literally 20 hours every day. rediculous
---
***You‚Äôre still not getting it.***
---
I ***NEVER*** said that anyone said that playing two hours a week should let them finish the Run. 
---
My statement was *an analogy*. 
---
Saying that someone playing for only one day a week should get the same rewards as someone that plays seven days a week is like saying that someone that plays one hour a day should get the same XP as someone playing seven hours a day.
---
I didn‚Äôt ‚Äòforce‚Äô anything into the conversation. I made ***an analogy***. 
---
I also said there are pros and cons to this system. You skimmed right past that to focus on your misinterpretation of something I said.
---
Actually, if you think games are buggy and other issues cause you issues, it‚Äôs great.  By reducing the local content to rendering only you introduce a level of platform stability and better cross platform support.  Azure, google cloud and AWS can all bring that and Azure May in the end prove to be the best platform of the three. Amazon is too busy with twitch and Google Cloud is not having the best time with Stadia
---
This is what I figured but I thought I‚Äôd put it out there to see if anyone knew for sure.
---
Oh - all of them.
---
For the shotgun, you're probably going to want perforating and extended barrel for the armor pen and range. 
---
For minigun, prime if you're going to do SBQ with it and also to give you better ammo economy.
---
For pistol: silence it and use a high capacity mag
---
Caster: sniper barrel. Not sure if it has a receiver that adds damage too.
---
Perks: one point concentrated fire.
---
All commando perks, maybe weight reduction for the type of ammo you choose, dodgy, blocker, sneak.
---
I understand your point. However:
---
1: Have you finished wastelanders on all 5 accounts you can have.... Meaning you can make the most of both the raiders and the settlers.
---
2: Have you completed all the Challenges? Therefore completed all the gamers core you can
---
3: Have you created the best camp you can?..... Coz honestly that's fricken hard.... Especially when you can't get the right placement
---
Have fun. 
---
4: Do you have a good group to play with? This is the best part.... Playing with mates.... Find some good mates and just have fun.....
---
Hopefully any corrections I offered came across as helpful and not negative. That‚Äôs (usually) my intention, unless someone is being, well, an asshat.
---
The Gutter (the unique assaultron blade quest reward one hander with build in extra damage and vampires effect, is a new craftable legendary in PTS (if you get the plan for it from ops). Costing 2 legendary modules. That is a very good option, if you get a good effects on it.
---
Fun videos and all but those videos are pretty old and not a good source for the current state the studio is in.
---
Too damage 1h is the cattle prod, sadly. It‚Äôs fugly and has almost no skins. Sheepsquatch club is right in the same ballpark but WAY rarer.
---
I really wish they‚Äôd rebalance damage on 1h, tbh. Shishkebab should do more, assaultron Blade should do more (those bitches hurt when they plunge them into your chest!).
---
Currently a freaking sword made from a ski, and a sword made from a guitar, beat out a literal military assault robot combat blade, and a katana that‚Äôs on fire. And all of those are beat by a cattle prod.  Like. Wtf.
---
Thank you
---
https://imgur.com/a/nMTcqml
---
To late for that.
---
you could just make new toon, and get to the wayward.. you typically level up right after.. 10 mins tops. it's what i do.
---
then delete that toon after you get the 500 score.
---
Gauss minigun- Tri barrel, and either the prime receiver if you can keep up on prime ammo (crafts in much larger amounts than non prime) or the receiver that adds the most electrical damage.
---
Plasma caster- sniper barrel, and same thing about prime
---
There‚Äôs no reason to even have levels beyond 50. After 50 it should have gone for destiny light levels
---
Yeah it‚Äôs like a 10% chance to drop from all 3 of those events
---
The Cattle Prod. No, don't laugh.
---
Crafting this weapon means you will *always* get a legendary 1H melee weapon, that can be fairly decent with the right legendary roll.
---
Of course, you could instead try your hand at purveyor roulette, but then you have to contend with all the rolling pins and tire irons she throws at you.
---
"Any thoughts on best way to use it?" Aim at enemy and pull trigger? Two shot btw is one of the worst legendary prefixes in game. If you don't count nocturnals and enemy specific ones.

---
There's no rush friend:) out of curiosity what were you planning on leaving? I can always place a display and put the same item in it, I'll remember the thought
---
Hold the fuck up. You can't seriously play this game if one of your complaints is the fucking collectron. That's the kind of complaint you see from someone that watches shitty YouTube videos.
---
Ricochet, just for the sound effect alone.
---
Best. Advice. Ever. Also, I‚Äôm pretty happy with it so far cause I don‚Äôt like bloodied and junkies feels like it judgmental.
---
i didn‚Äôt see any new DMs but my gamertag is sourskittlez16. you can send me a message on xbox thank you!
---
Only been in the game for 4 months. It‚Äôll be at least 8 more before they‚Äôll even put it on their to-do list
---
Thank you for both of your replies! Helps a lot :)
---
I spent four hours farming for one.  Finally found a sloth but he was lvl 20 üôÑ
---
I saw that. I was like damn that things a beast.
---
Test it out and see hoq it fits your playing style. I am also a heavy build but run .50 cal. I usually only run my .50 cal during events. When doing everything else I switch my build over to shotty and run that. I personally enjoy it. Was originally gonna go PA Heavy, but now I am not sure as I am really enjoying the sneaky sneaky game style.
---
What would be the easiest way to do this? Can you stand in the fire ring until death and get revived...? I won‚Äôt be able to get on to try for a few hours...
---
Because that's a way you can avoid putting in time if you don't want to grind. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it is what it is. A paid shortcut. Doesn't change the point - Later rewards are intended to take a lot of work or a lot of atoms to earn. They're not something you pick up casually.
---
They just should have made the other builds better. If bloodied gets nerfed to the point some are saying I‚Äôm just done. I like playing the game we‚Äôre it is realistic. If I shot something 1-2 times in the face it dies, and the same for me.
---
High health fallout it so unrealistic at a high level and I don‚Äôt enjoy bullet sponges. I mean people shit on Bloodied but it‚Äôs not easy at all. There‚Äôs a big trade off. It makes the game a little more challenging and fun having to sneak around.
---
&gt; I don't know who in their right mind
---
Angry Turtle, evidently...
---
Its a hazmat suit so doubt mods will ever come out for it, skins would be awesome though.
---
twice the amount of \\items will be stolen now that he isnt patrolling around to guard them
---
Same, I'm at 115 and I have yet to get my endgame gear all the way together. Between the RNG for weapons and armor. I'm at the point where it's just "it is what it is" I'm over the grind at this point.
---
It also spews spent nuclear fuel out the top to get those assholes that are too far away!
---
Where does OP say that the person who is only able to log in a few days a week is playing less overall time than someone who played every day? Please find it for me.
---
Until you find that quote you are the one injecting this idea that less days = less playtime into the conversation.
---
I think those who min/maxed their characters with those top tier archetypes are going to see the biggest hit to their numbers. Even so, just looking at the data we have so far, the only style that's taking any meaningful drop in damage is an optimized bloodied build and still outperforms by a decent margin.
---
he's defended nerfs multiple times in the past so he's not exactly an example of someone I'd consider 'in their right mind'.
---
Honestly, I'm not sure. I have to see my options. Well, see what the game will let me place at your camp. I'm hopping on 76 now.
---
There literally adding content by making enemies sponges. To be completely frank people hate on bloodied because they aren‚Äôt capable of doing it themselves. They should try to do scorched earth at 20% health and tell me how fun it is.
---
I imagine this in trumps voice for some reason.
---
I guess I just don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs fun to do that, but I think a few other people that commented on this post answered that question without even meaning too. lol 
---
I‚Äôm glad you can at least win sometimes. I‚Äôve always been completely outmatched by at least a few hundred levels, today I thought might have a chance, the guy was half my level, but as soon as I appeared he killed me instantly. I don‚Äôt know how that is fun for him but whatever. I just left.
---
I agree the system needs a lot of work. But I want, for the sake of playing Devil's advocate, to push back on one thing
---
&gt; There is not ONE SINGLE THING they do right.
---
They make perk packs useful for high level players. At the moment once you are past around level 100, perk packs serve no use whatsoever. Even if you have every perk you want, a level up at least lets you tweak your special stats, but perk card packs just give you more perk cards, and you probably don't want any.
---
Now, in hindsight they should have just stopped giving you perk card packs once you hit level 50. But they didn't - and, even worse, they started offering them as a reward to the legendary run after announcing that you would be able to turn the perk cards into perk coins.
---
So if they get rid of perk coins, what should they do to make perk card packs valuable to higher level players?
---
I just saw that the glass camp buildin set is at the end
---
The end
---
What the actual %*#@
---
I'm done with it
---
Thats from the settlers right?
---
I OWN The fucking thing dude !besides, that was one of my weaker points anyway go ahead and try and justify locking something like the scrap box and survival tent behind a subscription when most of us bought this shit full price (in a very broken state) and we're explicitly told only cosmetic mtx ,all CONTENT was supposed to be free! Scrapbox and tent look like fucking content to me bro
---
Unarmed as a whole is getting nerfed, which includes stalkers
---
Why wouldnt a bloody sniper roll anymore? The only time a bloody sniper would be useless is in PVP and trying to solo SBQ or Earl.
---
Might be something good to grind for, for sure!
---
Yeah I just realised that too. There are definite fixes that could be done and need to be done. But like everything else it's probably gonna be awhile (if ever).
---
You can't nerf my 1* Stalker's Board!  
---
It's not a nerf - it's a "rebalance" remember?
---
yeah, exactly. I've read the same excuse today, 'they're doing this because we're burning through content'
---
my man how is that sound logic? so it's our fault we're burning through the paltry content there is? alternatively, their solution, instead of making actual content, is to increase the grind?
---
grind ain't content.
---
the same way the courier did when he was shot in the head but you don't hear anyone complaining about that...
---
I'll jump on too. Btw I appreciate this a lot. Even if it's a flamingo, it'll be staying
---
Currently glitched
---
Heard that its gonna be fixed in patch 22 but that's at least a month out
---
Yah it's weird, sometimes if i die soon after fast traveling and respawning i'll get no respawn screen and just immediately respawn
---
Ive respeced about 4 times on my main character. So im way behind.
---
I dont think the rebalances on any casual  build are going to be super drastic. Mainly just the super min max setups. My only worry is the changes to a unarmed plus the other rebalances
---
Hold on to the JSS MMG. Just in case.
---
"Content"  
---
üòâ
---
I did the ‚Äútake a photo‚Äù one in vault 51
---
All I want is to be able to wear cosmetics over the suit. That thing is butt ugly.
---
Of course. Again, I never met your friend but if you're building a memorial for him in this game, he sounded like a wonderful person. Not many wonderful people nowadays &amp; the world keeps taking the few we do have.
---
I stopped because the grind, didn‚Äôt feel like it was worth my time.
---
Thanks for confirming. Between this and not actually loading the deep pocketed mods like promised not sure how any of this makes it out of QC.
---
I'm not 100% sure, but I think this was me. Guy had like 38 scrip legendaries at 20k plus caps. I was ready for bed myself, but couldnt let that shit slide üòÇ
---
Dammmnnnnnn
---
What I do is log in. Notice I forgot I already did my legendary run. Log out.
---
Im kinda in the same boat right now.  I have no incentive to play anymore unless my boyfriend is online
---
This may have been said already but the higher level community are getting screwed here. I‚Äôm not talking about the damage nerf directly but for all those affected think of the countless hours that every single person who‚Äôs running a stacked out bloodied build had to put in to achieve that. Think about the hundred of hours, farmed loot runs, events, trading loot to eventually get that perfect weapon for it to be nerfed ~50%. Kinda blows in my opinion. 
---
I‚Äôm new and only level 45. This doesn‚Äôt hurt me. But even with the tiny amount of hours I‚Äôve invested into this game compared to the die hards I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve did an event to get a horrible legendary weapon out of it. Now I think of that times a hundred and then when I finally achieve that it‚Äôs nerfed? O that would suck.
---
Nice
---
Oh I'm definetly waiting to see the final results before getting rid of it. Inwas just going to trade for a backup weapon so I could hit the ground running in a worse case scenario. So far it looks like a JSS cattle prod or sheepsquatch staff are the ones I can get at this moment in time
---
damage has been nerfed across the board. so whatever you pick, it'll also be nerfed.
---
having said that, builds that rely on several multipliers were hit the worst. hard hitting weapons too, so snipers I suppose. fast firing, low per shot damage weapons are the safest bet.
---
all roads lead to heavy guns.
---
It's hard but holy fuck is it a lot of xp/score
---
thats pretty much where I'll be once the run is finished.  ive been doing em but there are days when i just play fallout 4 instead.  least that game has freedom and action.  and repayablility. and actually has story. This doesnt. its essentially grinding things till it becomes a chore. In 4 you can grind but you really don't have to.
---
You rang?
---
Oh, nevermind.
---
And\*
---
Haha
---
I've pretty much given up on turrets since they keep vanishing from my CAMP anyway.
---
I have 10, can confirm.
---
I only wish I could do more. He was truly the most humble person I've ever met. Such a shame to see him go
---
Looks like something i'd expect to see in CoD*
---
*Note: I've not played CoD since MW2, so my I may be way off*
---
No I totally agree. I meant those points very literally. Im not saying you'll struggle with a non bloodied build but you'll use more ammo and consumables for the same result. For example a bloodied rifle can kill in 1 shot, an executioners in 2 and non legendary 3. Same result but slightly slower without bloodied. And 2 or 3 more hits isn't terrible at all. But that is more ammo consumed and likely less time between repairs. Again nowhere near a big deal. And if you use stuff like luck of the draw and ammosmith its even less of an issue. Lots of builds are totally viable but I'm saying on paper, even if its small, bloodied builds are *more* efficient. 
---
And now that you mention Egghead I realize I need to add that mutation because with full Unyielding I'm less affected by the negatives than before.
---
And I just love feeling like my game is gonna crash when I look at the legendary run board and it starts having a lag seizure...
---
The shishkebab was my go to in fallout 3! I really want to be able to viably use in 76
---
Yes I'd like this in all black please.
---
Build stairs and fall off of stairs.
---
There still ways to place water purifiers wherever you want
---
I mean I guess but it‚Äôs just an interface
---
Bethesda succeeded in what they set out to do: retain as many players with a little investment as possible.
---
they don't care about actual content, just keeping players logging back. and the cheapest way to do that is with inane busywork.
---
The problem is the Studio behind Fallout and thenproject lead Jess Gardiner. They are bethesdas least experience studio with zero games under their belt, they were actually working on a mobile game that was canned to come work on FO76. Remember when Nuclear Winter came out and it was relatively bug free and notice how there hasnt been any updates? That was a different team that worked on Nuclear Winter and they were pulled to work on Starcraft, supposedly they are back helping with FO76 but who fucking knows.
---
I‚Äôll try this one more time:
---
**For the purposes of my analogy, based upon the current system of time-gating in this game, which has pros and cons:** *The number of daily logins is to SCORE Rewards as the number of hours played equates to Standard Rewards, like XP*
---
A is to B as C is to D. 
---
Therefore, if OP wants to *change* the system so that players that have fewer daily logins get the same SCORE as players that have more daily logins, that‚Äôs a serious paradigm shift comparable to changing the system so that players with fewer hours played have the same XP as players with more hours played. 
---
Short of using pictures and colored wooden blocks, I‚Äôm not sure how to break down the analogy to you any more simply. 
---
And this all revolves around aesthetics and cosmetics. Nothing inherently critical to the game. 
---
Explain to me why any player **needs** the Season Rewards?  
---
There are a lot of games that have a ‚Äòdaily login‚Äô bonus of some kind. Why does it matter  if Fallout 76 has something similar?
---
There are limited time Atom Shop items.  There are other games that have Season or Timed exclusives.
---
This comes back to one thing: Fear Of Missing Out. Once you get over that, this is a non-issue.
---
I thought for sure were going to get eggs....I was so disappointed.
---
im level 25 and still haven't found a way to beat the game. I hear the bugs get intense the higher your level. Only few have ever beaten level 100...
---
Indeed. I hope the flags are okay. I also have another gift for you. I'm not sure what its called but it's what the military do. Where they shoot three times in the air to respect the fallen. If you want, we can do that.
---
Yes, it is. But it‚Äôs also a semi-viable way to catch up if you miss some dailies.
---
The last few I've been in had the opposite problem everyone was going for or and I was stuck alone defending the workers.  my real people lately has been people's inability to properly run guided meditation.  It literally only takes one person on the bridge and one person on the side with another person running center if you want to be really safe.  Stop running around chasing legendaries and letting the speaker's get broken.  If everybody does it right there should be at least one legendary down each path, also we can all just tag the legendaries and go pick up the loot when we're done.  Running to the legendary and leaving your post is incredibly annoying.
---
I appreciate the flags bud, gives the room a bit more colour. Anyways, I'm going to try to sleep now but thanks again!
---
Nothing was gained, unfortunately.
---
It looks very ugly! Add some yellow or something goddamit!
---
Of course! Sleep well. :)
---
Mutations for me were the meta. I don‚Äôt care how quickly I can kill but I just fell off a mountain and got no damage so that‚Äôs awesome
---
I like reading stories like this and learning life lessons just by OP‚Äôs username.
---
185 on PS4. What‚Äôs the gun?
---
I believe i never managed to loot those tickets, i need to unlock the feature or something ?
---
Sorry dude, I didn't see this. I appreciate the thought though, I really do:)
---
And the point of this sub is to discuss things related to fallout 76.  just because we discuss it here doesn't mean OP hasn't properly taken it to the test server forum.  I come here to read about and discuss the game and the test server is part of the game.
---
get a explosive gun, missile, grenade launcher even grenades if you can time it right, even 1 point of splash damage will net the rewards.
---
I recently got a TSE minigun from a west tek run and was pretty excited until I actually used it. The thing is absolute trash; burns through most of the clip trying to kill one lvl 68 scorched which any other gun would slaughter almost instantly. I know some baffoon will come along and pay a ton for it so I've got that to look forward to.
---
Well for new players there‚Äôs quite a bit of content until they consume most of them then they will be on the same
---
Boat as us.
---
I mean I could still play but I‚Äôm tired and I‚Äôm playing some other games right now. It‚Äôs a fine game to come back to once and awhile but not daily.
---
Make it effective for 30 mins with the ability to stack for more time. Id like to try different builds but not permanently.
---
Except they‚Äôre still going to have significant damage capability over someone without that gear. All this change does is smooth out the extreme ends from the excessively ridiculous values they were at before.
---
When i activate a public workshop, i just go right by the limit of the area (as indicated by the green frontier) and exit as soon as the activation is over. Just not worth my time to compete.
---
Wow. That‚Äôs a hot take.
---
Essentially they said "look I know I promised not to fuck your wife,but that was before I knew how hot she was bro, we're still friends yeah?"
---
I don't see how considering he did, in fact, defend and call for nerfs multiple times in the past.
---
The archery is easy but you will need the camera from the dead tourist which is also easy.
---
&gt; They make perk packs useful for high level players. 
---
Hey now... when that gum daily pops up, I crack open a perk pack to get some.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll put off Wastelanders for now then except the daily quests.
---
Pissing off your neighbors.
---
I didn‚Äôt even think about killing the robot!
---
Tbh I totally forgot we could build things in NW lol thanks!
---
This sub and complaining, name a better combo
---
Showing up to turn in a quest in prime condition, fully rested and ready to go? Sorry, you‚Äôll get massively less experience than that dope over there chugging out of a rad barrel.
---
I stopped when I saw the plans of "Follow the map of grinding". It's worse than horse armour at this point. I came, I tried and I was disgusted.
---
Todd Howard needs to step down.
---
Have you tried hopping servers
---
I played hard, I absolutely did not cheat, but worked hard on the Xp repeatable.  Gained about 120 levels going from about 280 to 406, and did most dailies and weeklies most days.  I finished last tues... I work every day, I have kids and a husband who I also spend time with. I had some vacation but wasn‚Äôt on non stop because I was already feeling burnt out honestly... I missed days, got screwed by a full batch of weeklies being autocompleted upon logging on, and skipped the odd daily I just didn‚Äôt have it in my to finish... and I still hit 100 last Tuesday with score to spare 
---
My point is, it‚Äôs possible. More than possible, but you do have to work for it.  It is not designed to be a casual accomplishment, but something you need to earn.  But You don‚Äôt have to quit your job and divorce your wife, or sell off the kids to have enough time.
---
If you don‚Äôt get it done, it looks like a bunch of items are being made available for bullion, so those who couldn‚Äôt grind the run can earn it another way.
---
Yes, some will finish, some won‚Äôt, But to say you MUST play ‚Äúevery day‚Äù is a lie.
---
I don't have crossbow plans
---
Yeah, I miss those too. Sure, they could be inconvinient at times but, they felt satisfying to pull off.
---
Just give us the option in the menu to tick them on or off. Satisfy people that want to min-max everything and people that just want fun at the same time.
---
It rarely lands anyway these days... doesn't make much a difference.
---
Is this for turning in material to Atlas?
---
Its easy to forget....its kinda a shame they don't push the building more...i play with a couple of blueprints and it makes the mode a little more enjoyable.
---
You just buy a cross bow to use
---
Can we not just shoot the other person or punch them ?
---
*Life* is unfair for working adults
---
Where at?
---
Don't know did stairs once and never worried after that.
---
It really isn't. I'm sorry you can't believe it, but I, and the group I run with run into these weapons all the time.
---
196 hours of game time, didn't purchase a single level. I'm rank 60/100, this is unacceptable tbh.
---
[](/ablookingover)Man, reading this post would make you think that perk coins have been in the live game for months ruining everyone's fun, and not in a test server.
---
You have to find stairs though right ? The plan or mod.
---
Not debating the damage nerf. Just the time requirement it took these players to get their version of a perfect build for it to be nerfed. Melee bloodied builds are reported to be almost not usable. That sucks SO much for the person who spent countless hours building it out!
---
I think the crossbow plans are on the table at the archery range.
---
StarCraft? I think you mean that new IP Bethesda is making? I forget the name
---
No put down camp and build stairs.
---
It‚Äôs not but contesting workshops just to kill other players who aren‚Äôt doing it for pvp is. If your just there cuz it‚Äôs the only way to kill other players without getting a bounty then yeah that‚Äôs a dick move. I get the annoyance that Bethesda has made 76 less friendly to pvp but some people need to get over it or go play a different game. I some times will swipe a workshop if i really need the resources but my only purpose isn‚Äôt to try and just screw with another players day.
---
It actually is there in the legendary perks thread -)) people have already commented on and upvoted that post there. I even directed this post to Valseek just so they know about that fun experience.
---
That‚Äôs legit but as someone who also does it, it‚Äôs not not a dick move
---
Gotta build high enough to hurt you.  So might take a couple or build over a ledge.
---
my wife wanted to try and put her tent down, slightly in the wrong spot, she was getting a lot of angry and thumbs down emotes, but she kept trying and by the third wave it was spot on and they all spawned in the middle. Some people are too quick to judge and have a shit attack than to help and teach.
---
It's only 20 years after the bombs drop, and many ghouls you find in the game seem general concerned about becoming feral if they take on more radiation. He is only trying to protect himself and the others around him
---
It's in the PTS. Daily Ops of the BOS faction.
---
Am I the only person still needing perk cards past level 150? What did I go wrong?
---
I love my TS Autogrenade launcher so this is good news.
---
Hunter is also doable and can be quicker if you're having trouble with getting the camera. I know it took like an hour of server hops to start my camera quest...
---
The legendary FUN.
---
Yea I always name them to keep track of it 
---
Example ‚Äú-  30%+ robots dmg‚Äù  for my gear I do ‚Äú- main right leg‚Äù etc etc I always put - so it could be on top when I sort them
---
Sounds like you're not ready to challenge yourself
---
You forget where you put your camp?
---
Grindout 76?
---
Sounds like a bicentenniel themed porno.
---
I also just rewatched the video to comment on it, and some important things to consider are:
---
-he says he's fine with the nerf and that it didn't affect him much. well, fast firing, lower per shot damage weapons, such as the .50 cal, which he used to test it, suffered the least compared to hard hitting ones. he's not even bloodied.
---
-he wastes two dozen rounds per super mutant. that's highly inefficient. it may come as a surprise to some of you, but a lot of us spec into bloodied so we don't have to farm acid, lead and steel every other day.
---
-he makes it sound like food builds are now performing 'better' due to the additive nature of the new system. but in truth, casual builds are not performing better, minmaxers are just performing worse, closing the gap.
---

I have a two year old daughter. A wife who loves to sing along to every song on Appalachia Radio and dogs who love to bark. Also, when I'm the only one at home, I prefer to listen to a podcast or something while I play. I'm hundreds of hours in to this game, have been on several teams, never use a mic. 
---
Unless, of course, I'm playing with friends. They're all well aware of my potential for background noise (which I hate). And we usually just party up anyway. 
---
Yeah, vocal communication isn't really necessary for this game in my opinion.
---
I'm not sure if you are asking to play with someone or not but I'm on xbox.

&gt; The problem with the Legendary Run isn't that some will finish it and some won't - it's that you have to play *every day*
---
Isn't that the point of Dailies and Monthly Reward Log-ins and the like? (or whatever you consider Legendary Run to be)
---
&gt;  Every other game has ways to grind out their pass even if you only log on once or twice a week
---
I don't believe that statement at all. The people over on /r/mmmorpg beg to differ. ^(Don't go there)
---
Name 10 Online games that has dailies/Monthly Log-in event/schedules that allows you to "grind out" that schedule by only logging in once or twice a week.
---
Don't force yourself to play it if you can't. If you're really desperate for the later stuff, you could just spend Atoms for free rank ups.
---
Because it dosn't really work? The PTS damage nerf hit it hard enough that the potential gain is not worth the certain death when doing anything meaningful like the Daily Ops (I hopped on and tried it, and hooooo boy)
---
Player vendors or here.  Even just a one star.  Someone might give you for free.
---
I mean, look at RDO
---
You say this as if there isn't a multi billion dollar company overseeing all of this. The is absolutely a Bethesda (as company managing many studios) problem, not just with Jeff and an inexperienced studio.
---
Bethesda could make the necessary changes but they don't. There's a reason for that - Jeff is doing precisely what Bethesda wants him to do. Rake in as much MTX money as possible with as few resources as they can get away with.
---
Exactly. The fact that I am guaranteed to have to pay real money in order to finish (only get to play once or twice a week) is absolutely ridiculous. It's a big deterrent, and one of the reasons I'm just not interested in the game anymore at this point.
---
You can get a little from the protectrons, but they're generally not worth it.
---
I agree I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt go this route with the one wasteland update too
---
Make character max lvl at lvl50 and just Make perk coin exp base , maybe every 5k exp
---
Also lower the requirement to upgrade legendary perk to 20-50 perk coins
---
My thoughts exactly. If this will ever come to live servers, the backlash would be so severe they would need to present some sort of explanation anyway.
---
Ah right. I mean something has to keep your virginity intact, can't just be you alone
---
I wouldn't mind to meet some people I'm on ps4 though
---
Sheep club is top damage for a 1H, hard to come by a swing speed version though.  Been reading that the cattle prod is up there too, never had a swing speed one to play around with.  I've been running an Instigating swing speed ski sword and a variety of SS combat knives for ages, both are better than any unarmed IMO after the meat hook got 'fixed'.
---
lol well said.
---
It should be weeklies will get you there in the nick of time, and dailies for the people who can and want to get there quicker.
---
I think i sold mine in my vendor for like 5k when I was drunk and broke one time üôÉ

Met a guy on xbox a few days back, since then we have been running rad rumblw, project paradise, queens, and encrypted. Been actually having fun with them for once instead of no1 showing and getting yeeted or incompletes

---
Thank you.
---
Yup, I‚Äôm also ahead and that was after losing a few days at the beginning of the run. 
---
The alien‚Äôs name is Dr. Zorbo, for anyone else who was trying to figure out what the hell his name is.
---
Honestly? I am a-okay with 1 rank of infiltrator. But even two ranks in Ammo is a godsend.
---
You have to own the game through the Bethesda launcher as far as I know.
---
Thats mega gross
---
Understood, just have some of the same sentiment and thought I'd reach out.
---
We all need to do a boycott of 76. Cancel FO1st subscriptions, not buying atoms, and contributing absolutely nothing to the ATLAS event. Then they‚Äôll listen.
---
And still they do everything to make playing alts completely undesireable and tiresome.
---
Okay? As has been pointed out melee got hammered because the number of multipliers they had were ludicrous. This is why it is a test server. So they can gather feedback and move forward from there. It sucks having your shit nerfed, so maybe people should communicate their feedback, support your arguments with the data you can, and then worry about how it all looks after some more tuning. 
---
But to start saying the sky is falling and look how many hours they spent grinding the best gear?
---
They still have the best gear in the game. They may want to get a new weapon, im not sure how the balancing will play out, but a lot of us have had to get a new weapon and adjust accordingly. 
---
So will the people with the current best gear in the game. This community constantly loses their mind about bugs, balance, and all other crap while getting livid every time tries to improve the game. It‚Äôs exhausting to read and it‚Äôs frustrating when sometimes you just want to read what is coming up in game and people are always screaming about Bethesda this or Todd that.
---
Ahhhh kk
---
You can put the bass instrument on concrete stairs and then snap that onto a foundation low to the ground. Then you go up to the tip of the bass and play it, and it pulls you underground. From there, you can attach stuff to the stairs and build under the map.
---
Game is already too easy without 5k crits and one shotting everything.  I like to swap perks often and play rifles, shotgun, explosives or heavies depending on mood and mission.
---
They wanted to give us a way to get rid of duplicate perk cards.
---
I agree with you, it's not a perfect system and I think awarding coins in levelling up would help alleviate some if the issues. I'm just explaining their pov.
---
Speaking from experience on live servers only.

Shotguns (excluding 'magic' variants and gauss) have sucked on live servers for a while. I think pistols outperform them.
---
Iirc + limb damage or +33% vats shotguns are bugged and do way more damage, and I think those prefixes are essential to properly run shotguns, but I wouldn't rely on the glitch being permanent.
---
People who use QE double barrels seem to really like them though.
---
This happened to me a long time ago with Signal Strength and I couldn‚Äôt get Rose to admit that I already got her Key Fragments for her... She would just tell me to go find them when I had them on my toon haha. Eventually it got patched and let me move forward. It might be bugged and you‚Äôll have to wait for the next latch unfortunately. :-(
---
My bloody hatchet is named Daniel Boone.
---
Give this man an updoot!
---
Wait, you mean to tell me that an MMO has a grind attached to it's endgame. I'm shocked, shocked I tell you.
---
As many people have pointed out, it is very possible to have completed the run significantly early if one has a hyper optimized build for getting the xp repeatable. But, I'm in agreement with the OP, that the daily challenges are weighted a bit too heavily compared to the weekly ones, which puts a little too much pressure on a player with common limits to game time.
---
I am lucky to have a gamer SO that has played 76 with me so we can support each other doing the Legendary Run while raising kids. I'm rank 85 today after having done 99% of all non-NW challenges including double SCORE weekend. Double SCORE weekend got my SO and I to try out NW, and while it is more fun than I expected, I still have only gone back for the occasional daily challenge that seemed easily achievable on a given day. We can't put in many hours a day to grind the repeatable and did not do so for the double xp or SCORE weekends.
---
That said, I will not be bothering with Season 2, as I am just burnt out. It is entirely possible that I put down 76 once Season 1 is over and never come back. Logging in just to do dailies has killed my passion for every MMO thus far and it has done so here, too.
---
I'm looking forward to more interactive content like the return of the Brotherhood.
---
Wait till you hear about all the bugs and glitches that even make the grind impossible!
---
So calm. Then the fire nation attacked
---
No, if all players leave the cell has a chance to reset. Best way to do this is with two other buddies
---
DOOT!
---
That bug‚Äôs still there. Lol
---
And they wont give a shit. They never give a shit. I support you, but honestly, they wont give a shit.
---
There's no way Fallout players are leaving with how good the season 2 rewards are, probably the best season pass of any game I've seen and it's free.
---
Also from what I've seen people are still shreaking enemies in seconds so there seems to be no need to worry about the damage numbers going down.
---
The difference is not minuscule. Bloodied and junkies builds will still do several times more damage than full health builds.
---
It is just smarter way to calculate multiple stacking bonuses so they can actually start to balance differences.
---
The easiest way is to have a private team with someone else, both of you spawn on the edge of the map and just walk into the fire enough to start taking damage. Revive, die to the fire again and revive a second time. You can revive someone inside the fire without going inside it yourself.
---
I like to log in and do what I feel like.
---
I just started back into Fallout and this is the industry standard now sadly. Rockstar does the same thing with daily challenges to earn premium currency.
---
Stacy is my instigating lever action , Bertha is my furious gatling plasma and Betty is my instigating explosive handmade
---
Great thing you did here man, your friend would be very happy. I know i would :)
---
I'll do you one better: this change was necessary AND Unyielding still needs to be nerfed. 
---
I keep saying: low-health builds should have the best DPS (and they still do), but do they really need to have the best carry weight, VATS accuracy, barter prices, XP bonuses, action points, stealth, and crit rate too?
---
Probably nothing, particularly if it's your first character. 150 level ups is enough to pick almost three completely different perk loadouts, but when you are starting out you shouldn't be expected to plan out your entire build right away (similarly, it's reasonable for people to spend a few level ups shuffling special points around once they've learned the game).
---
But unless you are contemplating a serious overhaul of your build it's unlikely you are looking for more than a handful of specific perks. And there perk cards aren't that useful - you are much more likely to get a card you either outright don't want, or a duplicate of one you already have, than one of a small number you actually do want.
---
no I will try that. :)
---
There is a map of his route available. Use that and follow it and you should be able to find him.
---
Keep trying because the gun is so worth it. I was running a rifle build before but now run a rifle/shotgun build and I use it as my primary gun now.
---
I do not intend to do anything with legendary perks aside from attaching the base level card and forgetting about them. It is not worth the grinding to level them as those explosions look more annoying than helpful, and the armor set bonuses are a waste of time for me. the legendary perks I expect to go the way of the Survival Servers. Forgotten and dropped in a few months.
---
Not true, pets take up none of your camp budget. They may have long ago but not anymore.
---
So, the post got some traction once again. Cosidering there's been a wave of posts on topic of legendary perk system issues, that were being pointed out hundreds of times here and on pts forums (but yet completely ignored), it would be great to see some comments from you guys: @Valseek @LadyDevann @_BethesdaGameStudios
---
And it would be really nice to know the direction we're going here. Some design philosophy behind all that. Not just generic "we'll pass it on to the team" which does barely seems to change anything yet after three iterations of perk system implementation. Although some welcome changes were made to the system, the majority of issues persist and from what I've seen, community has been pretty vocal on topic of said issues me and lots of others pointed out.
---
Why is all that system so convoluted and unrewarding? We need answers.
---
Yep, you, me, and about 36000 others each night.
---
As an essential employee, yes.  I have been playing quite a bit since TLR started and I am going to have to haul ass to try to finish it.
---
Y‚Äôall just fall for everyone who uses their dead friend for karma, get bent
---
spending 2 hours scrapping perks is fun though.
---
Archer, mammalogist, and athletics are the easiest
---
If you are already a bloody SNiper a Bloody Commando would be the quickest and cheapest Perk wise to switch too, you get a solid increase in DPS and it is very playable in Daily OPS and Colossal Problem.
---
its a glitch with the new update, the only fix is finding someone with fallout 1st and asking them to help you by taking you to their private world
---
Mammalogist takes forever because no brahmin let's me milk them.
---

---
I have a private world will that work
---
So by JFK experience he uses Mysterious Stranger a lot then?
---
Instigating is an underrated legendary even in the current patch. IMO everyone who isn't bloodied should have at least one instigating weapon in their arsenal. I've heard for commando it even works for the first few shots, but that might just be server lag.
---
I can confirm on the PTS I'm still one-shotting or two-shotting most common enemies with my Instigating Grogak's Axe, even in the Daily Ops.
---
Probably a bad comparison, but Call of Duty Mobile also had a battlepass system which i bought in the first week after it initially released, i lost interest midway and around 4 days before the season for it was about to end i was able to fully complete every challenge and level it up to 100. Sure i couldn't get the extra free currency or whatever it was after tier 100 but i got the main items in it.
---
Found the map but good god, it would take forever to track this guy down.
---
They truly are lukewarm at best. Ironically the best legendary perks to me are the special stat related ones that enable you to just grab more normal perks...
---
You know your mules level up counts as if it was your main
---
Yeah but even now with destiny 2 that grind is getting old fast.
---
It takes 5 minutes and about 3000 caps to complete. Just keep spamming the CAMP placement  while slowly spinning in a circle.
---
I want McNuggets!
---
I did all three in a couple hours. Get the Brahmin pen plan and build it at your camp, you can milk it then store it then milk again until you get it 10 times.
---
Oooh nice to know that.
---
Damn, thank you.
---
Essential employe here, yeah its difficult to try and squish in a couple of hours every day, but i have been doing it so far. Currently, at level 83, i missed yesterday, but im pretty sure im still on track to complete it. Compared to the peeps who get to stay home, but hey if you can't do it its your own fault as people on the internet would defend against my argument of making things more convenient for people who aren't attacked to their console for 6 to 15 hours.
---
I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt think having to play a game I love every day is a negative. Down vote me if you want but if you don‚Äôt want to play every day fine that‚Äôs on you. But you can‚Äôt have the same rewards as the guy who does want to play every day. The world doesn‚Äôt work that way.
---
it doesn't awnser my question i checked
---
No but I‚Äôm always near like 3 other camps
---
Sorry for your loss, mate, the memorial is amazing and you don't need big fancy things, what you've done is more than enough
---
May the Light guide Joe through the afterlife and may his soul rest without any regrets and may his life not be mourned but celebrated and remember, as long as you keep his memory alive, he never truly dies 
---
From me and r/PKOA community, we wish Joe the best in his new journey and hope you're doing ok
---
That's what I did, and 90% of the time my brahmin kicks me instead of giving me milk.
---
Wasn't there a ghoul in fallout 2 that we meet and in quest he goes feral after a large radiation dose
---
It can. I found it‚Äôs easier to build my camp along that route and listen out for him as I‚Äôm doing camp stuff.
---
As a fellow junkie i suggest ultra-light for all limbs
---
This. The plans are located Southwest of pioneer scouts camp at the archery range.
---
When someone picks it up I think. Or when the servers shuts down. What makes you ask?
---
They might as well remake the perk card system first. That in itself could do with quite a few changes.
---
Can you only do 1 op per day?
---
This is true.
---
If it helps anyone I run PS4 and have seen this happen a bit lately. Not very common, but these one shot monsters with the crazy builds and gear exist on PS4.
---
It looks like mine is already on his route so I will just have to be vigilant.
---
I‚Äôm Xbox, but I feel your pain. I played a handful of hours today, and managed to have server disconnect issues no less than 5 times. Very frustrating to have just about cleared a building or an event and then get dropped to the main menu.
---
Damn your right! It needs rainbows and some glitter!
---
I had the same problem on my main character the first time I did it, I ended up server hopping from the wayward and Flatwoods a few times and eventually got them. On my second character my pet Brahmin let me milk her every time I put the pen out, maybe having high luck helps or something lol
---
Most dwellers I found were dead in dumpsters, office buildings, ditches etc... Overseer clearly doesn't acknowledge every other kid who left that opening party.
---
Also if you have improved repair kits you can skip the repair 3 crossbows...just make them and use kits no need to wear them down
---
I hope you copy and paste this into the Test feedback and not just here to get upvotes from the community that loves to give upvotes to anyone going against what Bethesda is currently trying out. I have no idea how the system works and neither do i care, its up to the PC players to filter through the shit before it hits us Playstation and Xbox players.
---
I stand with you, supertrunks. This game is a joke. I love this game but hate it twice. And Bethesda showed to us they are the most mediocre, incompetent, careless company making games. Lazy AF, unwillingly, chaotic... They dont fix, they break. So, dont waste your time arguing with fanboys because to them you are fighting. Like religion, politics and sports, fanatism cloud minds and make people aggresive.
---
Unless you can kill two queens in under 15 minutes,  the silo will reset
---
lol ya I meant starfield gotta love android auto correct.
---
I love Bethesda games but this is one area that really makes them look bad. I waited 2 &amp; 1/2 months for the regular SS Underarmor and it's frustrating that such a small piece can't be quick-fixed. It looks really cool and all armors should have the forest camo skin so we can wear good pieces of different armor styles together.
---
A lot of people here keep mentioning that they think it is a PITA to micromanage health/rads for bloodied builds, but really, it's not that involved at all. 
---
Carry some diluted radaways (you probably already are) and a gamma gun with no mods and boom your all set to adjust your rads in a few seconds. 
---
It's not tedious or burdensome or any of that, literally a couple of seconds and my rads are wherever I want them to be (within \~1% or so). Maybe once or twice per hour I'll need to readjust rads. (Obviously certain situations, e.g. rad rumble ores, are an exception).
---
But hey, it's cool to play other builds too, play however you please. Just wanted to dispel the whole "constant rad levels struggle" myth.
---
I just finished mine legitimately. I now have a month break of the daily grind.
---
Muzzle brake I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
I‚Äôm disagreeing with the guy that said blocking people is cheating and disagreeing with anyone who claims Fallout is meant to be a PvP game. It literally has never been a PvP game. This one just happens to have elements of it, which I do not find fun in the slightest. Not gonna stop me from playing the game however I see fit, which means if someone steals my workshop, I‚Äôm going to stealth hide until they lose interest to deny them the satisfaction of forcing PvP.
---
And you now have a month of not having to do the dailies lol
---
thank you for sharing this with us, such a lovely memorial&lt;3 i know how awful depression is and i wish the best for you :)
---
You missed a "snorting a line of coke the size of a desk, diagonally, then chugging half a bottle of vodka" between "walking into the office" and "spewing some random evil/incompetent idea". 
---
üòâüëâ
---
The sad thing is, the game could go from mediocre to good/great so easily, but the Devs keep holding it back , thinking that the typical MMO grinding shit is applicable to the fallout fanbase üòê
---
Maybe when you generate a new bag (either by dying or dropping stuff) it deletes your previous one, but I'm not 100% sure on that.
---
Damn Brotherhood
---
no, paper bags do disappear even if someone stays on the server and noone picks it up, but i dont know how long it takes. more than 10min i assume.
---
its not that people enjoy spending more time doing the exact same thing its more that boss enemies and "tough" enemies were a joke in most cases and the idea of "anyone can play the build so just swtich to \[insert meta here\] is incredibly toxic for a game because sure people CAN switch to a meta. sure.
---
but tell me, how is the "if you dont want to suck use the cookie cutter setup" ever going to make people feel ike there is diversity?
---
if wow made everyone play rogue because "its the meta brah you need to use it, your mage? your warrior? shit and shit, play rogue or we wont go raiding/pvp with you" would you have fun when your favorite class/build is \[insert non-meta option here\] because it just feels more satisfying to use but over all its shit because its not meta so your excluded from enjoying the same content as others.
---
bloodied being the ONLY real viable end game setup was incredibly toxic for build diversity and you'd be a fool for not seeing that it needed to be nerfed.
---
there was no point of a full medic focused build because bloodied couldnt be healed much due to full rads+near invicibility due to dodgy+Serendipity.
---
there was no point for a tank setup because Serendipity, dodgy, nerd rage and unyielding made bloodied far tankier than any dedicated tank build all the while having the best damage in the game.
---
crowd control build? useless bloodied could kill things before they could even be controlled.
---
if i played a D&amp;D game where the only class available was high damage mages i wouldn't play it because it would always play out the same for everyone.
---
I swear this place would down vote me for donating to charity
---
If you're in the same area it usually combines them. But I also don't know if purposefully dropped bags exist separately from death bags or what
---
Thanks for offering :)
---
Oh, don't go dragging Gen-X into this.  We don't give a shit about any of this crap.  And we certainly never expect awards from anyone for anything...
---
;)
---
Like many things in FO76 it is often not well explained nor intuitive.
---
I agree but at some point they should put out the cosmetics for a price. Id prefer them in a bundle. If theyre not ill wait for the discount.
---
This is the reason the first test server was private.  You don't have a right to your build, or anything for that matter, working on the test server!!  The test server could install and not even launch on AMD processors and that's a bug report.  Test servers provide free quality assurance from the fans that volunteer.
---
You are on the test server to test and if your build doesn't work you report it, so your build will work in the next revision of the test server, and eventually on live.
---
I have a medic explosive mini gun with over 200 fire rate and it doesn‚Äôt behave like a magic weapon. I tested it on sbq, I was so excited when I got it :(
---
Thanks for this tip. I really don‚Äôt neeeeeeed a collection of magazines or bobble heads. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm even keeping them. They‚Äôre consumables and there are always more.
---
Do you even NDA bro?
---
So long as we hit the mark, we all get the rewards. Doesn't matter if you contributed or not.  
---
The only thing you'll miss out on if you don't contribute is the reward boxes you get from doing so, but that may not be such a big deal anyway.
---
First you go and watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs
---
Then you make a decision about whether to equip this thing with an accelerated barrel that bumps its fire rate above 200, and if you do you then decide whether to use it around other players or not.
---
You can do the Op as many times as you want, with some rewards each time. The bonus rewards for completing it under a certain time are only given once per day, however.
---
I would love to know your build. I'm curious, I am also a rifleman but I like the idea of gun slinging and one shotting enemies.
---
Would love to see Order of Mysteries faction, and a Silver Shroud one too!
---
 you can have more than one bag generated, they just cant be near each other. if you drop a bag, then go like 100 yards, you can drop another and they will both be where you dropped them.
---
so dropping a second bag doesnt delete the first. i think its just a timer of sorts.
---
You make this game sound like a full time job lmao
---
You wouldn‚Äôt see it as a feature if you were the person actually taking the time and effort to grind for it. 
---
Only causals who are used to getting our left overs think this way. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs true. When I spend countless hours running content and farming for plans or gear or whatever then finally get it only then to have it passes down to some noob who couldn‚Äôt complete the hard difficulty that‚Äôs a slap in the face.
---
Truth is, high agility is king. With 15 or more, you can do anything and stay undetected.
---
My Unarmed Ninja had 17 agility and shadowed armor and no sneak. He was invisible whatever the lights.
---
But thanks BencidüòÄ
---
I've seen this happen recently on Xbox, too.
---
I thought the only two mods was the regular receiver and the prime receiver.
---
I know right?
---
Goddamn Wastelanders update bringing all these gun-toting sons of bitches back to Appalachia. 
---
I remember in the old days, if you heard gunfire it was either a bot, or a mutie... or another player, looking to kill you.
---
So u have to be hidden? Or actively not shooting at anything?
---
Get out of here with your well thought out and reasonable suggestions.
---
Please don‚Äôt get me started on fire barrels. I have three big issues with them. 
---
1. They cast a shadow on their own interior, which physically should not be possible.
---
2. The shadow isn‚Äôt properly aligned to the model, so the vertical bars don‚Äôt have proper ground shadows.
---
3. The light is the wrong color. How did this happen. Orange fire should equal orange light. Not fucking white! 
---
I play as a raider, so these would have been my ground light of choice, and I still use them sparingly, but only in places that already have enough light to hide the issues I‚Äôve mentioned.
---
This would be true if in this game anything you got was account wide. Like plans or had an easier way to shift gear from one toon to the next. I swear it‚Äôs like the people who made this game never played an mmo in their lives. Much less one made by the very company who owns them. Lol
---
Mmm... the good ‚Äòol days, back when you measured a mans courage by the length of his pipe
---
...pistol
---
This game could have grind, but the actual grind is not fun in any way. Dude, the raider/settler rep grind is the worst shit ive ever seen. I played neverwinter for 3 years, every day, 16 hours a day and rarely got bored. They had dungeons, team play, a scoreboard, guilds, a shit ton of missions, hundreds of viable builds... This game has 1 mission for settlers and 2 for raiders. A game with a strong base on building and you cant have a clan and make your stronghold, for example. Imagine building a fucking base and creating a clan of 8 ppl. And adding like 30 daily missions. I'd play every day. And dungeons or whatever you call it with specific loot. For example, a cave and the boss at the end has a chance to drop a special helmet that marks bodies (dead or alive) or a mod for any helmet, even a special eyewear, get creative. Just like the berry mentats do. Or a mk II jetpack with more jet time.
---
They wont give a shit and this game will be forever mediocre and buggy and eventually will go to oblivion. This shit was born defective. And this is not sparta.
---
So why after all this time, is this "bug" being fixed now? Why wasn't it fixed before release, or shortly thereafter. This is just like the removal of the atom challenges for the chore score. There is going to be a lot of players upset because it's been in the game this long. Their poor handling of this game should not be at the expense of the players.
---
The more that I think about it, the more I think, maybe Bethesda added some random ambient sound effects that play throughout the world? Maybe I‚Äôm supposed to assume some settlers and raiders are fighting nearby?
---
Nah, sometimes a ghoul just turns for no reason. That's well established
---
I agree i dont mind buying their stuff but grinding another not so legendary run isnt for me cheif. 
---
I like a good story but if i can have an event with dr zorbo or whatever his name is, where i can actually battle with, im not interested. And it makes me less interested in buying cosmetics. Id go buy another game forsure.
---
Bruh!
---
Well I‚Äôve rattled a hornets nest lol. I‚Äôm not looking to win a debate. I‚Äôm just acknowledging the fact that it sucks for those players that spent hundred of hours trying to get a certain build for that build to be nerfed considerably. It doesn‚Äôt matter they still have the best items. It matters they worked hard to get something for it to be altered in a way where some players will have to change builds.
---
I used to do that but then realized that i can just create a building team and hope that people join with some good shared perk cards and play the game as i normally would. Build, Daily, Events, Loot an entire location. I do see quite a few Event teams and most of the events don't even get started. I guess people just use Event Teams as the default when the default should be the Building Team.
---
I work 12 hours a day and only get to play a few hours a day and I'm at level 87
---
what system are you on?
---
I'm only level 120 and play shotgun because it's the hand I've been dealt. One thing I've noticed is that there's a time to use VATS and there's a time not to use VATS. It makes a HUGE difference in DPS. I haven't figured out why this is, but give both methods a try on different enemies.
---
Can't upvote this enough! Totally agreed on every point but I have one thing I have to add. Not only most of the perks do not sound legendary at rank 1, most of them do not live up to their "legendary" status at all.
---
I like how this legendary perk topic is getting traction. We really need them to hear us and take action or it will definitely lead to yet another shitstorm on release if the core issues won't be addressed.
---
How bad is this nerf supposed to be?!? I love my bloodied unarmed/heavy build, I hope it doesn‚Äôt destroy my hundreds of hours I put into getting these weapons and fine tuning my build
---
I haven't donated a single thing, i haven't even visited the location yet and im still getting the rewards. I should i least go talk to the guy to hear the dialog he might have.
---
Im still pissed the Overseer gets to rock the greaser jacket over the vault suit. Guess you have to dip out on your squad for a year to unlock that fashion ability.
---
Hate to tell you this, but this game has been against working adults since the B.E.T.A. crapfest. Tiny windows of game time that predominately landed *right* when the average working adult has to be *at* work. Most of the stuff they do is more for the benefit of people who simply *don‚Äôt* work standard hours than the average working adult. Which tends to be kids still in school (including college in that category too) for the most part.
---
He took down a super mutant with 2-3 shots to the head with a non-legendary fixer, just saying.
---
&gt; Im not going to continue to engage with you. You have clearly made up your mind and wont listen to oposing views.
---
It's a bit silly to "stop engaging" with someone because they won't immediately change their mind and agree with you, especially if you create a gatekeeping thread and try to silence people's feedback just because you personally find it "annoying".
---
As far as me having made up my mind - yes, I have made up my mind about people having the right to give feedback about how the game is making them feel, when it's not the usual Bethesda-hating, Todd-hating hyperbolic, toxic vitriol, and from what I've seen as far as the daily chores go, it hasn't been.
---
I would like to give you a bit of a reality check, though; your thread here, where you are complaining about other people "complaining", in effect telling people to shut up and take it as far as the daily challenges go, and basically telling them to stop giving their feedback, got 61 upvotes in around two days.

---
Now, you're free to be "annoyed" by whatever you like, but perhaps, when you look at the amount of people posting about how they're getting sick and tired of the daily chores and how they're being burnt out by the system, you can maybe agree that it's worthwhile feedback to give to Bethesda, especially when no-one has recommended any changes be made into the game that would affect your own, personal enjoyment of it (or at least shouldn't, by any reasonable metric.) And, especially when Bethesda is about to slam an even more grindy end-game system, the perk coins, on top of all of this.
---
For real ,all the hype around wastelanders and when you finish the couple of hours of new content it added , your stuck doing the same 2 shitty radiant quests once a day for a month or 2, yeah I wouldn't mind grind ,but you really have to get the balance right on it
---
How long most kids are in school for? During a pandemic? And the summer for USA kids where they don‚Äôt have school at all? Did you really just ask that?
---
Yup. Just had this happen even 4 months later.
---
Archer and Swimming were quite easy for me.    
---
If you're doing anything where you have to repair something x number of times, don't have Fix It Good or Weapon Artiscan equipped. I think you an repair dropped weapons for it which would be faster.
---
Unarmed calculation is bugged and incomplete, and 1h/2h melee are still multiplying strength bonuses.
---
After a lot of testing, it seems they are experimenting with making STR bonus melee damage additive and attempted to do so with Unarmed weapons, but they messed up and there is a missing "1.0" in the calculation. So Unarmed is doing a fraction of the damage it's supposed to be doing.
---
It appears to me, if and when they crack the right formula for unarmed weapons, that they will do the same normalization to STR damage bonus for 1h/2h weapons.
---
Okay I wasn't 100% sure.
---
Maybe it only remembers your last 3 or 4 bags, and after that it starts deleting the oldest one. Since the OP "died a few times", each one of those counted as a separate bag, and therefore eventually his oldest one got deleted.  
---
Or yeah, it could just be time based I guess.
---
Oh well, looking at the number of threads about this issue, I have the feeling the legendary perk system will be again postponed.
---
More like Beth managed to cork the numbers.
---
Thanks for doing the math. At a glance it looks visible. 
---
So you can miss 32.8% of the days and still complete the Run. That seems to make the OP‚Äôs claims significantly less valid.
---
Sorry, I‚Äôm not sure I totally understood the first part of what you were saying
---
It's not?
---
I understand exactly what the changes do and still think it‚Äôs bullshit. Losing 156 dps on my fixer is bullshit. Losing 911 dps on my bloody deathclaw is bullshit. 
---
It‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre a casual and you don‚Äôt mind if they tank your damage. But dont be so gun ho to give a way my damage. 
---
All the white knights I‚Äôm seeing on this post are all ‚Äú hey it‚Äôs fine it‚Äôs good for the game ‚Äú says who?? What gives you the right to say how I should play?? I dont say shit about these noobs who don‚Äôt want to take the time to make a proper build and put in the time to maximize it. Let them play on the fence with pipe rifles while I kill the queen. But the flip side to that is dont fucking tell me that it‚Äôs fine if I get fucking raped with a nerf. 
---
There‚Äôs nothing reasonable about nerfs. Needs are the lazy dev way instead of actually doing a balance pass and buffing things that could use it. Make the enemies tougher more challenging. Make content more challenging. Buff builds that are useless or under performing. These are all good changes I and most top tier players can get behind.  But a wholesale nerf to damage output isn‚Äôt it chief.
---
You make it sound so fun.
---
Wait....I also have a rifle named "The JFK Experience"   I thought it was super witty...
---
Same here brother im just a normal heavy/commando build trying to make a living in the wasteland
---
i mean ive looked at the season 1 rewards and nothing there is "must have". theres some cool shit in there for sure.
---
i mean the real must have item in the entire run is the ammo converter. which i find clunky as hell menu-wise. but its still important to have access to. but its at like rank 5. so any semi active player has it.
---
I'm still early in the run, my goal is to unlock the stupid ufo playground object before it expires, im like 10 spaces away. but all that other skins and stuff sure it'd be cool to have but mehhh. nothing to stress over.
---
people need perspective.
---
I got 7 perk points im saving to go pistol build. I got much more to go.
---
It's a limited MMO and like any MMO it's made to be a grind.    
---
WoW. ESO. I played WoW for maybe a year and a half. Luckily a nephew got me into it and 'helped' so progress was faster. Spent a lot of time solo but a lot of time in a Guild group.    
---
It is good a lot of the time but having to go through the main quest and all again for an alt with a different build is BORING.    
---
Things like water and food needs go down faster than you think unless you get perks which take up slots, you grind more, or get something else to slow it down. Ammo drops are small unless it's a heavy gun and then you're meant to grind more for mats to make more ammo.    
---
My main is 104 and I still haven't launched a nuke. I have completed Wastelanders and the mind numbing grind to max our Raider rep is so Fing SLOW. IDK about anyone here but I value my time more than small rewards for game time.
---
Kinda miss having to jump in to replace the main tank even while specced as moonkin...
---
Bears can tank... And better!
---
I often jump from team to team if I notice someone has a camp in a spot that's desirable for fast travel daisy chaining
---
Did you forget where you parked?
---
I missed the first two weeks and i have just passed dr zorbo. I even got the first double score day auto completed.
---
Its hilarious that you think they will ‚Äú balance ‚Äú anything. Name one time they‚Äôve ever done that in the 2 years the game has been active. 
---
Never. They released the game with god tier weapons ( TSE ) then instead of actually balancing them they just needed them into the ground to the point they‚Äôre useless. 
---
Then they let bloodied and melee go for a year and a half with all top tier players grinding and trading and in some cases paying to get their builds to ‚Äú end game ‚Äú and then instead of actually balancing anything they just wholesale nerf with the meta taking the biggest hits. This isn‚Äôt balance chief. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt know how to do that.
---
.....
---
You know VATS doesn't work on players in NW right? Why you trying to spread this trash.
---
And "every single person" does not have a gauss shotgun or 40mm. They aren't that common.
---
Lol yeah I did see a brotherhood banner show up I guess that's what it was from
---
That may be off a bit. I can convince the former raider to go to Foundation, gain the Foundation rep at that moment, kill the raider, and then get the standard Raider rep plus the ‚ÄòAppalachia has a new corpse‚Äô bonus.
---
The first has to be fissure prime
---
Yes, enquiring minds want to know!
---
Nope.
---
Another option is to take pictures of Crater but give them to Ward. You‚Äôll get Foundation rep and still get Treasury Notes from Davenport.
---
A lot of people are already complaining about this up coming nerf, but I must say it‚Äôs ridiculous easy to kill things right now. With my bloodied stealth commando I can one shot the Grafton monster, a non legendary scorchbeast takes about 6 or 7 shots. This nerf isn‚Äôt going to make these builds unplayable, just a little more realistic....
---
What a pathetic response.
---
Full health build wouldn't use bolstering, they'd consider Vanguard.
---
BUt you have to consider your current DR/ER to decide.
---
My full-health Tank with full Solar (scout variant) has roughly 500 DR/ER without using Vanguards. So vanguards is mostly trash to me (due to the soft-cap being around 350 DR/ER for most enemies in the game). So I get a lot more benefit out of running a mixed set- primarily 2 pieces LifeSaving just in case I do get downed; and then the others mixed, although ideally I'd probably run like 2 Troubleshooters and 1 Hunter's. Yao Guai and various Robots (assaultrons, gutsies, maybe even the miniguns on sentry bots) are the biggest threats to me I feel.
---
Don't forget your Rad Resist though; my Solar has 0, so I run a Lead Lined Backpack for 90 RR. I'll pick up the Rad Resist legendary perk when that comes out.
---
Obviously you don't play NW lol. You can use VATS on grenades you throw to make them do way more damage. Instantly downs a player. And yes they are that common. I'm level 477 on NW. I know what I'm talking about ü§°
---
Ever use Godmode?  You lose packs if you leveled up during godmode and don't do something to make sure they get applied before leaving the server.
---
So if I prime up one with a key and a code, and then complete the second one and kill the queen in under 15 minutes the previous one will still be keyed up? That's cutting it close with the fast travel and clean up. My best time in the silo 9:30. The queen is easy with the right group, but cleaning up and fast traveling back sounds impossible without a friend.
---
They don't - I have a bloodied gauntlet thats listed as 400 damage. It does roughly that. There's a mirelurk pond near my C.A.M.P. - the mirelurks now take 2-3 hits to kill instead of the one they need on live.
---
Using an instigating gauntlet + power attacking I was able to 1HK them
---
Thanks for the link!
---
I‚Äôm in awe of the eloquence you demonstrated with your own response there.
---
Prototype hazmat suit is the best one
---
This. I like turtle but he‚Äôs shilling here. He‚Äôs not playing a bloody melee or stealth commando which are the two that took the biggest hits here. Watch Captain noobs stream from last night and it‚Äôs clear the difference. Bloodied fixer goes from 316 damage on live to 180 on test. Bloody death law goes from 1700 on live base damage to 800 on test. So yea his full health heavy gun power armor build wasn‚Äôt effected much because that build isn‚Äôt/wasn‚Äôt a dps heavy build to begin with. 
---
I get it that bloodied needed a balance pass. I agree that some of the numbers that were possible were high comparatively to other builds. I would argue that was in part because the risk involved at playing with 30 hp. But even beyond that why not make the game harder through tougher enemies and content and buff some of the other builds some? Seems like that would be something I could get behind and see as reasonable. But making us weaker? After we played for two years and worked to get gear and builds? That ain‚Äôt it chief.
---
If you do, bring 250 of whatever it is, plastic at the moment. I showed up with 150 and they really should have a stash box and scrap box there
---
You know, you could just play something else for a bit and come back when they release new content. Or you could post yet another redundant thread and bitch about it.
---
I mean, you're already doing the best you can. Surviving in a nuke zone without Hazmat/CSA/PA means sucking down Rad-Away like a dying man in a desert.
---
Full Buttressed SS with a few extra RR buffs will slow the intake a little bit, but not by much. What you may not be aware of is that CSA/Hazmat have a hidden 99% rad reduction buff, and PA has a 15%/piece buff (totals up to 90%). There's no way to match that with anything else, even if you can get your RR numbers up to 5-600 to beat power armor, you're still missing that 90% reduction.
---
I disagree. I don‚Äôt think these are good changes. They are lazy changes. Good changes would have been more difficult enemies. Harder more challenging content. Buffing some underperforming builds.
---
Foundation, cause that guy in front of Ward's office won't stop drinking coffee for nothing, not even a nuke.
---
2 more rounds may not seem like much but in the grander scheme of things that's 3x times the ammo consumption. West Tek has what, 50 mobs?
---
now it takes 50 rounds to clear it. after the nerf that's 150.
---
Ah, no, it's a problem of communication. You mean throwing and then VATsing them.
---
Sounds like a console problem. It's all assault rifles on PC, because we can freeaim way more efficiently. Some gauss shotguns if people find them, but that's about it
---
Look, you clearly missed the point of my post so I will say it again in simpler words. Its your fault if you feel tired if you grinded the event and finished it a month early.
---
If you have a legit complaint about anything else regarding the Legendary Run then its great you provide feedback. Just like with most of the posts you provided. The pass is far from perfect.
---
I did not decided no stop engaging because you wouldnt change your mind right away. I said that because you repeated yourself with nonsense. In the future please take the time to read posts before commenting a dozen paragraphs.
---
what NDA? It's public test server, there's no NDA bro.
---
I gotta say I agree with ya on this.
---
I was excited for the daily ops. Was.
---
The explosive effect doesn‚Äôt effect the queen as well, test it one other enemies. Also another requirement is 60fps. Queen fights are often laggy which means the effect wont work.
---
Got an Uny/Ap/Sentinel Combat chest lvl 30 once. Might have cried.
---
This is not a nerf of individual things.  it is an overall rebalancing of all the bonuses multiplying damage.  If you want SBQ to stop dying in 2 second due to broken weapons this is the first step to fix it.  Multiplicative damage buffs that stack together will always make it incredibly difficult to prevent all exploitative combinations without some kind of arbitrary cap that is never fun either.
---
Personal Terminal can mark there the NPC is to start the camera quest.
---
And that means it‚Äôs ok? Angry Turtle is just a guy who plays the same game I do and you do. He‚Äôs no better at it then me or maybe you. He‚Äôs also in shill mode right now. 
---
I disagree with him here for a number of reasons on this. He doesn‚Äôt speak for me or a lot of other people. 
---
Being able to kill an enemy in 6 shots when it used to take 2-3 is a big difference over time. It‚Äôs a lot kore ammo and a lot more reloads and a lot more wear on your weapons and armor. It‚Äôs also a lot kore chances for some ghoul or rad scorpion or whatever to kill me. 
---
If they were going to do this but then also make changes to the risk you‚Äôre taking as a bloody or junkie build then I‚Äôd be more inclined. I still wouldn‚Äôt like it but at least it would be fair. But nope. I still have to play at 30 go to get the best damage but now that damage ( the reward for the risk ) is 50% worse. That ain‚Äôt it chief.
---
Man, I‚Äôm on xbone idk if I ever get 60 FPS. Recommend another enemy to test on? I know angry turtle used that behemoth maybe I‚Äôll have to hunt him down.
---
No, earned my levels the old fashioned way.
---
Yes. But im willing to pay for quality cosmetics if i can skip the not so legendary run
---
I don't play nw to pvp, but the main 2 weapons people use to kill fast is automatic rifles and grenades. Tank killer destroys armor in a matter of seconds and nade vats + explosive perks makes them deadly in team wiping. Explosive weapons aren't that deadly as theyre aren't readily available compared to assault rifles. You got Radium rife, handmade, automatic combat rifle, both smgs, and some others I can't remember. Heavy guns aren't even as deadly as automatic rifles because they got a spin up time to kill and don't have the accuracy while moving around. I've seen a guy in Xbox get like 16 kills in a match with just a handmade and nades. Wiped multiple teams cause he jumped around nade vats people an finished them off with some quick shots. They need to make NW first person only. No 3rd person cause that has to many advantages. You go watch pro nw players an all they do is play 3rd person, jump throw nades, vats and shoot while in the air with a automatic rifle with pin point accuracy cause of perks.
---
I'm a full health shotgun and I have a mixed set of SS armor.  I've got an auto stim, 2 regenerating and 2 life saving and it really depended more on the other qualities.  Three have a +1 stat and 20% off weight on junk or ammo or  weapons....I'm sorry I can't remember them all.  I don't know if SS is bugged but I've made a lot of SS armor and haven't gotten a vanguard yet.
---
Then make the enemies harder and the content more challenging. I‚Äôm for that. Make things take more effort. But they‚Äôre taking the lazy way out and instead just making the enemies higher level and us do less damage to them. That‚Äôs weak.
---
&gt; Idk why you're getting downvoted...
---
Because they are spamming multiple threads with the exact same copy paste shillery.
---
Yes please make explosives more random. After 5mins of looting I'll find 1 stimpack and 5 different grenades. Or give us some kind of defense against explosives
---
Oh, I thought you were done with this conversation. If you want to continue I will gladly explain to you how and why your new analogy is incorrect. I didn‚Äôt want to waste my time on a response that would fall on deaf ears. Do you want to continue the conversation?
---
nope, ini files werent touched and no prefs or custom files. every other game is working totally fine too..fallout was working fine like a week ago but all of a sudden, it just gave out
---
If you sit in an Office chair while fireing it, you turn yourself into a race car.
---
Regular super mutants is a good way to test, or a regular scorch beast, they are not that resistant to explosives.
---
It want a bug. They did this exact same thing to TSE weapons about 6 months after the game launched when cry babies started on how OP they were. And they were OP and probably did need some sort of balance pass. But that‚Äôs not what Bethesda did. They just needed them into the ground to the point they were useless. 
---
The same thing they‚Äôre doing here. They aren‚Äôt targeting bloodied/ Junkies per say, they just happen to be the ones hit the hardest. Yeah right. 
---
They know what they‚Äôre doing and it‚Äôs lazy.
---
I disagree on buffing builds, bringing bloodied and junkies back in line with others would be better. But I will agree that we need tougher enemies, but that‚Äôs supposedly what daily ops is bringing in so we never know until those get tested
---
I'm a working adult, and I've finished the run. The daily challenges were never more complex than "level up", "kill X amount of creatures", "chew bubblegum".
---
I don't know _what_ kind of challenges you're getting or _how_ you play FO76, but for me not a single one that wasn't Nuclear Winter-based was unachievable.
---
Only one I wear if I do
---
Not significant enough for the risk involved.
---
I‚Äôve gotten 10 badges on my alt from doing stings and things every day
---
&gt;its more that boss enemies and "tough" enemies were a joke in most cases
---
and? whether that's a bad thing is subjective. personally I play the game to become stronger, not weaker.
---
&gt;how is the "if you dont want to suck use the cookie cutter setup" ever going to make people feel ike there is diversity?
---
and your idea to fix that is to bring everyone down to the same level? it's doubly funny because people who disliked being op for whatever reason could always *not* play the meta, but now I have no option *but* to shoot bb guns.
---
&gt;if wow
---
WoW is not a good comparison. neither the community nor Bethesda sees this game as a full fledged mmo. most people play it as a singlelayer coop, it doesn't even have a competitive scope.
---
&gt;bloodied being the ONLY real viable end game setup
---
there are other viable setups. bloodied just excels at what it's supposed to, dps. but nothing's stopping you from playing with vampire's and being actually invincible. people here always related 'viable' with dps and that's silly.
---
&gt;there was no point for a tank setup because Serendipity, dodgy, nerd rage and unyielding made bloodied far tankier than any dedicated tank build
---
are you sure about that? https://streamable.com/svtgyn
---
Must be something else then.
---
Nade vatsing is also a problem on consoles.
---
Is it cut from the game or some place else
---
On PS4, sorry everyone, I don‚Äôt check my reddit too often üòÖüòÖ
---
But they shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äú inline‚Äù with other builds. Besides maybe beserker. Because other builds don‚Äôt require the risk they bloody and junkies do. 
---
The REASON bloodied does so much damage is because you‚Äôre literally one shot away from being killed by everything. Hell you can die from a rad ant if you‚Äôre playing low enough. And with Junkies you‚Äôre basically sacrificing you‚Äôre special stats for more damage. 
---
No other build has to make trade offs like that. Could they have made some changes to bloodied or stealth or some other things to tone down the buff? Yes. I would agree with that. But going from 316 on my fixer to 180 with the same build and risk? That‚Äôs too much.
---
This is exactly what all the backlash is about. People don‚Äôt like seeing lower damage numbers. Most builds are gonna be roughly the same damage while it hurts bloodied and junkies the most. It hurts melee builds even more than bloodied and junkies though. They‚Äôll need to set a standard on what they think is a good damage threshold and buff/nerf accordingly
---
PS4, sorry it took me a week to reply, I don‚Äôt check my reddit too often üòÖüòÖ
---
"You try running bloodied and see how much you enjoy it"
---
"i spent so much time getting bloodied"
---
" BlOoDiED so EaSy SereNdiPiTy" 
---
Bloodied / Unyielding gang still get mad benefits. Are likely still meta but God forbid their damage is back in line now.
---
LITS isn‚Äôt broken, people just found a way to exploit the spawn mechanics. It‚Äôs either they spawn in front of the generator or we get the same hide and seek when defending workshops. Now that is a real nightmare.
---
Should, bug is that it will only allow one person to insert the blood sample.
---
With a private world, it should be fine, since no one would have inserted it yet.
---
You find more and more stuff mising from your stash, sometimes things in it you don't remember putting there. Quests just disappear half way thru them. 
---
And these days more and more long time players have just stopped logging in, while others delete me from their social menu because we back different factions. 
---
I miss some parts of being a low level...
---
Wait is this confirmed?
---
For someone with "Angry" in his name that dude is one surprisingly chill dude. I think I've only seen him get really angry once, when he lost his full set of Unyielding SS.
---
Otherwise, he's representative of those of us in this game who don't react like we're getting our genitals cut with every update. Like sure, even Update 21 was bad, but I found a workaround. Like sure, Legendary Run was grindy, but I used the new public teams to get an average of 450 XP per super mutant kill so I finished it well before September.
---
Yes, the game can be broken, but it's still _just a game_. People here really need to learn how to chill out instead of blaming Bethesda for the deaths of their ancestors.
---
You have to be completely out of combat. If enemies are at all aware of you it wont heal you.
---
It says it right in the google doc, muzzle brake.
---
Muzzle Brake	(Default Mod but must be learned by scrapping)	25%
---
nope not it I've checked wiki after wiki and the only mod other than the standard ones
---
I don‚Äôt know how to link on mobile but search this sub for ‚Äúcompete fallout 76 apparel list‚Äù
---
Thanks man, I‚Äôll hit westek. It‚Äôs gonna be hard not to use my BE handmade though. I‚Äôve been using a 3* zealots Gatling plasma on sbq. I have 2 one is primed. I‚Äôm not a heavy weapons build so I‚Äôve been considering selling that mini gun. I appreciate the help!!
---
How's the damage nerf when you boost with food, specifically food boosted by Strange in Numbers and Carnivore?
---
I have this list but I am not sure how up to date it is:
---
 [https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Outfits](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Outfits)
---
It is standard
---
This is ridiculous know!
---
Theres a stash box there but I agree, they need a scrap box too
---
Angry Turtle's video shows him breezing through level 100 super mutants with fucking Final Word, a 3-star freebie of all things.
---
And what's an extra 156 dps on the fixer anyway? One extra bullet?
---
A lot of the quality of life perks should only be swapped in when you need them. Get rid of happy camper, swap inspirational and lone wanderer when you're not in group, get rid of scrapper. You can re-allocate those points to strength. That might help enough with your carry weight problem to buy yourself another point somewhere else.
---
the fuck are perk coind
---
If you're gonna be this upset with the game, maybe step away and play something else? i know I spent about 8 months away to actually live life, and only came back after Wastelanders.
---
Remember, it's a video game, and if it no longer serves its core purpose of entertaining you, then maybe you need to play something else.
---
That‚Äôs more than half the damage gone. One bullet? Have you ever played this game??? And yeah he was ‚Äú breezing ‚Äú through with a heavy gun at full health in power armor. The most noob build in the game.
---
I'm looking for the outfits that are more valuable in a trade.
---
Is there any database somewhere where there is a ranking of rarity?
---
Like which is rare, or a list of what is common?
---
I have alot of outfits that I don't need or use, but have no clue what rarity they are.
---
Yeah I only recently started saving them. Didnt like pushing an extra button to move my cards around
---
Here's a brilliant unheard of idea. Make legendary perks not require any currency to acquire and equip. Just select the perk you want and done, equip it. If your Level 50 you get 1 legendary perk, if your level 100 you get 2, if your 150 you get 3 and so on.
---
Simple. I know, it's a very out there idea but hey let's give it a try?  
---
On a serious note, why must everything in this game require grinding for a type of currency? I mean we got Caps, Scrip, Gold Bullion and now SCORE. Why do we need ANOTHER currency? The regular perks work as I described, no need for anything extra.
---
I mean I understand you are upset with losing your damage, I‚Äôm a full bloodied build myself always at 40hp/330hp... but literally the only thing that ever kills me is poison stuff. Nothing else. You can get so insanely tanky and take so little damage it‚Äôs insane. You are at barely any more risk than anyone else unless your armor is subpar. 
---
While I will agree it shouldn‚Äôt be such a drastic change, I will say it did need to be lowered. The damage you can get (especially melee w/ all it‚Äôs foods and drinks, etc stacking) was insane. Just give me a nukashine and I can kill the queen in 1min tops. Something like that? 100% nerf it hard, but don‚Äôt make melee in general completely useless.
---
When u have low fps looting, go inside fort defiance and back outside, that should fix it (it helps me on pc)
---
No thanks. I‚Äôve been playing since beta and have sunk 3000 hours in this game. I enjoy the game as is. I‚Äôve spent months and months getting the gear I want and the build I want. 
---
What I don‚Äôt want is Bethesda to bend to the will of the casuals who can‚Äôt take the time to learn to play. And that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing here.
---
Invisible Stealth Suit, where only the suit itself is invisible.
---
You, however, are still visible.
---
I‚Äôm not going to finish it and I don‚Äôt care
---
Thanks for the suggestion.
---
You‚Äôre forgetting that we now get that same ammo back after kills, so your ‚Äúlosing ammo‚Äù point is irrelevant.
---
Already a few videos of players stating that they are getting back more ammo than used.
---
&gt; but a lot of us spec into bloodied so we don't have to farm acid, lead and steel every other day.
---
You don't have to. 
---
- Equip Ammosmith 2 and Super Duper 3
---
- Craft a shit ton of railroad spikes
---
- Make sure you end up with a total that is easily divisible by 30 or 300
---
- Go to your ammo converter
---
- Sell all the spikes
---
- Buy ammo of your choice
---

---
Disagree. I think that things dont need to be ‚Äú nerfed ‚Äú they need to be balanced. You can either balance by making other things harder like enemies and content ( which I am in favor of ). This is the non lazy way to make games. Or you can just say fuck it make them all suck which is the lazy way and the way it appears they are going. 
---
If they did that then you wouldn‚Äôt be able to kill the queen in a minute right? So the same result without invalidating the work and effort that I and others have put into the last 2 years.
---
I don't have the PTS but I believe that's just for daily ops. mobs in general do not have contextual ammo drop, like the colossus.
---
on top of that taking a long time just as well, you also have to farm steel to craft spikes.
---
This is cool hope someone is able to be helped
---
Ammo is less of a concern these days anyway - raider ammo machine for free ammo, ammo converter for swapping all your unused ammo, and the new legendary perk for making more ammo
---
Who's touring the facility, and picking up slack?
---
1 coin per level is trash and worse than the existing system. You can earn 3.6 coins per level atm.
---
18 per 5 levels should be the minimum.
---
sssssshhhhhhh
---
No. No you don't.
---
The first has to be...
---
your own CAMP sight! Burn the world around you starting with everything that you've got!
---
speak for yourself my man. I balanced my build around the idea of maintaining a 1:1 ratio just so I don't have to ever farm materials again.
---
gathering resources is the bane of my existence.

This was the first thing I saw when joining Radiation Rumble the other night.
---
New Camp object, Trampoline.
---
And just like in real life, has a chance to break a limb.
---
Ahh 'Faction Warfare' yes please! This would be great.
---
They are at least now in the PTS. So they should/could be in the next update.
---
my view
---
1- new players
---
2- language barrier
---
3- afk xp leechers
---
Sweet! I was hoping this would be some form of repeatable content, even if it just killing waves of shit or whatever. Awesome.
---
Yes make everything to the level of the meta that was scaled far beyond reasonable instead of bringing it back in line. 
---
All because you're upset because your min/maxed build is disrupted and you're having a bloody (lmao) temper tantrum all throughout this thread. 
---
No one cares how you okay but people do care about the plethora of negative interactions in game in a multiplayer game. So yes the Devs do get to decide how you play. 
---
I'm with you add more content, make other legendaries useful yadda yadda but leaving bloodied in its outrageous state is a cherry picked request. 
---
It's not like you did anything specific for these weapons or accompanying armour's it's all RNG or trading through RNG. So short of someone breaking TOS and doing cash trades it's not exactly the end of the world. L
---
Plus judging from your attitude and other bloodied reactions and the counterpart responses from the "noobs" maybe we're better off with that population influx of noobs. 
---
If it goes through and works I'm all for it as a bloodied)unyielding user. 
---
All other improvements they can actually get to would be swell too. 
---
But buffing everything else around your super rare build in an RNG based dice roll for weapons game rather defeats the purpose of every reason you stated to keep it. 
---
The special bloodied feelies and high damage numbers.
---
It all depends on what outcome your after? Are you grinding for xp? Loot? Then nuke white springs granted it‚Äôs not as good as it use to be but it‚Äôs alright 
---
If your after a old fashion boss fight then drop it on fissure prime and other people will come and join in that‚Äôs what I like about it
---
If your looking to piss low level players off nuke I‚Äôd nuke the town where vault tech university is I always forget the name lol 
---
Or if your after just random/funny shit then it‚Äôs again down to you just nuke anywhere
---
Just to check, no mods installed?
---
It doesn't take that long, farming steel is ridiculously quick if you already kill super mutants and scorched and use the Scrapper perk.
---
At the end of the day it's a solution, and I always look for solutions instead of wasting energy complaining.
---
I need to give this a try!
---
Atlas observatory
---
Daily ops isn't on console yet..... Its only in the pts
---
I understand that man just trying to get a good squad together
---
Xbox has a very limited NW player base. If you are 477 I'd know you. I've never heard ANY complaints from other high level players about vats and grenade throws.
---
So you want a list that actively sources the inventory of every player in the game to gauge rarity, and sifts through alllll trade data and vending machine sales to let you know their order from most to least valuable?
---
Yeah, that doesn't exist hey.
---
You think a bloodied commando build is super rare? Lol you already said it‚Äôs the fucking Meta. And yes I think that a much better way to make the game more challenging is to make it more difficult through gameplay and mechanics. Make bosses feel like bosses and not bullet sponges. Make enemies hit harder so there‚Äôs a danger to fighting them. Tanking damage numbers is weak and lazy. Only a casual would want that. And maybe this will be the thing that finally finishes this game off because from what I‚Äôm seeing in these threads about half the population is too lazy or casual to want to be good so they want everyone else to be bad. That‚Äôs not a good sign.
---
Exactly. That's one reason why I'm extremely hesitant to ever switching from Xbox to PC.
---
Was *thinking* about it but i don't think I'll do that, at tnot until a year from now more or less.
---
Yeah I've been collecting these, and have been meaning to go cash 'em in, but haven't gotten around to it yet. Thanks for the reminder!
---
Drop rate sucks so I guess I got lucky. Still... didn‚Äôt even know it gave badges at all.
---
Its nice to use, but i prefer weapons that allow mods, anti armor for example, so you can save perk points
---
the public teams are cool but people always leave them, like bruh you get free money for other party members completing quests, sure it's only like 20 per quest but still, with all the dailies that adds up pretty quickly.
---
MaNaGe YoUr TiMe BeTtEr!
---
I sense a nuke headed their way
---
Also to use the laying out pose haha
---
If they kept working with obsidian then this wouldnt have happened. Im not a high level so i cant relate the same way, but i played enough to think the story isnt as good as new vegas, and crafting is just a grind when trying to get recipes, or even trying to get thousands of caps for buying recipes from other players just to find out we're capped at 1400 caps per day and are forced to get caps in more tedious ways (finding small amounts of caps on bodies and containers, or hoping a player buys something), and waiting for events so we can have a chance of getting a useful recipe or item thats not leather/raider
---
My GT is MatanzaCueto add me and I'll show you I'm level 477. What "high level players" do you know?
---
Sometimes I can do the quest like 4 times a day so that helps, it just pops up when I log back in or server hop
---
Juicehead also has a good video on it with some of the pros and cons.
---
Except you don't?
---
I mean fucking seriously... the fact that people are already finishing now with weeks to spare and double/bonus events they'll never have to touch should be proof enough of that.
---
I barely grinded the repeatable during the double exp weekend and I'll be hitting rank 100 on Tuesday.  There's what, three or four weeks left in the season?  I could literally take those weeks off, come back the last couple of days and still finish.
---
Why would you lie about your level, im just saying ive never seen any other complaints on this, lol. My brothers TAGs i play a lot with Skulls, Helo....i normally see 2 lobbies and thats it.
---
&gt; Then make the enemies harder and the content more challenging.
---
How exactly? The only way I see them being able to do that would be turning them all into bullet sponges, thereby effectively nerfing *all* weapons. As you'd end up needing more damage to do the same job. 
---
It isn't like they'd be adding weak spots (Grafton Monsters back) or creating dynamic situations where tactics would be needed... No, they'd just add a few extra thousand HP to all mobs and call it a day, end result is your weapon gets nerfed either way.
---
Morgantown
---
Nuking white springs, mostly because there is something funny about nuking the place that gave you nukes.
---
Unfortunately, the only thing that happens when you nuke npc's, is they walk around in hazmat suits. It would be better if there was some devastation. They could even make a quest around it. Rebuild Foundation, atlas, crater, etc.
---
A, so a minmax build? The second best after bloodied? With around 40 of your 56 slots dedicated to damage? I rest my case.
---
I mean I‚Äôd think it would be easy. You up their damage resistance and make them hit harder. You add mechanics in bro the fights to damage check and make sure it‚Äôs not just a hold the trigger fight like the scorchbeast and earl are now. Other mmos do it all the time. Make certain bosses immune to certain attack types at points during the fight. I mean there are infinite ways to make the game harder without nerfing damage. The devs just have to want to.
---
username checks out
---
I agree with you OP. the SCORE awarded should really be about double what it is everyday to really make this managable. As it is the ladder is causing an undue amount of stress and changing the game waaaaaaaay too much in a negative way. All that time that people use to do the SCORE train every day is preventing other things from happening in the game.
---
If it's not rare then your little tirade about working for the optimal build over so much time is moot and you'll easily transition into "new meta" should one take over. 
---
And you can't balance an RNG loot game around optimal loot rolls in a game where each weapon has umpteenth combinations. 
---
Enemies do hit hard if you're not using the plethora of overly tank overly damage producing builds to mitigste it. Ironically both often overlapping. 
---
You want enemies to hit harder for the challenge but not to drop damage numbers drastically yet still want your sense of progression? 
---
Oddly bloodied centric views wouldn't you think? 
---
And guess what. Most of the gamer base starts of casual and decides what game they want to truly deep dive in. It's not your right, nor mine nor anyone elses to decide that because your precious little self decided that they sunk time in that they're entitled to gatekeep and be condescending to players who are new or simply have no desire or means of being HarDCoRe. 
---
You're a walking contradiction and the only thread that makes it not so is your desire to keep your own build and have the world revolve around you and how you play. 
---
I happily welcome the toxicity from Bloodied or Bust disappearing. Despite the Fallout 76 perk system you aren't S.P.E.C.I.A.L and no the game won't dissapear because overinvested  high-level players who find pain in leaving a game that doesn't cater to them and their "easy not rare meta" way anymore. 
---
Things were fine with all the N00Bs at events from the influx of Xbox Gamepass players so ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
level up at level 500 takes a loooooong time.
---
F
---
Thats a really great idea. I can imagine you 'buy it' from Biv. Biv chuckles and its lights out for you.
---
I sell at my camp fixers and Gatling guns for 100 caps lvl 20 and 125 lvl 30. I don't put free stuff anymore as I caught alot of lvl 300+ getting them, to resell maybe. The other day a lvl 250 was syphoning my food , water, junk and ammo wich are unlocked and have a free for noobs  sign. Funny but lower levels do not do that..
---
Which makes the escape from that all the more important in our gaming
---
Yep :) but only after weapon or armor durabilty is below 100%. But improved repair kit can repair a weapon to 150% even if the weapon or armor is still at for example 125% durability. I just wish we could repair weapons and armors up to 200% even if the weapon was above 100%. It's just a pet peeve, but since 'kits can do it I can't see why we players can't do it too :P
---
ive literally never had to group to do rad rumble
---
always 10+ people there chilling
---
i tag a few mobs, gather some ore, rewards flow
---
I've been with the family on the moat isolated vacation we can have with a covid pandemic. I missed three days of dailies. I'm pretty much done playing this. 
---
The 800 stash. Doable if you don't want to run two builds. I would pay $5 for a perma 200 junk or 200 ammo can.  But besides that I haven't really gotten into the quests yet. Ive spent most of my time doing dailies then logging out before reset.
---
Do you have a claim ticket?
---
Your moms bedroom.  I asked her to trim that bush down, but she simply refuses - nuke that sasquatch!
---
I'm not ignoring those people, I just don't see it happen that often. If you kill me for the workshop and actually use it, thumbs up. Good on ya. No hard feelings whatsoever.
---
&gt; I mean I‚Äôd think it would be easy.
---
This is 76 we're talking about. The game where 75% of the time the enemies I encounter are paralyzed and motionless. 
---
Expecting the devs to do anything other than adding some numbers to the HP column is unreasonable, even then I'd expect them to mess up and inadvertently remove HP from players in the process. ;p
---
Yeah, only to get precisely one negligible tweak on next month's pts round like 10 less coins to upgrade a legendary perk to a final rank. Or 1% more damage for exploding palm no one ever asked for.
---
Believe what you want, you're obviously not going to listen to anything I have to say.
---
So like pretty much every online game ever? Balance changes over the lifecycle of any continuously developed game; it is a given. Some companies are crappier at it than others, and it can frustrating as hell at times. But if you're not prepared to deal with that, you're playing the wrong genre of games.
---
The fact that you had an extra NINE HUNDRED damage on your deathclaw gauntlet which was this easily removed just by rebalancing the damage calculations a bit is what is bullshit.  Unarmed melee is probably the best example of the worst offender here because there were just so many stacked damage bonuses that allowed for it to have ridiculous damage.
---
That‚Äôs an excuse I‚Äôm not willing to live with. They dont get a pass at being lazy because they‚Äôve been lazy in the past. There are solid ways to make this game better and more challenging without nerfing.
---
Yeah, Because running a Bloodied build with 804% damage just for having 20% health and using Psyho is so difficult lol.
---
If you're going to jump into as many topics about this as possible and write paragraph after paragraph maybe you need to go take a break.
---
The one that pops up when you install the PTS bro.
---
The fact after 2yrs of this game being out and list like doesn't exist is kinda weird and downvoting just shows you are close minded but take it easy my guy.
---
It absolutely would, but they would have to fix pvp first, because as of right now absolutely no.
---
Not necessarily - Ive got a full set of unyielding SS and some decent bloodied melee (faster swing +1str). I can 1HK pretty much most things.
---
Thing is I dont really enjoy 1HK things - Im using it atm to get XP for legendary run but it doesnt feel like Im fighting things - there's no satisfaction from winning a hard fight, when a max level behemoth dies just as quickly as a min level rad roach. I dont feel "powerful" using it, I feel disappointed.
---
Now for myself, I can control this - once I've hit lv100 in the run I can go back to using a build I enjoy. For others, I dont really care what they're doing when they are off on their own corner of the map. Where it becomes an issue is at events, because this is where players interact. Because having the mini boss die immediately is just......lame.
---
I dont go to free range anymore - it used to be a fun fight against the sheepsquatch. Now its some boring cow herding followed by the sheepsquatch dying instantly. Sure I can get my tap in so I get the xp/legendary, but the fight isnt fun.
---
Same with SBQ - that used to be a fun tough fight. Now you need to be there before the bomb drops because someone will kill her in less than a minute (Im aware this is because of bugged magic weapons more than anything)
---
More difficult enemies?  So what does that mean exactly?  better AI and stronger attacks?  Well those don't mean shit when you have people with stealth builds or blowing their heads off in one shot anyway.  Make them tougher to kill with higher armor values or health?  Well how is that any different from reducing the damage we do to them?  There is no difference, you'd just be bitching that they turned everything into bullet sponges for a different reason.
---
So wait how are we punished for opening card packs?
---
I like my Lone Wandered perk, and the benefits generally don't beat what I get from that.
---
So is that a no to continuing the conversation?
---
And you caring about a downvote, and assuming I'm the one who did it, just shows you are a narcissist "my guy" üòê
---
Apologies for answering your question. It won't happen again
---
Except it doesn't turn everything into bullet sponges. Have you actually played on the pts?
---
Don't so it - unless you really, really need the things at 100. Otherwise buying stuff in the atom store selectively will be much more satisfying.
---
There‚Äôs nothing contradicting about what I‚Äôve said. Finding all the pieces you need to have a min/max build is rare and takes time. That doesn‚Äôt also mean the play style itself ( bloodied commando ) is rare. It just means its rare to have top tier people doing it right. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre not one of those. At least not from your remarks. And you‚Äôre saying I don‚Äôt have the right to say how the game is played but isn‚Äôt that the EXACT thing you‚Äôre trying to tell me?????? Lol and I‚Äôm the contradiction??? 
---
If you think things hit hard then you‚Äôre not playing right. But to make the game challenging without nerfing everyone and overly nerfing the top builds requires them to be even harder. Requires mechanics in boss fights and content that challenges people. This is the way to make this game better not by killing our damage. 
---
Also if you think things are fine with all these new noobs then you haven‚Äôt been the one carrying them through queen fights mate. In fact I‚Äôd bet you‚Äôre one of them.
---
Just lost an SBQ event, I'll take the virgins anyday. Atleast it'll die. Everyone who were there for the bomb drop can easily shoot at it a few times to gurrantee their legendary drop not like it will die in 10 seconds.
---
I just hit level 400. Did you respec to a max XP build? I went with 9 INT, got Inspirational 3, Strange in Numbers, Class Freak 3, and Carnivore, Egghead, and Herd Mentality mutations. Wear full Unyielding, bring HP down to 20%, then eat a Tasty Squirrel Stew and Broiled Scorchbeast Brains. With Carnivore and Strange in Numbers, the bonus from teh squirrel stew becomes 25%, the INT bonus from the brains 7.5. That means raw XP bonus is 40%, and the INT buffs boost the XP gain further.
---
Even teenagers with strictish parents. I‚Äôm only able to play on Friday and weekends and even then, only for a couple hours. I gave up on trying to level it up a few weeks ago, it‚Äôs too tedious and I didn‚Äôt feel like spending every minute of my time on fo76
---
Yes but it‚Äôs also the most risky. You know how rush and reward work right?  To be a bloodied melee you have to be at 30 hp RIGHT IN FRONT of whatever enemy you‚Äôre fighting and usually there are multiples. 
---
I‚Äôve already said that bloodied could use a balance pass. But that isn‚Äôt what they did here. They didn‚Äôt balance anything. They just nerfed EVERYTHING. 
---
Basically instead of bringing bloodied down a little and bringing other things up a little they just said screw it they can all suck together.  This is stupid.
---
I realize this will probably get downvoted here, but have you ever played an mmo before?  If you don't invest the time then you don't get the prize at the end.  Not everyone is going to be able to do it.  Literally every mmo is like this.  There are certain things a casual player is going to have to accept they aren't going to be able to do.  If you think the legendary run is bad just wait til you see legendary perks.
---
Since the last patch my tesla lags me out even after I stop using it. I have to fast travel in and out of the area just to get back to a normal frame rate. I really hope they figure out how to fix it.
---
One line in the sand or uranium fever provides you with 2-3k steel
---
It‚Äôs difficult enough that the casuals can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt do it. And to get your hypothetical ‚Äú804%‚Äù damage would take a shit ton more than just taking a psycho pal. You‚Äôd know that if you played.
---
Ya see fallout 76 is like having sex with minors it feels good but it's not good
---
FO76 isn't an mmo
---
Stronger attacks is a step. But it also means better damage resistance and mechanics in boss fights. It means content that isn‚Äôt just ‚Äú sit in this spot and hold the trigger until the boss dies ‚Äú like the Queen fight is now. That isn‚Äôt a ‚Äú boss‚Äù that‚Äôs just a tanky enemy. 
---
And I don‚Äôt mind bullet sponges to a degree. I mean there are limits to everything. But if it meant no nerf I‚Äôd trade that for a tankier enemy. I think most would too. But it has to be a comprehensive change and Bethesda devs are too lazy for that.
---
Seems console users are actively using grenades to compensate for shitty aiming with controllers. This trend is moving over to pc as well and is quite effective
---
I use an explosive fixer, but I‚Äôve seen people suggest using an Auto grenade launcher as a good method of tagging. There‚Äôs always a huge surplus of 40mm rounds after just one wave
---
As someone who also works fulltime, i fully understand where youre coming from. It sucks, because theres times where you just want to grind the score but at the end of the day, I just accept the fact it that this is free content that I can participate in. It sucks not getting everything, but then again its not really game breaking or detrimental if you choose not to participate in the legendary run.  
---
Best thing to do is just accept the fact that youre not going to complete it and to not pressure on yourself completing it.
---
I'd say they should keep the scrapping to enable us to get rid of cards we don't need. But the incentive to scrap almost everything should be low, as in 1 coin per card, 2 to maybe 10 max coins from levels.
---
When one is young, one has many time but no money to buy game.
---
When one is old, one has much money but no time to play game.
---
You want to explain that?  Cause it's definitely an mmo.
---
Lmao already on the high horse. I have my god rolls having played for longer than I should have. 
---
The only reason bloodied builds advocates are so mad about being a weaker meta is that the accompanying armour sets are a grind to even get the chance to roll them.
---
But apparently you struggle to read with your blind fury about the matter since i already stated so about being a meta build already. 
---
You're not top tier. You're just another one of us high level players with lucky weapons grinded for through RNG rolls. High their sure but the very context of how you use top tier insinuates something more than being dedicated. 
---
Again with the poor comprehension. I said things can hit hard if you're not running meta builds with meta weapons so again. I employee you to take the time and breath. 
---
Get this you can add mechanics and nerf outlier damage. Oddly enough for the builds you again contradictorily stated as "doing it right" there is minimal risk in a bloodied build. 
---
But again as someone who enjoys trying to one shot enemies i wouldn't expect anything less than angry rants from someone who cherry picked which version of "rare" to use. 
---
And no one is telling you to how to play the game lmfao. You're the one projecting that this entire time. I'm just stating why the nerf is valid and reasonable to someone who was literally cursing over and over about their precious build. 
---
I don't care if i need to provide you screenshots of my unyielding and bloodied legendaries. My point still stands. 
---
You're toxic, on a high horse, nonsensical, avoidant of any actual points and pursuant of what you think in your blind rage are counterpoints and all in all-- 
---
You're just having a temper tantrum at players for a dev decision which behold, some players might support.
---
I had to do this mission twice because of an enemy spawn glitch. I havn't played 76 in at least 2 months, but I recommend restarting the mission.
---
Yes - settlers have 1 daily so you may want to side with them because raiders have 2. 
---
There really is no consequences for your actions as they make it seem
---
You‚Äôve missed his point.  The 1 perk coin per level change only works if OP‚Äôs proposed change of the cost to max perks is also adopted.
---
yeah, i haven't even played on the PTS but just from reading i can tell they are going through 2-3 hoops to accomplish 1 trick. they are totally over-complicating things. they need to stop what they are doing and simplify...
---
The punishment is if you‚Äôve already have some perks, there is a chance you‚Äôll get duplicates in the pack and in the current game they are discarded so your expected 4 card pack sometimes results in only 2 cards and for the higher leveled chars they sometimes get 0 cards from a pack.
---
I suggest to have Todd Howard personally knock on my door telling me Feed the People is up each time. 
---
Here‚Äôs to hoping.
---
I‚Äôm not on a high horse or toxic. I am stating my point against someone who has been attacking me since his first post. You don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm top tier or not. But I can share my solo queen kill vids any time. And just because you got lucky and got a good roll doesn‚Äôt mean you know how to use them or have spent the time building around then and maximizing them. 
---
If you want to denigrate me because I am passionate about this that‚Äôs fine I dont really give a shit what you think to begin with as you‚Äôve proven yourself to be a fucking moron. If your happy that now other players will be as low and shitty as you fine. That‚Äôs your right. But dont expect us to be silent about being dragged down with the likes of your casual ass.
---
Shoot, I think I'd actually love a StarCraft battle royale if it added different species/classes to mix up the genre. Imagine fighting as a small pod of zerg with a zergling, hydralisk, and an overseer, and you come upon a trio of protoss zealots duking it out with a marine, a firebat, and a ghost.
---
Seven days to die?
---
Final fantasy 14 uses "light levels" in between expansions, and then bumps up the normal level by 10 each expansion release. Never felt an issue with grinding gear or anything like that.
---
If you dont wanna play every day then... dont ?
---
The challenges are meant to be a bit of fun with some generic fun prizes. You're not missing out if you dont play every day.
---
I feel like I'm fucked because I don't have a bloodied unyiedling high int char. Finishing now is only possible with grinding the repeatable, which means killing lots of high level enemies with high XP, fast.
---
I missed the double score weekend because of a vacation and some days due to work, and I'm somwhere at the beginning of the 3rd chapter. Granted, I don't do NW challenges if they're not stupidly easy, so this may also be a factor.
---
There's a certain level of foolishness though - everyone that saw the toughest enemies being killed in 1 shot, knew that it would be nerfed. Especially as it did massively more damage than every other build. When and how it would be nerfed was unknown, but it was clearly going to be.
---
Sure, there's plenty who decided to ride that wave while it lasted, but if you genuinely spent hundreds of hours building up kit for a full bloodied build without being aware that at some point the brakes would be put on then thats pretty naive.
---
yep- have given up on finishing that quest
---
always show both sides of the medal.
---
damage buffs are greatly nerfed, also enemys are greatly buffed.
---
I legit didn't know you could turn them in. Good thing I kept all of 'em, being the absolutely mad hoarder that I am.
---
Link seems broken
---
and a work bench for scrapping :)
---
I went with 246 steel (didn't count just scrapped heaps), couldn't find a bench to scrap anything else so just left with my steel lol.
---
If you‚Äôre sneak build it makes little difference.
---
&gt;I understand exactly what the changes do and still think it‚Äôs bullshit. Losing 156 dps on my fixer is bullshit. Losing 911 dps on my bloody deathclaw is bullshit. 
---
There‚Äôs nothing reasonable about nerfs. Nerfs are the lazy dev way instead of actually doing a balance pass and buffing things that could use it. Make the enemies tougher more challenging. Make content more challenging. Buff builds that are useless or under performing. These are all good changes I and most top tier players can get behind.  But a wholesale nerf to damage output isn‚Äôt it chief.
---
You're not passionate you're an angry fellow with an axe to grind because he grinded for a specific meta and is mad at having to adapt. People have all throughout this thread made valid points to possible adjustments and you've done nothing but continue your little rant about:
---
Noobs and SBQ helping and proper builds and just buff around MY meta and don't tell me how to play and I'll tell you how the game should be balanced for me. 
---
Again go take your high horse to the stables because it's clearly chaffed your ass enough for you to be delusional about not being on one. And while your at it you and the "us" of bloodied meta crew can continue having a sook.
---
Contrary to your belief i don't care if you keep going. Speak your mind just expect others to do so to believe it or not. 
---
But hey what would a fucking moron and noob like me know about not being a condescending wet lampshade. Especially considering the absolute whirlwind of unlinked points you tried to make somewhere along the line.
---
Oh no you're right. It's 807% with Adrenaline. 
---
20% x3 for perk cards.
---
15% from Bloody Mess.
---
80% from Bloodied at 20%
---
50% from Adrenal Reaction at 20%
---
20% from Nerd Rage.
---
25% from Psychobuff.
---
60% from Adrenaline.
---
Swapping perk cards.... so difficult and challenging only the greatest of champions could do something so ELITE as clicking.
---
Thanks to how DR works it's actually even more damage than that. About 17x more total damage than a weapon without modifiers against 300 DR.
---
Link is broken.
---
For the PTS to be on Steam, XBox, or PlayStation, it would have to be handled as an update and go through reviewing by Valve, Microsoft, or Sony. By keeping the PTS to the Bethesda Launcher, guess what? Nothing has to be reviewed. Bethesda owns the game and the platform. They can just do it. It‚Äôs time efficient, and if they need to change anything on the PTS, they can just do it. I don‚Äôt see how them doing that is gross.
---
Regardless, it is still an exploit, so there's really nothing to cry about...Can't just pick and choose which exploits are left in the game and which are removed.
---
Yeah noticed as soon as I posted. I think I've fixed it now
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eaqio1pAEW0
---
I think people are too busy applauding the "lol bloodied got worse" part to realize this affects *literally everyone*.
---
Granted, there are some benefits and merits, but coming alongside a different change that makes enemies bulkier? Anything short of optimized bloodied/junkie, legacy weapon spam, or hacked/bugged weapon spam is going to take even longer to deal with enemies. Just look at how bad melee got hit.
---
Part of it is just how jarring it is, but honestly... As a optimized Bloodied Heavy main, I'm not worried about my damage. There's not much difference between using 1 Ultra 50 round and using 2 to kill an enemy. The combination of the damage changes and One Wasteland just makes it even harder on people trying to make their off meta builds work.
---
If they're going to go through with the damage change, they really need to dial back enemy bulk. That is, assuming they want to make the game less grueling and grindy. Which means the changes will get shipped as is üôÉ
---
Should be fixed now
---
That‚Äôs literally every MMO. Star Trek Online is that. Elder Scrolls Online. WoW. For the past few weeks, I‚Äôve been playing a lot more FNV, FO4, and TF2. I can go to 76 right now and do my ‚Äúchores‚Äù without them feeling like chores because I‚Äôm not forcing myself to get burnt out on 76. Just set the game down for a bit until something gets added.
---
Yup! It‚Äôs working now! Sometimes the strangest things happen out in the wasteland
---
To be fair, given how Shannon Rivers was treated, Fallout society was very patriarchal.  They probably weren't allowed to wear pants often.
---
I hate it so much lol
---
I was going to drop them in person to the lowlevs so that way it doesn't get abused.
---
Riflegaming is that arsehole that griefs players on a number of occasions for "content". 
---
I thought his earlier content on what if you nuke X location was decent but once he started nuking people's camps for the high crime of charging prices higher than he was happy with, I moved on. Better content from better people out there.
---
Maybe he wears the suit to avoid losing bits of himself?
---
Like you know when you put an apple in a sandwich bag, chuck it in your work bag and forget about it for a month?
---
Maybe he's the hypothetical apple in a sandwich bag. If he removed the suit he would disintegrate.
---
Yes, I‚Äôd love to see a headless, handless, legless ratty skirt running around, since the suit is what makes the things *under* it invisible.
---
I agree with everything tpoint you made
---
Yes. But just the base veteran ranger, not the elite, advanced, riot, or desert variants. Which is fine for me, since I think the original is the best anyway.
---
lol I thought I was the only one who wanted that
---
Lmao, again.
---
At level 70 I'm swimming in (Known) plans.
---
I had been just dropping them in random suitcases at train stations but with the 'buy or sell 3' daily challenge, I've started putting them in vendor for 1 cap each. 
---
Had a level 21 stop by and bought 17 plans and started doing the heart emote and thumbs up. 
---
I went to my stash and pulled out the level 25 full auto Handmade I'd used from 25-35 and dropped it for him but he pulled out a ski sword and gave the thumbs up emote again before running off.
---
I finished 4 weeks ago you really don‚Äôt need to log in everyday
---
Yes you can, if an exploit doesn't make the game easier than tell me why it should be removed other than "it's an exploit" tell me why the exploit is bad
---
I finished like two weeks ago - barely did any grinding over the double XP weekend, bought like two levels. I just did every daily and weekly, maybe missing two of the NW ones.
---
We still have a month to go.
---
Are we sure the hat isn't just the unique combat helmet appearance you get while wearing the outfit?
---
Because I feel like that's probably it.
---
It's gonna go live and it'll be fine.
---
Yeah I do felt that the rewards in season 1 were nice but some of the stuff felt like there was to much filler or missed opportunities like instead of 25 gold bullion make it 100  I dunno.
---
There‚Äôs a unique combat helmet you get when wearing it?
---
That just sounds like the combat helmet appearance you get when wearing it, no?
---
Plastic is everywhere. All those anti-freeze and various plastic bottles, toys, plates, etc. Pumpkin buckets all over. But to be more specific, Watoga high school has a lot of plastic in the plates and pumpkin buckets all over the school.
---
Reminds me at stalker clear sky would be fun to see them fight each other while you walk by.
---
You wouldn‚Äôt wear a skirt in the Wasteland. Or youd get Raids.
---
Watoga high school is full of plastic
---
Did something "similar"
---
I'm in my public party and I get a pm on my Xbox that my level 30ish teammate is being griefed by two dudes level 70-80. They followed him around taking every workshop he claimed. 
---
So I go and find them and eviscerated them with my anti-armor explosive gauss mini. Took their loot in revenge of my Ally. What dobi find? 100s of rare junk and flux.. made my night üòÇ
---
No it won't and no it will not be. Did you even read what I said?
---
I don't need a reason, and neither does Bethesda. They removed an exploit, something that wasn't supposed to be done is now unable to do; what's your problem? 
---
Tell me why you should be allowed to exploit flaws in the games coding, just because it's fun? 
---
Stop crying over a patched exploit, it's childish and unsightly.
---
&gt; Besthesda is about to destroy this game with the damage "rebalance" 
---
Lol! You doomsayers are just adorable sometimes.
---
It'll be fine. The game will still go on. You'll still have the meta build relative to the others as the damage nerf is fairly proportional across the board. 
---
&gt; Please everyone. Make posts and gave your voices heard. 
---
People have. You're just on the losing side of this issue sadly.
---
Yeah there are quite a few idiots like that
---
&gt; would take a shit ton more than just taking a psycho pal
---
You mean a nukashine?
---
If it‚Äôs not so hard why doesn‚Äôt everyone do it instead of crying about it? Lol and you‚Äôre making a lot of assumptions. What if someone doesn‚Äôt have the adrenaline cards or adrenal reaction or use psychobuffs?
---
Ever been to a Scorched Earth event that failed because you weren't able to do enough DPS?
---
Ever spent 6000+ rounds of ammo only to get nothing for it?
---
That happens when only a few players show up to take down the Queen. 
---
All this suggestion does is make it much more likely that you'll fail every attempt at the queen, since players would end up being spread out between various events that start at the same time. 
---
Instead, I suggest a 'chain reaction' event. 
---
Upon successfully defeating the Queen, a new event will begin that takes place in the same area. Every time an event is completed it leads to a new one and if you complete all 6 events within a set time (before the nuke dissipates), you get better rewards.
---
I also agree that that they could add five star legendary guns and people would still not be happy but hey I do like them chickens
---
I believe Bethesda adjusted the requirement to 65 million
---
Both high schools, plus put on scrapper and run west tek. The laser guns some mutants use is like 8-10per
---
It won't be. It will be far more challening and grindy. Im sure you saw the angry turtle video and was soothed by his claiming voice into thinking its all sunshine and lollipops. I can assure you its not sir. It won't come to pass and if it does there will be a mass exodus the likes of which not even todd can predict
---
Lol it‚Äôs Bethesda nuff said
---
Nukashine does nothing for a commando or any other gun build.
---
This is not nerf this is rework and also this is mmo game.Things will change this is not happening in gamig industry for the first time If you are not ready for it and you shouldnt play online games
---
Little late, have you seen the perk coin rage
---
I understood about half of that
---
Agreed but we all know why they restricted us to so few atoms that we can gain for free anyways so I kinda gave up on the idea of not atoms
---
I run a unarmed character &amp; if they don't look at rebalancing my powefist damage, then ill just swap to shotguns. Overall I think it's a good change.
---
The point is that someone who plays 1 hr a day, every day should be equal to someone who plays for 7hrs on a sat.
---
They both play 7hrs a week.
---
However the 7hrs on a sat guy will be massively behind the 1hr a day guy because of how the challenges work.
---
The liquor would be proud.
---
Its not good at all. There is so much more that they need to fix but instead they're literally destroying the game. How does nobody else see this! It took me months to get my build right and for me to get good weapons. This is stupid !
---
I really want a junkies fancy single action, I've turned in just a few short of 200 tickets now, and haven't gotten a single fancy gun yet. :&lt;
---
These would be great but I feel it‚Äôs a little too advanced for Bethesda. Just look at the game now
---
Mainly hoping at West tek. Or hitting events like awol and hoards
---
I run the same build. There should be a game rebalance and this is the right direction, but.. pts was rough af. Downloaded it because I was bored. Close combat felt normal. Anything past a slight distance, level 100, took multiple mags (2-4). It felt better to run into melee range than waste time shooting at a distance. Stealth/crit damage felt non-existent. 
---
Then I met new raid boss. Level 100, 1 Star, SB. Unkillable, killing machine. Tried about 10 times before logging. I run the tanky version too. If serendipity didn‚Äôt block it, instant death, even mid-air screeches. Don‚Äôt think I got it past 50% hp. Felt like I was soloing SBQ, except I was dying lol.
---
That legendary meat will tast so goo in a deep fryer its finger likin good
---
Hey, you got me curious, I use a LA AA3325, plus 3 star tank killer. am I not getting full penetration? (waits for 3000 dick jokes)
---
Because people like variety? I hate the low health play style so I don't do it. That's some pretty awful reasoning.
---
Also, Seriously? The only time getting all these damage modifiers matters is at endgame. At that point you can get all of those with little to no effort.
---
If your reasoning for all that is about hitting 100% mathematically possible damage as soon as possible you have some messed up priorities. Of course your "Elitist" attitude makes that apparent.
---
cannot remove the mental image of my character literally shooting her arms away
---
&gt; It won't come to pass and if it does there will be a mass exodus the likes of which not even todd can predict 
---
HAHAHAHA
---
See! Utterly adorable. People have said this over and over throughout the game's life and there hasn't been a mass exodus.
---
But please, feel free to prove me wrong when the changes go live.
---
My theory is that right now they can't power creep the game anymore. Everyone at the endgame is so powerful that adding new weapons is meaningless. By doing this they, first of all make it easier to predict how your buffs and perks work (ie when it says it boosts your dmg by 10% it actually does just that) and second it leaves room for new and more powerful weapons we can grind for.
---
I do fell like with all this leveling up its to much grind when I reached level 50 on all four characters it was fun and I got to try out different builds now it seems like everything goes out the window to make it easier to get to that next level where I‚Äôll get a perk point I‚Äôll never use. Actually scratch that the way these legendary perks are looking I‚Äôll need it

Best way to get tons of plastic quickly imo.
---
I'm sorry to hear about your loss dude. He was lucky to have you as a friend by the looks of it. Hope that gives you some small amount of comfort.
---
1. It's all deflected. At full points it gives you an 18% chance to avoid ranged damage completely which is actually really powerful - really underrated perk.
---
2. Haven't really paid attention but guess it would, it doesn't take too much health at all but enough to balls up your instigating if you run them weapons.
---
This is great! What a touching way of honoring your friend's memory. I love visiting camps and seeing all the effort others put into their places. If I saw this in I'm sure I'd cry!
---
Yeah I just want the original for the trench coat so I can wear it with my deathclaw mask lol thanks so much :)
---
I like the dailies because I am new to the game, but dear God, they're gonna just get old.
---
I really appreciate when players that have the ability to destroy her in seconds wait until the "Legendary enemy has mutated" notification pops up before they unload on her. You all have my gratefulness and respect.
---
Im on XB and when fighting the Queen, my fixer never does any damage to her when using VATS. The damage number come up and everything, but no damage. I have to do manual aiming for her otherwise i end up doing no damage ( even tho each headshot gives about 340 damage )
---
Ive tried to leave VATS and enter again like people have mentioned, but doesnt work for me.
---
Can we scrap the whole perk system entirely and rework it? It's silly to need to swap cards out for lockpicking and hacking. Non combat cards shouldn't take slots.
---
How about .50 for sniper rifle? .38 is easier to find but harder to craft.
---
I think OP means NPCs from those factions. Not Players. Regardless it would be great.
---
The legendary perk card system is fine it's just ppl not wanting to put in the effort to level the perks
---
Wow. I never noticed that. I always assumed the card I got a dupe for was still there just waiting to be upgraded...
---
The ultra rares
---
* tattered field jacket 
---
* leather coat 
---
* traveling leather coat
---
* asylum worker uniform red 
---
* forest camo jump suit 
---
. And that's about it for me lol I hold no value to any other clothing items.
---
There was. When tse got nerfed shittons of ppl left. They won't go live either. But if they do, enjoy your peashoote rifle and squishy toy hammer weapons!You supported this man.
---
And nobodies saying you have to play low health if you can‚Äôt do it. But dont fuck my low health build up because you don‚Äôt want to play it. 
---
That‚Äôs my reasoning. They didn‚Äôt have to nerf anything. They could have buffed other builds and made the game and bosses more challenging. That‚Äôs the point.
---
I would love a legendary modification bench where we could swap out one perk for another even though the hackers would probably make some crazy 10 star gun that would be sent to the Duper for real money who would dupe and sell it for a ridiculous price thus the way of the market. We can dream tho
---
I don‚Äôt have a life 
---
Can no longer work but couldn‚Äôt agree more. I kinda lost interest a lil. Maybe more than cuz I had about 2300 hours before that update and after is like 200 ‚Äîapprox. I‚Äôve been playing all my other games I ignored for the last year. And I think about jumping back in but then I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm super disappointed cuz I enjoyed working towards atoms and I gave them so many props for allowing players to earn the atoms to spare kids and parents the extra costs. Now just dunno. Rather play FO4. Especially w all the fun mods u can use in survival mode. Almost the same as 76 but better in lotta ways. No other players to ruin it or crash game. But that‚Äôs also the boring part.
---
I've played for more than 3000 hours, so I know about putting time in. I understand if they don't address unarmed, which I think will be changed by extra perk cards, that it does suck &amp; possibly makes them not viable. But I'm an Xbox player so all I go by is the pts forums &amp; some people are doomsayers &amp; some are in favour. What ever they do not everyone is always going to be happy.
---
I think they should add unarmed damage perks to bring them in line with everything else 9 points total required to give you 60% more damage, just like everything else. That's what I'm expecting them to do.
---
Cool glitch.
---
See that's more helpful than a drop rate, I'm more interested in what people wantt than were it drops and how often.
---
You of all people should be totally against this then lol.
---
Did they though? Do you have any proof?
---
Was he still classed as an enemy so you couldn't fast travel ? 
---
Did you run away or put him out of his misery lol
---
Thanks to the chem backpack I don't give a fuck about the capacity mod from the scouts now. Thank Todd as I was stuck on 2 badges for like 6 months. Still am. Cleaned up so... Much.... Goop....
---
&gt;Thats what happens when you make an mmo with a decade-old engine made for single player games.
---
The creation engine / gamebryo is actually built off NetImmerse, which was originally designed for online MP games.
---
Those are the only outfits that can fetch anything decent, except the traveling coat, most people reject it simply because it isn't the normal leather coat. Also forgot the responder fireman outfit.
---
I absolutely would if I could. I'm not in the testing server but I also refuse to sit idly by while Bethesda implements yet another far-fetched idea with zero thought put into it.
---
Raising a fuss on Reddit is the best I can do. The more people who speak out about this, the better.
---
I mean yea. Ask anyone. Many left after it got nerfed. Same with dupe waves. People don't like this man. Youre actively supporting your weapons being made impotent and having enemies made far stronger. Idk if youre doing to "epically own those nerdy bloodied builds" or if youre that type of vindictive person who hates fun, but this affects us all including you
---
Glad I quit playing this game to be honest. It was fun while there was story content to do, but seeing the fuck ups every week just wears you down. Big oof Beth
---
games like this need an AI quest generator wich keeps on recreating and getting better each time
---
I feel like Bethesda already but its losses soon after launch when they realized how bad of a failure this game is compared to fo4.
---
You can tell by the swift change in direction to a "squeeze as much money out of the playerbase" model soon after beta ended.
---
They had *tons* of feedback that the Fasnacht event literally would not work at all, and they ignored it all until, sure enough, it did not work at all.
---
They should never be given the benefit of the doubt.
---
Well, there *was*, but it looks like it was changed whenever they updated the outfit to show backpacks. [You can find references to it on the subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g2n3si/veteran_outfit_bug_involving_combat_armour_helmet/)
---
If I'm right and that's what the correct model was supposed to be, it was a pretty unflattering piece of headwear - like an overly tight black hood. I wouldn't be surprised if it's taken them so long to address because it was so... underwhelming.
---
I appreciate the information and help in the right way.
---
Speak for yourself. The game is boring as fuck and clearly broken with the way damage is currently calculated. Something needs to be done, I'm looking forward to this.
---
Or maybe you shouldn't assume others intentions. 
---
Perhaps that full event team was 4 irl friends that were strategizing how they were going to do 'x' 'y' and 'z' after their silo run. 
---
Perhaps they were waiting for 2 of the team members to get back from being AFK and then just decided so much time had passed they'd skip that event. 
---
Maybe they'd been running events non stop for 4 hours and had taken a break to restock on supplies. 
---
Maybe you have no way of knowing *why* they weren't running events, so you shouldn't get so bent out of shape over it.
---
That's a bit sad. Learning weapons mods from scrapping is imposible if the weapons change on kill.
---
Overseers house. The ultimate in self absorption is leaving diaries about yourself across a whole state making other people find and listen to that inane bullshit. 
---
Bitch needs to pay the price.
---
I think I've been really fortunate - I've only once had someone shoot me in the back over a workshop but that was during a daily and all I was doing was for my challenge. Someone came to contest and shot me. If he'd have waited 1 min I'd have messaged him to say take it dude, I'm done.
---
I bought FO1st for the private servers when I was running with my gatling lasers and needed the cores. There was no way I would set up a generator in a main lobby. Not worth fighting for.
---
Play stupid games.... Win stupid prizes....
---
I understand you want to be more rewarded the more effort you put in, just like how people say berserker's should get a buff. 
---
HOWEVER, you cannot balance group content around weapons that make you godlike and one shot everything. 90% of the time in a group setting enemies won't even be able to use any mechanics, yet what do the devs balance the game to? Bloody build, nocturnal?
---
 Well if they balance it for anything but unyielding bloody enemies will be too easy and just melt, while making it insanely hard for everyone else. The gap between low and high level will also be even wider, completely breaking certain parts of the game, like PVP for example.
---
In the end the devs themselves had said they want to make damage boosts more "predictable" so they can make damage happen in a certain range for group gameplay to design it to be more challenging. With the ability to multiply your damage time and time again by stacking abilities, makes you far too beyond to even balance for when no other build has these kind of gains. 
---
IT's a nightmare to balance around there is no way they can balance the game for lesser builds and not make it too easy for the vast majority of players who use bloody at endgame. 
---
Not only does it get in the way of new builds and itemazation since everything will have to meet the standard of bloodied but also it increases gains too much for weapons to be balanced with each other making certain weapons 100% completely outclassed as well as outclassing other players and making older areas too easy and melting too much of the game's content in single shots from a 1.1k DMG gauss rifle.
---
It's impossible to implement game mechanics that the group must contend with when the enemies don't even last long enough to do those mechanics. That's not balanced or challenging. 
---
Bloodied will still be the best even according to the new calculation, but now everything will be within reach of it and allow new item effects, better itemazation and possible new future build diversity if all the damage builds are around the same damage threshhold they seek to design new bossfights arounds and other new content.
---
It 2would be great. So often I get a notification "reclaim your workshop: defeat the molerats" I mean logically what the hell do molerats need with fusion cores and lead?
---
awesome blog, subscribed!
---
Hey man I personally enjoy destroying enemies with op gear. Its fun asf for me. If you wanna have boring peashooter weapons be my guest, but don't force the entire community to have the weapons they traded for for months become impotent and bad because you're bored lol
---
I would say do Riding Shotgun, you are going to get 1 legendary for sure at level 50, but I have had runs of the event where I end up with 3-5 legendary enemies spawning in, all level 50 at the lowest. It is a dice roll and more often than not you will just get the 1 blood eagle captain, but it is still a good event to run.
---
If you have a legendary with explosive bullets or a tesla rifle, you can tag them easily.
---
It‚Äôs really weird, I had this super awesome tse handmade way back in the day did 591 damage without sneak and a drum mag held a shit load of bullets. Guess what? It got nerfed so hard it only does 192 damage now, and the mag holds way less bullets. What happened, you ask? I didn‚Äôt riot in the streets. Nor did I angrily quit, no pissed off letters were sent to Bethesda. I simply kept playing the game. If you don‚Äôt like the upcoming changes or feel it will make things too ‚Äútough‚Äù for you. I would quit, don‚Äôt post about it either. Nobody cares.....
---
The only thing they'd listen to is if their player base would drop pretty much to zero. Bethesda is a shitty company and they (surprise, surprise that's how our world works). Just care for money and that's also the only force that would drive them to so any shit.
---
&gt; Monster Mash
---
Just curious why you skip this one? I ran it last night and got 9 legendaries from it!
---
It might be the part in the institute where you can't get out after fighting your way back to the start.  You see the quest marker to go up but can never get there.
---
Could have been. I stopped by that camp earlier and left in disgust. Didn‚Äôt even bother checking all their vendors.
---
Ok smart guy but this isn't just gonna affect one category of weapons. Everyone gets fucked over. Especially casuals like me that don't wanna spend a million years grinding for stuff. Again, speak for yourself
---
What about a shotgun axe though...
---
Splash damage is what you want - any explosive weapon is great for it. 
---
On my main I use a two shot explosive combat rifle - one pull of the trigger and everything is tagged :) On my alt I have a pretty basic explosive shotty - not as good as my TSE but still works well. 
---
Stay away from energy weapons - the ash and goo piles mess with getting the loot. And yeah, Tesla seems to turn it in to a lag fest.
---
I‚Äôve tried the PTS and sure, it‚Äôs still playable with bloodied commando. But now it takes half a mag without VATs (torso shots) to kill a lvl 75 supermutant with my bloodied handmade.
---
I can‚Äôt imagine how bullet spongey the enemies will be with a full health build...
---
They‚Äôve gone from Bloodied being OP to bloodied being the only viable build...
---
If management says no, it's NO. Management usually doesn't really understand what is actually going on. All they see is profit.
---
I found plenty. The usual swarm at the golf...pro...place clubhouse and the regular wander-abouts.
---
same build, and on a quiet night you can hear me screaming like crazy, vats does not target at all, vats targets furthest creature away and swings you 30 degrees, vats shoots damages and nothing happens, I was doing campfire tales and seriously 2-3 bullets for every bug IF vats hits. 
---
VATS CRITS MISSING!!!
---
Only consolidation is once you do hit and gun fu is working, not a single miss.
---
Yesterday I joined an event team that was truely amazing. We did literally EVERY event that popped up, even if it was small ones. 4 hours straight. It was really fun playing  a events team like its supposed to be played.
---
This. There are maybe 3-5 things i really want from the legendary run. If you don‚Äôt plan on finishing it, I would just buy up to the last reward you really want. 
---
Of course, some levels award Atoms, a thing to consider.
---
Have you tried unequipping concentrated fire?  I only seem to have the glitch when using that perk.  I know it's not ideal but I've found it better than just missing all the time.
---
Jim!  I told you me and your father were taking your phone away the next time we caught you acting rough online.  We know you're mad Sarah at school doesn't like you but you can't keep lashing out like this!
---
Thing is though, yeah most of the time it's less than an hour (unless you get a stupid NW one), but it means you end up playing something you didn't mean to for most of that hour - going out of your way to find a particular enemy type, or switching to a new character to get an easy level up, or going into battle just to plop down 3 camps and then back out.
---
It's not "play your game for an hour and it's done".  It's "play a slightly different game for an hour to get it done, before you can play what you actually wanted."  Luckily for me I can play more than an hour a day, but from this thread clearly there are some who can't.
---
Still, making it weekly is clearly the answer, everyone is saying so, we shall see if Beth really do listen.
---
Like I put up above, Exponential growth doesn't scale well with how DR works. The point of making most sources of damage additive is to establish parity. It creates a position to work from for future balancing.
---
There's so many different weapons with different amounts of damage and rates of fire that it'd be impossible to manage them if they kept exponential growth.
---
Because of all that they *can't* just buff the other builds to parity because they'd have to add multiple sources of bonus damage for every single playstyle.
---
They can't just make enemies harder either. If they mess with DR it has the exact opposite effect. Where Bloodied builds barely get hurt at all, but all other builds get massive damage.
---
Feel free to shit on Bethesda and the like... 4 different studios they have Frankensteining this game together as much as possible. They deserve it, but by making everything additive they can actually make changes to individual builds without risking it make them implode/explode.
---
If after like 1-2 weeks they haven't had a tuning pass on the actual numbers of each build then they deserve every ounce of vitriol you have.
---
The major story content should last people around a few weeks. Playing casually exploring all the minor story contents will last you around a few months. Yea it‚Äôs normal to be bored after that, it‚Äôs a mmo after all.
---
For one, nobodies one shorting bosses. That‚Äôs a myth. And it‚Äôs not impossible to balance the game around higher end builds. Other MMOs do it. You simply have to make the content harder. Make the bosses harder. Use mechanics in content to force players to strategize and work together. Make multiple boss fights. I just think these are much better options to nerfing things.
---
Real talk, if ESO has taught me anything it's *WAIT UNTIL THE FINAL ROLLOUT*. Same parent company (Fukn ZoS) and very similar things happening (our multiplicative stacking went to flat numbers however it not only serviced balancing iirc but server stability around some shit with computations and having to calculate everyone's levels etc... I dont understand it I'm a dumbass but it smacks of the same changes). 
---
Some shit doesn't leave PTS and some things even end up buffed contrary to notes. Some things get overturned completely also.
---
Once the nerf hammer actually strikes is when to get fucked off or not. Give it some time.
---
How is it an exploit if it provides no gameplay advantages
---
Well darn, then I pass my magic wand on to a benevolent dragon on Xbox, someone w FO1st give this King a run on a private server to complete the blood sample analysis I beseech thee.
---
I will meanwhile sit in the corner and hold my breath for a fix from Bethesda because this is a pretty darn gamebreaking problem and I want to have faith it will be addressed soon(ish)...but just in case I turn blue and pass out the corner will keep me from hitting my head you see.
---
So what I'm hearing is a week where as many people as we can gather just don't play
---
They 'bout to see some loss real soon
---
Well they said they were adding something for pvp later. Although I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath because it‚Äôs Bethesda. I just played crucible(pvp) in destiny 2 and it really does help in terms of motivation to play the game
---
Yeah I really don't understand why it has to be so convoluted.  Why are normal perk cards involved at all?
---
it's your fault for having jobs and kids /s
---
Yes, someone should have a word with the devs of "life" to make it fairer.  They should be listening to their users.
---
That's how they sell the servers, only reason there even is PvP still I swear
---
What do you mean with the 3rd point?
---
They already ruined the game for me with the brotherhood update and I‚Äôm not very happy with the new weapons I would have liked i Chinese pistol or something other than the gauss weapons I like the gauss weapons but more would have been better but hey it‚Äôs Bethesda and the legendary run is too needy I would have rather bought most of the stuff from the atom shop tbh
---
...in the process of moving toward you to rip your head off!
---
But damage resistance tuning can make the game more of a challenge which is what everyone is saying is the reason for the nerf. 
---
And as I‚Äôve said they can tune bloodied without killing 50% of its damage output. Maybe make the bonus for being at 20% health 50% instead of 100# while leaving the multiplicative perk cards active. That‚Äôs at least an option they could do which would still have the effect of toning bloodied down while not nerfing other builds. That in concert with enemy tuning would have a better effect in my opinion.
---
That's nothing in fo76 only I get a blue screen telling me I can't continue to play that I  have to  uninstall and reinstall the game.  This past week 3x a day.  Forced to do the reinstall just to rince and repeat the next day
---
If you think Steam has a huge quality assurance process you're insane, on top of which Bethesda could easily just make a separate game client for you to download like a lot of games do, or even make an opt in beta branch again which a lot of games do on Steam.
---
Two options.
---
1. Stop people from giving them money.
---
2. Cause a massive enough fuss that it gets widespread attention and risks making them lose money in some way.
---
I don't know about anyone else but with some of the performances I've seen in public events like Encryptid are the cabbages we all know and love in public server ready for raid content and tougher enemy?
---
I've launched nukes recently after checking a server full of Lvl 100-300's only to see some wack shit and a half hour SBQ fight.
---
maybe make it a bullion item/untradable?
---
Yeah that would help hopefully they do add something but at this point who knows where they want to take this game towards.
---
Jup, that's when the game will probably change for the better. I don't imagine and I don't want to imagine that the developers hate their own game. They most likely would want it to be good but have too little resources. 76 still has the potential to become a fantastic game, it's just not utilized.
---
Shame your post is getting downvoted for making valid points. 
---
Yes, practically all enemies are a joke but like you mention, you play the game to become stronger. Starting out and before getting a good build together (weapons, perks, gear), enemies could potentially pose a threat. After dedicating the time to obtain said weapons, perks, and gear, the enemies should be much easier. Nerfing (especially after SO long) is not the appropriate way to fix this. 
---
If everyone feels similar, then people will get bored. Also, there will almost always be a "meta" build. It is extremely difficult to completely balance a game and as I previously mentioned, if it all feels the same then people will become bored. Of course, people will complain no matter what; that's just how things are for everything in life. You can't please everyone.
---
I'm a bloodied build myself and have spent roughly 700 hours building it. I actually don't play anymore but I do consistently stay updated because if they release actual decent endgame content, I'd return. It would be a shame to see them nerf my 700 hours of gameplay trying to optimize my build. As you mention, there are other viable setups. Bloodied isn't the only one. It's just arguably the best. 
---
Trying to balance this now after two years is a bad approach honestly. It's spitting in people's face who have spent hundreds, if not thousands, of hours working toward a very specific setup. It should have been done shortly after release. The only way I could see a true fix with minimal complaints would be to leave it alone.
---
Instead, release true endgame content. Dungeons, raids, missions, etc... Content that is better suited for repeatability and more engaging than SBQ for instance. Release 4 and 5 star weapons and gear. Add new prefix's. Bump up the existing prefix's so they're better balanced with the "meta" builds like bloodied or junkie's. 
---
It would be like starting fresh (how expansions are for true MMOs) but without disregarding all the work and time people spent creating their builds. If a specific build is outperforming majority of the other builds, then they could swiftly balance it out before so much time and energy has passed. 
---
I would love to see a lot more variety but with the current state of the game and the content it offers... why even bother trying to balance it out by nerfing something that has been around since launch? There really is no point to it. Release new content and start fresh I say.
---
More people would be using this perk if two pieces of Acrobat armor weren't the only way to get fall damage immunity outside of power armor.
---
Me and my friend discovered that if you leave the area and then come back you'll be able to find meat piles where they'd fallen. 
---
Granted this was on a private server, so we didn't have to worry about anyone else looting them first. 
---
We nuked WS and cleared it out, had 4 legends fall into the ground before we could loot them but after fast travelling to camp and back, the meat piles had returned.
---
Nope, how else will players continously grind the oh so fun daily content that has no faults at all whatsoever?
---
give the 100 and a wedding ring with the promise of more. before you know it you wake up one morning naked with one bobby pin and a note. in a dark room with a locked door and a horde of hungry dogs on other side :D note says: i left you this one bobby pin because it will break next time its used. just like the first one you gave me that you said never broke on you. but atleast you dont have too face the dogs tata. Alternativly could work out and be sunshine and  a bunch of tinys that also wants bobby  pins.
---
Maybe a chair I can sit in, have a few beers, play my hologames, hell maybe even a gambling table so people have a reason to chill at your camp (house always wins though)
---
I‚Äôm not even a working adult and I know I won‚Äôt get all the rewards. It takes AT LEAST 5 hours of continuous daily grinding to get anywhere close to 100 tiers. I‚Äôm hoping the next season makes the SCORE system much easier to collect and more daily challenges.
---
Exactly
---
I have a friend on Xbox who‚Äôs level 25 he could probably use it I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs too high or not
---
Totally unrelated but have you guys had issues with the mirelurk kings? They have been killing me in seconds,  same with my gf. It took us both multiple attempts to kill a three star run (I was even in power armor) and it never used to be like that. I last longer out of power armor against a sheepsquatch. They (mire kings) seem to have way too much health and dmg since the patch. Is it just me?
---
Protest in the streets. Call you senator. Learn about the candidates before you vo... Oh wrong subreddit. I confuse ones passion for games with a passion for a better society and governance.
---
Best bet now would be doing the glitched line in the sand event, people who use the text chat mod always call out the big events on their servers to share.
---
I'm really hoping it becomes another ESO story where the first few years were rocky and then it got really good. 
---
Literally all this game needs (aside from less bugs) is more story content. That'd solve so much of the dissatisfaction in the game. There's like... 5 quest lines in the game. All we need is more stories to play through! They don't have to be crazy! I did the Mistress Of Mystery and REALLY enjoyed it because it was a new story. Even just short things like that, but a LOT more of them. Buuuuut they'd rather focus on grind and events that are fun twice
---
Maybe a relative of Grahm? I mean those biceps are exactly alike!
---
I‚Äôd settle for the ability to turn off an ally‚Äôs dialogue. If I have to hear about lights in the night sky again ...
---
Okay boys who's gunna start this campaign
---
You might want to wait with cashing in those claim tickets until the BOS collection event calls for cloth (Aug 31 - Sep 3). Pleasant Valley claim tickets also get you a *lot* of pre-war money, which scraps into cloth.
---
So, you're going from "it's an exploit but it's not a bad one so what's the issue?" to "it's not even an exploit"? Okay then, let's break this down for you. 
---
An exploit doesn't necessarily have to provide gameplay advantages. An exploit is any use of any game mechanics or outside software to manipulate the games coding to produce an unintended effect. 
---
Example: if you press a certain door in a certain position with a certain item equipped and then shoot the floor, your characters facial pixels don't render in properly (completely made up for this purpose). You're exploiting vulnerabilities in the games coding to have a pink dotty face that glitches around everywhere, which you can't do normally. 
---
Now as for the exploit you're all crying about:
---
You were manipulating the games coding to remove walls that shouldn't have been able to be removed. That's why it's an exploit, because you aren't supposed to be able to do it at all. It's really not that hard to understand.
---
Have you actually played on the pts? Is your actual ttk worse?
---
I agree with this. Legendary run, to me, feels like an extra thing to do to get more atoms to buy aesthetics from the atom shop, or to buy mobile weapon repairs. 
---
Granted, I've only been playing for a week (I am now up to level 31, thanks in part to some friendly folks on public servers). At the moment, Legendary run isn't what I am playing the game for. To me, it seems like something to get people to keep playing once they reach "end game." Otherwise, it's harder to draw in new players (if not many people are on the servers), and hard to get people who have completed the game to come back.
---
As an example, I haven't touched Skyrim since I completed it back in July. I pretty much finished out two separate characters/endings in Fallout 4 between mid-July &amp; last week. I don't know that I will revisit Fallout 4 (I am a completionist and like to get all of the playstation trophies for a game). I still had a bit more to do with my "piece of shit" character who sided with the Institute, but it'll likely be a while before I go back to that game because I just feel like I've done all of the main things one does to level their character up, and I wasn't in the mood to redo Far Harbour/the Mechanist/Nuka-World quest lines (and said character isn't high level enough for any of those anyways).
---
All in all, I give it a couple of weeks before I feel "so over" the dailies/weeklies events. Right now, I am in FO76 to finish out the main story lines (vault 76 in general &amp; the wastelands one), side up with the Enclave, and launch a nuke. Anything I do after that is likely to be more because a specific repeatable quest struck my fancy.
---
I don't feel there's enough lore in FO76 to keep me coming back, the way there was in FO4. I'm big into spoilers, and I loved going through various zones in FO4 and discovering the lore for myself. I don't have that same love with FO76. I *hate* that most of the lore is on holotapes. I listen to the YouTube lore in the background, and don't feel any interest in discovering any of the lore for myself.
---
I just tried it. It is NOT patched. Dunno what you're on about.
---
unarmed damage is broken on pts. doing about 30% less than it should for something like a bloodied DCG or powerfist. after they adjust the calculation it will be back to being able to just one tap most mobs... unarmed will still be the best melee option. damage will be in the 500 600 700 range. it will be just fine. so will most 1H and 2H.
---
bloodied builds are basically functionally the same dude, that extra 1000 damage that unarmed is irreverent 99.99% of the time, the other .01% is just cheesing bosses.
---
Yeah so I get that you're being edgy but that doesn't work when you know nothing about the person posting. I'm allowed to want a good game, it doesn't mean I'm not also passionate about political issues lol.
---
They haven't touched ANY builds at all.
---
They only changed the Damage Formula right now.
---
The reason Bloodied got hurt the most is because it has so many different sources of damage. With Bloodied, Adrenal, and Nerd Rage at 19% health you end up with 324% damage. (1.8x1.5x1.2)
---
it would be 250% damage with the formula change (1+.8+.5+.2)
---
That's why I said give them a small chance at a tuning pass. Because now they can make those specific change like you said. Hell, They can probably make those low health sources of damage even BIGGER to compensate, because it won't make all the other sources of damage balloon.
---
High schools, cat lady house
---
Step 1: admit that you want the stuff
---
Step 2: estimate how many hours of playing it will require
---
Step 3: check your hourly wage
---
Step 4: check how many working hours it would cost you to buy the stuff
---
Step 5: enjoy your stuff
---
Probably not, but that's on their dev team to fix that loophole then. Or to cap which levels no longer get the challenge to level up.
---
4. tripod or bi pod mounts is maybe what you want?
---
It is.
---
Would it also get rid of perk cards because even if it reset perk points you would still need new perk cards and would it only get rid of the ones in use or all of them
---
The BETA times were bad cause they forgot timezones exist
---
Dude is a literal autistic pseudointellectual, your argument is absolutely right
---
So to summarize the PTS:
---
Nerf certain builds more than others, make people reconsider their build path and want to respec
---
Any respec, including one‚Äôs you‚Äôve made in the past, puts you at an actual disadvantage
---
Well, you still good, but hunting rifle provides bit more penetration with penetrating mag, with the same legendary prefixes. They stack now, all penetrating bonuses, but the more you have, the less is impact. With new patch anti armor prefixes abd mods gonna have a bit more meaning i think
---
Well, the neighbors complained about the sentry guns, so not much you can do anymore...
---
Like fallout, we had them already but they were all removed for 76.
---
75% decrease is a hell of a lot though. I mean a hell of a lot.  It I can see we‚Äôre just going to disagree. But at least you‚Äôve not chewed my head off for being angry at them for screwing up again. So I appreciate that. I guess we will have to see if they‚Äôll give it that tuning pass you think they‚Äôll do. My money is not on that as I think they are not great developers anymore. But I‚Äôve got two choices right? Live with it or cancel my sub and find another game. 
---
With 3000+ hours played I guess I‚Äôll have to give it a shot.
---
That is really cool of you to do, well done!
---
PER is my dump stat but thanks to full unyielding I'm still able to test out this Instigating Explosive Fixer I'm considering for my snipey alt. 
---
And that's before we start talking about the Unyielding double-dipping glitch.
---
It's really a prbolem that systemic to the dispaity between bloody and other builds as well, it's really hard to balance content when one build stands above the rest by a mile instead of a little bit. This is what the devs meant by when they said "predictable".
---
 They want damage to be in range of the damage they want regardless of what build you bring, this allows them to count on players do X dmg with within X mins, which means we can setup X Y and Z to unfold a certain way based on predictable damage thresholds allowing possibly for players to do more than phase skip mechanics. 
---
They want a solid foundation of predictable damage that they can balance mechanics around, the old system just multiplies your damage the more synergy you have with your build, which made it stand too far above the rest. 
---
Instead of creating a bigger gap and crazier multipliers that trivializes most of the content in the game further, they correctly decided to scale it back and bring all builds to around the same damage threshold. 
---
Daily ops seem to be a step in the direction of forcing players to contend with challenging buffs on enemies since non boss enemies just won't die instantly. This allows them to be more dangerous to you and therefore encourage different perk card shares between team members and some kiting and team work. 
---
My only point of content is that we will have to wait for a long time for newer content based on this new foundation.
---
VaultTec doesn't care for the opinion of it's lab rats.
---
I'm a 30 something with no spouse, no kids, no job who also points out "If you want to get ahead in a video game, you have to be willing to put time in it."
---
I just want to point out, while I am getting ahead in the game, you are likely out enjoying life itself, which is much (physically &amp; emotionally) healthier...
---
[How soon is now?](https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340#7d)
---
Naw man. Even with the adjustment that's still a bs neutered version of what it was. Make enemies tougher, dont nerf and neuter our weapons
---
A lot worse. 
---
A

LOT

WORSE.

Enjoy your 40 scrip

TBF: How else would Bethesda maintain servers? Those cost money, and a one time $20-$60 fee isn't going to cover those costs. The options are either micro-transactions or subscriptions.
---
It‚Äôs broken as fuck, I really just play because I enjoy the people I play with. We still have fun, but if I were a solo player I would‚Äôve quit a long time ago.
---
Ever heard of rules as intended, it's clear in the tos by exploit they mean shit like duplication and going to the dev room, not fucking building tricks, if this were fortnite where building bbn is competitive you'd have a point. You're just being a dick and tbh I have seen trolls nicer than you
---
Battle passes honestly always kill my enjoyment and desire to play a game. I rarely play DBD since they added the archives (lore and cosmetics locked behind frustrating challenges that take a dozen games to complete), R6S, Paladins, Modern Warfare, etc. 
---
The only game I‚Äôve ever seen do a battle pass right was Warframe. DE included it for free, they give you 4-6 months to complete it, they filled it with lore/ cosmetics/ resources, and they make it so it only takes about 8 weeks to complete so that you don‚Äôt get burnt out with the challenges. The best part is that you can‚Äôt buy tiers, you have to play to unlock it, and even if you don‚Äôt the rewards come back at a lower tier during their intermissions! It is a great way to fill content droughts in that game.
---
I think you're right. It makes total sense. I expect they'll work on getting melee back up to par before going live with it, but this patch IS coming regardless of how many of us threaten to leave. They've wanted to add more weapons and overall variety for a while and this is the only way they can achieve that. I get the anger, I really do. Initially I was hot-headed about it as well, but after thinking about it rationally I see the need for this change. 
---
Yeah, it still sucks to lose the feeling of power we worked towards all that time, and it feels unfair that they let us achieve it just to then take it from us, but think about all the players who simply didn't want to play bloodied. Was it fair that they would never know the power we had? Balance is important when you offer so many ways for people to play. It's not a single player game no matter how antisocial some of us (myself included) are. I'm not jumping for joy over the nerf, but I'm also not jumping off any bridges. This feels like a much needed change for other players benefit. We're still going to be strong. We'll use more ammo, but we're also getting a legendary perk to help mitigate that if we choose it. In the end that's what this is all about, choice.
---
I have said and do agree that the disparity between bloodied and other builds is great. I can think of ways to address this without nerfing bloodied into the ground. It‚Äôs a shame the devs could not. 
---
And I also agree with your assessment that this is to make their lives easier as far as creating content. Which is really sad that they‚Äôre so fucking lazy or incompetent that they can‚Äôt do what every other MMO has done and find a way to build their content around the way the players play the game instead they are trying to force us to play the game the way they want us to. 
---
I think the daily ops are a step on the right direction as well. I enjoyed the few I tried and found them fun but frustrating because I know they would be better if I could do what I can on live server.  I think if they had just taken them to a further degree they‚Äôd have found the nerf wasn‚Äôt needed. But instead of making REALLY challenging content they took the easy half step.
---
My thoughts (stolen from elsewhere): do away with perk card scrapping. Award 1 perk coin for every level-up after level 50.
---
Todd plz
---
It's really only 30%, but it balloons like crazy when you consider it increases all other sources of damage by that much too.
---
Bethesda dropped (and is dropping) the ball so damn hard they deserve all criticism at this point. 
---
Also this could be my broken brain making things up but I'm pretty sure they recently said it's actually 4 different studios working on this game. Which would explain why it's such an inconsistent mess.
---
 I love so much about this game, but I explain it to everyone who asks if they should try it that the game is 70/30.
---
70% of everything is great, but 30% of broken in some way. Big or small. It's like being a child and getting this really awesome toy, but then you find out that half of the back of it is melted. It still works enough to have fun but it's kinda hard to ignore.
---
I'm also extremely petty about some things. Like the Gatling Plasma Splitter still being broken despite it being almost 2 years since Beta...WHEN I REPORTED IT.
---
Also I *think* they might be taking One Wasteland seriously. Like a revitalization point for the game. But we shall see.
---
No, no it's not. Any and ALL exploits are covered in the Terms of Service, your refusal to commit to them is your own problem, not Bethesda's. 
---
I'm not here to be nice. I'm here to tell you that you're all fucking crybaby's for whining about an exploit being patched lol, thought that was pretty obvious. 
---
Can't be fun to be a Game Dev and have muppets like you breaking their shit day in, day out. Play it as you're supposed to or find a different game, wtf üòÇ
---
Oh like the heavy melee attacks in third person?

The amusement park in the southwest part of the map has a lot of plastic in the form of trash laying around. (Good spot to farm for cloth as well).
---
See thats what I thought as well.
---
Don't know what platform you are on but if you are on console, understand your machine is close to being a decade old and they weren't even considered that good hardware wise back then. Of course your game's not gonna perform
---
I'm glad you joined us.  If you ever need some help DM me you IGN I'll gladly give u a hand
---
You &amp; I are likely not the target audience.
---
I think this game is targeted towards the teens/college crowd in general. I'm in my 30s, and I think my peers are off raising babies/doing whatever with their spouses instead of playing video games. Hopefully they'll come back to video games when the kids grow up. When I've run into other adults in the game, it's been pretty nice.
---
I agree this game is too good to be stewarded but the lame brains that are in charge of it. A half way competent dev team would take the great idea and foundation and turn it into......wait they already did and it‚Äôs called ESO. That‚Äôs ironic. 
---
I hope they get this sorted and we can talk them into making changes to lesson the nerf.
---
There is another thing to consider here as well, when they add more consistent 4 star and brand new 5 star weapons...they need to make it in such a way that it doesn't break the game even further. With new challenging content that's based on end game, we all new this day would come when it was time to balance the game around 5 star weapons.
---
At least there's a way of abusing INT and XP buffs with full health using the team mechanics and the new Carnivore/Herbivore reworking, but even that build benefits from the +15 INT you get from a full unyielding set at 20% HP.
---
Personally, I'd have loved to see other perks, mutations, and legendary effects get the same synergy as Adrenal Reaction+Bloodied+Unyielding.
---
I have seen the community push this notion non-stop on the subreddit since I've started playing the game.
---
I've yet to see anyone validate it.
---
Someone said it's roughly 10 weeks for a run's event to expire.  If I'm wrong about this, it could change my entire perspective.
---
I'm 61/100 so far and I'm 3 weeks into the game.  I don't do any of the NW challenges.  I'm 104 after 3 weeks of gametime so I haven't been AFK farming level challenges.
---
By these calculations, simply doing the daily's and weekly's that I WANT to do, I'm going to manage to finish the run in 5-6 weeks.
---
That's 4 extra weeks worth the daily's and weekly's I don't have to do in order to finish it.
---
How are you guys having trouble with this as a working body?  Most of the daily challenges literally take less than a minute.
---
Place 10 things in your C.A.M.P.  Take a photo in your camp.  Take a photo in a group.  Buy 3 things from another player.  Etc...
---
Why are you all blowing this out of proportion?
---
This.
---
Bethesda is willing to run its reputation into the ground, give zero f's about having pride in releasing a quality product, customer retention and making customers happy.
---
All they care about is short term revenue. 
---
Anything that directly impacts that in a meaningful way or could snowball into doing so at a bare minimum will get a response. It might still take months to fix and have it done several times because there isn't a landing that Bethesda won't stick or a deadline that they're not willing to fly past.
---
I AM EXCITE!
---
Capitalism in general means companies want to convince you to spend your time/money on their products/servers.
---
Regular websites do this as well. Sadly, companies don't seem to realize they are competing with each other for our time/money, and just assume we all have unlimited time to get all of the Internet/video games done.
---
the game wont be harder dude. at all. just a little more spongy for some people.
---
Across the river at Harper's ferry got to the top of the cliff head north on top of rock you will find one with his dead owners.   But I thought you can only tame random spawns.  And that camp is badass!!!
---
Thanks for the PC master race pro gaming tip üëç will definitely make sure to spend 2000 dollars to play the same 3 games
---
Ok but the ToS is bullshit if that is how it is, some of the most fun in any game ever is rocket jumping which started as an exploit, them removing inconspicuous exploits can damage the future of gaming, as higher level fun exploits will be removed cause zenimax is the worst.
---
I had no idea this happened.  Looks like I have new quests to do during the daily grinds.....
---
It ducks in pvp tho :/
---
Are they expecting people to level up daily, or is that just an extra reward if the leveling up happens? Like, can you still "win" the Legendary run if you don't level up each day?
---
you mean you like one-shoting legendarys in events so that no other can tag them, because you traded for some duped weapons and eventually paid real life money for this trades?
---
do you know what evolution does to creatures that have specialized too much? She makes them die out - Fortunately, you can adapt to the new circumstances so that your character doesn't die out

Game is easy enough without using a GG EZ build. I want to see a deathclaw and feel my sphincter tighten in terror. Currently i actively seek out deathclaws for that delicious black titatnium. I want to hear a sheepsquatch somewhere close and start booking a ticket to belize where i can hide from it not get my camera out and take close up pics of it while it does little damage to me.
---
These posts act like we are somehow partaking in some development process. Like games and the corporations that run them are some sort of democracy driven entity towards utopian gaming perfection. I've been playing 76 since beta and dealt with every single hickup. Dupers hackers cheaters bugs glitches server crashes inventory loses etc. The fact is you're playing a game made by a company bent on making money owned by a holdings company that's privately owned. All you can do is express your views in this "echo chamber" report bugs post on their forums and social media and try to eek out an ounce of enjoyment. What does anyone on this sub or anywhere expect beyond that? Voice your distain have an opinion that's all fine. But there isn't some amazing threshold to pass that suddenly they reason with us directly.
---
okay
---
Ah yes, just checked it out.
---
Honestly, I'm not a fan of skins that completely remodel the weapon. Mostly because they often have awful animation bugs.
---
I wouldnt mind if once we unlocked tier 3 of a card we could have the option to lower it down and up (3 to 1 star and vice versa) would be great for QOL perks to fit into builds like perk rat
---
Seriously. Man, I wish I knew this before. Oh well... At least I can let some others in on it.
---
only dupe frogs
---
That's a good way to put it. I love this game, but fuck this game. ü§£
---
Mines.  Plant mines after each wave.
---
What even is the BOS event? Are we expecting the supplies to bring them back to Appalachia? If so, I just figure they'll either come back or not, regardless of what the players do, if that is the route Bethesda wants to go.
---
Sir I dont do those events because the rewards suck. My weapon isn't duped. I traded for months to earn it. Sounds like you're just projecting from personal experiences man... idk why you're so vindictive and want others to have less fun. I also have no idea what evolution has to do with this either. Its simple. I spent a lotta fucking time on my build. When something around the corner threatens to make the thing I grinded for completely useless and a husk of its former self, youre darn right I'm gonna be mad. We as a community have a chance to stop bestheda from doing this. We have a direct chance to prevent this. Ik you all want a challenge. But this isn't it man
---
I want to forget I ever played this game.
---
Here's hoping One Wasteland is them allocating more resources to the game and copying more from ESO than a naming convention. I believe Zenimax is directly controlling ESO with their Zenimax Online studio. Kinda explains the difference a bit.
---
If you don't like their ToS, don't play their game, it really is that simple. You don't own the game, you pay for a license to play it; a license that Bethesda/Zenimax could revoke due to your brrach of ToS. 
---
OBJECTIVELY, you and everybody else here moaning that your exploit is gone, is in the wrong. You're all in breach of ToS and tbh, should be banned the same as an ammo duper. 
---
SUBJECTIVELY, you're right. It's not that bad in the grand scheme of things and there's other things thtsy they should patch out. 
---
Thing is though, objective arguments always beat subjective ones I'm afraid. Especially when those subjective arguments devolve into "ToS is bullshit" and "Zenimax is the worst." Like I said, if you don't like it, don't play. 
---
That's all there is to this argument, I shan't respond further and there's nothing more to say.
---
Thanks a lot!!! Yes I tried it but I wasn't possible to tame this dog üòî
---
They don't grow on trees, but they do have static spawns üôÉ
---
Ok man. Then use a nocturnal pipe pistol or sumn. Drag everyone else down into the pits of mediocrity with you all. I spent months on my buuld specifically to avoid getting my ass getting handed to me by a large creature. I specced to i would be what it fears.
---
I mean, you could just use a different weapon üëç
---
Finally, someone with the guts to say how it is
---
Yes, but teens are more likely than adults to grind through 4am/sunrise gaming.
---
Bethesda knows this, and thus their days seem to start at 12p ET (at least, for me they do). Even if a teen is grinding through until 4am, there's only so many dailies/weeklies they can accomplish.
---
I wonder if you can thame  that one clans dogs the screamin eagles  butt thunder hell I can't remember there name but they have dogs
---
Snitch üòÇ jk lol
---
&gt; just assume we are maintaining our food while we are there
---
Ironically, building in camp mode is the *only* time I ever get dehydrated, as I just fail to keep an eye on it. lol
---
I like the game though, and I want to see it get better instead of the developers removing fun features that's all
---
Man you're just out for misery aren't you? There's definitely a way to rally players together to make a change to the game for the better. If Bethesda wants a game that makes money, they have to learn how to listen to their community. That's obviously not happening, so lets bridge the gap and solve a problem instead of being apathetic and saying "They won't listen to me, but I'm gunna bitch anyways".
---
if u call them a homo often enough they'll respond quickly with a ban
---
We must form a coup
---
People who logging in every day o do the challenges are around rank 88. I'm at rank 87 only losing one day due too autocomplete bug. The people who are finished by now are the people who gets scorepoints by massive xp farming.
---
It's not about cheat engines Bethesda just won't respond to reports. There's this cheater I've been reporting for the last several months and I do believe many others are spamming reports on him as well and he's not getting banned.
---
If it's the error message on the computer saying there isn't a sample, there's a workaround at the bottom of this page.

I won't lie, the ability to quickly get through quests is one of the things I do like about this game. It's much harder to bullshit myself with "I'll just finish out this one quest and go to bed, or go to bed at 11pm, whichever comes first" in Fo76. Skyrim &amp; F4 quests took me much longer to accomplish, and each time, I figured it'd only be a half an hour to an hour &amp; then I'd be done. Nope.
---
As someone who is using video games to escape from the hellscape of the US, I like how I occasionally get bored in Fo76, and it gives me, personally, a solid stopping point for the day.
---
Very likely you are a terrible player :(
---
I mean, this game requires xbox x or ps4 pro to play. Either one's going for 400 to 600 right now. I could build a more than capable rig (if you don't mind bootleg windows) for that.
---
next Grunsday
---
Nuke comes tomorrow, worked all the way to the prep missile stage. PLease tell me I don‚Äôt have to  do all that shite every time I wnt to launch a nuke. Wasn‚Äôt hard just long and tedious
---
There are three weeks left?  If I start now can I complete it?
---
The only other two games that I play that have the same season path/journeys are Destiny and Division.  If I start them 3 weeks before the end I can still complete them.  I have to work harder for it but the option is there.
---
Timegating sucks and I can't understand how Bethesda can copy the season thing after the other games have done all the ground work and still eff it up.
---
They just don't give a shit in my opinion.
---
"The season is open for 3 months. You get new tasks each week, and all of the tasks expire at the end of the season." Boom. Folks can be the first to complete tasks each week, or just binge play the last week or two of the season.
---
What are the pros to time gating in your mind.  Not being a dick, genuinely curious, because I am wracking my brain to find the positives.  Every time gate in this game seems to be universally disliked, and merely an artifical barrier to stretch thin content over a longer period of time than feels natural.    
---
I mean it's a common complaint that all the time gating is causing these forced feeling walls to play that make people log off by halting progress when they still want to be playing.    
---
I personally think seasons would be better for everyone all the daily challenges excluding the "gold star" should expired in 72 hours rather 24.  That way people can play more at their own pace, and people who can log on every day still get a bonus with the gold star points.    
---
I feel like a lot of people defend this system just... because.    There's really no downside to making it more accessible other than some people feel less special which to me is not worth much.  I say this as someone who is single and can sit and play video games 8 hours a day if I wanted to.  I just don't like this design.  It doesn't need to be any easier, it just needs to be less time constrained.  I wouldn't mind if it were harder personally.
---
The top floor at fort defiance has a canteen area with a lot of plastic cutlery and plates
---
Idk why you're being so rude man. I put a lotta effort into my build and getting the necessary gear and I don't wanna have all that effort and damage taken away. Sorry someone  hurt you man.
---
They should have based it on XD gained not challenges, every other game with a season pass style content unlocking system uses that method so why not 76?
---
It‚Äôd be more achievable and less of a grind to put on top of the grind that holds another grind etc
---
Golf courses, high schools, cat lady house, freak show (bowling pins) , laser weapons.
---
76 dupe, water is wet.
---
And this is true to life as well. My dad used to write a check to get out of selling whatever for various school events I had as a kid. Other kids' parents used to take the selling sheet to work to sell whatever it was for whatever event it was.
---
Sometimes you grind your way through, sometimes you pay your way through.
---
Damn and you can buy upgrades to have more allies of your own faction defend for you, just like turrets. That‚Äôs would be sick
---
To be honest i have my sights only on 2 perks. Ammo crafting and special. Maximize ammo output and get space for sharing l3 charisma perks and add adrenalin to my build (not like it would be used much)
---
Ton of molotoves and just keep spaming the in there lol
---
That database has it. It‚Äôs categorised by base, common, rare, and ultra rare. It gives the percentage drop for each vendor and quest if applicable.
---
If you are affected by this change that much, then very likely you are playing as bloodied. You still one or two shot your enemies so this is not the end of the world. If you were not playing as bloodied, then there's not much to complain about cause your damage was not hit that badly in the first place
---
Begin the homospam!
---
If you are level 100+, the difference will be pretty much zilch, I hate to tell you.  It's just gonna max level on stuff, and you are probably already seeing a lot of max level stuff in areas where no one else sub 100 is at.
---
Same, I'm not even looking forward to them at this point after all I've heard about them which is tragic. Just like you said, I'll equip one and forget about it. "Legendary"
---
A-men, adult brother.
---
Yea i am a bloodied build Einstein, I said it in the post that you probably didn't bother to read (or because you apprarently can't read it. Not judging). And yes. I was hit. Very badly. My dcg does less than 1 thousand of what it used to which us pathetic. I dumped 100s of hours into this game and into trading for my weapon so id like for it yo pack a punch and not be an impotent little piece of garbage
---
I am having great results with a bow lidded with flaming arrows. The splash area of the flame is quite big, and the flame also spreads to other mobs. Usually a single arrow can tag an entire wave. Thank me later.
---
How have they been in the PTS for seemingly months now and they STILL haven't got them right yet? It's utterly baffling. Do they just ignore 90% of feedback on them?
---
I really doubt it.  People have been accepting all of the terrible elements of this game and still forking over money and asking for more things to buy for over a year.
---
It will just shut down.  It wont undergo some radical change.  If people stop spending they will just stop developing it, and put it in zombie mode.
---
No, I hate rads and like max life.
---
Then you are having trouble cause you are playing as a melee,. Other builds are doing just fine. Title of this post should be 'Melee is just beyond terrible'
---
Lol at bloodied players downvoting the crap out of you. Honestly, I think your argument is more sounds. Pull all these crazy builds back down to earth, and then decide where you want to go. I really think that a lot of players are just upset the wasted all of their time getting this crazy gear. I mean the weapons still  pretty beast on the pts! My bloodied build still shreds stuff pretty easily.
---
You forgot the coming perk loadouts. How happy will players be when they have scrapped all excess cards and then need those cards for different loadouts.
---
FO4 had a similar bug! My solution was to look around and get my character to use something. Stations/beds will automatically move your character out of a "stuck" place, and into a different position to use the items.
---
Um ok? Am I not allowed to play as a melee character now? And yea. Melee was hit hardest but other builds suffered a lot still. What's your point big brain.
---
I know internet currency is meaningless but I'm upvoting you. I agree in essence with what you say but there is no wall to climb over to suddenly change the status quo. I have 24 hours in a day time is of the essence. I try to put my fighting energy in a meaningful place. The games I play I keep it simple. I don't like something I give feedback in all of the right places. I send them a message via their website. I post it here and social media. I am active here, on their forums, social media, etc. But I also work in the creative arts and understand that running a creative business doesn't mean you can do everything you want to do. This knowledge does not excuse how 76 started and the insurmountable bugs that have existed since beta. But look around. Look at RDR online right now. Literally broken. The fact that we still have a 76 at all shows you the players aren't going anywhere and Bethesda understands it's development investment. You can not shout any louder than you already are.
---
But many do try. And it clogs this subreddit. And I guarantee their focus isn't trying to appeal to those who yell and scream but to those who continue to pay for first and atoms. And clearly those numbers haven't gotten bad enough.
---
There's a post on the PTS suggesting unarmed (but not 1 or 2 handed melee) is actually broken, as in they forgot to  add a 1 somewhere in the multiplier. Makes sense since unarmed has been nerfed into the ground.
---
It's a tight rope to walk.
---
In case you are new to gaming, look up the term 'Power Creep'.
---
They are in a classic 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' situation.
---
You can buy that plan from the production wing of the enclave bunker and also in white springs shopping mall.
---
Thanks, I was totally confused as I'd never come across perk coins.
---
Watoga vendorbot should have them.
---
I tried both of those, but thanks :)
---
No. What I'm saying is ask them to buff melee, not roll back damage nerf. And other builds were not hit that bad its just bloodied. I really doubt you played pts. Even with the nerf, we are still doing way too much damage in pts SBQ dies within a minute. Jesus
---
How about if the world did ANYTHING?
---
It's so static. The only thing that changes are the players, whether or not an event is triggered, or if a nuke has been dropped (players again). 
---
It's a stupid, boring world. Wastelanders brought NPCs and "real, meaningful dialog options", but that was a total marketing lie.
---
It's astounding that a multi-billion dollar company legitimately thought this was a good idea.
---
It can be ducking funny though - one time I saw two  hackers clash, obviously none of them were dying so somehow one kicked the other out of the server, then my game crashed. I think those duckers can crash you out of the servers in adventure mode also.
---
I am tired of the word "bulletsponge". You act like enemies won't have a chance at attacking you now, whereas before a lot of end game builds vaporize enemies in one hit. Now with the current dmg thresholds you will have to actually contend with mechanics instead of one shotting most enemies including legendaries at events.
---
I mean they aren't wrong.  Game development doesn't work like you think it does.  They don't go to reddit and see what the top posts are use that to decide what the team works on that week.  They are well aware of the issues we have, they have community people who's job it is to track that sort of thing, and I'm sure it's all on a list somewhere, and I'm sure they want to address all of it, but the team isn't huge, and they have internal priorities that they probably understand better than any of us could.    
---
You should bring up your issues, and report all the bugs you find, but the idea that the only thing stopping the game from getting better is us not rallying up as a group is simply wrong.  Software development just doesn't work like that.    
---
Plus I mean you take an already highly buggy single player engine and tack on a wonky multiplayer mod and you are going to have a LOT of issues, some of which probably cannot even really be fixed, because they are problem with the engine that have existed for YEARS.
---
Checking... claim ticket. ü§ñ
---
Literally not true lmao. And I dont care about other builds. It doesn't affect me. Which id assume is the logic youre using. And instead of fucking with damage 2 years after releasing the game and after everyone already has there builds set up they should focus on stuff the community actually wants
---
\*nerfed every build
---
to answer your question: Nobody except Bethesda knows
---
Fucking with damage every 2 years is exactly what WoW is doing and it's doing just fine
---
Yeah I feel you on this one, for example, i tried the dead by daylight paid season pass when it first came out and never again. Missing a few days of playing really makes it tough go get through the whole thing.
---
I have no idea what that is and it's irrelevant to me. My point still stands
---
Dies it really matter if you get to 100 anyway? Im at 65 and stopped trying because i had all the stuff i wanted lol
---
Try a server hop or ask if someone will let you on their private server, I‚Äôve bought it for people many times, I‚Äôd hep you but I‚Äôm on Xbox. Best of luck!
---
No reason to bring anything. Bethesda automatically completes it for us
---
You don't know what World of Warcraft is?
---
I came across a few drop sacks filled with 20+ of every mounted plan in the game, on PS4. 
---
I noped away from that bag like it was a level 100 deathclaw. 
---
I was banned from GTAO after a duper made it rain cash from the sky and I had zero way of avoiding taking it, so now I have PTSD when it comes to exploits.
---
Thanks for the suggestion :D
---
Well dat because they want u to spent money..... its a company ofc they want money
---
You know what would fix a lot of the arbitrary time gates on end game gear? If they added a ton of new builds to the game and new item effects to make it harder to get the build you want.
---
They could get even make a intricate legendary crafting system with this because it's still hard to get the effects you want so having a random roll legendary crafting system for ALL ITEMS wouldn't be broken...since there would be way more builds in the game. Having more builds and itemization would make the game funner, and end game grinding less stingy since there is too many different builds to get the items you want reliably. 
---
Increased itemization will make this game way better, right now it's very limited and forces artificial time gates on you.
---
Or they can just give us infinite fuel jet packs.
---
Never played. Im more of an fps guy tbh. This is the first mmo I've ever played and it's turning into a disaster. I also played some of the earlier fallout games and this just isn't makin the cut
---
Tried both. I've literally been trying to find this for a week. Every time it's a bust.
---
You're trying to help me "cope" by calling me a shit player? Keep your help. I dont want it
---
The complaints at the start of the season got Bethesda to add two more dailies that made catching up easier than it was supposed to be. This allows daily players to catch up but doesn't really help the weekend players.
---
How dare he conject a sustainable solution.
---
It does look clean and good but yeah, it isn't very Fallout.
---
Fusion generator and resource gatherers cause loud sounds underground which disturbs Molerat living nearby.
---
So they are angry and try to chomp the source of noise.
---
No I'm not Molerat Behaviour Physicist
---
I'm helping you realize it's not the game it's just you so that you can keep your cool and control your anger.
---
That is just for daily ops. However, playing around with the new ammo factory legendary perk, I was able to make a fuck ton more ammo than I‚Äôm able to outside of the pts. With ammosmith and ammo factory equipped, you can craft a little over twice as much ammo, so it honestly seems to balance out the bloodied nerf imo.
---
It's not a disaster this happens in every mmo and it happens for a reason. First time playing mmo? Well this is how mmo works
---
I would be using more fusion cores than 5mm rounds in my minigun....
---
It's supposed to run until mid-September from all the Google results.
---
You'll be fine if you just continue doing your daily/weekly challenges.
---
I'm 62/100 and I've been on for 3 weeks.  That's almost a month to finish another 1/3 of the run.
---
I don't do the NW challenges either.
---
I mean it won't be any harder, you'll just have to shoot a few more bullets.  It will just take more time and resources for the same experience and rewards.  Not sure why everyone is so excited about that.    
---
If they were making some fundamental change to the way fights go, made them more interactive or challenging or something I could understand it, but a damage nerf isn't going to do anything fun.    
---
Don't get me wrong shit IS way out of whack, but I see no reason to look at something like this with anything but resigned acceptance.
---
It blows your mind because you're flat-out lying about the state of the Legendary Run.
---
You don't have to log in every day.  It's absolutely not mandatory to hit every daily challenge in order to finish.
---
There's a LOT of breathing room.
---
Well you can use perks to tackle that
---
Uh what discord was it so I can make sure to not go there
---
me too. I'm still in the low 50s on the board and I had saved up a few thousand atoms to buy my way to the end when the time came...but now I don't think I will. It doesn't seem worth it.
---
No its not man.
---
Sucks, did you appealed or are you still banned?
---
I'm not angry lol. I'm sad that in a democracy you snd I have the same say in anything
---
Honestly the only thing I am looking to get is the one that makes it so I do not need to use perk card slots for lock picking or hacking, that one has value.
---
I SOOOOOOO agree!
---
I have a fuzzy memory of an early plan that seems to have evaporated: legendary perks come from resetting your character. 
---
Remember in Skyrim how, if you maxed out a skill, you had the option to reset it and that would allow your character to grow beyond the normal limits?
---
So you start over at level 1 but with a legendary perk to make your next incarnation easier than the first time around. The more you reset, the more godly you become. 
---
I swear this was a plan for 76 once. It should make a return. I‚Äôd much rather reboot my character than go through some new, torturous currency.
---
Yeah then I'm helping you control your depression
---
I'd love if they allowed a full respec without doing it one by one through level. Really can't be that hard to implement. I did a melee build. Didn't really like it in the middle of a respec, got like 20 or so levels to go before done. Just took any fun I had in the game out.
---
Sure man whatever helps you sleep better at night. But I'm blocking you because you're annoying me immensely.
---
Yeah I got 3 grenades a beer and a nukashine, probably not doing that again
---
Wallace in Harper's Ferry has them. I just checked him
---
Yes it sucks. There is no way to defend against it. I wish that we had fireproof park card to help out some.
---
The Raider tree at level 50 is my fave item! üëçüèº
---
I just used 50. Got a RL and LL within the first 10, and then the other 40 went down the drain.  
---
RNG is RNG.
---
Can you buy it and sell it to me? I was just there 20 minutes ago.
---
Yeah, I tried server hopping to see if it would help but I then got 4 Bolstering in a row... Was so annoying
---
We don't know yet. It seems like all builds are pretty much defiently getting a nerf due to the way they'll calculate damage, but its broken right now in the pts as its only come out a few days ago, so once they fix it and hear community feedback we'll know for sure. I wouldn't be too worried
---
The reason I stopped playing this game a month ago.
---
People join a team, and then go off to do stuff in real life, letting their character get the XP from whatever the rest of the team is doing.
---
Popped off after checking so I'd need to pop on again and check.
---
There's one up the road from the fissure site south of White Springs. Had mine there for quite a while. Decent ish sized flat area to build on
---
Straight cash, homie.
---
I'll go there again and see.
---
How have enemies been made any harder? Sure the normal enemies will be a slightly higher level but a lvl68 super mutant vs a lvl80 super mutant won‚Äôt even be noticeable for most builds. 
---
The bullet sponges will be the large Enemies like SB and sasquatch. They are not overally deadly it‚Äôs just a time and ammo thing to take them down. 
---
Now it will just take 1,2,3 or however many more clips to take them down depending on how much damage is nerfed.
---
The level shift is due to me being level 311 on PTS and the closes they can go is 100.  
---
And I compared it with my now level 314 on live.
---
And the ability to appear from the shadows behind you like Batman.
---
You have to fight your depression not ignore
---
I've actually always wanted to use the ski sword, but have never been a melee build until now. I used a combat knife for a good while while leveling up my alt until I made the switch to unarmed, so I have a few of the perk cards still. Thanks!
---
There are 22 workshops on the map, with the exception of the ammo factory and the two power plants that have unique features i.e ammo and fusion core production, players don't really need to contest workshops, they could just as easily claim and farm similar resources at another. If a player is contesting a workshop other than the three aforementioned when they could just as easily claim another, it's fair to assume that they're intentions are antagonistic. 
---
Overwhelming, and perhaps surprisingly, players are generally courteous and respectful in this regard (a sense of community and solidarity almost unheard of in other multilayer circles) and just because the PvP function is there, doesn't mean that it should be engaged with at every opportunity. If a player has taken the time to build up a workshop then leave it and that player be. If PvP is your thing (not you per-se) then there is a server dedicated to that style of play, use it.
---
What you really need to do is just not play the game if it annoys you to tye point your gonna basically stop playing to have demands met
---
Yes, same. I am now level 31, so less likely to XP leech, unless it's in an area with harder enemies. When I was lower level, I joined events teams to XP leech and help build my character up a bit. Now that I understand the game better, and my character is stronger, there are a few events I can solo to help pay forward the XP I've leeched in the past.
---
Sometimes I look for teams filled with lower levels to see if they need any help/advice.
---
Rocket turret rank up to 50 
---
rest  Turret are all 25
---
Or it makes more sense than a Monday morning start. 
---
Opening on a Friday allows the maximum number of people to engage for several hours and give their impressions before the Devs look at the early results. Looking at feedback after a few days will give much better balance than reacting to the fist handful of loud voices. Shockingly the first reports are not always right, just look at the number of threads decrying a 'Bloodied Nerf' who are ignorant to the fact it affects the whole player base regardless build and level and is not targeted at them personally.
---
Don't think they would respond to whiners Friday or not
---
we'll have to wait and see how it balances out.  I don't play Bloodied or Junkies so generally I don't one shot a lot of things anyway. A little extra challenge is a welcome thing, but it can easily tip over into *tedious*
---
Ya I watched angry turtles video about the new pts and the weapon damage definitely dropped a bit but it doesn‚Äôt seem too bad. But he did mention that the unarmed got nerfed way to much, he said a crafted baseball bat did more damage than a legendary deathclaw gauntlet so hopefully that gets fixed before the release. I‚Äôm not going to worry about it until it comes out
---
1 part of your day should be spent getting set up for ammo production. 
---
So 1 day you make a few lead runs, the next day you take acid workshops and always scrap weapons for steel in the process. 
---
On Acid days the 1st thing I do is take Hemlock holes. Typically if I take this 1 day a week, and keep checking it every 40 min or so, I'm set on acid for the week. 
---
When I was low level, I used the FO76 resource map to locate all the acid nodes and I would just spend 30 minutes hopping to each one and draining it manually. Really adds up. 
---
Now I can just farm Snally so it's less of a hassle. 
---
There is a 'secret' location that has an acid node and a lead node that you can camp on. It's a bit tricky to pull off however and I've found that both are in such abundance once you memorize a farming routine that it's just not worth the constant Scorchbeast attacks. 
---
Make sure you select acid component via component view, so everything with it gets highlighted. I probably passed up a few thousand pens in 50 levels of playing before I realized they broke down into acid. Every coolant or antifreeze or otherwise colorful plastic container should be grabbed for it as well.
---
On xbox one? U never heard any other high level player complain about explosives? If that's so, they must run an explosive build themselves
---
Legendary perks don't even seem to be showing up for me at all. Am I doing something wrong?
---
Yeah, nothing. I'm going to server hop for a couple minutes. Hopefully one pops up.
---
Oh like mindwipe tonic from ark. I wouldn‚Äôt mind it! Though to counter balance it would have to be a pain to craft
---
Of course you stay banned. You get banned only if you stick around and collect like millions. If you log off as soon as those hackers start dropping cash, you are good
---
,,  The one and only way to get perk coins will be through level up. Every  time you level up past level 50, you will get one free perk coin.  ''And you are full of shit mate.  What about all of us High levels who have good gear, builds and know all recipies ? Should we go fuck ourselfs acording to your wish? Get real and leave it or think about  a way which will not fuck 99% of playerbase.
---
Great! So we don't have to finish seasons to get the rewards and we get new stuff to use Gold on. That's a pretty big deal.
---
I feel that bro, trying to craft specific legendary mods is a pain. Tired of trying to get good mods I‚Äôm just settling with ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù until I can resupply
---
The downvotes you are getting is immature, nonetheless I could see it. You don‚Äôt want the level up to lose its purpose!
---
Definitely the Atlas Observatory: BoS needs to get the message that they are not welcome to Appalachia!
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they started the PTS on a Friday since weekends have more active players, allowing more testers and everything else is just bonus
---
Juice head did a video while playing in the pts with a bloodied DCG and was still basically 1 hitting all high level enemies a day or two ago, and even then he said the damage will probably go up because it still was messed up. That made me feel better. There was chaos on this sub the day it launched due to misinformation, so I didnt want to do the same thing, thus using "possibility of a nerf", but we all know betheada so im just being prepared lol
---
Yea that is an old bud I hate it lol üòìüòÇ
---
I honestly love the Captain Cosmos PA skin. That was my carrot on a stick and I finally got it
---
It is not really 'genius' strategy. It is actually basic business practices. Whenever you have to tell a employee bad news (like firing an employee), it is usually recommended that you do it on a Friday afternoon. That is because they are already looking forward to the weekend and more likely to take the news a little better. Also, it gives a couple of days to calm down rather than trying to make a scene or cause problems. Bethesda is just using this same strategy on its consumers.
---
Woah, not a bad idea at all! Now we're talking! Take an upvote.
---
The chicken coop. When I saw that was one of the rewards, I knew I couldn‚Äôt rest until I had it.
---
No luck. I'll hop on again tomorrow and hopefully find something.
---
The worst part is as much as you can get loads of Legendary weapons and armors, you can only get enough scrip for 3 modules a day. It's so limiting
---
Yea that‚Äôs really annoying, it‚Äôs worse if you‚Äôre trying to get a weapon
---
Season 3 is Brotherhood of Steel themed.
---
Now Season 2 though *does* have **some** things that can be Brotherhood related: Create your camp into a bunker for example with the Bunker Foundation/Wallpaper and the Brotherhood Field Station. (My doors will now finally be Brotherhood bunker doors!!)
---
IMO it biggest benefit will be with freeing up different builds. Right now you sort to have to pick rifleman, shotgunner etc and specialize as the penalties to damage is to much. 
---
But with the new system hybrid build will be more less impacted (so say rifle and shotgun) the damage will be a bit lower not the penalty like it is now and you have the benefit of rifle outside and shotty indoors.
---
Yeah I'm not even going to attempt for that, I'll stick with what I'm using
---
&gt;  Players who are above level 50 will get a perk coin for each level that they should've got one.
---
Well then you'll get some legendary perk coins to start out with. No need to get so angry when you haven't even read what I said.
---
They're in lighting
---
you make good points, but I would question your first statements about the community being united in what they want, and how we all have the same complaints.
---
For example...look at PVP; there's definitely a broad range of wants and complaints there..
---
I craft between 2-4 on all five characters every day. Have been doing this since it started. Have only received 3 great pieces. Rng is a bitch.
---
I was trying to get a furious gauntlet with faster swing speed and after like 10 I think I just said screw it and kept the only 3* I crafted
---
The faster reload mines....
---
You can't even trade them between characters so is there any point of that?
---
I HAVE logged in everyday and i‚Äôm rank 83.
---
Ahhhhhh! I could have sworn they said next season, but this makes sense haha. Yeah that does look sick!! I'm hoping the gas mask and tank helmet look cool too.
---
I had a level 300+ player drop me a bag with 350 large xmas gifts in it. Opened they all. Scrapped all the junk, pocketed the caps, learnt the plans I needed and dropped the rest in a trash can. Then logged off and back on so they all disappeared.
---
I wish they'd kept the old daily system and not this stupid legendary run shit
---
hope you're right, as that's how I play for the most part. I have the basic perks running for different weapon classes at the same time, and hardly move them around at this point.
---
Yeah because getting higher level gear is a fun experience, doin the trials or raids is fun
---
Here you need to farm everyday trash mobs in the hope of getting something worthwile
---
I found him sitting backwards in his chair like some cool guy at school being edgy , he didnt turn around when I talked to him so maybe he was crying prior to my arrival , I didnt want to dig though , he works so hard .
---
It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs hard to keep that from happening. Probably should be a bullion item.
---
There are no new bugs this long after a patch drops.  
---
There's just old bugs that people gave up talking about.
---
they at least fixed the fast travel bug and gave it it's own keybind. press alt+f4 to fast travel now.
---
Text chat mod?
---
I know, but I have limited game time during the week and I'm not wasting it leveling up my alt.
---
Bethesda is vault-tec in disguise. They do these sort of social experiment stuff to see what will happen to their players when they do those stuff. They probably want to see if working people are willing to quit their jobs just to do their grindy runs and other end game grinds. I think they do not really fix the bugs and add more to see more drama and if how long will people keep tolerating them just because it is the Fallout franchise.
---
Well they‚Äôre making the above scenario impossible any day so it‚Äôs not that
---
I think so, sadly.
---
I got a level 5 unyielding ap refresh sentinal leather bp . Gave it to a noob for free.
---
I am just looking forward to people not being able to one shot legendaries at events and not being able to take down the queen in 30sec. Perhaps then I might be able to get some lootz
---
Also, the Warframe passes run far beyond the time required to complete it by doing every task (comically so, in fact). You can easily miss a few weeks, come back, and still finish without needing to do every task. 76 is ridiculously strict in their requirements. Their pass is a job, not a quest. 
---
While the constant bugs and lack of endgame piled into multiple grinds had me regretting my time with this game of late, it will be the completion of this battle pass that sees me hang up my pip boy for good and delete this game. Shame it never attempted to meet its potential. The latest steps and choices prove to me, though, that it has no hope of changing course any time soon.
---
So has the nerf already happened? I thought that was only in PTS for right now
---
That's cool man I ain't against some educated fuss, it's the ones that say "fuck the legendary coin system" and that's it, Bethesda isn't going to pay attention to those post. The Legendary grind does seem far-fetched, but I'm not going to expelliarmus Bethesda for something they're testing out, I hope at this point no one is expecting the full release of the Legendary Perks by the end of September. I sure ain't, but I am looking forward to One Wasteland.
---
I bought the plans last week from the watoga vendor, maybe try server hopping a few times if it doesn't work. 
---
If all else fails and you're on Xbox, I can sell you the plan
---
Won't this new nerf just tip the balance even more towards legacy weapons?
---
I'm on PC, but thanks for thoughtful comment. I'll server hop and check a few places out ;)
---
What pisses me off is the RNG "progression". I'm sat at 1062 LL, and if I do a Pinnacle Gear activity, that activity could give me a 1062 Primary, or a 1062 Helmet, for instance. If I've already got a 1062 bit of gear in that slot, it should be higher, especially as it's fucking Pinnacle Gear. Not the same LL. Ridiculous system, but what can you do?
---
No
---
I'll probably bring one batch of each material from now on, just to feel like I partook in the "event" even if Bethesda seems to be automatically completing no matter what.
---
Ummm. They ARE making them more challenging. Like.. what?
---
I feel that the spear is the most ignored weapon in the game by players!  But it is so fast and so stabby stabby, I love it!  When doing an SBQ fight, I love switching to my spear when I see the queen shift into position to dive into a landing and then I run underneath her and start stabbing furiously!
---
Wait for the Series X, gonna be pretty close to a PC at half the price
---
I lucked into a Level 30 SS Troubleshooter Super Sledge when I was in my late 30's and it really changed the game for me, turned me into a melee primary/commando secondary. 
---
Named it Wham Bam and never looked back! 
---
I just hit level 70 and got a MMG drop that was 3 stars, SS, Mutant slayer, +1 AGI and the damage was superior to my Sledge so I reluctantly switched out. 
---
The MMG is more powerful but I miss my sledge. I've spent 700 scrip trying to replace it with a level 50 SS super sledge already. 
---
Something about bringing that rocket propelled beauty down on my enemies heads is just more satisfying.
---
Of all the problems we have to deal with in nuclear winter on xbox one, I'm glad that hackers isn't one of them.  Maybe one day if bethesda isn't busy patching new dupe methods or banning dupers, they might be able to get around to adding another map to nuclear winter. To me adv mode is super boring. Before nw came out I enjoyed it, but now as soon as I go in to adv mode it's the same thing. Go do this then go get that then listen to someone then constantly sort your inventory to make room for more junk. I would buy fallout 1st if it allowed me to host private lobbies in nw so I can host all melee rounds or no weapon rounds or whatever. Nw has so much potential but it is being pissed away.
---
Lol. Months. Lol.
---
I think vats is weird anyway, I'm not sure what it's meant to be.
---
I think vats would only make sense if you were wearing some sort of headgear like a power armour helmet, so yes I think wearing power armour should make vats more effective.
---
I was wrapped up in one of the massive sweeps but they ended up reversing it a few days later because too many innocent people were swept up in the process.
---
Hate to say it but that will still happen. Even a 50% nerf to bloodied and they will still one shot every thing. And well the 30sec SBQ is because of magic weapons not any crazy damage build.
---
Just scrip them saves bothering with saving so many rubbish drops from legendary enemies.
---
It took me about 200 modules before I got an armor set I was happy with.  Funny thing is the very first item I rolled was a great 3* Unyielding chest piece.  RNG got me back by making it a headache to get the other 4 pieces.
---
Well, a Shotgun load to the Face should be instakill - the magic effect just compensates other hindsights in this instance.
---
Cafeteria trays are 2 per
---
If the enemies have more chances to attack you, then you take more damage and have a higher chance of dying. Daily ops have level 100 enemies that are fairly challenging and don't go down too easily, making their mechanics dangerous to you. 
---
Maybe for higher level characters most enemies in beginner areas won't be that challenging but this will still make it so you are not one shotting everything legendaries at events either most of the time.
---
Unless one wasteland the game is feeling Me overpower.
---
Why does any criticism get written off as whining?
---
The mental gymnastics you fanboys do for Bethesda are why they can keep bending you all over and you turn around begging for more.
---
Wait what? Was I suppose to save those? Why does it sound like because I've played for so long and have a sub I'm being punished?
---
ü§£
---
Yes. Its taken me a while to accrue all my gear and weaponry. I have a full time job and family and play this game with my kids as a hobby
---
Never thought about, but it make totally sense!
---
\^\^ Duper confirmed... ü§£jk lol
---
I do the same, any thing over 10k in my machine has emotional attachment value added tax built into the price
---
I did get alot of use out of the game. Over 800 hours of play time between my PS4 and the PC. Might be time to move onto FF14 more than I am and get into raiding.
---
I'm scared. D00ping is so bad. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Thx for the (long) explaination :)
---
Yeah also having vats drain both AP and fusion cores makes no sense when you consider that vats in power armour is no better than vats outside PA.
---
I feel that
---
True that one will be useful, I don't even use lockpicking or hacking anymore. If it's above lvl 0 Its not worth the time to switch out cards for some Pre War Money and .44 rounds. Which yet again says volumes about the Bethesda's game design abilities.
---
About to begin the grind as I bought all the plans last night.
---
I actually am a full health build with crappy mashed combat armor I've had for the last 100+ levels. Shit a one star zealots would be an UPGRADE.... :S
---
Best of luck to us all then!
---
I don't quite get this. Depending on my build I sometimes use any of the starred version of a perk card. Are you saying that if we have the top level version of Gunsmith, for example, that all other iterations of it owned will just vanish? That makes no sense, as I use all levels of Gunsmith depending on which build of the day I'm going for? ü§î
---
Burrows can also yield up to 3 legendary ghouls.
---
Good luck!
---
Players can't complain about not having perk loadouts if they have no spare cards to swap out *taps head*
---
A new nuclear winter map and also nerf the grenade spawn rate or give us a perk card that will actually help defend yourself from explosives instead of getting 1 shot with grenades. Take the gauss shotgun out or nerf it like the Tesla rifle was shortly after nuclear winter was released. Everytime someone spams the trigger and shoots at u with the gauss shotgun, causes extreme frame drop and lag for the person being shot at. Everyone has been complaining about this. Fix it Bethesda
---
Exactly that's were my idea comes in. For high cost you should get high damage and range. A trade between core energy and damage
---
Still subject to change
---
Lol my post got removed for not conforming with rule 1. As if the legendary run isn't a part of the game. These mods man, everytime
---
Allright, start one.
---
I once found an amazing crossbow, I can't remember the exact effects, I think it was AA explosive and +1 agility. I haven't played with a crossbow in this game but I wanted to try it out but it was only lvl 25.
---
i think the devs never stated anything that specific,
---
the only mentions i can remember where that they are going to make a balance overhall
---
anyone logically assumed that this would mean buffing laserrifles, making the alien blaster usable looking into bugs with the broadsider etc.
---
the changes we currently see in the PTS are probably all the changes we willget and to be honest even if they would decide to look into specific weapons, id bet they still wouldnt be usefull after all
---
given they allready buffed laser weapons once and what they did was giving them like 10% better durability and a supposed fix to their armorpenetration wich still doesnt work proper
---
when they said they changed efficiency to craft flamer fuel, the increase was so small they might as well could have not done anything
---
so far the only changes that were effective, where nerfs and i do believe that this wont change in the future
---
From what I have seen from angry turtle for me taking done a high lvl super mutant will prob go from 1-2 to 2-3 bullets on commando. Not sure that split second will allow them to attack anymore. 
---
But I agree adding more damage from enemies would be better n
---
It could all of a sudden drop you a whole bunch of unyielding, just be patient. I don‚Äôt think any particular effect is rarer than the rest, after a while you‚Äôll get what you want for sure.
---
Bloody fells like it is rarer hahaha
---
I started one but dropped it in my coffee, sorry about that üòí
---
I know, the one we want always feels like the rarest, no matter what it is lol
---
Whining cause your damage got nerfed is not a criticism
---
I think it comes from fallout 4, where power armour was just better than non power armour, so they added the FC drain as a form of balance.
---
But in this game, 76, we have 3* legendary armour which for the most part is better than fully modded power armour. Even the jetpack isn't exclusive to PA anymore!
---
Also, I think scoped weapons should have zero scope sway when used in power armour. Makes sense as you  are basicly a walking gun rest anyway!
---
And the unarmed damage when in PA should be at least as powerfull as a power fist!
---
Well that‚Äôs good to hear because I love playing unarmed for day to day use to save on heavy ammo. Everyone loves to complain but when I saw actual gameplay it didn‚Äôt look to bad, and like you said it‚Äôs only been in pts for a couple days so everything is subject to change
---
Hey! I‚Äôm running a 10 Black Powder pistol pirate an yes, pistols fuccing suck on a full health build, but 1 VATS crit deals 576 damage on the SBQ. You do 3 of those and you‚Äôre set for the event rewards. 
---
But yeah, while it is kinda sorta viable, a full health pistol build that doesn‚Äôt specialize in stealth sucks balls against basically all other builds...
---
I,very handed in 300+ tickets.......now I can open a.pocket watch and slacks shop.........waste of time imo
---
Sinbad WAS a genie!
---
Yeah, NW and FO 1st are the biggest disappointments so far. Both could be so much more valuable if they would put some actual effort in.
---
Good input Sir! I'll think about the whole power armor problem and create a concept, since this post won't gain any traction
---
Just saying , my junkie stealth commando really struggle killing the wendigo spawn (10+ headshot to kill one) in colossal problem. I think the sneak critical should always work whether the  mobs have aggro to you.
---
over on the PTS they have an Asam turret installed, but otherwise yeah. very few defenses
---
I am not a fan of Fortnite but I think they have grasped this ‚Äúseason‚Äù thing better than anyone. Seasons are made to keep you playing while it still being fun and somewhat easy. The most important reason why seasons should not be difficult is simply because you won‚Äôt buy it again if you realize you don‚Äôt have enough time to level it or it makes the game too grindy. Fortnite offers the best season value with almost every reward being good and not just some items you can get in-game. I‚Äôve never seen a season as good as Fortnite‚Äôs in any game. There are always 2 main issues 1. Takes too long to level and/or 2. Rewards are not too impressive. For me F76 has both of these so I am not even bothering with the LR
---
VATS stands for Vault Assisted Targeting System. It uses the pipboy on your arm to make split second calculations to help you make tactical decisions in combat such as "what's the probability of me hitting this supermutant in the head with this pipe pistol from here" or "Can I shoot this grendade mid air that this blood Eagle has just thrown at me and turn myself from the recipient to the sender"
---
Not for at least 6 months after launch
---
I have  the problem of vats saying 95% and never hitting.
---
They should add an event like hordes of blood eagles attacking ATLAS and the  players have to defend it
---
Not when the effing body gets launched to the moon after it explodes.......
---
Think they should nerf bloodied to oblivion. For example they bleed 5 health per second while having bloodied weapons equipped
---
I think it made more sense when we could pause time in the old games.
---
Is that a power armor display stand?
---
Uh, is that a power armor display?
---
Also if you don‚Äôt have the time because you‚Äôre busy earning money, money can be exchanged for goods and services such as atoms. Which buy levels!
---
Yeah, it gives me something to buy in their shops.
---
It gives me reason to pick their locks and attack their workshops.
---
The legendary run is nothing more than a FOMO marketing tactic. I work in marketing and this is the kind of thing we do to get people to pay up. Bethesda is the same as the other publishers, they don't just want to make money, they want to make ALL of the money!
---
I've been having these problems but mainly the one where I miss a whole  mag of shots at 95%
---
Yeah, something like that would be great, that would show that at least *someone* is defending it because clipboard man (unless he has a secret clipboard attack technique that we don't know about) wouldn't be much use.
---
I don't mind the nerfs to an extent. I mean, the idea of killing a SB with a bloodied pipe pistol in 10 shots as opposed to say 20 with a furious gauss minigun does seem a bit silly.
---
BUT.. the perks are there for a reason i.e. to make weapons better than they normally would be if it complements your build. 
---
So I'm not sure really. Maybe the nerfs will provide that balance, we'll have to wait &amp; see..
---
Sad thing is that these changes will only affect newbies, and make the game harder for them. Those of us that have been playing this game awhile will barely notice the difference. And i know this because i play on PTS.
---
No problem at all, good luck :)
---
Criticising because your damage got reduced is not whining.
---
They drop ultracite ammo except plasma and fusion cores
---
"**it's that you have to play every day.** "
---
...or pay the money.
---
Bethesda knows exactly what they are doing, they did not design it this way for no reason. And it's shitty.
---

---
I already used 120 modules on gauss miniguns, thats 60 miniguns. None of them where junkies, only 1 bloodied, and 4 anti-armour.
---
So, yeah, RNG FTW...
---
Use the in game tool to trade and give them the items for a cap
---
I've been mostly hoarding 5.56, shotguns, 50 round and 2mm EC.
---
But then only use my fancy shotgun for everything.
---
My anti armor .50 machine gun for sbq
---
I'm starting to think that nw will eventually get taken out of the game like survival.  I hope that doesn't happen but who knows.
---
There is a reason why the Legendary run is set up as it is and that's so you are gonna buy atoms in order to finish it unless you can play all day really.
---
eyyy bethsda take notes
---
So you scrapped perks that you use in normal situations for a legendary perk?
---
Yes please and add selling ammo to the vendors so we can scrap that ammo converter once and for all.
---
Similar feelings. Doable as a group, possible in solo (took 20 min for me in non-Bloodied PA w/o legacy weapons). Really hard in solo, but doable. You'll need lots of stimpaks though.
---
Makes you think that it isn't weighted evenly and the better ones are rarer
---
Or u scrapped extras?
---
I would want something like this to be a quest and at the end you produce the tonic or drink. And then, to make sure you can't just respec whenever(cause let's face it, no matter how rare the ingredients, glitchers will find a way to exploit or dupe to get around it), have it only be repeatable once a month.
---
Juicehead also seemed happy about the nerfs, his only real complaint about them seemed to be that for the moment on the PTS the damage output is too low, but that seems to be a bug. 
---
Looking at raw numbers even after the nerf Bloodied and Junkies will still be the best two for damage output, but they are now more in line with everything else. It'll be refreshing for me as a Junkies player to not one shot most things anymore.
---
What an utterly entitled and misguided opinion. It can be done in 30-60 mins per day. I missed 2 weeks of it and am still on course to finish it. Don't have time for gaming? Then change your life around, stop running the rat race as a wage slave FFS. Can't find time? Don't play, it's simple.
---
My guns all start with zzz to be at the bottom if a scrip scrap run, until i get a zealot's that sits unnaturally at the bottom after those. Idk if the sort is bad, or i am using the wrong option
---
The immersion idea isn't a bad one, although 5 HPS would be way too much lol. They already run extremely low health. Can't tell you how many times I got blasted by a Ghoul running up behind me.
---
Do not forget he was killing scaled up mobs. Mob levels will be a lot higher now. Hopefully experience from killing high level mobs will not be nerfed and that means no matter where you are on the map you will be getting a higher experience boost and should level up faster.
---
Why didn't you just wait?
---
That's called whining. Kids do that. This overall nerf was made to balance damage between builds and lower the excessive damage output. And you guys be going like baaahhhhh I do less damage kill Todd I'm gonna quit baahahahhhh
---
Most likely it's just people remembering they have them when they open pip to check what they got/re-hydrate.
---
Let's just stockpile 490m supplies and leave a guy with a clipboard to defend it, makes perfect sense. By the time the turret is on LIVE, I'm guessing the gathering event will be finished which will be a total of 1,265,000,000 supplies, so basically when they have over a BILLION supplies they are like "hey, lets maybe defend these supplies and place a turret here".
---
Apparently the BOS with their military smartness overlooked this one.
---
They won't
---
I'm pretty sure it was over on the PTS. The character they tested must not have had too many reserve level UPS to be able to scrap all of their unused perk cards to rank up a legendary perk and still have wiggle room. Luckily since it is the PTS the character saves are deleted once that pts testing session is over. Nothing carries over to the main game so it's your chance to go a bit crazy
---
I‚Äôm trying to get a full set for each character....

Yeah I did a timed fast travel away to crater. Returned. Took some pics. Got him to follow me to the middle of the dam.

&gt; Posting something does not inherently mean feedback was sought

Come back when you understand how forums work.

You are not really running on all cylinders.

Am I missing something?

How is having the ability to craft your own Flares worth 50 bullion? ;p

Talk about getting apocalypticly drunk.

Proper factions and faction conflict? If only.

But with hopeless PvP, magic weapons, hacked weapons and duping ... yeah, no thanks. Fix that crap first.

Come back when you realize that forums do not operate to YOUR desired wffect. One can, and many often do, post things not looking for feedback. Your lack of basic understanding doesn't mean I'm the one in the wrong. Now sit the fuck back in your corner.
---
My main is a bloodied heavy gunner and I have pretty much the same thing as a 2*, two shot and +50 limb damage. I carry multiple heavy weapons, some magic, and this one is hands down my favourite way to say 'Screw this noise'. You don't even need any perks for it to be a vicious little toy.
---
Slap and accelerated barrel on that bad boy and just aim down the sights. Everything dies. Easily able to melt the queen in seconds even on public servers on base ps4. It's also remarkably accurate, even being a two shot, especially aiming down the sights.
---
Downsides - Breaks a bit faster but I honestly haven't run in to any times where it broke under pressure yet. But it' way too overpowered if you go 9 points in heavy weapons damage and 3 points in stabilized. People won't thank you for dropping the Queen before they get enough damage to tag it. And it will trivialize a lot of fights, at least until the damage rebalance stuff goes live.
---
I love mine too. With my junkies I managed to get 700 base damage from it too.
---
Counter point: TS has a double chance to trigger one gun army, luck of the draw and any other on hit effect of the sort. With op‚Äôs being a limb damage it also has a fast enough firerate (basically doubled) to trigger the damage-overflow bug.

Just because YOU want something to be, does not make it so.

Like, I've legitimately never seen an animation for the above mentioned 'novelty' weapons. Never seen an enemy actually using them, despite picking them off their corpses. I just figured something was bugged with the code that only allowed them to display 2 or 3 weapons, despite the randomness of their loot. 
---
Has anyone ever seen a spear actually used by an enemy mob and not another player?
---
I really hope they bring survival back in some for. A hardcore mode with no legendaries and survival style pvp would be really fun, as long as they fix the initial survival issues.
---
Sorry but this is not true. Participation rewards were not a thing in schools til the late 90s. Boomers - whose parents had fought WWII - would view such a thing with contempt.
---
You on PC? I already have one of those, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind another one to start cornering the market üòé
---
I am really happy with it and it sounds like TSE might experience some sort of renaissance once the damage nerf happens.
---
Thanks for pointing that out, made my day.
---
If it's that, I've never had that issue, but I also run the Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch. I make mods, but don't know enough for fixing something like that. However, if I had to guess, if something like that is broken, I'm thinking there's probably a busted script involved. 
---
I did find this mod, but it's geared towards survival, so I'm not sure how effective it would be outside of that mode: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12680/
---
There's also console commands and I've used the mod Cheat Terminal to fix broken quests before like Danse not talking after you clear out the ghouls. Mod is available on XBox and PC (I've played on both those platforms, now playing on PC). I haven't checked if that mod is also available for Playstation but since it's essentially a holotape with console commands in it, I don't think there's any external assets involved, so it should be fine for Sony's guidelines.
---
Yeah that would be cool. I would definitely play that.
---
I just want a challenge. D: been trailing back to sum FO4 survival.
---
This was on pts.
---
I‚Äôm so glad I gave up on this game after about a week
---
do you think they're gonna start giving a shit about what anyone says because of the spam posts on this discord? they know already. they know what they need to do to fix it, they know how to fix it. if they gave a shit they'd have done it already. stop fucking crying.
---
I was a tad lost for a second. I was going to say are legendary perks really worth it? Lol, nvm
---
Same here. Started survival a week ago :) for the 100th time.
---
They won't give a fuck until player numbers drop significantly, just saying.
---
 No cross platform between console and PC, thanks! We don‚Äôt want their filthy hacks and dirty cheated weapons over here ruining our game even more than the bugs already do.
---
Nothing about this post makes sense
---
Except reality?
---
At the same time bloodied unarmed is getting a ~70% nerf. You are doing mediocre damage, but now you have to be in the enemy‚Äôs face and you have a sliver of health.
---
Dear god, man. Your posts are maddening to read. Are you being this obtuse on purpose?
---
That‚Äôs the real prize.
---
They are not in the actual game yet, only in test server.
---
No, you are not.   Geez, on both my characters, I had more crappy cards than good cards.  If I'd had to play with what I had then, I probably still wouldn't be playing.
---
I scrapped extras including most of the perk's I got to max
---
Did you try the harpers ferry vendor? I used to have my Camp right by there and would buy them from him. Good luck!!
---
Might swap from stimpacks to salves for my bloodied character. What was the objectives like? For example was it go here defend this rinse repeat so you could run past enemies to get to each objective quicker or do you need to kill everything? Just so I could shave some time off go make it easier to get top rewards solo
---
Are you on the private test server?   They haven't been rolled out to public servers yet.
---
I feel this post so hard, level 279(??? Ive lost count because of the level up challenge lol) and I decided to just buy the last 4 ranks so I could spend more time with my GF who is completely burned out on fallout for the moment and so I could go back to playing the game normally
---
To be honest Ive gotten so used to grinding the challenges that I no longer know what to do
---
Im still gonna say this is my favorite game but Im a little unsure about the direction it is going, really hope expeditions is exactly that and we get to leave for other areas, new maps would be sick but smaller areas with an exterior is welcome
---
You gotta do it each time. Helps a lot if you dont die, grab a pa for that and sit on the top floor where the  prep launch terminal is. 
---
Leave only eyebots alive. Find yourself a fast firing troubleshooter weapon (a minigun for example). Disable all turrets via hacking (not all of them can be deactivated. Prep launch room ones can)
---
Every week the nuke codes reset, use nukacrypt to avoid codepiece hunting.
---
Bos may be a bit op though against power armour users, you turn up to defend and there's a legion of assaultrons XD
---
Hmmmm... I am
---
Working 45 hours per week, got a gf and I don‚Äôt play FO76 for more than 30 minutes per day (actually only for the dailies).
---
I also miss like all weekends, including the double xp/score stuff. However I am at rank 88/100 without spending atoms.
---
So while I don‚Äôt have kids, it is totally doable with playing for like 2-3 hours a week.
---
It might be not ‚Äúfair‚Äù to whoever can‚Äôt do that, but what do you want the system to be? ‚ÄúEveryone can complete it even if he does not have time to play the game‚Äù? Nice. What about people that actually *do* play the game? Finished in day 4?
---
Getting to rank 100 is not meant to be completed by everyone. Still I am pretty sure the biggest part of the playerbase could or can finish it, if he/she/it wants to.
---
Focus on doing the dailies. They can be completed within 20-40 minutes, depending on which one you need to do. I play wayyyyy less than you and I‚Äôm at 88/100
---
Just stay away from workshops or respawn when you are down?
---
I think pacifist mode should mean you can‚Äôt deal OR receive damage.
---
All the enemies are attacking my camp or stealing water cooled bone saws from Foundation
---
I have full sets of scout armour but SS has better damage numbers and crazy rad resistance. I‚Äôm always at max caps and have god tier weapons, so why not.
---
Yeaahh, and the enemies drop the scrap resource that's currently needed
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that was only applying to the PTS to test the board itself?
---
Yep! The casual outfit.
---
I am on the same boat. Damage calculation change is good. Especially if it will help Bethesda to fix magic weapons and jumping health bars.
---
But what is not good, is that relevant damage perk cards and effects are not adjusted for the lost damage during the calculation.
---
Right now everything gets a nerf. But some nerfs are just too much, like the ~70% damage reduction on bloodied unarmed melee.
---
How would that work after you have taken a workshop ?
---
Exactly, the time period of the game, 20 something years after a nuclear apocalypse where if I want to A body to wear his pants I should be able to wear his pants. When I put on his pants, it shouldnt magically turn into a skirt.
---
ooor you could get good and stop getting farmed lol.
---
Hmm. I guess we will see. From what I've read they never said for PTS specifically, and was worded to make it sound like it's in general (especially since you don't even get rewards on the pts.) Hell, everyone has been complaining about it. But we shall see~
---
It would probably take, with a really powerful gun, 2 mins to destroy every part of power armour. You stayed there for that long without re spawning?? Why? And if it was re spawn bug, why didn't you just reload the game?  Instead if staying there letting someone destroy your pa. This is assuming that your armour can be destroyed after you have died.
---
Yeah, they have better things to do than steal billions of caps worth of supplies, it all makes so much sense!
---
I wonder why they've changed that now Perk Coins are separate per character, not per account. That resulted in situation that I've been able to upgrade few cards on my main (lvl 630+), few cards on my second (lvl420+), but only a 1-2 on my lvl250+ character, which haven't got many cards to scrap. I greatly prefer previous, account wise, approach.
---
They should remake the game. Not only that is broken
---
Happens at the end of a nuke zone there
---
&gt; Rake in as much MTX money as possible with as few resources as they can get away with.
---
But it's working, isn't it? Each and every week, people spend money on their shop because "OMG *insert neat looking camp item here* is back for only a week! I gotta git it!" and I bet that a good chunk of those who fall for this are actually players who aren't even happy with the current state of the game.
---
Nothing will change if the player base's behavior won't change. Last week, someone posted a "I'm not quitting" post and you could read that many people would still spend money regularly despite not enjoying how the game is going because "muh they need support so money will help them!" ... c'mon.
---
Ah ok, that would explain it!
---
No, they've only changed it than Perk Coins are now separate for each character, not per account like before.
---
Ah I see, thanks!
---
I envy you SS grinders.
---
Thorn/Solar armor takes 150 scrip per piece and you have to server hop since you can only buy 5 vault steel at a time.
---
All I wish for was that I could buy more Vault steel...
---
U haven‚Äôt used the chainsaw I take it? It‚Äôs great, Dual bar with a flamer is powerful but if your looking for a chainsaw to one hit a enemy not only will u not find that but that would be ridiculous as it‚Äôs a chainsaw, It‚Äôs got to be in contact with a enemy to inflict damage and not one tap ko them. I use ultrasight Gatling and it‚Äôs great, I think all you guys want energy weapons to be suddenly powerful like a ballistic weapon with explosives effects because I use energy weapons and they‚Äôre fine.
---
weird, thank you
---
Fair enough
---
Different people find different enjoyment out of the game. 
---
Some enjoy min maxing.
---
Some enjoy camp building.
---
Some enjoy exploring Appalachia.
---
I like them all.
---
I got so tired of having to close the door to my generator every time I come back to camp. It's a separate little building, clearly marked as 'Electrical' above the door. Nothing to see in there but a hodgepodge of wiring but everyone that comes by feels the need to check it out.
---
I got so tired of doing it... I locked the door. No reason other than preventing me from having to manually close it every time I zoned in. 
---
Since I started locking it, it's been picked 4 times! I've got my Collectron locked, it's never been picked. I've got my purifiers unlocked and they're never touched... yet locking this one door and keeping people from seeing my fusion genny just drives their curiosity mad apparently.
---
My corpse was there for about 10 seconds as I chose a respawn point. I have duoed a Scorchbeast queen and tons of scorched monster spawns without losing a single piece of power armor. Yes, apparently your power armor can be destroyed after you die against unwanted PvP.
---
Right now it's on PTS only. I hope they'll retract the changes, since with all my characters do half of the damage and all new lvl100 enemies that are bullet sponges, it's not fun to play.
---
If it was Bethesda logic, then if they ever did an event like that the drop rate would be like 0.0000000000000001% just for 1 plastic.
---
The damage change just enlarges the gap between normal weapons (even B &amp; J) and legacies/magic weapons. So it kind of forces people who r chasing highest damage (end game) to turn into using those stuff.
---
Yes, yes, and yes.
---
They read +25% Xp then stop
---
Let the workshop go to the challenger until both players are not in pacifist mode.
---
I respawned as quickly as possible. It didn't matter. Damage should stop when death occurs. Pacifist should mean you don't ever want to engage in PvP for any reason, ever.
---
Don't say you'd be fine with a one star because that's what you'll get lol.  Happened to me when I told myself the same thing. Rolled tons of 3 star junk over and over and then when I finally got my unyeilding torso it was one of the only one stars I crafted.  I'm still using it and continuing to roll a few a week.
---
This doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs gonna be any fun at all
---
I'd actually love such a thing, akin to the GoW PvP horde mode.
---
Too bad Blizz was actually making such a game and they scrapped the shit out of it.
---
We know it was a patriarchal society, but this is 20 something years minimum after a nuclear apocalypse and I should be able to wear the pants I steal off of corpse. The most unbelievable thing about this entire universe is that there is a set of clothing that magically detects what my genitalia look like. As far as I know, there is no other outfit in the entire game that can magically detect your genitals.
---
Yeah, I think he realized how absurd his ‚Äúanalogy‚Äù was and dipped before I could embarrass his. You can defend the grind all you want. Even I think it needs to be hard to reach the end of the run, but arguing that people should be punished for having a life is pathetic.
---
I currently have 2x 1star Unyielding pieces, I re-rolled my chest 15 times after getting a 1star and got a 3star AP refresh piece and got a 3star bolstering just because it has 50% less fall damage while I'm also gonna re-roll for unyielding. Overall it's quite lucky but it's going to take a while to get those 2 or 3star pieces
---
If they're the ones who did the launch (their silo work, their nukecard), I couldn't care less if they kill it fast.  (Okay, maybe a little annoyed for loss of time coming to the event.)  Same with Encryptid.   Their 2K-cap recall card?   They can play it how they like it.   But if these things aren't theirs and they behave like this....really bad.  They're high enough to run their own silo and use their own nukecard without basically stealing the rewards from someone else.
---
Huh, nukes that place loads and all i get is liberators
---
taking a workshop means it could be taken from you, that's a game mechanic. it disables pacifist mode. if you don't like that but still need to take workshops for challenges, the best you can do is take the workshop and immediately jump servers, or FO1 and take all the workshops you want in safety
---
Some times it's eyebots or libirators
---
I want to be able to unlock ever perk and use them at once like fallout 4. I leveled all the way up on fo4 for that very reason
---
If you respawned when you went down, how do you know the PA damage was done while you were down?
---
Workshops are also the only PvP places in Adv. If you are not prepared to PvP, just stay away. Pacifist does not mean that you can walk into a PvP area with impunity.
---
Iv got 40 gauss shotguns no bloodied or junkies now waitibg everyday to get them scriped
---
Add in doing the dailies and you should have enough for at least 4 modules.
---
I do 8 modules every two days.. still getting junk but I did get lucky on my first SS chest piece was 3 star unyielding.
---
We don't get extra coins for maxed perk cards?   It's just one coin whether it's a 1- or 5-star card?
---
Why aren‚Äôt you shooting her?
---
Can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôll probably be a season 3 as soon as the BIG December update comes out. Unless they change the system, nobody will be 100-ing every single one.
---
Please read the message while taking a workshop about you are entering a pvp zone
---
So don't ever take a workshop. No pvp .
---
But the problem is, nobody wants to be forced to play every single day, even if it‚Äôs just for a few hours. I used to play every single day, but now it‚Äôs become a chore and I might play once every 3 weeks.
---
I took an unowned workshop for genuinely about 5 seconds while I attempted to go to the map to fast travel back to my CAMP before quitting for the night. 
---
Another player 100 levels below me showed up, one shotted me in my X-01 power armor, then continued firing at my body while I attempted to respawn elsewhere. When I did, my armor was destroyed.
---
If this wasn't mostly due to flawed game design, I would have spent the next hour nuking that players workshop and CAMP.
---
PvP or not, players should not have superpowers and be able to destroy your work when you are dead.
---
Actual gametime is probably hours if that though. And you do realise bloodied is still gonna do way more damage than everyone else yeah?
---
i was chugging stimpaks and by the time i found it, it was nearly dead
---
That will be fine when workshops are not part of SCORE challenges. Until then, maybe pacifist mode should be fixed.
---
You need a vampire weapon.
---
Legacy camps because I still have double walls in my camp. I just can't change them or they are gone forever.
---
An attempt was made to placate the community. They "forgot" the ability to blueprint those stacks, so once you have a print, you can still place them.
---
that would be a good idea actually
---
Then pacifist mode should be disabled while owning a workshop. Otherwise, not helpful.
---
I will only accept a stealth suit skin that is both charming, and flirtatious.
---
It is...
---
I don't have time to play as much as I'd like, so I probably won't make it all the way through the run.   I'm very busy, and I have other games to play as well.  I didn't have time to play at all last week.  And yeah, it bothers me a little.  But what can you do?  I've dealt with the same thing trying to get through Diablo III seasons in past years.
---
 Seasons are for dedicated players who put in the time. That's how it should be.  It's not a instant reward program.
---
 If you want it badly enough, find time to earn it. And if you can't, you can't.  It's just a video game.
---
It allows me to solo her.
---
It does help, a lot. Even if you get a crap roll Minigun or .50, the high ROF will keep you alive with the Vampire effect.
---
I read through this entire thing expecting to see and actual example or suggestion
---
Actually, my partner and I were pretty impressed with the performance of a nocturnal gatling gun used at night.   We collect gatlings.  :)
---
Yes. If you kept shooting my body after I'm dead you would put more holes in my body armor and clothes.
---
Well I mean the suggestion is to listen the community. That's pretty much what I was saying. There tons of examples out there by others.
---
Yea, it lets you chat in game with anyone else who has the mod so you can coordinate events and such.
---
Mountain Scout? Get in line. I want the Captain Cosmos headpiece they showed off in the Legendary Run. I just got to rank 100 yesterday and all I got was the stupid outfit.
---
Right? Haha. I mean, what‚Äôs the point of this if you have no suggestions.
---
Disagree. That wouldn't fix the issues with the games balance, that being that Bloodied did more then the next 2 prefixes under it combined with more defense to boot. Sorry, but I've read this entire thread and this was an adjustment that needed to happen last year honestly. Damage being multiplicative is never a good idea. You get stupidly wild variance in damage to the point that balancing said damage is a nighmare.   
---
I'm sorry most people got nerfed, but if your build is 1 shotting 95% of all enemies in the game as opposed to other builds, it's going to get nerfed sooner or later. Everyone who went Bloodied took that risk. Bloodied builds will still deal the most damage, they just won't imbalance the game outright anymore.   
---
Also, for anyone who is making the case that Bloodied is hard to play, or squishy...I very much disagree. Nerd Rage, Serendipity, Dodger, high stats from Unyielding, the list goes on. The only things you should be dying to are your own mistakes, Rads, and poison. You want a true high risk high reward (low reward, sadly) build? Build Berserkers and then we can talk.  
---
If anything, Berserkers should do the damage Bloodied does. It's the true glass cannon of the game.
---
Patch 22 does not only nerf bloodied...
---
Are you suggesting that five parts of my level 200 player power armor were destroyed in one shot by a level 100 player? If so, that's a pretty big game balance issue.
---
I know that the other player never stopped firing while I was trying to respawn. I have never experienced anything like that with any monster.
---
I seriously took an unowned, unpopular workshop for five seconds before quitting. I did not ever anticipate having my entire suit the power armor destroyed as a result.
---
I don't care about dying, but that was just ridiculous.
---
It's not you. The Purveyor given me one good gun in a lifetime....
---
I love this game, however character respec and legendary weapon transmutes would be my idea of the perfect addition. True control of our characters and builds. Exists in ESO so it's possible.
---
Such as....
---
The legendary perk cards havent even released yet. I'm sure they'll be fixed by launch
---
Grahm sells them, the vendor at watoga should sell them, the vendor in harpers ferry should stock them, whitespring vendors (in the whitespring shopping centre, not the station) occasionally can have stock. They shouldn't be that hard to find, you must have awful luck, I'll keep an eye out for them, I'm on PC aswell, so if I see them I will grab them for you.
---
There‚Äôs the cheats who should be reported, and as much as I hate to admit it, dupers are the biggest cheaters in the game, and they deserve reporting. My views on dupers are irrelevant, that‚Äôs point blank cheating. But doing something as simple as blueprinting the ammo factory from the converted munitions factory is so god damned simple it shouldn‚Äôt even be viewed as an exploit. I just wonder if it‚Äôll work for the fusion core generator. But let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs wrong. Who would you rather take down? The Duper who‚Äôs abusing lag, or the guy abusing legitimate ingame mechanics?
---
Why does this not happen with the Scorchbeast queen or any enemy other than PvP?
---
This is not a matter of 76 trying to be realistic.
---
Personally, I don't really care about the changes. I've played every high damage build. I've played the most soup builds imaginable. In the end I settled for full health PA heavy because, ultimately, I want to have fun and not feel as if I have a second job. It's the casual approach and it's literally what this game is balanced around. 
---
Hop into PA, go wreck shit, have a couple of QoL perks as well. That's easy mode but it's basically what this game has been balanced around right from the start.
---
The min/max high damage builds where never intended to be the selling points of the game. They're an option and even with the changes they are still above every other build but now they need maybe 5 instead of 1 or 2 bullets to get the job done. Short of the bosses, obviously.
---
I think people just need to wait for this to go live and check for themselves instead of getting angry over a potential non issue.
---
hm, ill keep an eye out for one, thanks for the advice \^\^
---
So you are level 100 and your raiders are ALLY but Settlers are friendly? Good job of self-incriminating yourself.
---
Taking damage after death is not something in the message now is it?
---
Fax bro I‚Äôve been there and i think so too
---
I'd say more like 1 to 2 hours daily. Maybe 30 to 40 minutes of actual game/kill play but inventory/sustenance/gold/cap/scrip management takes up the remaining time.
---
Haha, normally i get get dead ghouls dancing on the floor or shopping trollies doing back flips, but thats new!
---
So I guess for every one that feels like they wasted a whooping 2 minutes reading my post. The suggestion is Bethasda needs to stop coming up with what they think is best and start hitting the forums and taking suggestions. Stop promoting."Shit in a bag" updates that they came up with. There bound have success on this game if they start developing it the way that the people who actually play it would like to see it.
---
I was just thinking to myself as I entered Foundation that Scorchbeast attack would be a great event quest they could add to both Foundation and Crater.
---
Group up, problem solved (as long as your teammates hit her)?
---
Oh yes this should be a fantastic event
---
I'm going to just float this idea, if they made a grindable event for OoM that could give you a plan or token or whatever, but the ability to get legendary versions of their equipment, I would grind that event or quest.
---
Just by searching Suggestions in this reddit yields a lot of suggestions Bethesda could use. Instead they trot out another Botherhood story line
---
That‚Äôs debatable since no one has ever had this happen, maybe your power armour had really low condition before the attack?
---
Or maybe he find the ASAM only After he get the resources
---
if teammates hit a legendary you can get it too? or am i misunderstanding
---
You‚Äôre the gamer that everyone should be ignored. 
---
I bet you trip a lot with your fucking nose stuck so far up in the air it managed to find its way up your ass.
---
They are not focused on you when you die because of everyone else. If you die by a SB out alone it will continue to sonic blast your body if you just lay there.
---
He's got a Fallout 1st Scrap Box.  Once it's in there, it's safe!  :-P
---
This is a part of gaming though. Balance happens, sometimes players are on the receiving end and it sucks. People either adapt or quit. I've played many, many online games and this is nothing new. Maybe to some people here, who thought things would never change then in that case I could see it coming as a bit of a shock.
---
We could call it something like a Cross-Atlantic Sparkle-Buster.
---
Yeah that's really all I'm saying. The community is asking for apples and thier giving us oranges!
---
Such as Goe to bed and stop trolling.
---
Correct. Otherwise I would never get loot when running ores in rad rumble
---
Number sorting in stashes meaning adding a priority system for what should be shown first, ie legendaries marked "1" will be shown first in that stash in alphabetic order. Followed by item marked "2" etc. Fast travel mats. Bulking ammo so you can sell it for a reasonable price (no way am i buying .38 for 1 cap/round. Bulking all scrap. Higher cap limit. Giving S.C.O.R.E from events, kills and quests. Theres alot.
---
None of the parts of my armor were below 100%, as I had repaired everything possible after my previous SBQ trial; yet, only one piece of my power armor survived this player encounter.
---
Do you think this could have been a bug or hacker?
---
I'm sorry, I thought that this was how the game was for everyone.
---
If you are close.
---
It seems like that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing with your clickbait title
---
Yes. I finally have a job I love.
---
Great suggestions! I was asking OP though.
---
Not the best phrasing mate. I get your point but people gonna be downvoting you.
---
Lets use an example of item that for majority of the players is not very desirable, but for right people its worth 1x anything. Lets say the majority prices it at 10k, but there are buyers out there for which 90k would be a bargain. If the tool priced it as 10k, those who look for it would be laughing its underpriced by a lot. If the tool would price it as 90k, those who think its meh would be laughing its overvalued significantly. If it outputted something in between, both groups would be laughing simultanously. There's no way to balance this out, we tried, an so was the "nicheValue" added to the system.  
---
You are right that the tool doesn't output average sales price. It's purpose is different. It's purpose is to help people become efficient traders and learn the interactions between effects and the demand for combinations. It's purpose is to teach people about various in game niches and what items satisfy them.   
---
What is price? It's as much as buyers are willing to pay. Sure, you can make some caps with vending, but you can get much better price much faster by selling things actively, and finding buyers looking for specific items, not the ones looking for a bargain.  
---
Vendor prices are the most irregular and random between the prices in the game. It's more of a series of exceptions than a pattern. Vendoring is different art than active trading. Great selection with great prices might not sell because camp is placed badly. Gathering enough data to build any statistical significance out of those exceptions, without the power of 'search' and without an access to in-game API would be a process so painfully ineffective that by definition the tool would always be half year behind the markets. Focusing on data that can be scrapped allows seeing the trends in the market much faster.  
---
The way it is now, maintaining the tool is unpaid work that consumes multiple hours per day. Building the tool and interacting with the community is definitely one of the most insightful and valuable lessons I've received, and I'm very grateful for such chance, but the suggested change in data gathering methodology and tools purpose would demand that its not 3-5h hours spent daily, but twice or thrice that, and this is not realistic.
---
100% this.  I've been done for a week, and haven't really played since.  Waiting on the new content to drop, and log in once a day to get scrip/bullion and turn in some resources for the BoS.
---
You've got to make your own fun, my new hobby is sneaking around people's camps in my stealth armor and messing with them. Kills a couple hours easy
---
Didnt think it mattered. Should i remove it?
---
Welcome to legacy energy explosive weapons with proper perk loadout. And thx to duping, they‚Äôre not even rare
---
It took me about 75 modules to get 4 \*\*\*/1 \*\* unyielding SS armor. I guess I was luckier than most here. Only 1 has poison resist (the \*\*, of course).
---
I think most don't 'plan' on playing the builds. It's more a case of what RNGesus decided to give you, and then you build around that.
---
was my story, initially
---
Two of us fought a SBQ for 45 minutes straight, failed the scorched earth event, but kept fighting until she was dead. I probably went through at least 20 fusion cores with my gatling laser.
---
In all of the damage I took from her attacks and every scorched enemy that was spawned during that time (a lot) not one part of my power armor was destroyed.
---
Another player was able to destroy almost everything in 10 seconds. That's why I posted.
---
The nerf is fine for some and not others. Specifically melee and non automatic weapons got majorly fucked. Melee lost a good 80%+ of its damage, and my pipe revolver went from 3200 per sneak headshot to 600. Auto variants of weapons are now doing almost the same damage per shot as non auto, but they have way higher fire rate.
---
I think the change to auto is fine, i think a nerf to non auto and melee is also fine, but not 1/5th of their old damage, thats actually insane. It needs to be half, not a fifth!
---
Also im just salty because i find that playstyle fun and now its completely worthless compared to auto
---
Different strokes. 
---
That mission for Rose is practically the *only* time in 70+ levels that my melee/commando brute felt actual tension while running. 
---
Only time I've had to say to myself, "If I'm not careful here, I'm dead."
---
My character is a brute, always bullrushing opponents and overwhelming them at point blank range. But not this time. 
---
This time I was surrounded by max level Kings. Kings that could decimate me if I was seen. I wasn't specced for stealth, don't even think I'd crouched at all in 40+ levels. 
---
Yet here was my brute breathing heavy under his breath, crawling in the dark and praying. Inching closer and closer to the goal. 
---
I knew if I could reach the Wendigo I could take it, it was only the Kings that posed a threat. 
---
They killed me twice before I managed to sneak/run past them. 
---
It was exhilarating and the only time I've felt that kind of tension while playing. Once I got blocker maxed out... everything sort of became a joke, unless it was 15+ levels higher than me. 
---
So personally, I'm not looking forward to the 'enemies always appropriate level' as it'll take away that feeling of fear that I get so rarely.
---
the problem here is that you're under the impression they actually care. they don't. they want(ed) to spend as little as possible on Fo76 for the maximum amount of profit.
---
you know what's easier (and cheaper) than actual content to retain player? repetition, ad nauseam. and thus we got the legendary run.
---
 I have noticed a similar  pattern with legendary's as well.
---
Got  4 bloodied drops yesterday, various locations but consecutively. maybe it's a 'server' thing?
---
So now at purveyor if i get 2 weapons with same crappy major I stop and either come back later or jump server.
---
Pain
---
Really? It sounded like 50 Cal. It definitely wasn't a Gatling laser or Gatling plasma. 
---
I am aware that there are hacked weapons out there, but still think that damage should stop when you die.
---
Teabagging is bad enough, but losing your armor is just punitive.
---
Is blood too powerful after a nerf?
---
Guys, I understand that everyone is playing with commando and machine guns. And I'm playing with a pistol, what should I do? On PTS, a super mutant dies from 4 headshots from stealth! This is not an automatic rifle with 30 rounds in the magazine, this is a 10mm semi-automatic pistol with 18 rounds! Pistol assemblies, already weak enough, were simply destroyed.
---
Dead people don't have perks to protect them.
---
Not true. It was definitely a thing in survival mode while it existed. Both PA and other armors could be broken by your attacker after death. I had mine broken and broke others as well.
---
I‚Äôve always wondered about this. It‚Äôs a huge pain to have to remember to equip certain cards to harvest crops, scrap, whatever...I‚Äôd be fine if crafting cards still took slots and had to be swapped out, but the basic passive ones shouldn‚Äôt cost us anything.(I guess they want me to forget to use them, though. Less benefits = more incentive to spend money.)
---
I understood your point, I think you willfully misunderstood mine. As for "not always listening to the community" I agree. Maybe though, Bethesda could listen to us once in a while? Rather than "fixing" things  no one asked for, maybe they could fix longstanding bugs, put in some free new content, or remove some of the grind?  Instead we get a nerf to damage coupled with increasing health - wow, so fun.
---
I just gave up on the game. I dont have the money or time yo grind all the bullshit. With work and kids the gaming hours are so limited, so when i play fo76 i feel like i dont have time to accomplish anything.
---
[RIP what could have been](https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-07-starcraft-fps-reportedly-axed.html)
---
Well. Hacked or not I did plenty pvp in my time and never encountered what you explain. 
---
It might just have been a one time fluke
---
And I wouldn‚Äôt even care, I have like 400+ adv. repair kits from all the SBQ that I do. I‚Äôd be happy to spend some on my PA
---
I don't understand. I don't have perks to protect me when I'm alive either.
---
You don't use fireproof?
---
Who are you telling this to? Me? Lmao i definitely hope not. If you're making that rant for other players, that isn't helping with overall player retention.
---
Point is, the world doesn't revolve around you bud.
---
Most players like player balance. It would make them enjoy a mode more. That also means faster lobbies and more competition down the road--more competition is more challenge--that "challenge" that you like.
---
Idk why i'm having to type this out. Nuclear Winter is supposed to be a pvp mode about balance which is inherently imbalanced. There is even a fuckin loading screen that says "To promote fairness in Nuclear Winter, we have stripped you from yaddayadda".
---
There is absolutely nothing fair with a perked player doing 2.5x your damage jumping around with frog legs with less recoil management.
---
I Always head shot Them while they are playing it
---
*It's free too*
---
Yeah looking at the "rewards" on offer we can tell.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I gathered as well.
---
Instigating weapons are key to my build. I use an instigating explosive pipe revolver rifle for my main. Benefits from both rifleman and gunslinger. It gets ~4k head damage and between 900-1500 damage gut shots.  Definitely not bloody damage but good enough to kill just about anything with one shot
---
I also have an  Instigating explosive lever action and an instigating +10% while aiming Gauss pistol that can both one shot almost anything.
---
Nope. Good suggestions should be voiced
---
I am one of those whales and I am quite happy with the game. It is a nice after work distraction with friends, and I am quite proud of my camp.   
---
Be safe. Wear a mask. Wash your hands.
---
  
---
Cheers.
---
lmao this season is the most casual thing to ever exist. There's nothing legendary or hardcore about grinding.
---
Well I don't have anything like that, but in any case, I thought this was a known aspect of the game design which I simply disagree with.
---
Maybe this is something that some players should test?
---
Respawns cost capsüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Good luck with that...
---
dailies takes only 20-30mins at least for me. but i exclude nw &amp; levelup challenges. depends if i feel doing it like nw: place camp x3. very easy. upon start of battle, just place camp around 3x, done. quit. sorry to my team nw mates. hehe. for levelup, if it's around 70-80%, im going to push it. lets say another 10-20mins.
---
I have a lot of ideas. The Legendary Score is just grindy as hell. I really agree with what you are saying.
---
I never got stuck like that before. Maybe because I dont use PA. But if I will, I will remember of you. &lt;3
---
Pacifist is the one thing that is working as stated.
---
Maybe just take the shop and get the hell out of there?
---
You don't need to go to the workbench to claim, anywhere inside the radius will do.
---
No, since I don't like devoting 3 points for partial protection so I can use an explosive weapon. If fireproof gave 90%, I would think about it.
---
Therefore, I don't use explosive, and in this case I didn't even have time to draw any weapon before I was dead.
---
Found a Assaultron Blade Sword the same a few days ago, Bloodied/SwingSpeed/+1 STR. Thought I'd won the lottery.
---
It was lv35.
---
That‚Äôs a good point. I‚Äôd forgotten about the ad posters. It‚Äôs like *all* camp lighting has been inadvertently boosted. I‚Äôd hoped a community rep might‚Äôve replied to this thread by now, as even just acknowledging the issue (little as that might mean these days) would be somewhat reassuring to me. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve done even that much so far.
---
This is not an MMO.
---
It would invigorate the caps economy, as they would actually be useful again. Balancing the cost could also include a level cap above which it would apply, so that new players are not drained. Perhaps lvl 50 would be a good cap, where you can be considered an "adult" and therefore responsible for getting death insurance... Death has a monetary cost in many games, like Borderlands or GTA. Obviously people that want everything will not like this, but that is not he point here.
---
i found a way to speedup critical shots. use only weaker guns like 10mm pistol. go to weak group of mobs like the liberators near fo76 entrance. the scorcheds in gauley mines, hardware near nuka plant. or super mutantsbon grafton dam. spam vats-shots, then crit. repeat. easy. optional: add perks or guns with vats faster refill or less crit vats consumption
---
You are lvl 200 and you never completed the SBQ event? You get a couple repair kits every time. Look in your inventory, MISC tab I believe. They actually have weight, so if I was you, I‚Äôd check it out.
---
I literally took the workshop, went to my map to fast travel, and died, then listened while the other player sunk another 250 rounds into my corpse as I tried to dismiss the revenge dialog and respawn.
---
I didn't expect another playerto be hanging around waiting to kill whoever took the workshop
---
Possible? Yes. If you are inexperienced it may prove to be a challenge though.
---
Ha. Nice one!
---
Yeah I'm with you on that point. The lack of BoS items or item I want for my character at all make me thinging about not playn Season 2 at all
---
Simple solution ... change the exchange rate of a duplicate from 1 to 100.  Done!
---
Everything is possible depending on your build, level, and weapons
---
I like this. I like in lore ways to do things. Much better that "perk coins" for instance, sounds like a free to play mobile game and not a post nuclear role playing game.
---
I never played starcraft, I only play competitive shooters and survival games, Fallout is as far as I'll stray.
---
They need to fashion the teleportation devices they use to appear on roofs and through solid concrete.
---
Only thing me and my friend had an issue with is the encryptid event and a few wondering to the wrong place at low levels but I‚Äôm level 57 and he‚Äôs level 47 we‚Äôre decent at the game. Normal sb are easy with my ultracite Gatling laser. Just wondered before starting to prep for it today thanks
---
I mean that I don't have hundreds of advanced repair kits. Maybe 25 or something.
---
ESO's end game point system is non-destructive; for a flat fee one can respec the entire skill tree. The ESO system is enjoyable, and does not punish anyone for making bad choices with their end-game points. 
---
By no means do I suggest that FO76 should try and mimic ESO with everything they do, but look at the mechanics that work and learn from that. I agree with the op that Bethesda needs to take a step back and start over with this system. If it doesn't work, scrap it and start over.
---
[Timetable](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
People kill it solo, os yeah it possible. 100% dependent on your gear and build though
---
I didn‚Äôt play for a week and I‚Äôm like 12 spaces away just casual like
---
Ah I see. Well I wish I could trade them because they eat over 40lbs of my inventory and I am too greedy to drop them. 
---
Knowing my luck, if I dropped like 75% of them, Bethesda would remove them from the loot table the very next day ;)
---
She is a lot tougher than a regular scorchbeast, but you won‚Äôt know unless you try!
---
That'd be funny buuuuut... If they just immediately prompted you with "would you like to respect your special points? " it'd be impossible to abuse in a punch bowl..
---
You also need to take into account the stuff like extra challenges that they threw our way to try and make up for the SCORE auto-complete bug, however. I doubt it‚Äôll be as generous next season.
---
I hate grinding.    
---
My main char is 104 and all MMOs especially this one is at it's core a time sink.    
---
This char will get 3 but needing 100 for one rank? That's stupid. The material thing with Atlas - Another time sink for very little reward.    
---
I like your suggestions better than theirs. They know there's enough people obsessed with Fallout that they'll simply play and consume.
---
Did you share the right calendar? Neither thing OP asked about are on there.
---
Thanks man. I want to fight it but just kinda worried it will wreck us like the encrypted event
---
Alright then, when us heavy hitters aren‚Äôt there putting down the Queen because your little food build can‚Äôt handle her, we‚Äôll see who‚Äôs whinging and bitching about everything being too hard. Yeah?
---
Ohio river adventures, all the life savers there. Pool tables in Morgantown, Bolton greens, ws golf club, fort defiance.
---
Colossal Problem  is starting tomorrow probably around 11-12ish EST(later if update goes poorly), the last patch downloaded the files for it but I would assume there to be a small download.
---
Hmm couldn‚Äôt find anything on the specific start dates of the events, just what we need to do to unlock meat week
---
Saw this and thought of you.  
---
 https://imgur.com/s1jqHGP
---
This comment though...
---
Because Russell is both an incredible moron and also incredibly lucky,  he's siphoning everyone's luck when they buy from the purveyor to keep the raids away
---
I totally feel your pain. It feels kinda like having two jobs - one to pay the bills, and a part-time job to grind SCORE. Sadly work had me travel for a few weeks so I missed a whole lot of play, so I'm still in the 40's on the board, with little hope of completing it on time. Instead of more dailies, we need more weeklies in order to get enough SCORE to catch up. At least that's my case. C'est la vie eh.
---
I took over a week off and I'm still level 72
---
Actually it does have meat week but I couldn‚Äôt find anything on a colossal problem
---
Take nuclear winter out of beta and add a new map. Nerf the spawn rate of grenades in each match or give us a perk card to help defend ourselves from getting 1 shotted from a grenade or gauss shitgun. Buff stimpack spawn rate. Some matches about 5mins in I'll have 1 stim and 6 to 7 grenades.
---
I would recommend doing it on a public server so you can get some help. She does not go down easy. She does not do as much damage as the imposter, but has much more health. And isn't on the ground most of the time making her even harder to kill
---
They said that A Colossal problem would hopefully be active within 2 weeks, I believe all they need to do is a hotfix to activate it, as the content was in the last update, but depending on how much or what they change, I guess that could change. I'm expecting it after the reset in just over 24 hours, but Bethesda haven't really said anything official that I have seen. As for Meat week, I'm pretty sure its due for mid september (14th-21st I think?), I assume thats probably already in the game aswell, as far as I know its not a new event, though some of the rewards may be.
---
Are you holding a rabbits foot and throwing salt over your shoulder before sacrificing a goat to Todd Howard?
---
But you don‚Äôt get XP from not doing anything?
---
Ah I usually wait for the normal ones come down so I can wreck them guess it forces me to be more ‚Äúcreative‚Äù
---
They need to remake their piss-poor excuse of a company.
---
No, it's not about multiple ways. It's about one way that captures the relevant data, manages that data properly and isn't the laziest possible way of doing it. I literally do this stuff as a job, Bethesda's defect and test management seems to be virtually non-existent
---
The problem with yoh caps idea whats to stop people from dying, respawning at camp then just fast traveling back. All that would accomplish is just being as annoying as the rng.
---
Yeah I remember the dame. LEVEL 45. Mahogany handle and polished steel body. Quad capacity, vats crit, and two shot, a real dream for my new pistol character. 
---
I mean I've found some good weapons before but this pistol really blew me away. My melee character never gets items, it's all +1 powerfists and vampire knuckles but no.... not today. Today I found a good gun and my badass female gunslinger character will FINALLY...
---
*server crash*
---
AND THEN WHEN I RELOGGED IT WAS GONE AND IN ALL MY HOURS I HAVE NEVER FOUND A GUN NEAR AS GOOD.
---
Yeah, timezones in their *own country*.
---
You can‚Äôt have your cake and eat it forever. No?
---
Ok how about this? 
---
Lord Toddington the III ‚Äúno prefix rules forever, bloodied.‚Äù
---
Here's a trick - listen to the sonic generator. After a wave is dead, count 7 cycles then toss grenades, you'll hit almost all the mobs getting you a good amount of xp. The timing is a bit tricky but you can get a feel for it and learn when to chuck your grenades for max carnage.
---
6 months after launch?
---
This. People act like bloodied is berserkers when it‚Äôs definitely not.
---
Definitely give it a go is you want, it could be fun. But she is much much stronger than a normal sb. Has a built in 70% damage reduction as well as her armour, and she likes to fly around a lot haha
---
The normal ones either just sit in the sky and scream or land and get wrecked Hopefully all goes well
---
100% possible even solo, but entirely dependent on your build and experience.
---
Anywhere with pool tables so Fort Defiance, The Bounty, Bolton Greens, Summersville ( house nearest spawn point ), the house near the Flatwoods relay and Fraternity Row. There's probably more. Also cigarette packets which are every where. Also life preservers so Ohio River Adventures, Bolton Greens again and Wavy Willards.
---
Do literally i do everytime
---
Exactly. One could argue that you should also lose your junk if you do not pay those caps and respawn somewhere else. The issue at hand is the dying is meaningless right now, making bloodied a very low risk undertaking for an extremely large reward.
---
Must have high charisma too, since we're giving him all our scrap and getting not much in return.
---
Armor ace is gi Joe, but all the bos stuff happens next season too
---
This is the answer. It's been shown multiple times now that ghouls do turn feral occasionally and sometimes without warning. They aren't supposed to be zombies or even immortal, just live a lot longer than normal.
---
Thank you will probably need it gonna go capture monagah and Poseidon power plants so I can get some fusion core ammo first üòÇ
---
Doing more damage then the next two prefixes combined IS a problem. No one can really provide an argument otherwise that doesn‚Äôt devolve into bloodieds supposed defensive weaknesses, or lack thereof. You could remove nerd rage and adrenal right now and bloodied would still do way too much damage. 
---
Hell, we aren‚Äôt even factoring in unyielding yet, or serendipity.
---
But gaining resources is the raison d'etre of this Games existence..
---
Speaking of which, it's annoying there isn't actually one there, only a normal stash box.
---
He isn't the Brotherhood, he's just some guy.
---
I understand it's only a matter of opinion, but this does not look futuristic at all to me.
---
The notion I got from their design choices for legendary perk system is that it's again balanced around those that exploited the shit out of early xp farms after launch and are now in the thousands of level. Bethesda wanted to ensure those don't easily get 'all' the perks at once...while completely shafting the rest of the playerbase again. They tried it with the bullion system for dupers but missed their target there already anyway and will miss their target with this perk system too. While normal players might've missed out on crucial coins because of duplicate cards those high levels players might still have enough spare cards to get all legendary perks anyway.
---
Its like the crack of dawn Monday morning, to be fair.
---
Well they are worth a lot of the more important junk and useful in the field, so I wouldn't let them go either.
---
They just need to add a respec option for perk points, nothing else should be required apart from maybe a reasonable caps charge that increases with each respec ala ESO.
---
We have enough grind for bullion, scrip and soon perk coins as it is.
---
Shotguns are not as common as automatic rifles but yeah they can wreck if they are used with someone perked out of shotguns.
---
This was one thing I thought as well. Factions would take each and you could gain/lose rep from the encounter. Once the map had all the workshops taken then the true fight for Appalachia would begin. But then I remember World of Warcraft and the area of Silithus where they tried something like it and it didn't go as planned.
---
No, you‚Äôre not ready.
---
The mobs will wipe the floor with you.
---
I'm just wanting to know what they did with all that cork.
---
perhaps that's the reason behind my troubled relationship with this game.
---
personally I very much prefer to tell Bethesda to shove their inane busywork and play my own way.
---
I would certainly hope so.
---
Mobs aren‚Äôt the issue I can easily dispatch groups of enemies with a Tesla rifle and legendary tse railway rifle. I was just worried about an insanely over damaging boss basically one hitting me
---
&gt; I think you willfully misunderstood mine
---
I did not, I just do not agree with it.
---
Yes, it would be a great idea for an event, but Bethesda would make it that the event would give zero reputation and drop terrible loot, which would then, in turn, make it a terrible, pointless event which feels completely unrewarding... wait I'm sure I've done an event like that before.
---
No clue if you can cripple him. But enforced with shotguns or one gun army with heavy weapons both help you cripple things
---
Honestly, just expect to get killed at least once. If you need to do the event dump your junk and go. Even if you die, hammer the crap out of it so at least you‚Äôll get the loot. Even at my level it gets me every now and then, I gave up mainlining stimpacks and just die. Failing that something with vampire, a high fire rate and a large magazine.
---
Lol jnco jeans someone is showing their age.
---
Those should come with a 1% damage reduction and +1 disease resistance due to their drafty nature preventing swamp nuts
---
I said I wasn‚Äôt interested in continuing the *debate*. You didn‚Äôt continue the debate. Neither did I.
---
You‚Äôve fought the Queen before, right?
---
Also, in private works there is the 120% glitch, where mobs will spawn at a higher rate...just saying, it‚Äôs a whole different experience if you don‚Äôt have several guns to cover you as you kill the Queen.
---
Is there one for rifles too? Or is it just shotguns and heavy weapons?
---
I said in a different post that I've handed  in over 300 tickets and never seen the shot gun but had ski sword 50 times.....I think the shorty is a myth.
---
Perk cards are ok, re-work the coin system.
---
I don't think rifles have one
---
ahh i wondered why I was mobbed by eyebots last time I was there
---
:(
---
More hp isn't any more challenge, just more time and bullets.  That's all this is.
---
I just want Todd to get off his butt and add a new map to nuclear winter. I rarely play adv mode anymore because of nuclear winter but I get what u are saying about the PA. When someone takes PA out of their inventory then places it on the ground, another player cannot do damage to it then either. It shouldn't receive any damage after u are already dead. Idk why this is.
---
&gt;just had my first
---
congrats on your first, of many to come.
---
Always get a few shots in at the imposter right at the start, even if it's cloaked. The pseudo-damage you're (not) doing apparently still counts for loot contribution.
---
As to your original question: because Bethesda is
---
1) really not that good at thinking through the incentive structures in their game (see also the mad XP rush for the Legendary Run leading to loads and loads of failed Radiation Rumble events) or  
---
2) not interested in incentivizing good team play or  
---
3) all of the above.
---
There are blueprints and legacy camps but there also still exists different methods of stacking them unfortunately... it's best to try and keep your junk stored at all times until they fix it
---
Yep. I can't play every day due to work. Likely will have to pay at least some to finish the season. And I am already burned out on this. I don't care about future seasons. They need to make the challenges either weekly only or even monthly. Could still have a small daily repeatable.
---
I like this. Just earning a legendary perk pick every 50th level and not having to deal with any bull or yet another currency sounds great.
---
You need raw flux, high rad fluids, and hardened masses (the latter 2 collected from enemy's in nuke zones)
---
I've been to that spot too. It's nice up there
---
Won‚Äôt help if it gets killed to quickly. 
---
Just this weekend I activate the event, ended up tanking three pylons because no one else would, turned round to shoot her with my Vamp UGL, she‚Äôs dead. I was literally the entire reason the event was on and the reason they could kill her, got f‚Äôall because selfish prick lords killed her too quickly.
---
That's what I call a real commando build right there!
---
have you done the sbq before. what were your damage numbers on her. if you're using gattlin laser you need to be doing minimum of 20 damage per hit to put her down in the time limit.
---
 she scales her defence to the number of players in the event too so it's not hard to kill her solo or group of 2 with the right set up.
---
my build hits her in the head for 250-450 per shot to the head depending on distance and adrenaline. it takes 5 min for me to solo kill. my wife has a similar build and together it's a 3 min fight.
---
good luck
---
Where do u craft the pure flux?
---
I feel like it's the chemist work bench
---
There is more to the world than the US
---
You should earn 1 legendary perk slot per 50 levels and max out at 5. All cards are automatically unlocked as level 1 and only increase in level with experience gained while that legendary perk card is equipped.
---
https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs
---
That why I solo. Other players just screw it up.
---
She does not scale with the players there.
---
This is hopefully just a baseline to make future balancing more easy.
---
The same happend to me but with a mothman. It was quite fun running around with a mothman following you but once a  player shot at him he disappeared:(
---
Remake the whole game*
---
I mean, you have to play on double score and extra challenges weekends, but if you go for it you should get really far. Grind xp while doing challenges and I dont see why you cant finish
---
Lmao. So if there is another exposed dupe I'll get some more god roll guns
---
she's no supposed to but does. she gets more defence to a max out at 5 players.
---
I built it, checked it out, then deleted it to never be built again.....
---
You're right, it's been a while since I actually talked to him, I always assumed with the outfit he was part of BOS. When you talk to him he actually says he's nothing to do with them, lol. So basically we're giving some random guy that has nothing really to do with BOS 1.2bn supplies that he's going to use to make sure they already have everything they need when they finally do arrive.
---
There's definitely some logic there somewhere, I'm just yet to find it. So it actually makes it worse, he is just some random member of society, armed with only a clipboard, defending billions of caps worth of supplies from the dangers of Appalachia.
---
This is a huge feature we need. It would eliminate extra cards taking up space for nothing. Legendary cards should not run on points for scrapping old cards.
---
I wish I could say me.
---
I really, really do.
---
Yes.
---
There should be a radio station that only plays Queen
---
Colossal Problem Starts tomorrow and meat week Thursday according to the inside the vault article.
---
Here lately, meat piles have just been appearing as the actual loot itself sporadically.
---
It's even worse with melee weapons. I am hitting the enemy both in and out of vats but they arent losing health
---
I thought they nerfed the large gifts.how many caps per do you get.also heard they added weight.i have 3 gifts on display would love to get 1 large and a few of the small and medium to display
---
You gotta remember the BoS that are coming don‚Äôt even know that Russel is collecting supplies for their arrival. All he did was intercept a message.
---
  Peaceful until nukes start flyin
---
Yes they fixed it. Just their definition of "fixed"...
---
I will not because I am not a child that throws a fit over stupid shit.
---
It's the perk Tormentor in the luck tree for crippling with rifles.
---
Do any of you play on Xbox and are looking for a sqb fight üòÇ
---
There is, it's called Tormentor and it's under lucky in the special categories
---
PC, sorry
---
Oh, this guy said 1-3 hours.
---
Dude, I don't even need to respond. You've made my case better than I could ever have.
---
You've explicitly proven the case of why so many players, especially veteran ones like myself, dozens that I know personally and many others, consider Fed76's pricing a joke. You openly admit to not reflecting average, in-game pricing at all. That's a hell of an admission.
---
You've saved me so much time arguing over whether or not Fed76 is a fair and realistic pricing tool to go by. I just need to show a screen cap of this and I'm done.
---
Thank you so much for your responses and candour. I really do mean it.
---
Something is definitely wrong with level 100 scorchbeasts.  Myself (level ~295 bloodied commando) and two other level 300-400 players (a heavy gunner and a stealth rifleman) FAILED Surface to Air given a single 1 star level 100 and never even got the health low enough for it to mutate.  We all died several times and in the end the SB just flew away.
---
I had a second encounter with a level 100, non legendary SB last night and gave up after I put about 300 rounds of 5.56 into it and had only dropped the health about 20%.  Also, the poison attack seems to have been buffed, or resistance nerfed.
---
Scorchbeasts should be harder than they are on the live server but this is just a waste of time, stimpaks and ammo.
---
Except for being steep ladders that's basically what they are...just, not.
---
In RL, any slanted ladder is little different from a very steep set of stairs.
---
In the game, stairs are all of a certain angle, however there are ladders that are of a range of different angles and sizes and those in the game design basically are acting as ramps...from shallow to very steep angles. So someone asking for a  ladder to fit a very small area is certainly doable. And yes, they COULD do an extremely steep set of stairs as well, but honestly it might look better being so steep as a ladder.
---
All they have to do is introduce legendary perk cards each with their own unique XP bar to increase levels while equipped. No dumb exchange system for old cards.
---
I like going into grind mode for stuff it‚Äôs like part of the game, smoke a zoot, go scavenging in first person. Bethesda classic. Just don‚Äôt get Over encumbered (the only true endgame).
---
I‚Äôve quit playing almost entirely. It‚Äôs boring as fuck now. The goals for the new shit are practically unreachable for me. That‚Äôs not fun.
---
Twas worth a shot I saw your solo video there and was intimidated until it started cutting a fat rug
---
Are all your buddies bloodied builds? I can‚Äôt imagine the changes being implemented are that dramatic &amp; for the ‚Äúworse‚Äù that THIS is the breaking point where they say ‚ÄúNo more‚Äù... I personally am looking forward to the changes but I don‚Äôt one shot kill things because that‚Äôs not fun, Not even a firefight, That‚Äôs just exploiting bad game design hence I am looking forward to changes making the game overall better
---
Bro... I don't think anything they build is natural. Mothman is lorewise a legit supernatural creature. Those roots are definitely a result of it's powers. Same with the old one in lucky hole mine. They're linked.
---
I don't know why there aren't several more nw maps, and the ability to choose the map before joining a lobby. Voting is blah.
---
I got very metal gear solid vibes from it
---
What reason would anyone have to go there? Even when it was open when we could walk around inside you could find a few terminals and maybe a toolbox or two with some stuff in but it's not like there was a stockpile of food or military equipment there. The Observatory was mostly empty. The infrastructure of the place will likely be built up by the Brotherhood when they arrive.
---
Plus just because we can intercept a jumbled and broken transmission on our Pipboy doesn't mean that Crater or Foundation can. Meg is too busy dealing with a brewing uprising against her in Crater to probably care, and even if Paige is aware Russel was one of them and can act as an ambassador for Foundation anyway. 
---
Until the Brotherhood arrive and we get to see how many there are and how well equipped they are it seems counter intuitive to make a move against ATLAS until they show up.
---
So its more of a challenge to kill them
---
people are allowed to not like huge changes in game. if they dont want to keep playing after a big alteration to a game after 2 years, they can. doesnt automatically mean they are a "child that throws a fit over stupid shit."
---
saying shit like that just makes YOU look like a child throwing a temper tantrum over the idea someone might throw a temper tantrum. its dumb.
---
In every single Fallout, i've always wondered why sitting down anywhere doesn't let you use your Pip-Boy. I would sit down more often.
---
I do as well, that made the whole system palatable
---
Oh no...they‚Äôll have to work for a living.
---
Amazing how entitled people are nowadays.
---
I bet u could show me how to get good in nuclear winter. Crouch walk, aim down sights the entire game, hide in bushes, 3rd party every fight. Mad because I can't use vats on other players
---
I am so angry I didn't know about this til now. Spent hours last night making a new camp and it's not on map. How does Bethesda let crap like this remain?
---
Hell ya man
---
Here is the trick with workshops 
---
A only use the workshop resources.  They provide enough 
---
Don‚Äôt over build.  You really don‚Äôt need a super complex defense.   
---
Lock your resource extractors
---
If at all possible use a private world.  
---
Re: fusion cores.   They take up a ton of stash space.  I‚Äôm constantly dropping 100% cores I get from events and daily rewards because I already have 10.  I don‚Äôt really need more than 10 at a time
---
Re: screws/junk.   I have over 1k screws in my FO1st stash. Along with thousands and thousands of other resources.  My point is.  If you pickup everything you run across as you farm. I mean everything.  I‚Äôm a Hoover vacume.  I just rapid fire e and spray the screen.   You will have more resources than you need plus you are constantly resetting loot table so the good stuff respawn a the next time you visit 
---
Suggestion: buy 1 month of FO1st.  Use the private world to farm workshops and stock up the stash then you can cancel and use the stash as a dispenser till you need to restock 
---
It‚Äôs a huge QOL change.  I couldn‚Äôt play with out my camp and stash so the yearly is worth it to me
---
Just some tips
---
That does make sense simply because some of the trees they use in their buildings are huge, that body creeped me out the first time I saw it.
---
25-1500 is what I usually get
---
Got in a routine of muting my tv for 30 seconds every time I'd log in just so I wouldn't have to hear it for the 800th time.
---
I (thought) I had a glitch that wouldn't let me go forward with her mission as every time I went to turn it in she'd just say the same "I saw you with the Overseer" canned line. 
---
Finally read an old thread from here that mentioned finishing a different mission chain (That dealt with Madigan) first and that would free her up to continue the wastelanders stuff. Thankfully that worked and I was able to get past the...
---
"If you ever try to screw me oveeeeer"
---
Thankfully I've avoided the Grafton Mayor on this alt. ;p
---
Just curious, i know theyrw way tougher, but did you guys try to usw strategy and cripple the wings?
---
I agree. I'd love larger, non-light lettering to post messages for all my camp visitors.
---
Just curious if you got that discord...pm me ?
---
That‚Äôs a fair question. 
---
The first answer is: **Resource Management**.
---
The average person would probably prefer to play on the weekends, and in a long play session. If the majority of players did that, then server strain would be much higher on weekends, more so than they already are. 
---
It‚Äôs like traffic. Rush hour exists because so many people are using the same resource at the same time. But if everyone had different start/stop times/days for their work shifts, rush hour would no longer be a problem. 
---
Same concept applies here. We all know FO76 servers aren‚Äôt always the most stable. So time-gating is a way to spread out the workload. 
---
Second: **Profitability Management**
---
Without a time-gate, far more players would grind out the entire run in a much shorter time span. This means that there are fewer players that will decide to purchase ranks. Additionally, by getting players to log in daily, Bethesda gets to show them new items in the Atomic Shop more frequently. That‚Äôs repeated advertising. 
---
So, in short, time-gating helps with server stability and product profitability (which in turn leads to product longevity). 
---
These ‚Äòpros‚Äô are more beneficial to Bethesda than the players, but still of some benefit to us. 
---
Having said that, let me point out that a reason is not an excuse. The servers should be stable enough to handle a large player population. And a product should be high enough quality to sustain its own profitability. 
---
There are better methods to encouraging daily logins besides time-gating progress.
---
I've played PTS and I'm really pissed off with those changes, especially with the fact that they've nerfed the damage by half while simultaneously introducing lvl100 bullet-sponges enemies. And even though most of my characters are able to kill those sponges with 3-4 shots, I can only imagine how much ammo will use non-minmaxed players. In my opinion it's not fun as it is on PTS now. What's more, I also don't appreciate change to Legendary Perks - now they're not account wise, but character-wise. And again - high level character shouldn't have problem with upgrading few cards they'll use, but to fully upgrade 7 cards I estimate lvl 1000+ will be required. It's too much in my opinion. My 640lvl character could only do 3 out of 7 cads to max lvl and I had 250+ levels untouched and 30+ perk cards sets unopened waiting to be scrapped. Either make Legendary Cards give more coins when scrapped or change back to account-wise coins pool.
---
You don't get enough lunchboxes to use on a daily basis so I did not include them
---
I would join you but my daughter is currently not allowing me to play haha
---
Okay thanks!
---
Yes. They're going to have supply issues, or underestimate demand. It's happened on every system launch going back to the SNES. People storm their local Walmart, buy all 4 systems they have available, then sell them on Amazon or Ebay for 500%+ markup. Happens every time, and yet people still act surprised. This won't calm down for at least 6 months, and won't fully normalize for 6 months after that (still paying premium prices, and no used market). Even then, the bugs won't be fully worked out, or discovered (i.e. the xbox 360 red ring of death).
---
Kudos for the honesty.
---
This is pretty much what I expect the majority of those against the change will do. You may not like it but you're not going to quit over it.
---
TSE nerf back in the day was all bark and no bite. I expect no different here.
---
I just froze up for a moment reading the title...
---
As I scrapped one last night for steel.
---
Thought I was about to find out I could've made a fortune selling it instead!
---
But yea, to answer your question, they exist in game.
---
I think each gives between 25 to 250 caps. They  weight 0.01 each I think.
---
I mean you‚Äôd be more than welcome to if you were allowed but what the young lady says goes lol. If you‚Äôre still interested it won‚Äôt be until tonight I woke up early for a change and just came to grind before my groups on
---
It can be soloed, so yes but your build and kit will matter as to how realistic an endeavour it is.
---
&gt; if they dont want to keep playing after a big alteration to a game after 2 years, they can. doesnt automatically mean they are a "child that throws a fit over stupid shi
---
When the change they are quitting over is Bethesda addressing serious power imbalances and removing the ability for a single build to solo a boss with a build in 60-70% damage reduction in 2 minutes that is a child throwing a tantrum over stupid shit.
---
Ya ofc I'll let you know so you know where to not go
---
They should have moved the purveyor to whitespring s instead of that shitty mine bar
---
I usually get eyebots. I think it happens when the area recovers from being nuked.
---
nah, just know how to react to what weapons you get. get competent in sniping, autos, explosive, and shotguns. its not hard, just takes time.
---
&gt; Look, you clearly missed the point of my post
---
No no, I understood the point you were making. It's just that you're wrong.
---
&gt; I will say it again in simpler words. Its your fault if you feel tired if you grinded the event and finished it a month early.
---
Yeah, this is exactly what you're wrong about.
---
I actually haven't finished the event yet, not even close, seeing as though each level still remaining will require more and more S.C.O.R.E. to finish, and I've been doing all of the available challenges every day, barring 2000 points that disappeared into limbo because of the challenges for that day completing automatically.
---
I also haven't farmed the 10000 XP repeatable a single time beyond the times it completes while doing the level up challenge. And, to be honest, I wasn't even complaining that I am personally getting tired of the system; I responded to you trying to shut people up with this thread of yours, something you shouldn't be doing, because you being annoyed by other people's valid feedback isn't a relevant thing, and because you thought that you're somehow in charge, deciding who gets to speak and who doesn't, deciding what is "valid" and what isn't, thinking your opinion somehow matters more than anyone else's.
---
As far as me being tired of daily chores goes, that happened years and years ago in WoW, so I've got plenty of experience, both from myself, as well as all of my friends in WoW, as well as any other games that have had daily chores in the past decade and a half, or however long daily chores have existed in games, about how daily chores can burn people out.
---
But yes. I, too, feel like the chores are burning me out, because they're there, every day, and it's not immediately clear from looking at the game board how many days I could skip doing them. Throw on top of that the daily limits in caps, scrip, bullion and so on, and there's plenty of incentive to log in every day. Remember your own words? Here, let me quote you from a couple comments back:
---
&gt; They are actively trying to get you to play every day.
---
Yeah. You're 100% correct. They *are* trying to do that. And they are actually succeeding. And that's the problem. And that's what people are giving feedback on. Because they're getting burnt out by Bethesda succeeding in getting people to log in every single day.
---
&gt; If you have a legit complaint about anything else regarding the Legendary Run then its great you provide feedback.
---
What you don't seem to be understanding is that you are not someone who gets to decide what is a "legit complaint" and what is not. Which is why I wish you hadn't thought that you getting annoyed by other people's "legit complaints", to borrow your own description of the feedback - and legit those complaints indeed are, regardless of what you're trying to say - was somehow justification for you to try and gatekeep and shut them up, because now I've been dragged into a completely pointless back and forth with some random person on the internet who thinks they're so important that they need to tell people what to shut up about, and it just sucks.
---
My GT is Zachy Chan13 feel free to add me. And if I'm on I'm always down for a Queen
---
Old enemies from past fallout games
---
If the crash wasn't just your client but the world, why would you expect any of your stuff to remain at all? It would have been wiped with the crash.
---
Can confirm, just download it to datamine ATX.
---
same, or when i go AFK in vendor mode while i work
---
How do you get your depth of field to not look like shit? This looks good!
---
The fact that you disagree with me or don‚Äôt understand my point doesn‚Äôt make me ‚Äòobtuse‚Äô. My point is clearly presented and I‚Äôve broken down my analogy as simply as possible. 
---
Let me try again. 
---
Monkey A press button. Monkey A get one treat.
---
Monkey B press button. Monkey B get five treats.
---
Is that fair?
---
I dont understand the outrage over this. Yeah i know people have been collecting and trading for some weapons to stay meta, but this game is so easy and nothing is a challenge anymore. I started a new character and got it to lvl 50 and im one shotting the lvl 90 deathclaw, thats just not right.
---
Might be just me, but I welcome the change.
---
Another man that‚Äôs reddit handle is his gt same boat here: dizzydeaths
---
They are probably at max caps
---
I haven't even been to ATLAS and log in to claim rewards.
---
Well slightly different haha. Makes things easier to remember
---
Yeah, like someone has a scavenger collectron set to "stupid shit".
---
I am excited to see what they will do
---
Which platform?
---
people move on from games to you know.
---
people quit because of grind, people quit because of bugs, people quit because of content droughts, people quit because of meta changes. its like this in every game.
---
Just stop your fallout 1st member ship
---
I disagree,
---
-getting duplicate cards isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpunishing‚Äù while yes veteran players like myself will have fewer cards since they where discarded previously, cards are no longer being discarded in the current build of the game. ‚ÄúNot even
---
-yes you‚Äôre right the levels required ARE astronomical that‚Äôs the whole idea, and in every case the rank 1 card provides most/all of the value of the card, which is why leveling them up is less important comprared to just getting to level 300 and unlocking all the slots. ‚ÄúNot really legendary‚Äù what are you talking about? 
---
-if you want to scrap all your cards because you don‚Äôt need them that‚Äôs your choice, I‚Äôm going to keep collecting cards until I get all ranks all animated. And I‚Äôll scrap all the duplicate cards that would have been discarded previously.
---
Also I think it‚Äôs funny you call out bethesda that they aren‚Äôt learning but the truth is, they know EXACTLY what they‚Äôre doing, this is ‚Äúnearly-infinite journey‚Äù IS going to work, it‚Äôs going to be fun for many players, and it‚Äôs going an exciting part of the game for people who use them. Just look at Colossal Problem and Far-Flung Fireworks, this perk card is perfect for this event! Just kill one of the many Windigo spawn for it to explode, then the AOE damage to splash on all the other nearby enemies. And guess what? Only rank 1 is needed for this effect, higher ranks only needed to make this happen more consistent and reliable. There defiantly a lot more thought about this system then you think, even if it means your unhappy you can‚Äôt get each and every rank right away. Keep an open mind out there. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Thanks.would it be worth trading for say 500 to 1k gifts just to keep to stay at max caps always?or is that too obvious and just asking for a ban.I wouldn't think so but never owned more than 20 gifts at a time
---
because you can never have enough berserkers broadsiders or zealots missile launchers.
---
Keep sharing perk cards
---
&gt; im not upset with the people who killed it, im upset with bethesda 
---
This is precisely the right attitude to have. 
---
I hate it when players blame other players for something that ultimately only Bethesda can solve.
---
There are two sections. One has you destroy the mainframes, another has you repair 15 mainframe cores and replace them. 
---
You've either done it and forgot, someone on your team did it without you knowing... or you've never launched a nuke. ;p
---
Purchased fallout 1st actually. Regret not doing it sooner for the tent. Very handy to just dump junk. Thanks for the rest of the advice though. I will take it on board.
---
I wont lie I'm not up to date on the legendary system and what it offers/ how it is supposed to work as it seems overly complicated for something that is just supposed to make the game more enjoyable. So what im about to say may completely miss the point and be partly possible in the new system but I just want to say it;
---
I've played ESO for a long time and they do it really well where you can change basically everything about your character for a fee that is universal thoughoutt the general play of the game; gold. And they have a champion level system too after Max level, which again can be completely reallocated for an exchange of gold. I mean why punish the end game players who have earned those ranks and stop them from changing how they want to allocate things?  It literally affects no other players as everyone has the option at that level, that's the incentive to get there.
---
What Fallout needs is an easy way to reallocate all your special points for some Caps or something and then be able to slot in the perk cards you have already obtained up to that point and any that you use future level ups to obtain. And if you have useless cards already then trade them in for a currency where then a certain number of that currency can buy you other cards you want.
---
It's the not being able to move SPECIAL around easily that drives me away, I'm bored of my heavy gunner build now, but to switch to a rifle build I need to use numerous level up points to move my special and then more level ups to get the cards I want. Then what if I get bored with that and wanna go back or try something new, gotta do it all again, why?. Who does it affect if I just pay caps to move my special when I want? It would make the game and diversity so much more enjoyable. And I know I could just create a new character but then what about all the character locked items on my main character? I have to get it all again and that's a lot of work and isnt rewarding either. Not to mention theres no easy way to move items between characters, ESO has a bank which is account wide and the items can be accessed on any character you have.....
---
Rant over haha
---
Also I have seen a few posts of a new vendor glitch where people have had items from their stash stolen.  I am not high level but I stored my vending machines.  I dont want my stuff stolen.
---
&gt; introducing lvl100 bullet-sponges enemies   
---
  most of my characters are able to kill those sponges with 3-4 shots   
---
lol
---
Those guys own Appalachia, not crater or foundation. They have larger numbers and more territory.
---
Yeah.. Tons of supernatural stuff is canon. Mothman, Sheepsquatch (not technically supernatural but it's the real deal and not a result of mutations), The mannequins (they're actually alive and possessed by an old one), Ghosts, Poltergeists, Aliens (they aren't technically supernatural but I'm counting them. Canon wise they shot down the space station that is now crator), The god cult of Atom worships,  Residual hauntings (there's a church in the mire that's haunted and it only happens at night), Wendigos (I'm pretty sure they're the real deal... There's a quest that gets you the mounted wendigo that shows it's got some relation to the cult).The old ones in both lucky hole mine and the deep, there's actual legit psychics and even an immortal man with godly powers in fo4, and I suspect the gnomes and teddy bears are haunted too but that's just speculation on my part.
---
What makes you think it was a server crash? My client crashed. A server crash would likely have brought me to the game menu. Regardless, when you disconnect, it would be good to get resources back from workshops rather than it just vanishing
---
Every other battle pass I've seen was like this. BO4 passes required you to play every day and that got you a little ahead. You had something like 30 days for 50 tiers, and everything after that was just a reserve case. It took many matches to get through a single tier, and you got one tier skip per day from playing. If you played an hour a day every day, you would finish it in the last week. If you missed some of the daily skips and just wanted to grind it out, it took HOURS AND HOURS to do that.
---
In case people don't realize it yet, THAT'S THE POINT. They WANT you to play every day, feel pressured into spending money on rewards you missed. This has been blatant for years now, I don't know how it's causing so much confusion here.  If anything, f76 is more generous than the others. It's a much longer season, which means if you're one of the people who wants to power grind to make up for losses, you get much more time to do so. And as others have said, the people who play every day and do all the challenges have been reaching the end for the past few weeks, with 1-2 months to spare, so clearly you're allowed to miss some
---
If I‚Äôm honest thought it was a Jackie chan joke at first ha
---
It's good for insulating
---
I wasn't meaning to make a move against ATLAS, I was meaning that there are plenty of scavengers in-game currently that roam around looking for places of interest to gather supplies, you're telling me that it's highly unlikely someone would come across all the billions of caps worth of supplies? Or that word of mouth wouldn't have let people know something is going on near the ATLAS Observatory and that there is just some guy with a clipboard defending it? The point is that the whole thing doesn't really make much sense and even less sense when you look at it in more detail.
---
That was the original inspiration haha
---
Indeed indeed
---
It gives the dates for Bonus weekend, the challende weed, purveyor sale, and meat week.
---
Is OP talking about different events?
---
Thats cute that you think your damage is needed that much.
---
That‚Äôs the fucker thanks I always forget it because I don‚Äôt spend any time there really
---
True, true. I forget the time gap.
---
OP asked about colosal problem and the first meat week
---
There's definitely more to the mothman cult than we can see.. I feel like they're setting something up with them for way,  way down the road.
---
Alright. Send me a video of you soloing the SBQ, without running the meta builds. Do it.
---
Dates, in their Order, taken from the events site.
---
August 20 - August 24
---
August 26 - August 31
---
September 10 - 14
---
September 22 - 28
---
Tbh i dun really care, the damage imbalance we have now is really insane.
---
And for people who owns a legacy the change might not hurt so much.
---
People were playing the game with their ez mode demigod build and are upset that it's getting nerfed. In an online game. You can't make this stuff up, it writes itself
---
Lol yikes
---
I did not know that about the Sheepsquatch, I seemed they where another FEV experiment, I think I need to do a lore run of this game.
---
That‚Äôs for the ‚Äúsecond helping‚Äù of meat week. We actually have a first round starting this Thursday.
---
&gt;Boost carrying capacity by a lot and even allow for container mods, similar to pocketed/deep pocketed.
---
Based on this comment alone, it seems like you haven't been around since beta. Before backpacks, people constantly complained about how they felt they were forced to carry PA around due to its carry weight.
---
I don't mind a carry weight focused set of PA but it'd have to be at the expense of combat effectiveness. You shouldn't be able to both be a tank and a walking fork lift.
---
Forgot glowing mass.  
---
3 ingredients and 10 raw flux makes one stable flux.  Get farming them nuke zones.
---
Alternatively you get flux for doing the scorched earth event.  It's a random mix of different types though so you have no control over what kinds you get.  Join the event whenever you can, just make sure not to die before you get to a stash box.  Flux rewards disappear if you die right after the event.  Even if you go back and retrieve your loot it will be gone.
---
I hope so, I want to know why they Mothman would help them.
---
Colossal Problem is afaik not a timed Event per se, but a permanent one that should drop with the next patch.
---
Right?!?!! You saw that too? Hilarious!
---
Yeah it's really interesting stuff. You learn about the sheepsquatch in a couple quests related to the taxidermy. It existed in pre war America.
---
There‚Äôs already a Fallout 76 build sub, r/Fallout76Builds. Or it might be r/fo76builds.
---
&gt; What makes you think it was a server crash? 
---
Reread my comment. The beginning part is very important.
---
First thing I always do is build a crafting bench and stash box at a workshop. Scrap and stash first.
---
Going to paste my comment from another comment, saves me making the same point twice :D 
---
&gt;You're right, it's been a while since I actually talked to him, I always assumed with the outfit he was part of BOS. When you talk to him he actually says he's nothing to do with them, lol. So basically we're giving some random guy that has nothing really to do with BOS 1.2bn supplies that he's going to use to make sure they already have everything they need when they finally do arrive.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;There's definitely some logic there somewhere, I'm just yet to find it. So it actually makes it worse, he is just some random member of society, armed with only a clipboard, defending billions of caps worth of supplies from the dangers of Appalachia.
---
That's your call. I wasn't aware that the gift boxes had been duped until I read about on reddit. There is not anything high end in them so I guess it's up to you. Not as if your using God mode to change stats or caps or give yourself 5 star legendary weapons/armour.
---
yup. misses too much while "95%" and sometimes doesn't even start VATS.   
---
The lag is getting worse and not only related to vats. I usually spend 3 to 5 stimpacks before the game actually heals me. Even been healing after I'm down a few times.
---
[oops](https://hrl.es/76/img/Photos/HRL/Photo_2020-06-08-214730.png)
---
So the theory is the mothman prophesized the fall of man. A lot of the theory thinks it is a direct messenger of the old one. 
---
Edit: actually I think that the propheiis mentioned in 76 but don't quote me
---
I get the sense that this is a newer bug. This is the first I've ever heard of this.
---
Vampire 50 cal or lmg works wonders even without being spec'd for them
---
I call my TSE double barrel shotgun 'the bloodrunner'.
---
I called my AAElaser rifle 'pew pew laser'
---
I would like there to be a better way to communicate with others via camp signage also, but not at the cost of budget. I'd love it if there was a C.A.M.P MOTD that could be posted, either on some kind of whiteboard/blackboard object, where interacting with it would bring up a message, or even something on the personal terminal, go to a players camp and check their terminal/whiteboard, see the MOTD and what they have to say, could be links to discord communites, could be a looking to trade message etc.
---
It is old news which always gets removed from this sub for rule violation.
---
It‚Äôs definitely a grind, but very satisfying when you roll that Unyielding/AP/Sentinel Chest piece on your Bloodied character. 
---
Unfortunately, most of my best Uny pieces rolled on my FH character. I keep them Justin case, though. Plus it helps increase Intelligence for crafting new pieces. 
---
That‚Äôs the side-tip; since Intelligence affects durability, get that as high as you can feasibly, and equip Armorer 3 so your piece‚Äôs durability is as high as possible.
---
I keep mine closed off, because of a glitch, and I don't want to sell something I might need later on when the PTS-changes hit.
---
Pretty much any event (or location) with lots of scorched or ghouls - Line in the sand, Distant Thunder, Guided Meditation, Burrows, even Collision Course (if you did the quest). Not really 'farmable' imho, it is still rng if you get some
---
Wow!  That's awesome!
---
I lock mine up because I am max caps on all characters with nothing to spend on. I have been putting displays on the wall, with what I have to trade, along with my Discord name so people can contact me for trade. Lately I've been trading ammo and scrap legendary items for junk (Gold, Silver, Lead, Screws, and Ballistic Fiber), using this as currency, until the cap threshold is hopefully increased.
---
See my edit. Sorry, got your reply a bit too late.
---
I e heard of glitch as well.  I also heard a way to stop the free taking of stuff in vendors is place an item like a piece of ammo or something not worth much, place sale amount to 30000 max cap.  Just a single piece.  They are saying if they can buy everything in a vendor and one time that‚Äôs the glitch wiping it out in one shot and you don‚Äôt receive any caps and they don‚Äôt pay any.
---
Somehow you missed the memo that SBQ is meant to be a group event. I like how your defense of the bloodied meta went from you need our damage to kill her in a group to show me a video of you soloing her. Lol
---
Also you fail to realize balance is a two way street. Now that damage between builds is tighter if the SBQ is somehow too tanky Batheada can change her resistances. Bet you didnt think of that did you? üòÆ
---
&gt;Remove the scrapping of perk cards entirely. It's extremely detrimental to the roots of the perk card system
---
No, I want to be able to scrap my unnecessary cards, i don‚Äôt really care any other changes or enhancements, but this still allowed me to get rid of the cards that came from packs that I will never ever use.  I want this ability.  Otherwise I‚Äôll simply continue to not open packs.  It is also the only way that the card packs from the score season even have any value is if we can scrap cards.
---
Sorry pal, sounds very frustrating.
---
May not have been quite that bad. Workshops provide their own materials for building at the workshop. (Shows as green when you go to build), so you may not have lost that much junk.
---
If you need junk, collectron plus camp at junk node will get you tons. Nice location on the river near the food factory.
---
Ah the hype I gotcha, all my console r gen 1 and so far I havnt had any issues, I've heard of the red ring but never experienced it myself, I've always preordered my stuff, i don't do the line hassle haha
---
Sounds painful to do.
---
It blows my mind that some people arent getting that the idea of the battle pass was to get people to log in every day.    
---
Your complaining about it doing exactly what it was designed to do, 1 of the few bethesda deisgns that has worked perfectly as intended.  
---
Its designed to get you to log in every day because if you dont you miss out, and by logging in every day you are more exposed to the atom shop, and if you dont log in every day you will be more inclined to buy the remaining levels at the end.
---
Peace is temporary, flux is forever
---
I just took this with my prosnap
---
Make it known loud and clear to Bethesda. The system isn't in the main game yet so there's still time for thing to be changed.
---
Ah no I'm on Xbox. Hopefully they do get a rework. I want to use this gun but it's just so ineffective unless I'm only trying to tag enemies with splash damage cuz that's about all it can do at the moment.
---
What I am most curious about is whether the changes are intentional or not.    Given how often they screw things up you have to wonder if things are actually working as intended or not?    The devs for this game really do have a track history for this sort of thing.   The first thing that comes to mind is crippling the SBQ.    First we are told it was a mistake and would be fixed yet here it is four months later and the change is still in place.   So which is it?
---
What is going on with weapons could be the exact same thing.     Are they supposed to be nerfed this hard or is it a mistake?
---
Literally no one.....
---
Put the good stuff at the end of the board so people either play daily or buy their way to it, its a very basic business plan, if you give all the good stuff away at the start no one will bother going to the end
---
Alright. Get a group of friends, none of them running meta builds to put down the Queen. Everything is being nerfed. As for Bethesda doing anything to the Queen, do you *really* think they‚Äôll tone her down if she‚Äôs too hard to kill? They *still* haven‚Äôt fixed bugs that have been in game since beta, and they *still* haven‚Äôt fixed the fact you can‚Äôt cripple her. So you fail to recognise it‚Äôs not just Bloodied suffering, and you also fail to recognise Bethesda is just sheer incompetence.
---
I never knew this was a thing. Makes me think the other player combined firing knowing this. I should have nuked them.
---
Because legacy explosive energy weapons would be even more broken
---
a friend is at 200 modules and not a single unyielding...
---
I was referring to the gauss shotgun, but yeah autos are more common. The next u get shot at by one noticed how your character will just freeze in place for a split second due to lag caused by the spamming of the gauss trigger. It's just a garbage weapon. I get the fact that it was added to help people who can't aim get a kill and want to keep playing and I know that I could put the same cards on that they have and run the same  build and get cheap kills but wouldn't be able to sleep at night knowing I did that
---
The Season concept just kills games for me.  I had the same problem with Warframe when they introduced seasons.  It made it so that I felt like I \*had\* to play each and every day, and it killed the joy of just faffing about having fun.  Now instead I had these often stupid and pointless objectives I "had" to complete.  I know that I didn't really have to complete them, but that was what it felt like.  So instead I just dropped the game.  FO76 has now pretty much gone the same way.  I have enough stress in my life.  I don't need my entertainment to add to it.
---
I never said 40 out of my 56 slots were dedicated to damage. And, even if they were, do you even know what minmax is? Minimal weaknesses, maximum damage? No junkies build is a minmax, if you were minmaxing you would be using bloodied and for maximum damage out put, probably a BE gat plasma. If I wanted to even try to go near minmaxing I could be using JE heavy guns instead of JFFR, using max rank of adrenaline instead of level 1, playing solo instead of public teams for lone wanderer, I could be using more damage resisting perks, etc. Dont use a phrase, like minmaxing, when you literally have absolutely no idea what it means
---
I too have a life outside Fallout: Time Sink edition. The amount of time I would have to put in at my job to buy the required atoms VS the hours upon HOURS the game demands for the legendary run is ridiculous. So I did exactly what bethesda prefers, which is use atoms to finish the board.
---
I finished the board a couple weeks ago and am very relieved that I have no real reason to log in the game now; since there is no real new content. The thing that kills me is the amount of time it takes for a NW match to start up, just to attempt a 250 score bump. I'm over it. They got some extra money out of me and I got my time saved from this slow-moving train wreck.
---
I disagree, rather I think they should double down on the survival aspect (I mean this game is supposed to also be a survival game), Take away our ability to swap in the middle of an area so you‚Äôre actually forced to decide to get loot or do more damage.  Also what qualifies as a combat card. You might think a perk that makes you suffer less thirst or hunger from chems is not combat, but if you go into hungry/starving you start having AP penalties, that would make that a combat card.
---
No, I only logged on to do my score challenges, and save the workshop for last for this reason. I couldn't log off fast enough I guess.
---
You on PS4? I might have it.
---
Yes but they have a terrible organization and they have few big bases
---
The implementation with perk coins ONLY coming from scrapping cards is fucked for people who got duplicate cards back when that would just make them vanish, or for people who respec their characters regularly, or for people who keep multiple ranks of cards for different builds- you get punished for all those things.
---
Your ability to level up legendary perks should have zero to do with your perk cards. It should be purely based on your level.
---
On mobile, *slanted* text is achieved by * text *
---
No spaces between asterisks.
---
Yeah it had been datamined already a yr ago that 2 or 3 other maps are available but no one knows if we will ever see them.
---
Funnily enough, I saw this for the first time yesterday (on Xbox). SBQ was dead in about 30 secs. Not a very big deal one time as I had nothing invested other than my time to fast travel there and back, but if it happened all the time then I would be pissy for sure.
---
The fact you gotta do this means that this device has been found wanting.
---
Mine's long since deconstructed.
---
TSE however had an alternative,now everything will get a hit.
---
The bloodied build tears taste oh so good! üòã
---
It's chemist, yes.
---
You know a player needs to be over lv 1000 to max out one or two perk cards right?
---
That's far too unreasonable!
---
It does not matter if I was in beta or not. What you are describing basically validates the point that backpacks have made PA crap at carry weight. Since you are losing backpack bonuses, standard PA should have at least a normal levelled backpack worth of carry weight bonus. Then, if you want to be a pack mule, you would be sacrificing a mod slot to use it for a storage mod. Is this not compromising combat effectiveness?
---
Wtf? If they already did the work of creating the maps and aren't using them, that's just bad business.
---
That it is. They need to expand the run from 10 weeks to 16 weeks.
---
Same. Was super confused
---
And yet the only change happening in this game is Bethesda altering how damage calculations are done to balance all gear so more neglected weapons are a bit more useful.  And the indirect effecting of bloodied build that again could literally solo the SBQ in only a few minutes even though she has a build in damage reduction effect that instantly reduces all damage by 70%. 
---
All while pretending that it will make the game harder when the game is already piss fucking easy and the hardest part is aiming. Even with my build that is most likely unoptimized as fuck nothing save for scorch beasts or Mire Queen/Kings survive more then a single magazine from my handmade (+30% ghouls, +10% aiming) or my Gauss Rifle (+30% scorched, +50% to critical hits). And getting ammo for my weapons is piss easy and only takes like an hour if you include fast travel loading time to mass enough lead and steal to create 4 or 5 thousands 5.56 rounds and 400 or so 2mm rounds.  Even leaving me enough to usually make a couple hundred 10mm rounds for my anti armor 10mm sub machine gun I use in lower level areas to not waste my ammo against level 5 ghouls and shit.
---
Would t surprise me they do this so people do t sell the keys to people. I say let us drop them and let them be destroyed.
---
Haven't picked a lock above level zero in over a year. There's nothing in them anyway
---
   I feel like people who stick with this game should get a free T-Shirt at this point .. Like "I survived Fallout 76" This game is so predatory it's crazy they get away with it.
---
The sudio behind 76 has people that made ultima online
---
respec potion for bullion or something would make too much sense. that way its a bit of a grind to get but functionally better than what we have! cheers
---
I just scrip everything in exchange for legendary modules.
---
The issue isnt with the nerfs tthemsevles. It the implementations of both the nerfs and higher level enemies at the same time.
---
I would add to this, strongly consider not pre-ordering bethesda's next major release or even buying it close to release.
---
Literally the only things they are going to respond to are negative press and low sales. This game's release was so bad, both in press coverage and sales, that they had to make the next major update to the game (wastelanders) essentially a relaunch of the game with an entirely new starting quest aimed at new players.
---
That's alright just keep levelling up and unlocking perks as you normally would you'll get there. Its really a non issue.
---
Clearly the guy isn't smart enough to realise that. Not playing the game is crazy talk to him.
---
I‚Äôve been absolutely demolished with a be 50cal with normal armour and that‚Äôs never happened, could be a hacker depending what system you‚Äôre on, I‚Äôve never heard anyone else say this
---
That was while ago
---
Presents. Fair enough, delete those. People didn‚Äôt grind hundreds or thousands of hours in order to trade for those. But legacy weapons? They shouldn‚Äôt be deleted just because a few people duped 100 legacies and made them more widely available. Some people had to grind for a thousand hours to trade for just one. Some people had them from before they were made legacy. I myself had to grind for about 600 hours before I got a low end legacy laser rifle, and it was only around hour 860 or so that I got my first Bloodied legacy.
---
And you can still fail if you login every day because they STILL haven't fixed the auto complete bug, and outright refuse to help any player affected by it!
---
Does it matter?, bloodied will still be king, i know no other class that offers +15 to all stats,and for a game that had allready 2 meta changes and forced people to grind again for the wastelanders dlc this might be the breaking point,its a game thats past its half life after all.
---
Try running it in windowed mode
---
I like the coin system.
---
I like the Perk Card system as a whole, and I do actually find it fun to try and collect the animated cards. I would love to have my character all animated cards.
---
Having a goal of all animated cards has the downside of having tons of cards you can‚Äôt use. I stopped opening packs months ago just because i knew we had this system coming up.
---
It even makes having perk packs in the SCORE worthwhile. We got 13 packs this last season. That would have been 65 more cards you could scrap, and if they were 2 coins each (I think that‚Äôs the current plan) that‚Äôs 130 more coins for anyone who doesn‚Äôt need the cards.
---
All the systems linked up well, you get packs every 5 levels, plus a card or can swap points. once you have your build set you‚Äôre getting 2 coins every level by picking a card and scrapping it. I can start cleaning up old cards.
---
I think perk coins and legendary perk upgrades should be account wide, but i‚Äôm more or less actually looking forward to this system. I don‚Äôt think we should quickly max out cards, Most people currently in the 300s should get one or two max perks, and that should be quite a bit.
---
I would love a +5 END on my character, and even rank 1 of master infiltrator
---
I'm on PC. Game hackers piss me off.
---
I was worried about it until I saw Angry Turtle and Juicehead basically doing the exact same thing in the PTS as I‚Äôm doing on console right now. The numbers are way less than what I‚Äôm used to. But I don‚Äôt think I need to worry about hitting 4k+ damage for a level 75 mutant.
---
If players quit, because of what is on a Public Test Server, then good riddance, they are probably toxic and we don't need them in this community. I don't think people understand what PTS means. It does not mean this is what's going to happen lol. It's TESTING, for players to give feedback as what works and what doesn't, see what's broken and what needs reworking. It does not mean, this is the finished product. Instead of freaking out over nothing, give constructive feedback to Bethesda.
---
Personally, I think a nerf across the board to players and a buff to enemies was needed, the game did not feel dangerous, and had no danger of dying. That being said, I think Bloody Melee is broken, as in, something is wrong with the math. Daily Ops felt good, running around the bog killing mobs and legendary enemies felt much better. I could even stand to get even more resistance on mobs with the Crowns next to their names. Should feel like a mini-boss.
---
Well I've done 3000 hours &amp; killed I don't know how many queens &amp; still can't get it to show up. My guess is 7600 hours worth.
---
This hits the nail right on the head. 
---
Many people seem to think that what they personally want is what everyone, or even a majority want. 
---
This sub isn‚Äôt the entire player base, or even a majority.  And this sub doesn‚Äôt agree on everything ‚Äòwe‚Äô want. 
---
The only things I‚Äôve seen that are close to ‚Äòunanimous‚Äô are related to performance stability and reliability, and possibly the ability to have built-in item transferability between your characters.
---
Not everything even remotely. Early to mid game will mostly be untouched.
---
The ones that are hit the hardest are the ones that stack the most damage multiple bonuses. However, they're clearly the ones that clearly need nerfing. If you're decimating the highest level enemies in fractions of seconds and boss-level encounters in a few seconds, there's something seriously wrong with the game.
---
Its getting to the point I'm actually surprised when I don't have to shoot something 3 or 4 times at 95% for a hit to happen. If they actually fix VATS at the same time they launch the damage nerf ill end up using less ammo.
---
&gt;simultaneously introducing lvl100 bullet-sponges enemies. And even though most of my characters are able to kill those sponges with 3-4 shots, I can only imagine how much ammo will use non-minmaxed players.
---
It is almost like they are trying to get players to play in a group. It is almost like if you have 1 or 2 or 3 people with you it will take less and less and less time to kill something and you will use less and less ammo and take less and less damage.
---
It doesn't make up as those challenges also auto completed!
---
I always get those DISEASED eye bots too. Gross.
---
This happens quite often since the last update...
---
So in fallout therms that would make it an Mindwipe Gin Tonic.
---
I also would like the ability too get rid of cards I won't use
---
My buddy from nw made this post complaining about people only using v.a.t.s. grenades in nearly every match. When someone uses v.a.t.s. on a grenade thrown at u, there is no tactical maneuvering away from that. An instant down. While being shot at with a gauss shotgun, your character instantly freezes from lag caused by the spamming of the gauss shotgun trigger. Grenades needs to be less common and the gauss needs to be nerfed much like the Tesla was at first
---
If I played a FPS where the only gun was a 007 golden gun, I would have stopped playing long ago, If these changes don‚Äôt seem fair to you, Then by all means, Riot in the streets if you think it will help, But I too play the same game &amp; I honestly don‚Äôt share your opinion as you‚Äôll find a lot of ppl don‚Äôt.
---
Challenge accepted 
---
https://youtu.be/cYm71HlM01E
---
&gt;Is this not compromising combat effectiveness?
---
Nope. Not in any real way. It'd be mostly the same but marginally less efficient. It already happens with calibrated shocks. Choosing some other leg mod doesn't suddenly boost your combat effectiveness.
---
is there a link detailing these changes?
---
I only realised was trying to give a low level some keys for the dam got like ten sets and multiple of everything else. No wonder I can't use me inventory.
---
Not factoring in the auto complete bug that can happen at any time on dailies or weeklies with no way to recover that score except to grind hard on xp....
---
Holy jesus that's a lot of Fallout 76
---
Yep, I play almost from the premiere ;)
---
We need a key ring tab or sub-tab. That would alleviate this issue.
---
You are right
---
SBQ challenge is bugged. I‚Äôm surprised flatwoods monster hasn‚Äôt counted for you.
---
Idk. I guess that they have been busy fixing dupe glitches and also banning the dupers
---
PA is not an offensive option. Combat effectiveness is lost from not having any offensive mods or any legendary effects while in it. The point about weight that you seem to be focusing on is what I described. I have a 2STR build and I can carry 360 lbs, then I get into power armor and lose 90 lbs. This does not make sense and is a big argument for not using PA more.
---
I wish we had a nice snappable pipe railing like that.
---
9 minutes, FT from and to included
---
The daily challenges are pathetically easy, the only thing that may take a bit is leveling up. Maximize intelligence and join building teams, eat scorchbeast brains and tasty squirrel stews with carnivore on. The amount of people on here that literally want the game to play itself is amazing.
---
do you have a link to the original post detailing all these changes?
---
I'm almost afraid to ask... how many hours is that?
---
Only one point of disagreement: Don't remove perk card scrapping entirely.  Allow people to scrap cards that you *actually don't want any more*.  Like, I already have rank 2 Bandolier and I don't expect to ever use rank 1 at any time, ever.  So let me ditch it and stop it cluttering up my pack.  I don't want anything for it.  Just get it to fuck, and don't make it part of this shitty grind.
---
I agree with you! People want to rush and have it all. Then complain why they game lacks end game content. I have been looking forward to this since last summer when they initially planned it. 
---
This also ties in with my legendary rant (unpopular opinion). Everyone wants easier RNG so they can get the maxed out bloodied/junkies build. Without having to really work for it. I feel the grind can make the game better in the long run. Then when you get that item it should feel special. Not just meeting the majority‚Äôs criteria for end game gear. This is also why I feel duper‚Äôs have made a massive negative impact on the game.
---
Awesome to be able to give to lower lvl‚Äôs  to help them.
---
I carry around a bloodied gauss minigun named "Piecemaker". A gauss pistol named "Winona", and a Plasma Caster named "Vera".
---
Have they given any reason why it cant be repaired, or is that just another bug?
---
Thing is I'm not much of a team player - I like to play my way, I go AFK from time to time, I was kind of forced to play Public teams for XP benefits, but I'm trying to avoid playing in teams if I can. And some activities, like Daily Ops are really difficult to do solo.
---
I wouldn't run any of these, but best of the 3, I would go with TS-25%FFR if it was m if you run with Power Armor and Stabilized perk. If you don't, then I'd run with AA-25%FFR-25%V.
---
That‚Äôs not what pacifism is though. Like a true pacifist you can still be attacked even if you choose not to.
---
3 stars
---
3600+
---
they are certainly shocked .... why patch it if it goes to avoid completely damage from these traps ... using your brain ... instead of crying learn to read with understanding
---
Cool idea. Way to difficult for currect dev team though.
---
Yes.  I got caught out by that at the weekend.  Innocently unlocked the safe at Tyler Race track and became wanted.
---
Thank you so much :)
---
I'm more likely to stay.  Reducing the upper variation in top-end build damage is good game design and creates space for adding additional bonuses and effects in the future.
---
You put forth a logical point, but I expect u to be downvoted so I up voted your very reasonable explanation for prosperity.
---
And build that workshop up. Build a fortress, tower defence, and so on and defend it against hordes of the opposing faction.
---
Ive been putting Armourer 3 on just incase, its been mentioned a few times on this sub thats a good idea
---
Remember to equip Ammo Smith and Super Duper perks to get the most out of each Flux once you start making Ammo.
---
U wanna get heard? Hire a garbage truck to unload tons of trash in front of their office. This will send "a strong word...", Roxy's style.
---
Pun intended.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs probably it ü§£
---
So you created a hypothetical situation and then quiz me as to why I made an assumption based on a situation you fabricated after I made my original post? You sure are a bright spark of sarcasm aren't you!
---
I‚Äôm console which is probably why I‚Äôve never seen this
---
If people are planning to buy and play cyberpunk, they are going to do that regardless of any changes to fallout 76. Looks like it‚Äôll be a good game
---
I do agree with the second point.   I know a lot of people felt the purveyor was a great QoL addition to the game, but in reality, it ended up devaluing gear. 
---
I can remember the first few months of the game and getting a 1* piece of Heavy Combat or Urban/Scout armor was exciting.  Getting the ‚ÄúAll Rise‚Äù was monumental for a melee build for getting something with basically 2*.  Actually getting a 2* item with a primary affix and something like +1 to a stat should be fantastic.
---
I don't think they have or will stop dupers without a serious change to their database system or how players are reverted following a server crash.
---
As far as I'm aware, duping continues.
---
I could even suggest a few ways to solve this problem, but they wouldn't listen to someone like me. I can say that they are going about resolving this in the wrong way.
---
And Super Duper when crafting the flux in the first place.
---
Same.  Anyone who's making 100 today or earlier has to have either bought ranks, sweatlorded out a ton of xp, or just played the game like it was a job.  Those of us who play a couple hours a night are in the high 80's, probably going to make it, but not with much room to spare.
---
The whole perk system in 76 is flawed. Cards? No. Fallout *NEEDS* its perk tree/free choice. It's how it works for the game world that is the fallout universe.
---
Even in other MMOs I  can set my characters up with mixed perks and skills.
---
&gt; Thing is I'm not much of a team player  
---
Then you deal with the consequences of your choice.

For fast traveling only

If I do decide to build a workshop I make sure I have 'throw away' resources. I then team up with my friend via Discord. We spend the day talking and tag teaming the workshop. (Both of us are at home due to Covid restrictions) If I drop out she takes over. We go to town on the workshop. Set up resources and build a home etc. bit of creative fun. I don't bother with workshops unless I have spare resources as I know at the end of my play it just vanishes. It would be nice if those resources did bounce back into your own stash.
---
As someone who played only one other game, which had some sort of battlepass (Fortnite), no you don't have to skip dailies if you want to finish and get all rewards. Daily and weekly challenges are there to incentivize those who can do them, to get rewards for that. And for full disclosure I started doing everything on my alt account as well, two weeks after the start and missing the double score daily weekend. Now my alt is sitting at rank 87 and will finish in two weeks. All by comitting less than 2 hourse per day for the challenges, right after work and before having dinner with my wife. You either commit and earn rewards or don't, but there should be no entitlement.
---
Wont be done as it only changes existing content to make it better not adds to it. Bethesda only want to ADD content to keep you playing and paying that FO1st money. This wont do that as only changes the core gameplay and enhances it mind but wont really add that many FO1st subs for the amount of work put in.  Great idea though.
---
Well that pretty much blows given the frequent workshop score challenges.
---
How am I using a memorial for karma? What makes you think internet points are of any use to me? I literally just wanted to gauge a community and post something that matters to me, is that not allowed? Why does it matter so much to you wtf
---
üòÅ
---
Thanks! This is great!
---
For now it is, until the upcoming mega-bullet-sponge nerf I'm hearing about.
---
&gt;  76? You're screwed if you suddenly have a week without internet in the middle.
---
You and I clearly operate under very different definitions of "screwed."
---
I'd keep the AA until I could make a better one, if it were me
---
Never knew about this, they only need steel don't they? Great tip fella thank-you
---
This is horrible news!
---
Those were the days lol. I remember when I got a TSE Gatling gun. Though it was glitched and would prevent us from killing things. It still felt special.  Like it was a unique weapon. Trying and hoping for something made the game more worth while for me.
---
Bethesda: 
---
Oh no!
---
Anyways...
---
Most of what you spent in scrap wasn‚Äôt yours. It was the workshops. And workshops have never been persistent, so building your a large area isn‚Äôt wise in the first place.
---
Live and learn.

yep- theyve been all screwy since the update
---
It affects the durability bar of crafted armor, i always use rank 3
---
While is shows as unowned on the map, it usually updates/changes once you are near the workshop. Always a good idea to double check when you arrive, if you are not in the mood for a fight you only lost a few caps.
---
&gt;You‚Äôre a victim of your own FOMO.
---
A FOMO that is absolutely fostered and encouraged by this system and therefore by Bethesda.  Why argue against improving things?
---
You can do the dailies in 30 minutes almost every day. They are really easy.
---
Oh, I know. It was a baffling olive branch, but my point is that it definitely boosted those who could complete the challenges.
---
Love to help anyone out and if like me menu not to lag the hell out. Took me about 3 mins just to make some food earlier üòÜ
---
Auto completes are still happening too...
---
&gt; I also think Fallout First members should get a small 10% score buff perk so they feel like they‚Äôre getting something for the money they spend as well, but it‚Äôs not a big enough bonus to piss off the non-sub players, but enough that the 1st members feel like they‚Äôre getting something for their money (although it could be argued they already are with the atom allowance every month they could buy levels with).
---
They said they would look into giving F1st users a bonus before S1 began for future seasons and here we are.
---
Thank you, that's reassuring to know as I really want to make an effort as doing something IRL is more difficult than I anticipated. 
---
That's very true. He was big into memes so I still have the "missing doge" poster when I was young. It's something he loved despite it being so daft.
---
That's really thoughtful of you to say, thank you and your community! Typing doesn't really give enough justice to the words I want to express but I really mean it, thank you:)
---
I‚Äôm not arguing against ‚Äòimproving things‚Äô. I‚Äôm saying that the proposed shift would represent a major change on paradigm that goes beyond just this one situation, and I wanted further elaboration by the OP.
---
And someone already did the math and proved you could miss over 30% of the daily challenges and still complete the season. Which means the initial premise of ‚Äòyou have to log in daily to complete the season‚Äô is incorrect. 
---
You can log in 47 out of the 70 days, as long as it‚Äôs at least once a week, and complete the season, and that‚Äôs assuming you got zero SCORE from the repeatable weekly of ‚ÄòEarn 10k XP‚Äô.
---
I agree except for the proposed speedy progression for the Perk Cards. This system is meant as a long-term progression system, that you progress in the background while playing. It's not meant as something that a player would focus and complete in a few weeks. This is something that sould last players for months or years. Requiring 1000s of levels to finish it is a nonsense, naturaly, but needing sub-1000 levels to finish it sounds reasonable.
---
Sounds like they were just there to donate and we misinterpreted their friendship bullets.
---
Never happened to me, and there‚Äôs not enough info on exactly how it is caused or what the circumstances are to factor it in
---
Settings &gt; Pacifist Mode &gt; On
---
[](/cozyglow)I actually could farm collision course now that you mention it, since it can still be triggered by getting close by as opposed to being on a timer, and it's low level, so it's cheap on the ol' ammo.  
---
Thanks man, I'm gonna try that.
---
I‚Äôve come across a lot that say unowned but have built items all over the place. I can capture them fine with no PVP initiates or anything. 
---
I‚Äôm assuming those one were captured and then the person who owned it went offline, but their built items stayed?
---
I‚Äôm level 90 something but I‚Äôm pretty new to the game. When do legendary perks become a thing I can use? Is there a mission I need to complete or if this a FO 1st thing?
---
Scrapping perk cards should absolutely be an optional extra for perk coins. I totally agree, i have duplicates and certain cards i never use and would love the ability to tidy up and get rid of those.
---
However, making it the ONLY way to get perk coins is really stupid. Especially as they plan to bring out perk loadouts in the future.
---
Yeah I dont think it will ever get fixed. People are still gonna find ways to cheat at the game in one way or another. When all the legendary drops are trash and the purveyor rolls are garbage it's hard not to find other ways to get what u are looking for.
---
I made double walls after the patch with the flamethrower trick
---
Even the projections (which aren‚Äôt ‚Äòupcoming‚Äô, just being tested) don‚Äôt stop a focused build from quickly killing most enemies. 
---
Watch Angry Turtle‚Äôs video about XP grinding.  He doesn‚Äôt even run all the possible damage boosters, like Bloodied Mess.
---
You can still make double walls
---
They
---
It happens on either login or the moment of the daily reset, it can happen during any login after the reset even 22 hours later!
---
It can happen to either dailies or weeklies, it can happen partially to challenges that ask a certain number of kills or completely. Sometimes it only effects 3 or 4 challenges sometimes it effects all of them! the one constant is you get no score from this and Bethesda customer support refuses to help!
---
My pump shotgun is named First Aid, and my rifle is Lil Nipper.
---
He sounds way more aggressive , I noticed it just the other day and mentioned it to my crew
---
dont
---
care
---
Yeah Bethesda! And please add a new map to nuclear winter.
---
Once again you didn‚Äôt list any specific causes or circumstances, neither has anyone in the community. Like I said, some people have it happen every day, some people never have it happen, so there is too little info to factor it in
---
I work full time, ignored nearly all of the nw challenges and still finished a few weeks ago. A 16 week long season would be horrendous, especially as you get zero daily or weekly rewards once you've finished
---
Personally i want to just scrap the idea of seasons. I agree it‚Äôs tough getting regular time in. I have a 50-60 hr/wk job and two kids. I‚Äôm on track to finish this season but it has felt like a chore. It‚Äôs just not designed well. They pitched it as being able to complete it doing things you do anyway. It failed to deliver on that. I wish it was just tied to events and xp personally. Unemployed and teenagers would still finish early, but it could be designed in a way that allows more freedom to do what you want and still complete.
---
I agree.  There are unaddressed CORE problems with the dev team and the game:
---
1. Very bare bones, basic versions of systems supporting new currencies are added and then neglected to work on more new currency systems.  Perk coins will do to score what score has done to rep and gold.
---
2.  Server hopping is an exploit that they've ignored so long that most regard it as necessary for a wide range of content or to deal with bugs.  (I'm not hating on it, but it is a giant sign post for bad design.)
---
3. New content is not being adequately validated from inside the game client. (Armor/weapon skin issues)
---
4. So many time gates and injected grind.
---
We all do, but it has to do with those changes? Balanced game should allow to play both team players and those who prefer solo play. And both should have fun equally.
---
If it's the best you can do, then its definitely more than enough
---
Haha, I loved the Doge meme and have you seem them as puppies?? Cutest damn thing you'll see and from what you've said, it seems like he was a fun dude to be around, I'd imagine we'd get along fine 
---
No thanks necessary, mate, I cross shared it over to the community after I posted (whenever someone comments on it, it doesn't notify me which is odd) but there should be some nice comments there as well - stay safe, mate and I hope to see you out in Appalachia (I'm on PS4 but there are plenty in PKOA that see on Xbox)
---
Yeah, definitely felt like a bug. My bloodied felt fine. My unyielding felt incredibly nerfed. Maybe it‚Äôs damage was also bugged and nothing else will kill me like that. I‚Äôll mess around today. But I could not stay alive last night more than 10 mins at a time down in cranburry bog.
---
True... I think it would make a sense to make events and the grand finale would be SBQ with amazing loot. But we both know it's not going to happen. :'D
---
I think we (the player base) would like to think they will fix it entirely but whats done is done. They made the change and ready or not its coming out in patch 22. So now we all have a choice, scrap all of our cards to get the perks we want and ranked up or wait just in case they fix it down the road.
---
Youre inserting your foot deeper into your own throat.
---
Thank you, that really means a lot to me and I honestly wish I had more to say that isn't clich√© but I really mean it:) It's been difficult. I've struggled with depression since forever but I doubted myself because when I was 17 I wasn't taken seriously and I was told everything is fine, so it's taken a long time to get support but I couldn't ask for better. 
---
It's a horrible thing to live with  but on the plus side at least knowing nothing matters, the world is sort of my oyster. I wish you the best too:)
---
And add a new map to nuclear winter
---
Harterman
---
It does, I really appreciate it:)
---
again, people are allowed to not like the change, they are allowed to move on, 
---
not here to opine on bloodied, there is more to this change than just bloodied.
---
some people are going to be pissed because bethesda chose too make a huge balance change and when
---
hacked weapons are still in the game
---
magic weapons still work
---
score still auto completes
---
FT bug is still present
---
rubberbanding is still present
---
on and on and on. months and months issues persist. 
---
honestly people being not liking some of the new balance while simultaneously being tired of grind and tons of other glaring issues wanting to leave are pretty reasonable tbh. its almost never just ONE thing that gets people to leave a game.
---
3\* Nerd Rage and Bloody Mess
---
Comparing an ingame mechanic to a real life ideology nice.
---
Absolutely! I work a super physical job with long hours, and sometimes I'm just far too tired to boot up the game, especially when I know I'm just gonna be grinding the same daily events to level up. I really wish there were either more weekly challenges available or that the current weeklies offered greater rewards. Sometimes on the weekend, I have the time and energy to sit and just play forever, but once you complete the same five daily rewards it's sort of pointless.
---
Pretty much any vampire weapon with a large mag and high ROF will do, I prefer a plasma flamer because if you are a conduit, the imposter will be in your face anyway - just point and keep the trigger pulled, outheals the conduit damage too.
---
If you are not a PA build, get troubleshooter armor to minimize damage received (other stats don't matter).
---
*thanks!*
---
You mean comparing what the word means to what he wants it to mean. Try again
---
No, not until they fix their shit
---
I‚Äôm a 41 year old working adult, working 40-50 hours a week.  I‚Äôve been able to keep up with just an hour (sometimes 2) a day of playing.  That‚Äôs while working, taking care of the family, cooking dinner, mowing the lawn, etc. 
---
It all comes down to choices, priorities, and your ability to make time for yourself and how you want to spend that free time.  It‚Äôs insulting to make the assumption that the only people who are doing this are unemployed single people with no kids.
---
On the plus side. It will be a perfect reason to stop playing just in time for the new PoE league.
---
WoWs new expansion is right around the corner too. Leave it to Bethesda to put out content guaranteed to drive away paying customers at the same time as a natural player drought is going to occur.
---
Im not thru with the legendary run yet. And i tell ya, its a pain doing the grind on two accounts.
---
That means a lot to me, thank you so much:) I'm sure it'll confuse some people. I was actually worried that people would think this is a "Joe moma" joke. Joe never liked being called Joseph so I wouldn't put that on his memorial
---
Don't think I will I'm too tired.
---
Check them to see if they are magic.
---
We will see only once the patch is out. There were also claims that the ban wave a while ago would cause a huge loss of players, but there was barely noticeable change of the [Steam player count](https://steamdb.info/app/1151340/graphs/) at that time. People announcing that they are quitting might be a vocal minority, or use it as a negotiating tactic but then not quit anyway if the change does happen.
---
I appreciate it greatly:)
---
I didn't think of it like that, thank you, that means a lot to me:)
---
Means someone else got them first. Vendors only sell one plan per reset. If you can get someone to invite you to a private server, you can find them there NP.
---
Or just keep hopping till you find a world with the plans in stock.
---
I wish Bethesda could give me all the SBQ loot I've missed over the months of fighting her. I spend 20m doing this with others only to be shit on at the end with nothing on her but a harpoon gun.
---
I agree, I am lvl 250 and use most of my perk cards to swap between 7 loadouts that I have (thanks to that convenient mod). So scraping perk cards is not something that I want to do for the most part, but I still got a bunch that I dont need and saved up packs.
---
If we could scrap these cards for extra perk coins would that be too bad? I dont really know what else to do with these cards and I already love my SPECIAL loadout.
---
Ahh yes the common mistake made by people
---
Majority of the time Microtransactions don't go back into the game at all, games have set budgets for things like servers regardless.
---
There was a report I think Kotaku did in 2015/2016 about how only 10% of Halo 5s microtransactions went into the game and that was only to maintain servers for a short period of time.
---
Look at the bonuses Bobby Kotick gets, look at the staff layoffs
---
Microtransactions dont help the game lol
---
wdym?
---
Yeah I know.  Just wishful thinking.  I'm sure that these new perks will affect something else in nw. I wish that the 2 games could be separated somehow
---
...what?
---
If you look at damage numbers from same build on adventure, and compare them to PTS, then those numbers are indeed lower. But calling it a nerf is not descriptive of nature of these changes.
---
Basically, the math we had previously that was super wonky is now much less wonky, much more reliable and much more stable.
---
It doesn't matter what are the numbers displayed. What matters is how those numbers correlate with results. Shotguns were known for rubberbanding when used without VATS. No more. Good builds are still very efficient, I didn't have issues with killing level 75 vendigos in 2-3 shots using quad weaponry.
---
Nothing in the hierarchy of the effects changed. Bloodied is still outputting the highest damage.
---
Other side effects of these changes is that for PvP purposes, handmades are now more efficient than legacy weapons. These changes are so profound they may change public opinion on PvP. To me this looks like the game finally gets its first proper Ballance patch.
---
More weekly challenges. Weekly challenges with acceptable amount of repeatables completed should be enough to complete the Run within the regular time limit.
---
Weeklies + Dailies should make it completable within 50% of full run time.
---
Lvl 1 3* eyebots are the best üòÜ
---
Tbh gamepasses are not supposed to be fair. Usually, they are paid, and even then people barely make it all way through unless you play a lot. Here, ou get a pass for free, and nothing really happens if you won't make it.
---
HOWEVER, AT THE SAME TIME
---
Game passes usually let you progress at your own pace, like, I finish Q and I get another one, or another goal to reach, etc. However, these seasonal passes cost you $$.
---
In the end, this design is meant to make some profit because the pass is for free. I think they would give us "freedom" if the pass was paid, however, since they already promised passes will be free, they cant do it. So it is like a conflict. :D
---
If you're not running Bloodied or something that jacks your INT (or is Luck?) through the roof for the bigger durability bar; use Armorer 3.
---
yeah im trying to get a bloodied one for like a week
---
Abuse early, get slap on wrist, enjoy profits afterwards. The Bethesda way.
---
it has aspects of an mmo, but executed very poorly
---
Sorry to crap on your post. 
---
I am a plumber with my own company and two daughters and a wife to deal with and I finished the season pass nearly 3 weeks ago and I never bought one level.
---
Play smarter not harder.. do you know xp is locked to  intelligence ? I had been running a 60 INT build with every minute I played grinding super mutants and any other high level I could. ( 450 xp per level 62 )I would do a run then log out and log back in and do it all over again in the amount of time I had to play each night. I did the double score weekend, the two double xp weekends 
---
All because I panicked that I would not finish the season before September due to watching to many YouTubers.
---
Look at your build and get intelligence to 15 then get a set of unyielding and run at 20 % hp 
---
Eat cranberry relish and brain fungus soup,
---
Have egghead mutation 
---
You will see how faster you can get xp and get through the season pass.
---
They realy need to split pvp and non pvp players up in each servers. Just like it was in World Of Warcraft.
---
If you choose that ur char is a pvp it can not log in to a non pvp server. And the other way around.
---
Thank you, I was going to make an art piece or cover his favourite song on the guitar but I couldn't do them any justice and thought this would immortalised a memorial in a way.
---
At the last day of school me and my old friend Ed printed out loads of missing doge posters in the schools library. We went around our town just taping them to things, it was brilliant. I haven't seen their puppies but that's something I now need to do haha. He was very quiet, almost like a gentle giant but he would've loved this community and it's people.
---
I really appreciate it, I hope they enjoy it but they sound like a nice bunch. You too dude and although you said no thanks necessary I'm still going to thank you. Take care!
---
I would like a key ring added to Misc, and a "Folder" added to Notes where all non-map, non-plan Notes that have been read go.
---
I would also not say no to a Holotape storage similar to the "Folder" above.
---
No kidding. Europe got to have their BETA windows in their evening/night time. Because Bethesda is too stupid to recognize that a lot of people in North America - not just the USA - are working between 9 AM and 5 PM and a lot of people in Europe are *sleeping* during the same time. Instead of, I don't know, looking at a *clock* and using their brains, they picked windows least convenient for the people who could actually afford to buy the game.
---
The chest is what talks not the helm
---
go play something else then
---
im still having a blast
---
I can probably within 30 minutes or so. Psn is jtrag. If someone hasn‚Äôt helped ya by the time I can get on, I‚Äôll get ya üëçüèª
---
Thanks! I guess I asked the wrong question. Does equipping this reduce the materials needed to craft SS armor?
---
I dont really mind the system if it's done right, a whole slew of rewards you can earn over the course of a few months sounds fine, again, if it's done well. Fortnite and rocket league does theirs perfectly, you can not play for like a entire month and still finish everything without too much effort if you do the challenges. That being said 76 has the most grindy I've seen so far
---
I will find out who did this, then I will nuke their camps!  Just kidding.
---
If its not a huge hassle, it might be advisable to keep all of them until the damage nerfs on the PTS get sorted out. Whats most effective now might be below one of the others ones later on.
---
..all true...I'd maybe add perk load outs as fairly universal..
---
Shitttt I wouldn‚Äôt blame you. Them and the people who created the concept of downvotes lol
---
I would rather work 50-60 hours a week and then throw couple bucks to buy the rest than being on the unemployment. You got your job and dignity :D and I bet much more money than they have on unemployment...  
---
In the end, 40$ is exactly 33 score levels. Work two hours, buy the rest and you are free man. These people will have to grind way waaaay more than two hours to get 33 ranks.  
---
This is why people even do RMT, it is called the opportunity cost. I'd rather have few hours overtime than having to do chores in the game. But it is probably unpopular opinion.
---
You know ahead of time that pistols are never going to perform as well as rifles or especially heavies. On the one hand, id like it to be more viable just for more build diversity, on the other hand, We all knew what we were getting ourselves into when we rolled our pistol characters.
---
Mine was already being used more as a mule char than an actually useful character just because literally every other build outperformed it.
---
If the head pops off when you smack it, I say go for it. üòÇ
---
INT for crafted, LCK for found if I'm not mistaken.
---
idk this might be an age thing but its the perfect mmo/game for me, i can log when i feel like it, do whatever i want, no raid bullshit, no pvp bullshit usually, no need to deal with egos in discord, etc, you can achieve your own goals on your own back. And private servers are a godsend.
---
Nice, I‚Äôve just sent you a friend request.
---
some people are only happy if they whine incessantly. again, i think its probably an age thing, sense of entitlement, being owed something. it does pass. fortunately. my nephews are like this, but they are 13 and 14, and everything is "boring" lol.
---
Oh, That's a shame, it's harder to mix and match that way, I assumed the helmet would be what speaks considering you can paint it to have no voice.  
---
Thanks.
---
Yeah, im still suggesting they should use the same system they use for the companions for the pets.
---
Give each tamed animal a certain camp object they're fixated to. Like a tree for the sloth, or a meat club for the deathclaw.
---
First, that would make it possible to switch tamed pets on the fly in your camp as soon as you tamed one of them successfully. 
---
Second, they wouldnt ever get lost again. Or did you guys ever witnessed the settler girl not finding back her way to that damn guitar? Or beckett to his bar? They're even teleporting there.
---
I have other things to spend money on rather than cosmetics in a video game.  I‚Äôm not implying unemployed are better off, obviously they are not.
---
Dude, what you don‚Äôt get, for some unknown reason, is that no one is saying A and B get the same treats in your hypo. No one. No one. People are saying that if Monkey A presses the button twice - once on Monday and once on Tuesday - he gets two treats. If Monkey B presses  the button twice - two times on Wednesday - he gets two treats.  In each case, both monkeys presses the button twice and both monkeys got two treats. They did the exact same amount of work, just on different days.
---
If you‚Äôre rank 85 today, you need 49,125 SCORE to finish the Season. 
---
There are 23 days left. That‚Äôs 2135 SCORE per day on average. 
---
We have three more sets of Weeklies worth 8000 SCORE. That‚Äôs 24,000. 
---
We have 22 more sets of dailies at 2500 XP each. That‚Äôs 55,000
---
Without counting the 100 SCORE repeatable, and assuming you already got the current weeklies and yesterday‚Äôs dailies finished, that‚Äôs 79,000 SCORE left to acquire. Which is 29875 more than you need. 
---
That calculates out to being able to miss almost 12 days that are left in this season. And that doesn‚Äôt even count the upcoming bonus SCORE event. 
---
To go from zero SCORE to Rank 100, you need 220,275 points. I don‚Äôt remember he exact date they switched over to the extra dailies, but for the sake of simplicity, let‚Äôs start off by assuming it was two weeks in. 
---
First two weeks you could earn 8000 + 14000 SCORE each week. That‚Äôs 44,000 SCORE. 
---
Each week after that, you could earn 25,500 SCORE. It would take just under seven weeks to earn the remainder needed to reach Rank 100. 
---
Without the bonus repeatable or bonus SCORE events or Double XP events. 
---
It‚Äôs quite possible to have completed this season at this point without Atoms, glitches or ‚Äòexcessive grinding‚Äô. It would take some dedicated focus while playing. Ink tiger words, quality over quantity.
---
they have a skyrim easter egg in the archers exam for tadpoles scout. they also have a dark brotherhood easter egg
---
I think with the progressive increasing levels, you're only at roughly the halfway mark though, SCORE wise.
---
What kind of base are we going to need? Chicken or Beef or Vegetable? Im partial to chicken broths.
---
I‚Äôve maxed out my scrip every day since wastelanders dropped, and have used every last bit to craft SS pieces, and have only ever gotten 1* unyielding pieces. I imagine I have to be near, or above, 500 pieces crafted already. But I‚Äôm still looking for even one piece of unyielding, with weapon weight reduction...
---
Yeah just shows how in touch with their game they are haha
---
I think you get it for free but it cost to upgrade the card
---
This is absolutely beautiful. Brought some tears to my eyes to start the day. My condolences to you. I hope you're doing well. If you ever need a friend to play on xbox my gamertag is Hannibal i King. Don't be shy I'm always on!
---
I ment fake doors that lead to brick walls when you open them. Can you still make them? Then why are people mad about interior walls that you can wallpaper both sides?
---
I'm trying to understand him myself lol
---
&gt;again, people are allowed to not like the change,
---
And the kind of change they complain and quit the game over tells a lot of the kind of person they are.  In this case they throw a shit fit because now it will take 3 bullets instead of 2 to kill everything.
---
I'd say beep practising, bro, you never know :) and yeah being immortalised in a game is probably the best way to do it - or one of the best ways 
---
Lol that sounded like fun, hope people understood why as well be a great way to spread some happiness in his name 
---
I'm sure he would, he'd fit right in :) 
---
Yeah, our Elder does, not seen by many but I assume I cross-posted during a busy time lol I've been with them for a long while now probably a year now I think, Red recruited me when I was level 20 odd now been with them since and I'm level 227 now and a PKOA Paladin :) none needed still but you're welcome all the same and you take care too, brother
---
Your not actually addressing my argument.
---
Do you use home-brew "strings"? If so, generate them new.
---
40, working, and I complete it in 5 weeks.
---
I lack about 15 levels..fulltime job still do the house stuff,lawn repairs etc wife and kids.about a hour or 2 if I'm lucky hell I even skipped a few days.i will buy what I dont finish but doubt I'll spend any money 8k atoms saved atm
---
Nice. What's the flamethrower trick?
---
Sounds about right, thanks.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs quite possible to have completed this season at this point without Atoms, glitches or ‚Äòexcessive grinding‚Äô
---
We are definitely going to have to just disagree over that I guess.  I've been doing plenty of things I don't enjoy, like NW.  If you're doing things not because you enjoy it, then you're already grinding.  But I concede that's subjective.
---
I have completed every weekly and daily outside of two NW daily challenges. I'm at level 92, so about a week to go.
---
no idk what that is
---
I always make sure I hit the u-mine-it to get a yee haw for good luck
---
&gt;Livity Prime is online. All systems nominal. One Love: Engaged. Mission: the destruction of any and all negative vibes.
---
That's good to know. Didn't realize you could tag it while it's still invincible.
---
I moved to melee because I don't have a lot of time to play and I would rather play the game than spend the time grinding materials and crafting ammo. I really hope melee isn't or don't stay fcked.
---
Super great idea.. would add alot of fun to workshops
---
I work 50+ hours a week and I completed the pass 3 weeks ago.
---
I know what is being said. 
---
I‚Äôm saying the button currently has a recharge timer of 24 hours.  The same as many other aspects of this game. 
---
Therefore, changing *this button* would represent a significant paradigm shift from all the other ‚Äòbuttons‚Äô in this game. 
---
Therefore, my post was around that concept. Why change one button and not the others, especially when this button is only about aesthetics and the other buttons are tied to character development and improvements?
---
Are new glitch?
---
Same thing!  This guy killed my teammate, who had taken a workshop.  So they're going back and forth.  I turn pacifist mode to OFF, and fast travel over to help.  This other player now kills me.  I respawn, but when I shoot him I do no damage.  I see the numbers pop up from my gatling plasma, all zeroes.
---
Wtf. I wish I did something productive enough for me to require ancient Babylonian methods. Well played sir!
---
Takes literally 30min max to do the dailies. 
---
If you can‚Äôt do that, then you‚Äôre not SUPOSED to end the legendary run. It‚Äôs to reward people who play the game. Not to give shit to people who don‚Äôt play the game. 
---
This fucking debate comes up in every single MMO or multiplayer game there is
---
WoW: but I want raid tier epic loot with zero effort , waaaah waaaaaaaaah. 
---
Apex Legends: I suck at this game because I only play 5 minutes a week, but I want all season rewards, waaaaaah waaaaaaaaaaaah. 
---
Influencers: I want you to make me free graphics for my channel and I‚Äôll pay you with exposure on my shit channel with 50 subscribers, waaaaah waaaaaaaaaaaaah. 
---
Stop being so fucking entitled
---
Please can you clarify if this is intentional?
---
u/ladydevann
---
&gt; We all do, but it has to do with those changes? Balanced game should  allow to play both team players and those who prefer solo play. 
---
They do. You can beat everything solo. But certain enemies take more hits and deal more damage when solo. That is the compromise.
---
There is a bug with some weapons where consecutive shots to one body part trigger a massive increase in damage. I tested a bloodied gauss mini on the queen yesterday to see if it was magic and almost accidentally deleted her.
---
Amazing Idea!!!
---
A mod that adds tagging that hasn't been updated
---
Then just add the ability to hide them.
---
Chinese Stealth Suit
---
All other things being nearly equal, I'd base the determination on whether you're going to use VATS or not.
---
But you don‚Äôt need to rank up those cards, I think you‚Äôre right only because you‚Äôre setting unreasonable short term goals. The whole purpose of these cards is to give you a good reason to keep wanting to level up and if you could just max out all these cards easily it would kind of defeat the purpose.
---
You could wear a hazmat suit? Just rip through rad x and radaway. Rush down one side,
---
Collect what I can, run back up. Radaway. Go down the other side, etc. It def requires coordination! I‚Äôve only completed the even once. You really need a team willing to work together.
---
Aren't there a couple of hazmat suits on a table as soon as you spawn into the event. For a bit more protection you could use Chinese stealth armour if you picked it up during the wastelanders quests
---
I try to take some pot shots while being a conduit, but it looks like I often don't do enough damage to count. Bethesda might want to tweak how much damage you need to do in order to get loot from a boss.
---
This.  I'm almost always at max caps and can't spend my caps on anything, since legendary modules cost scrip, and the weapons and armor I'm grinding for cost gold bullion for the plans, and can't be bought from vendors.
---
There's a brief period where I have my vendors on after buying gold, but as soon as I max out again they're off for a week.
---
There are multiple hazmat suits when you walk in the entryway and bathroom to the left
---
MOTD? That greek? I don't disagree with your idea but this is more to do with if I want to build a Hubris Comics and don't want to use 12 lights to sign it. Different usage - not a message as much as a brand. As for the budget, there are glitches to deal with that: long may they reign.
---
Radshield
---
I didn‚Äôt see the NW part! I‚Äôve only played once. What do I need to do?
---
I just stick it on mules. But this fill up to haha
---
My most recent character did the mobile camp thing as I played through the story. I have several modular buildings I can plop down almost anywhere. I may eventually find a nice place to settle down. My other two characters have more permanent locations.
---
is there a kink to this new damage model?
---
it's not intentional and apparently only happens with 'new' SH PAs, as in, crafted with plans bought with bullion/post wastelanders.
---
which implies there are two different types of SH PA. for whatever reason.
---
I‚Äôm convinced this is all a testing phase for a future game and it is going well enough to just keep moving forward. We are the fans in a fan sub. Everyone I see in the real world thinks the game is bad and never tried it. So they really aren‚Äôt losing much here. 
---
This shit is a live action dart board and it‚Äôs just cleaning out the drawing room floor for the next thing.
---
Full bar of health and hazmat/stealth suit should be enough for a full ore run
---
I can‚Äôt help but think this is the ground work for releasing new weapon perks, damage modifiers and other things that are completely ruined by multiplicative effects.
---
Just be patient, they‚Äôre likely trying to improve the game because numbers are way too high. Many MMO games have done this several times in their life cycle (WoW, FFXIV, etc).
---
This is the correct answer.
---
It‚Äôs a  model to make it more likely for you to spend money on atoms so you don‚Äôt have to play the game . In game Atom reduction by 70% in legendary run. The season pass requires an absurd amount of gameplay to achieve rewards .  In the end they are going after your wallet , they don‚Äôt care about your gameplay experience . It‚Äôs super scummy but that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing .
---
Hacked weapons are bad..but on the same note you can legally get a junkies limb damage lmg and melt the sbq in 3 mins due to some broken prefixes
---
for bows and crossbows, the explosive effect is a mod from a plan bought at crater or foundation. any crossbow can be modded to be explosive
---
The range is quite big. Ofc if you‚Äôre in an entire different zone, it won‚Äôt work.   
---
But sheepsquash area is not that big. 
---
It‚Äôs smaller than radiation rumble and I never miss loot there while running ores will defenders stay in the middle.  
---
And on sheepsquash I normally dps with the conduits in my team. They never missed out on loot, not even on the legendary gutsy that I kill
---
Btw this also help if you ever get respawn glitch and have to relog: if you rejoin the team you should be able to get your loot as well
---
The leaves showing is an intentional effect. Some skins actually look quite cool with them.
---
Though having an option to toggle them would be cool
---
"Rake in as much ... money as possible with as few resources as they can get away with."  that's business under capitalism baby.  Applies to a lot more than games.
---
Yeah and if we already have the item In question it doesn't pick it up just refers us to our inventory. I'd like one for outfits and armours too.
---
It‚Äôs not subjective. It‚Äôs mathematics. 
---
How many days did the Double SCORE last?  Because that‚Äôs how many days were shaved off of the 9 week total I quoted.  Add in the repeatable 100 SCORE weekly and every 20th time you earned that shaved another full day off the total, up to 14, and then every 25th time after that.
---
We‚Äôre about to hit the end of week seven. Shaving off 14 days from the calculated nine weeks wouldn‚Äôt be that hard, with the Double SCORE and Double XP we‚Äôve had.
---
Because it would make people happy by allowing them to play on their schedule rather than every day, when there is really real reason to require every day play? Again, this is how most every game does it, so it‚Äôs not like folks are being radical.
---
&gt; You sure are a bright spark of sarcasm aren't you! 
---
Your lack of self awareness is astounding.
---
I use the excavator suit with rad shield and can clear out ore from one location then use radaway then enter the next zone ready to get ore
---
I appreciate the sentiment. Upvote just on the off-chance someone downvotes you too for taking on an agreeable position to my comment.
---
Seems to me that she won‚Äôt land until all of her Scorched minions are dead. I usually start checking the perimeter for that one straggler, then she lands.
---
I figured SBQ was as much at this point. But yeah, FM is also bugged for me, I guess.
---
Very interesting find. Thanks for the info
---
I‚Äôm not sure how this would make them more broken. Don‚Äôt they already melt limbs as is?
---
Wellp, I'll get that done in -checks watch- ten years.
---
I dare to disagree with you - have you tried to finish solo Daily ops when game give you robots with ranged weapon immunity? If you don't have a team when at least one player can do significant melee damage you're screwed.
---
Just join me in a match, and down yourself twice. I can just build a long staircase and we can both complete the challenge.
---
There are but they're often gone unless the area has reloaded since the last event.
---
I often find all the hand placed loot gone on arrival.
---
Nah. It‚Äôd give us a reason to use the plasma pulse capacitors!
---
Spoken like a true member of the Appalachia People‚Äôs Front. Not those People‚Äôs Front of Appalachia. Wankers. Piss off!
---
I didn't argue with your maths, in fact even in my initial post I did say that I'd have some time to spare.  I did however point out that something you might not consider 'grinding' can definitely be grinding.  That is the subjective part.
---
What's the issue with stacked punji boards?
---
You are killing all Bethesda games going forward by encouraging awful spending practices and FOMO. Thank you for investing in Bethesda and telling them it's alright. I'm absolutely looking forward to most of the content in their future games being locked behind paywalls because "small indie studio".
---
I‚Äôm a fan of this, too. There are so many other grinds in the game, worrying about using coins/scrips/atoms and if they will be worth whatever you are buying only to have what you bought suck and start the grind all over again on top of the timed SCORE grind if you‚Äôre trying to get the final reward. It would be nice to just have a set benchmark. Every 50 levels you get a legendary perk. What would be the down side to this system?
---
K, just lemme know whenever you‚Äôre ready! (Ps I don‚Äôt have a mic, but doesn‚Äôt sound like we‚Äôll need one)
---
I wouldn‚Äôt go so far as to say it‚Äôs ‚Äúinsulting‚Äù :) Just obviously wrong!  I‚Äôm a working adult on pace to finish on time, and that‚Äôs with me missing some days and having bug issues some day. I do agree that it helps that I‚Äôm WFH.
---
Just wanna say I thoroughly enjoyed your responses in this thread and upvoted all of them.
---
The only players who have even reached that level are ones who abused the god mode exploit, this is VERY long term goals they are setting! And this is only counting for one character, if you play multiple different builds this isn't ever going to happen!
---
Same. I realised I was doing the same loops every day, got max caps, camp hopped, while looking for events all the time. So I took a break. Came back every time they gave us new content. Then I came back just before wastlanders, got a new character to level 50 for wastlanders. Played both the raiders and settlers quest, was great. And fell into a loop again. So I took a break. Came back for legendary run realised I'm not a fan of the grind.
---
In another post, I detailed the positive benefits of time-gating. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt mean I like it.  It doesn‚Äôt mean I approve of it. 
---
It means I *understand* it.
---
I don‚Äôt trust Bethesda not to screw up something so critical like a major paradigm shift in how progress in this game occurs.  The time-gating is a bandage to issues that shouldn‚Äôt exist on the first place.
---
Well  he would obviously have to wear a mask
---
Alright then 6 weeks to complete.
---
That's still 4 weeks worth the downtime of doing no challenges and I'd be able to complete it.
---
I don't disagree - doing the dailies themselves can be extremely tedious. (I spent probably 30 minutes yesterday just looking for one legendary spawn.) And they definitely aren't "play your game" kinda things, either.
---
I was just pushing back on this concept that they're unachievable for a "working adult". That's just a false flag complaint, and distracts from the many other issues the SCORE system has that we should be focusing on.
---
I‚Äôm good to go, did you get my friend request?
---
I'm level 445 and have NO IDEA how this shit works and no desire to now lol
---
That really sucks. Never had it happen to me (or if it has, I haven't noticed bc I have 3 characters each with +/-800 lbs of guns) but for 6k I'm sure you could replace it. What gun was it? I'm on Xbox too.
---
Just down some stairs from the donation box is a stash box, power armor station, and some other workbench.  üëç
---
I‚Äôm thinking about rp-ing him as being annoyed about the scorched vaccine. But idk
---
Over the past month or so, I've heard of people having weapons just vanish (both from stash &amp; personal inventory). This predominately seems to affect "legacy" weapons.
---
I have no idea if it's intentional by BGS or just a bug, but I heard directly from a player that his Double Minigun just disappeared from this inventory (player inventory).
---
Yep, getting on now
---
do i have to do anything or just try them on behemot or something?
---
This\^.  The vault 94 scout masks and thorn/solar armor suffer from an issue related to this as well.  Armor and masks crafted/earned before wastelanders lost all of their leaves and decoration for some reason leaving them as plain scout items.
---
Agreed - my whole outlook on the event changed the moment &amp; put on the suit and found I could run my ass off to get the ore and not immediately die from radiation.
---
You just need to optimize everything.  
---
I work 7 days on, 7 days off, 12 hour shifts and still get everything done every day during my "on" week.  Occasionally there is a NW challenge that is too time consuming and I skip it.  You just need to prepare a bit and hoard common fetch items.  
---
-Pick up all the bubblegum and pre war food stuffs you casually come across every day.  Eating these are common challenges.  
---
-If you come across power armor, take the parts and store it.  Scrap power armor is a common challenge.
---
-Have some plants ready to go with fertilizer for crop planting challenge.  
---
-Take one of the really easy to take workshops like the landfill when that comes up.  
---
-On my off week, I start a bunch of level 1'ers and get them within a few points of leveling up ready to go for the 
---
next week.  
---
-For the "kill three legendary enemies" event, server hop until you see either Uranium Fever or Leader of the Pack.  Both spawn 3 guaranteed legendaries.
---
-Concentrate on doing the easy events for complete an event while in a group events.  My favorite is "manhunt."  You literally just need to roll into the Grafton Dam and kill one low level super mutant.  Boom, done, take about 30 seconds.
---
-For kill cryptids, kill the grafton monster that hangs out in between the Poseidon Power Plant and Charleston Train Yard.  It's low level and guaranteed spawn.
---
-And the most important tip of all --&gt; Buy an SSD and load FO76 on it.  This cuts your load times by a massive amount of time.  What took me a minute and a half to load on the old HDD takes about 15 seconds with an SSD.
---
Then most of the rest of them are very easy.  Buy 3 items?  Just buy some .38 ammo for 1 cap a piece somewhere.  Join a team?  A few seconds.  Take a picture while in a group?  A few seconds.  Kill a deathclaw?  Deathclaw island.
---
If you are well prepared, you are usually done within 20-25 minutes every day.
---
I just ran into this problem. I had no idea so many other players have been dealing with this for as long as 9 days. I‚Äôm a big fan of fallout games for the lore but I strayed away from 76 because of the reviews. Once it came out on gamepass with updates I decided to give it a try. I had no complaints up until this point. Hopefully this can be sorted out soon.
---
our entire group of hardcore players is feeling this way. You are not alone.
---
i work 45+ hours a week. so i don't get to play as much as i like and when i do i don't like being forced to do the same mundane tasks over and over and over and over and over again. so i just wait for my first member atoms every month and buy a few levels. its just a game not virtual life. I'm not coming home and starting my virtual job every day . if i dont make it ot 100 big deal they will release the stuff in the atoms shop anyway or a variant of it. if not o like i really needed a fireplace doorway that everyone knows is a door.
---
It was just a BFSS shiskebab. I got it cheap in my opinion, it‚Äôs more of the principle, like what if that was a legacy or something... I‚Äôm scared to even keep weapons now
---
Anything with lots of health. Sheepsquatches and Mirelurk Queens are good because they have enough health and it's easy to maintain fire on one body part.
---
and try to scare everyone out of the old abandoned amusement park so he can buy it from the owner dirt cheap
---
Base cards are free, upgrades cost 100, 150, 200 coins and you get 2 coins per current perk card "scrapped".
---
Things can still change, as they have in the past...
---
Mega OOF sorry man
---
I do that every once in a while. Usually farm a resource nearby and build up a big fancy garden for a bit, then decide I'd like another resource and head on out.
---
My main is currently right under Pleasant Valley Station, sitting on the Junk mine. That one seems to be oddly popular, not sure why.
---
But I had the Lead mine south of Federal Disposal Field HZ-21 for a long time. Was really easy to farm lead and  acid/oil from the Workshop there, anybody building their own weapons and ammo on the reg should camp there for a bit.
---
I play my Raider more like you do, though. Must be the roleplaying aspect of it, but I dont have him sitting anywhere for too long, heh.
---
The CAMP was made for people like that more than it was for long-time settlers, I think.
---
No doubt, I am totally with you on the "what if" aspect. There are a few guns I'd be gutted if I lost. Sounds like you did get a good deal on it. I don't keep melee weapons but if I come across one like this I'll look you up.
---
Why would you claim a workshop while overweight with junk, though? I mean you have to expect someone coming in and killing you on spot, at least a little bit. That's what workshops are basically for, a harvest of players overflowing with junk.
---
if?
---
they are definitely changing it yo.. there is no if
---
And u have to level up every day!! Thats just absurd!! Ive went up over 100 levels bc of this run
---
Sounds tedious.
---
Thanks
---
If you're not looking for PVP and wish to reduce the probability of players challenging your workshops, keep your extractors unlocked. That's generally the only thing other players want, and if you give them no reason to challenge, they'll take some mats and leave.
---
Stop with this "working adults" bullshit. It's a buzz phrase that has no meaning.
---
Most of us work. Most of us are adults. We all have different professional and personal time commitments. Most of us are able to stay apace of the SCORE system. 
---
The reality is that it takes maybe an hour a night to get the bulk of the challenges done. And that is enough to keep you at a pace to complete the season. 
---
If you miss a few days, yes - you will fall behind unless you grind. That sucks, and it's annoying, but that's how ALL online games work. 
---
Personally, I'd prefer they changed things to "weeklies" instead of dailies, but if we're stuck with dailies these are hardly the worst out there.
---
sign is probably making more people kill them than not...
---
and when personal instanced bunkers come out for players. my camp will just be BoS bunkers and an arrow point down to my door.
---
They rotate in and out infrequently. I would expect to see it again in maybe a month.
---
Love it.
---
It's currently 250 for the last upgrade.
---
Honestly it doesn't matter, even without the sign every time I come back they're dead.
---
Stacking damage in a camp, usually hidden, that insta-kills anyone who steps on it, leaving a nice bag of junk for the camp owner to steal. Was supposed to be fixed in the last patch, but they were too busy breaking legitimate building mechanics, I guess.
---
I think they added the piercing gaze to prevent people from sneaking by everything, but it mostly killed the stealth commando builds. Wish they would just give them a big radius which they can detect you.
---
Jesus christ how long did this take you to setup
---
Definitely much better than the play every day or piss off method they chose
---
So kind of related. I noticed around Friday or Saturday that 2 of my hacker perk cards were gone now I'm back to lvl 1 hacking after being maxed for about 2 wks. I haven't noticed anything else though.
---
I miss FO76's peaceful nature.
---
Last year, I could hop in and out of the game as I wanted, without worries. Whenever I was playing it was relaxing, peaceful, basically a "do whatever you want to do".
---
Then Wasterlanders came and I almost burn myself from grinding reputation and public events to get the gold for what I wanted. 
---
And then S1 came, and my playtime become focused on working on that... And S1 is not even done that S2 is already looming in the corner.
---
But as usual, Bethesda will ignore all of that.
---
Ok thanks, so it is most definitely a bug then. I never got SH from the raid, mine is from the bullion yes.
---
I'll post a ticket to raise this properly, I just wasn't sure if it was always this way.
---
I've bought 5/6 of the SH plans, I wish I had checked this sooner! My plan was to put atomic onslaught skin on to hide the leaves altogether.
---
Don't worry, I'm sure they will 'listen' and make it worse, like the ammo converter.
---
Dafuq?! I can't watch the videos right now but this looks absolutely awesome!
---
It mostly just make you in constant "DANGER", so sneak attacks are impossible.
---
I'm in the same boat, I will probably have to switch to a magic weapon somehow or maybe even a decent vampire's heavy weapon.
---
Xd dont destroy my favorite way to annoy my friend...
---
It‚Äôs to keep you playing and done so deliberately. The more you play, the more likely you are going to get fed up and spend real world money. I wish more people would realize this. Every grindy mechanic is done 100% on purpose.
---
That‚Äôs cool I appreciate that. Hopefully this is a one time thing because I haven‚Äôt lost anything before this
---
Seems it's a bug, a couple people have said it only happens with sets purchases from the bullion system.
---
&gt;Daily ops
---
Get a partner for that then. Or bring some melee weapons to switch to.
---
Allowing a bloodied explosive laser rifle to benefit from rifleman/commando, shotgunner perks and demo expert that means that it would be original damage √ó1.95(bloodied max) x1.25(explosive) x1.9(rifleman perks max) x1.9(shotgunner perks max x1.6(demo expert max)
---
If the laser rifle did 100 damage per shot base and had bloodied, explosive, shotgunner and rifleman perks and demo expert that would make the gun do 1408 damage. Without shotgunner that would be 741
---
That's an extra 667 damage from them benefitting from shotgunner perks due a beam splitter, almost double the damage.
---
Both.
---
1. Is a separate thread necessary when there's 1 already on the front of the sub?
---
2. 30 minutes a day is usually all that's required to complete all challenges. Weeklies, overall, might take an hour altogether. Some weeklies always overlap with dailies too (e.g. kill legendary enemies, build up camp are 2 I can remember immediately). So, no, this is not for stay at home players because they'll have nothing to do with it after the first hour.
---
If you find it that needing just 30 minutes a day not even every day (I'm 94, no ranks bought, done maybe FIVE NW dailies altogether) to get a mix of cosmetics that provide no benefit and some junk utility items with a bit of useful stuff like the lunchboxes is unfair, a single player offline game might be better for you, since almost any newer online game will have a some form of season pass. Again, none of the items in the season pass are necessary for gameplay. Just because you got FOMO, doesn't mean every working adult that plays this game does.
---
Can you do anything in there with a stealth commando build? Most dmg output is from sneak attacks, which will be nonexistent now.
---
My head hurts.
---
Put a wall down.
---
Place a flamethrower trap and activate it so it destroys said wall.
---
Place another wall next to the destroyed one , and repair.
---
The Junkies one has the potential to be "magic" IIRC, i.e. deal obscene amounts of damage due to a bug when the fire rate is close to 200 and a few other considerations apply. Slapping a tribarrel or maybe a pentabarrel on it should be enough to get there. With five addictions, it's also the one that deals the most damage per shot even without that bug, so it's the most ammo-efficient one.
---
The AA gun is one I'd keep if you don't want to go the Junkie's (or exploit-y bugged damage) route and don't live in power armor. The changes to damage calculations in the current PTS build make AA more relevant again. I expect things will change from current PTS to the next live patch, but AA will probably be pretty decent even if Bethesda tweaks those numbers a bit before this hits the live servers.
---
Finally, if you don't do Junkies but do live in power armor, the Two-Shot should be your best bet, although it will probably be weaker than the other two against the SBQ. With armor penetration from the Stabilized perk, this is bound to be a pretty decent gun against anything that isn't as armored-up as the SBQ.
---
I don't think this will ever be useful anywhere else... except in 2000 B.C. Babylonia
---
But their resources are limited. So. Big cheats or little cheats?
---
Wow.  Simply amazing.
---
Or just check this video and see if you have any of those prefixes that make the magic happen...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs
---
Does the skin still work on the sets obtained from vault raids post wastelanders? Or is it now broken on both the sets?
---
It‚Äôll probably be back soon put i cant promise it. The nuka cola machine was in the shop like 3 weeks ago and returned this week along with the simple power armor paint.
---
Hmm, this is a thing in the upcoming event "daily ops". That enemies are cloaked. Maybe some of those files are already in the game and are Messing things up
---
That'd be great :-)
---
Lag in inventory is not by number of items count IE... Grafton Dam keys x 6 it‚Äôs caused by number of unique items.  While I would love to have a tidy single key option and a key ring, it‚Äôs the amount of other stuff you have.
---
A post about a month ago did a good job explaining this.  If you want to speed things up, drop all your none quest/mini game holos, all non-quest notes, all worthless outfits, smelt all your ores and reduce the amount of items in you stash and on your character.
---
It has made huge speed improvements and my favorites wheel works so much better.
---
Maybe he ran off to live free in Appalachia! Maybe the aliens abducted him.
---
I'm amazed the game engine didn't suck itself into a black hole the moment you asked it to do simple calculus.
---
Power armor?
---
Thank you dude, really appreciate it.
---
Well for the PA it's the opposite.  The glitch is with new stuff while with the scout stuff it's the old stuff that is messed up.  I can put skins on my strangler sets fine because i built them all from raiding 94 before wastelanders
---
It probably took me 2+ hours to figure out how to wire it (I tried a lot of different methods) and then another one and a half hours to actually create it from scratch. I built it at a workshop so I had to get it all done in one play session.
---
The hornwright keys are all separate items but thanks for post ill look into it thanks.
---
Anytime, and thank you too!
---
The way I see it, the people who have a dozen ammunition factories aren‚Äôt hurting anyone. It‚Äôs people who crash servers to dupe that hurt you.
---
Sometimes I'm just happy to not have a wifu. Then I would have problems like these to worry about.
---
Yeah, we will have to swap to a heavy build if we want to do the daily ops. It's unfortunate for sure.
---
I didn't time it but all said and done probably 3-4 hours to figure it out and build it
---
&gt;Because it would be more then broken
---
Than\*
---
bro... BRO... that's like, THE BEST idead ever in the history of ideas
---
What have I missed? I dropped 500 steel off there last week but didn‚Äôt know I had to get anything from there
---
They probably cannot. Maybe the holos but not keys or terminal entries.
---
Agreed. I hide razorgrain among natural foliage far away from my brahmin and some depraved individuals will destroy that too üò§üò§ bastards
---
Frankly whenever i see someone say something like this, it makes me want to go kill Brahmin
---
Yeah, I agree.  I think the best compromise I have seen is that everyone gets 2 perk coins for each level, and then you can get 1 perk coin for each perk scrapped.  This way no one is screwed out of coins because they were changing their spec, but we also get a little something for cleaning up our UI.
---
His comment really was horrible, lol.
---
He stole that chinese tech
---
I mean... I doubt it‚Äôs the best idea anyone‚Äôs ever had. But thank you!
---
If your friends like those kind of games, you should all try Ark : Survival evolved. You can have your own server, build bases as big as you want and everywhere you want and the devs actually care about their game/players.
---
You're getting a lot of shit here, but you're not wrong.  The season is just kind of un-fun because either you're struggling to keep up or having to load up on XP levelling and do chores every day.  I played during the beta and free weekends, then finally bought the game when Wastelanders came out so I'm familiar with it but was pretty low level and haven't done most of the base game content.  I started out the season at around level 20 and was enjoying the story.  Now after getting caught up in the legendary run I've levelled up to 50 and have fast travelled all over the map to do events, but have completely lost track of the story and not sure I'll ever finish it now.  
---
Yes, you don't have to do the legendary run but the whole system is designed to suck you in and then make you feel like doing anything else is wasting your time.  It's also kind of predatory because the levelling slows down as you go higher.  So you'll breeze through the first 1/3 of the board, but that last 1/3 is a slog.
---
I'm glad that people are getting through it easily or if people can do the dailies in 30 minutes, but I've spend over an hour trying to just do a single NW challenge before.  And especially when I was lower level I just couldn't hang in more difficult events and didn't know what to even do to maximize my time or where to even find specific enemy types for those challenges.  
---
In the end, the legendary run is definitely a way for Bethesda to get more income from people who work to buy spaces on the board.  Almost every thread lately has people admitting that they got sick of the grind and just paid atoms to finish the last few levels.  This is probably true for most season systems in games, but it doesn't change what it is.  Personally I have very little free time in a day and typically would go days between playing games.  I've made some exceptions to play 76 to see how far I could get but it's not sustainable.  It feels like Bethesda has made it worse by being quiet about some of the details like actually  being able to buy some the rewards after the season or even how long it's going to last.

The junkies one with the tribarrel has 102 fire rate so i guess thats not close to 200.

These items where there before ATLAS closed

As someone who's a bit OCD about inventory management, seeing I have 2 of a key yet 1 of every other key is exceptionally aggravating.

Hold up. This would never be in addition. If the splitter was on there, it would only benefit from shotgun perks. Same as how an automatic laser rifle shouldn‚Äôt benefit from rifleman perks.
---
This is one of the biggest sources of welcome frustration for me. I will find an idyllic spot for a CAMP, and spend hours upon hours getting my home setup perfectly.
---
And then two weeks later I will find a spot I've never been to before that is even better. 
---
I currently have a spot SW from Watoga that I love, and I've got a great CAMP setup. But my waypoint marker is set at where my next CAMP will be already.
---
If you're at the event you should get boss loot. I'm even going to go a step further and say that legendary loot you don't pick up should find its way into your inventory anyway.
---
Prolly because you have shit in your vendor or people need to look for it.
---
If the vendor is straight at the spawning point, there is no reason for most players to go snooping.
---
This game is not good
---
YOU BUILT IT WHERE? ONLY 2 HOURS?? I spend longer than that finding a way to incorporate stairs into my shitty house that I don't want to rebuild. With all that wiring, did you accidently miswire something and couldn't figure out what was wrong or was it without mistakes?
---
I can't go in there now as it's closed, I should have got them before the Update
---
When you get up to Level 150+ you‚Äôll have so many levelups saved up you can just change the build anytime you want
---
Damn ok dope well this post probably ended up more insightful for me I'll definitely throw it on for my Bloodied melee and try it out. Ricochet does sound better than evasive then. Having a chance to avoid all damage is way more significant than maybe a couple points of reduced damage
---
Right ok.
---
On the power armour helmet I just crafted, in the name at the end, there's a weird symbol at the end, which looks like a square with a notch missing at the top.
---
So it's like:
---
'strangler heart power armour helmet ‚ñ°'
---
Not sure if the symbol is on the old one but just thought it was weird.
---
Good luck out there
---
It take so long to turn very many of these tickets in, I suggest to try and clear these often.

My vendors are inside a greenhouse dome in front of the fast travel point and I sell plans which the most expensive of is 10 caps so I don't think it's that. :/

We had this thread already earlier in the weekend.

Long story short, Seasons are designed to be a challenge, and no matter what the setup is, people would say they are too hard and unfair, for whatever reason. 
---
Be thankful you're in a position in life where you can be a working adult who still has time to enjoy videogames, and stop thinking everyone's experience should be adjusted for your specific situation.
---
The first 2-3 hours was finding out how to wire it and troubleshoot different problems that came up. I've done a lot of these types of builds so when it came time to do the final build I think I only made one or two small mistakes. They're actually easy to find because most powered objects have a small green light that comes on when they're receiving power, so you can use those like a kind of stack trace.

I dont give a flip what a youtuber says if i dont like the change,i just wont play .

Might as well go the extra miles and separate Weapons into actual weapon category too, some of those things are just confusing as to where they belong anyway.

This. Chinese Stealth Armor &gt; Hazmat suit &gt;&gt; Power Armor. CSA and hazmat suit have 98% radiation reduction before their 1000 rad resist. PA "only" has 90% radiation reduction for a full suit and somewhere between 300 and 500 rad resist at best. This difference is relevant at Radiation Rumble but pretty much nowhere else because nothing else has those rad levels.

I'm so happy someone else said this. Whenever I see people say it's "not fair for working adults" it always makes me roll my eyes.

I spend money but I sure as hell am not getting tricked. I pay because it‚Äôs the best themed  sandbox game I‚Äôve played. Currently their is nothing else  around that interests me. I played terraria,Minecraft aNd Conan exiles to the ground. All the other sandbox builders are mediocre to me at best. The community and additional content and ever changing map helps keep me playing. During dry spells like now I play moded fallout 3/Vegas. Honestly the worst part is just lack of pc moderation. This patch has the largest amount of duper‚Äôs going ham. Top it off with the worst exploitation of nuclear winter. Like 70% use esp. But their is infinite ammo,aimbots,autoloot,spread reduction,infinite so, wall clipping, send damage, turret spamming, speed hacking, gauss shotgun exploitation and more! Circling jerking over a new system that‚Äôs being implemented horribly doesn‚Äôt matter to me because I don‚Äôt intend to use it anyway. I have three characters in the hundreds I have no intention to get to level 200-1000 no matter how they roll with it.
---
Somewhere, sometimes someone will discover your calculator and will be amazed and at the same time be really confused.
---
In my opinion, some aspects of Fallout 76 should have stayed the same as Fallout 4. A perfect example of this is the perk system. There are some more funky mechanics and aspects, but that's all i'm gonna mention.
---
It‚Äôs all about time management, I am 58 y/o and work 9 hours a day 5 days a week. I train for triathlons 2-5 hours a day and much to my wife‚Äôs displeasure still get in a couple hours of play time each weekday and about 4 hours each on Sat/Sun.  She says I am addicted and I tell her yes.  Why can't she understand the excitement when I roll a 3\* Bloodied Gauss Minigun?  Life is good.

I hate that man. Last one i did,  I took all 3 pylons, but the event was SUPER laggy. I was running up hill after grabbing the center pylon. The imposter was by the shack and by the time i got there it was already dead, didnt even get a chance to see it let alone shoot it. Event was over so damn fast i couldn't beleive it. Kinda BS.
---
What about something like fallout 4 with the dream machine for Valentine. You go into it and have to complete a few short missions. But to fix the machine, needs some sort of rare crafting materials to fix between uses. Stick it in a free states bunker where they used it for entertainment. I think that would fit lore
---
Hey OP - you wouldn't happen to be running at 140+ FPS would you?
---
Hardly bent out of shape about it, but okay. I made one supposition to your three potential suppositions; tell me how I should've arrived at any of those from seeing full event teams and active events with no players at them? Being on an Event team grants the players intention that they're going to be attending and participating in events, so it's not an assumption on my part of those players intents - it's them stating "Hey, we want to do events, look at us, we're on a freaking *EVENTS* team!"
---
The only benefit to being on an events team is XP from doing events, if the four friends were going to be on a team and not do events, their team leader should've changed the goal of the team to something they would all benefit from, whether it's increased endurance, luck, charisma, or intelligence. 
---
Besides, if it were 4 IRL friends, wouldn't they just join a private team to get other benefits, if they're not worried about getting the event xp from a public team?
---
...more proof that numbers are evil.
---
I mean. Well done and congrats and respect for all the patience and energy you put into this.
---
But still. Numbers. Evil. x\_x

---
I think if you give us 3 Perk Coins per level, and then at least 1 per Perk card we scrap, then we could realistically do fairly well.  I also think Perk Coins should be rewards for quest lines and or daily events.
---
Agreed, more personalisations!
---
not everyone is just complaining, some people just giving opinions, perspective or insight, talking about broken stuff ect. but maybe all you see, or care about is complaining. 
---
getting super invested, and trying to moralize why people do or dont want to play a game is just unhealthy dude.
---
Because that event is garbage and the legendary system is garbage
---
Throwing on some XP buffs and clearing out WestTek isn‚Äôt ‚Äògrinding‚Äô by any stretch of the imagination.
---
I can complete the dailies usually in about 20 minutes, if that, with the exception of the Level Up and the NW if it‚Äôs not one of the simple ones. 
---
- Build 10 things: Plant then scrap Corn, repeat nine times. 
---
- Buy/Sell three items: Go to a player vendor and buy three pieces of ammo.
---
- Cook 3 Plant Meals: Corn Soup x3
---
- Kill 3 Glowing Creatures: Blackwater Mine yard area. Kill three Mole Miners. 
---
- Kill 10 Super Mutants: Go to West Tek and get this done before you even step foot inside. 
---
- Gold Star: See above
---
- Complete an Event: There are so many to choose from and easy to force start on your own if you want, like a Workshop Defense. And since the Prison Warden is incompetent, you can often either do Jail Break or Manhunt. Which can take care of the Kill Super Mutant challenges as well 
---
- Chew Bubblegum: This may be the most challenging, if you have to go look for gum. But once you know this is a challenge, you save your gum just for this.
---
These are easy challenges.  Even the Weeklies aren‚Äôt tough. 
---
- 25 critical hits?  Switch to a shotgun and you‚Äôre done after clearing out the liberators by Vault 76.
---
- Build up a camp or workshop?  I‚Äôve got a blueprint for that.
---
- Complete a Gold Star Daily challenge?  Easiest 1500 SCORE ever. 
---
These aren‚Äôt ‚Äògrinds‚Äô. They‚Äôre either actions many of us do normally or they‚Äôre brief diversions.
---
What are you even talking about? Everything they build is natural. You can find a holotape literally guiding you on how to build one of those effigy things you‚Äôre talking about, with sticks and bones and shit
---
Please ! This is so important! I cant sell shit without everything lagging out because theres so many duplicate keys in inventory!
---
Just let us dump and scrap them, like the pro snap camera, repair kits and lunchboxes etc
---
Not to be mean, but I just don't get it. Why do people feel the need to grind for a "season pass" thats free.
---
You don't HAVE to do it. I never check challenges and I'm over 50 on LR.
---
10c / plan? Then it must be your location, if you are in a high lvl area and are selling only plans that might only be useful fore newbs ...
---
Hahaha yeah definitely, in a perfect world though, this would be fun. Obviously I wish for a lot more simple fixes before this, just let a man dream ;)
---
Same, i dont even bother buying the cards on new chars. Same with hacking.
---
It is a shame they do nothing with the faction system in this game. May as well not even be there like before
---
What I‚Äôm trying to say is that the legendary cards aren‚Äôt meant to be maxed out. Instead they exist as a goal post, something to give you a reason to keep playing. And the slots are unlocked account wide so you‚Äôll always have access to these cards on multiple character builds. Yes, you‚Äôre shouldn‚Äôt be expecting to unlock all the legendary cards unless you put in a lot of effort. But if you don‚Äôt want to do that then you don‚Äôt have to, just take it easy and enjoy the journey to get all those cards.
---
I would actually prefer not to become wanted for helping defend an attack and accidentally splash damaging their poop generator.
---
I don't even. Litteraly. Orignally started and have built my self into a weird heavy weapons/stealth setup that gets weird sneak attack damage calculations with a flamer. When not creaping around like that one person who ALWAYS knows when your teenager is taking out the garbage and brings you cupcakes on labor day I'm generally a self defeating ammo hose that frequently holds right click till the daka stops.
---
I'm bad at this but still kill stuff and finish quests and content. &lt;.&lt;
---
That‚Äôs what they said, pending any surprises.
---
I noticed that too. Kind of annoying
---
Cheers! I'm glad someone did!
---
I'm located at Charlston Station so technically still in the forest.
---
Before I got the stealth suit, I'd grab a hazmat suit in one of the rooms at the beginning area that's off to the side before you get down into the event area proper. It helped quite a bit.
---
Slots are, but other characters are only ever going to get rank 1 cards, perk coins and levelled up cards are character bound!
---
I work full time, have three kids, recently moved, and help around the house. I play every chance I get but I'm barely to where I'm one step away from the tree.
---
It's not fair :(

FREE STATES

You can see them on the wiki but I am afraid getting them ingame is impossible most likely.

Rank 1 cards are all unlocked at the start

damn him to hell!
---
Not talking about the bones and sticks. I'm talking about the giant, massive unnatural roots and trees that are covering their bases. Like the huge twisted mangled tree that is growing around the church by the cemetary that somehow popped up in the year it took the wastelanders to come back (it's only been a year since 76 opened canon wise)
---
That's like 360 atoms wtf
---
Just wait until he has to pay taxes.
---
I once saw a gutsy shoot an assaultron head laser from its laser arm.  I assumed that it was an assaultron that respawned as a gutsy without dying or something.  
---
That was frightening.
---
I agree it‚Äôs a little forgotten feeling
---
I honestly don‚Äôt get the atomic shop. Its clear they want us to spend money in there but it‚Äôs hardly ever populated with unique content. There should skins for everything in the game lol. But no. And I get the psychological reasons why they vault stuff but it doesn‚Äôt work on me at least and there‚Äôs things I want to buy but can‚Äôt so do I save my money? No I just spend it somewhere else.
---
Ohhhhhhhh...
---
I kill every brahmin I see and will continue to do so
---
Yeah especially with it been closed, unless it reopens once the BoS arrive
---
It killed me pretty quick the first time, re spawned and knew it was there.  I dispatched pretty quickly but man that was a surprise.
---
Exactly, so having a requirement of thousands of levels is just unattainable if you play multiple builds! As they upgraded cards are locked to that character.
---
*What survival aspect are you even talking about*. There's no real risk in swapping cards and stuff like having to swap in your cards just to **craft decently in your damn camp** and having to swap out is just tedium. What MMO (or MMOlike) has you do that tedious shit just to craft at a base or such?
---
Why? You gain nothing and it's just griefing people.
---
This should‚Äôve been the ultimate concept from the start. It‚Äôs been put in place in many looter shooters like Destiny, all unclaimed weapons even the lesser rarity weapons would be waiting for you at the Postmaster. Why? Because sometimes loot can fall off the map or in the case of 76, quite literally go through solid terrain or out of bounds. Time and time again I would have a sheepsquatch disintegrated and have the pile underneath a grassland or the damn SBQ go on a tangent to the outer bounds of the map or even maybe the game just crashes because of how poorly the game allocates my PC‚Äôs resources...
---
wow that would suck
---
Let me guess, across the station, at the small pond?
---
I dunno what to say man.  I went into West Tek once or twice to explore, and probably once or twice for quests, and I wouldn't go again because it no longer interests me.
---
And like I already said, if I'm doing something I don't actually enjoy, then that's what a grind is.  I don't know how you can really argue with that.  But have a nice day.
---
There are certain things that still show as unique line items that cannot be dropped. IIRC, the keycards for Robot Rumble are like this.
---
I wish they would change the whole perk system to be honest. I hate perk cards and how clunky the management of them is. At the very least they need to add perk card ‚Äúloadouts‚Äù so you can quickly switch between builds.
---
I finished, paid my last few free atoms to get it done at level 80. It is nice to not think of dailies, and never cared for the donations. 
---
Enjoy what new adventure you go to, fair winds and following seas.
---
Ah, but the trick is, it's about the *effective* firerate. The gauss weapons have an inherent explosive effect, so each bullet causes two hits. So with the tribarrel, the effective firerate is over 200. You might want to test it out against a tough enemy like a level 95 super mutant behemoth, but it should work.
---
Its pot luck some days i can be done in as little as 20mins other days can be like 2-3 hours.
---
&gt;not everyone is just complaining,
---
Just the people quitting over needing 2 shots instead of just 1 to kill everything short of the Queen.
---
Its didnt survive long enough for.me to find out if it was just a visual glitch or not.  I probably should have checked, but the second I saw that beam.  KILL.
---
They may be working, but if they're complaining that a video game isn't catering to their particular lifestyle I have to question the "adult" part.
---
yeah like the critter spawns when wastelanders dropped and people were reporting before fashnacht
---
oh wait
---
Nope, almost though, it's on the other side just behind the station under the power tower.
---
By that definition, anything can be a ‚Äògrind‚Äô. 
---
My confusion is that if it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs an integral part of an activity, and that activity is voluntary and meant to be enjoyable, then it‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt be viewed as a ‚Äògrind‚Äô. 
---
So, tell me; how do *you* want SCORE to be awarded and the rewards from the Season earned?
---
Especially when the one saying it was rank 83 a [week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i5sniw/bring_back_atom_challenges_for_those_already_done/g0vz7a8) ago with multiple characters lol.
---
Well duh, an automatic laser rifle benefits from commando perks. That's why I said commando/ rifleman. Still wouldnt make a difference to the calculations I made. 
---
What would be the point in having them benefit from shotgunner perks anyway? It would just do the same as rifleman and commando perks, just one different stat point. I suppose it could benefit from other shotgun based perks but why not just add perks for energy weapons?
---
Yup same. Before, I would log in and when I used the favorite wheel it would lag really badly. I dropped all notes and holotapes and works perfectly now. 
---
I get what he‚Äôs asking though because the inventory is a clusterfuck. 
---
Getting rid of keys would help make things easier to navigate. 
---
Wish we could sort Aid by medicine and food too.
---
Because it's not all about high level player and the "scaling" is a joke.
---
Just take a look at the min levels and where those really small level mobs spwan.
---
Interesting tidbit related to the op. I few days ago i was encountering an odd issue where if i crippled an enemies right arm they would *always* drop the weapon they were carrying. Like literally drop it on the ground. Then, upon death, they would drop the normal randomized weapon drop in their corpse loot. Id get two weapons per mob.
---
It wasnt some isolated thing either. This worked for hundreds of mobs of varying types. But mainly i was farming mole miners and supers. And with double weapon drops that equated to a looot of scrap.
---
It made perfect sense in a way that by crippling an arm you could make them drop their weapon. But, given they still dropped regular loot, it felt like a bug. However, it only worked for one day. The next day, i could not get the effect to work again. And i have not been able to get it to work since despite numerous perk reconfigurations in an effort to try and reproduce the characters setup from that day. I even went back to the old gun i was using, but no dice.
---
Please, play the game before discussing - my stealth commando has to switch to melee? I've already told you game force me to play team and you said that if I don't like it I can get partner for that. I think the discussion is pointless.
---
Did you not click "seek revenge"? Because if you *just* respawn, you're not flagged as hostile anymore
---
Watch it just be a skin for the chainsaw...
---
If the reward isn‚Äôt a 3 star legendary it‚Äôs definitely a waste of time
---
Nope, it runs somewhere around 100, mostly less, interriors maybe a bit more. But it should be limited to 120 through nvidia control panel.
---
They won't credit you for part of it unfortunately ;)
---
Because Bethesda doesn‚Äôt do simple and it give us a reason to get rid of Perk cards we no longer want.
---
Still happening for you?
---
Everyone downvoting me is pathetic lmao. I finished 4 weeks ago that‚Äôs a fact if it doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative then too bad
---
It's a shame really. If they had a small chance to spawn a legendary in a locked crate/safe, with the star equalling the lock level, everyone would go mad for lockpicking. But as it is its just not worth the effort
---
The survival aspects of things like eating and drinking, the effects of diseases, etc, being able to find food in trash cans.  
---
This game fits more than one genre, other survival games that have perk or advancement systems (such as games like 7 days to die) put you in a position where you have to choose to be able to do things like craft better weapons or do more damage with weapons.  
---
Even MMOs like Everquest where you grind out alternate advancement points, you only have so many, you have to choose where you place them.  Do you put them into things that let you gather more materials or make your food and drink last longer, or do you increase your damage by a %
---
And I‚Äôm not talking about at your camp, I‚Äôm talking about when you‚Äôre out and about. You should not be in the middle of a location and now be able to decide to swap over to ‚ÄúFix it good‚Äù and repair your gear to 200%, ‚ÄúScrapper‚Äù to turn the weapons into extra scrap, or lockpicking to open up that level 3 chest for a bit extra loot.
---
We should not be able to ‚Äúrespec‚Äù  our characters (in the sense of changing our cards around) in the middle of exploration.  We should not have access to every single perk.  This is not a single player game, relying on other players should be encouraged.
---
Meat week is this Thursday.
---
When you see a flashing hexagon with a punctuation mark on the map, it's a public event - you do those and get treasury notes(if you've completed Wastelanders). The other events are just yellow hexagons, like they're your daily events - you do those and can get paid in scrip for the Purveyor.
---
Yup. Tomorrow it should drop (my guess is around 11am or Noon Eastern Standard time?) And then Thursday Prime Cuts should kick off to lead into Meat week
---
I get it. I started out excited about Wastelanders and casually doing the story content.  Now we're at the end of the season, I've lost track of the story because all of my limited gaming time has been spent on doing as many challenges for score points as I can each day then logging out.  At this point I'm feeling burnt out on the game, and keep thinking about all the other games I have ready to play instead.  The season worked to get me hooked but at the cost of possibly not returning to the game for a while once it's done.  I've racked up a ton of playtime, and I've honestly enjoyed a lot of it but I'm not any further through the story and could have finished probably several single player games from my backlog with that time.
---
Because besides the changes to builds that players have spent ages cultivating and refining to overcome the games‚Äô limitations, in typical live service style Bethesda are changing another way that players have found to make their experience fun and providing its player base with yet another example of how they like to indulge in delicate mathematical complexities whilst overlooking the ongoing bugs that are staring them right in the face.
---
another goodbye post. big surprise. gotta get that karma instead of just leaving
---
Some of us still have them blueprinted.
---
I'm glad to see this getting traction.  I've been saying for a while that we should be able to drop a faction flag/radio at a workshop that causes NPCs to show up and grants you a small faction rep reward.  So much emergent gameplay happens if that were possible.
---
No it's more like when you open the map, it says its unopened.  When you fast travel over, its owned and built up and the player that owns it has been on the other end of the map since you started.
---
It's a visual glitch on the map that corrects itself once you get close enough.  It also works the other way to show you it being owned when the player who owns it has been offline for god knows how long.
---
Whats weird is that the sheepsquatches ear is taged
---
Thereis a bug right now where you can't die from rads while under the influence of pyschobuff, but when it wears off you insta die. Its makes it  easy but the stealth suit is probably a better long term solution
---
Because people don‚Äôt seem to understand the difference between ‚ÄòTest‚Äô and ‚ÄòPreview‚Äô.
---
There was a bug pre wastelanders that would cause the leaves to not show up when you crafted it.
---
Crafting it after the Wastelanders update should always show the leaves now.
---
Pacifist mode doesn't override PvP workshop mechanics.
---
Also yes if you don't respawn, I'm 100% going to fire at your corpse and break your crappy power armor.
---
Get fucked, foodbuild.
---
You can take psychobuff and you won't die from rads as long as the chem is active, the downside being you will die as soon as the effect wears off.
---
Wow, another complaint thread by the subreddit community.
---
Guess we needed another one of these.
---
No I said to play with a team to make those bullet sponges easier.  The consequences of not playing in a team is it taking longer to kill things. 
---
So your complaint about 1 specific daily op that you can't do because of range immune mobs. How many other daily ops can you do?  Because https://youtu.be/7lxESlCvPoA?t=144  They don't seem to have any problems hitting people with range weapons.
---
Same. Except I have no homies that play this game :(
---
Russell strikes me as the kind of guy who hears that you're taking Becky out for an evening date at the beach, and then when you arrive you find out that he's already there with a blanket set up for you.

and if that bugs you, just ignore it, its just noise anyway.

Well, just in a way that allows me to miss a few days a week, any week or even every week, even miss a whole week or two (because any year we aren't in lockdown I would have had two weeks holiday), but catch up by playing *more* when I *do* play.  That suits a lot of people' schedules better, and I'm able to do it in every other game I've played that has seasons in it.
---
XP farming isn't integral to Fallout 76 btw.
---
Half decent weapons that fire quickly break PA easily. Stop claiming hacks just because your armor is trash.
---
If you do not NEED the rewards to complete something important then you do not HAVE to play every day. 
---
Why does everyone feel they deserve the same amount of rewards for NOT playing daily?
---
There is always the statement that they are being punished by not playing every day. 
---
Not receiving a reward for completing an event, when you did not participate in said event is NOT a punishment. 
---
This is a reward for the people who were willing and able to invest the time to earn said reward. 
---
Additionally, at level 94 I will complete my board this week. While I am one of the people logging in every day (the benefits of unemployment!) I'm averaging about 45 minutes to an hour to complete my dailies. With a month left, and the existence of an easily exploitable repeatable you do NOT have to log in every day ( well, I should say DIDN'T, at this stage you really should if you are behind). Sure it helps, but it isnt a necessity. 
---
A lot of this argument feels like wanting the participation trophies without even participating.
---
Noon is the standard (EST)
---
If by "superpowers" you mean halfway decent weapons and armor, sorry but uh, you're trash.
---
Bloodied is harder to play than full health builds and all those cards you mentioned  can help full health builds too just not for a sustained amount of time as they won‚Äôt be CONSTANTLY at low health one shot away from dying. Also, you forgot acid as another bloodied killer. And instigating can one shot a lot of enemies too and they didn‚Äôt even touch it. Go figure. 
---
I think bloodied could have used a balance. But this isn‚Äôt balance. Taking away 50-60% of the damage you do doesn‚Äôt balance anything. I‚Äôll give you an example of balance. Make bloodied bonus for playing at low health 50% instead of 100%. But leave the perk card bonuses alone. This nerfs bloodied but keeps all other builds including junkies intact. It‚Äôs the same bonus as furious, junkies and beserker at that point and they can all still add to that damage the way they do now with perk cards. 
---
Doing what I suggested above by making the game comprehensively harder by adding mechanics and tougher more challenging enemies. That creates balance because then it can negate the damage bloodied does. Other MMOs do exactly that.
---
If the disregard the environment differences, you basically described Red Dead Online.
---
I 100% lurk when I see a player near a workshop so I can tap said workshop and gank the player for their junk. 
---
I miss the good ol days of slap damage and survival mode. y'all foodies don't know how good y'all have it now.
---
You know you can stop playing the game without telling anyone, nobody cares if you stop playing, plus if you consider the game your job thats your issue not the games.
---
Why don‚Äôt they just add pets, I want to run across the map with my pet dog killing ghouls and sorchbeasts.
---
its the damage calculation change that people are most upset about.
---
the level scaling for one wasteland is seeming broken for high levels now, only spawning lvl 25s. so judgement is way premature.
---
On paper it sounds like a good idea. I've recently started 2 new characters to hold my weapons for scrip and getting them to lvl 50 made me remember how unbalanced the game can be. Last night my little level 4 was going through Grafton and there was a lvl 48 ghoul that popped up out of nowhere, like...what are you doing here, get lost lol I'm looking forward to the changes.
---
If my non legendary rifleman build becomes worthless I‚Äôll quit the game. Casuals shouldn‚Äôt be punished for being casual
---
In juicehead's video about pts you can see a guy using the plasma one during the daily ops segment if you want to see more
---
When you don't use mods you probably have changed your fallout76.ini and changed it to "read only"?
---
Or just try renaming/deleting your fallout76.ini
---
i think the game performs insanely well since I've been on since beta on PS4. Keep smokin' that "pC iZ bEtTeR mAsTeR cRaCK" while pretending to be offering advice while being passive aggressive.
---
Yeah I really liked the campaign, not so much the online
---
I miss survival mode.
---
It's the internet, and we've got a lot of keyboard warriors.
---
No kidding, right...I think I'd rather shove toothpicks up my own dick rather than play this silly game of hoops anymore. Has to be the most pointless grind I've ever played in a game.
---
Do brahmin bros dissapear if i leave the server?
---
Okay that's fine then. I just know that over 140 the engine caps your characters acceleration which can make moving in PA impossible because you can't start moving.
---
If you're on PC I'm 100% down with showing you my weapons, armor, and DPS.
---
Seek revenge?  I did not get close enough to see if he had options on him other than "invite to trade".  I was dead again too quickly.
---
I almost blame people like A/T, Capt Noob and TYR for the nerf by competing for the best time killing the SBQ.  22 seconds is crazy fast for something it takes 10 other player to beat in 15-20 minutes.  This nerf keeps them relevant since they will have to test new ways to beat the SBQ and other end game creatures.
---
The problem with all this grinding in the game punishes those who like to play alts. I have 3 characters I currently play, rolled the other 2 and they have their own builds already but they are sitting as mules as I won't be able to do faction dailies for all 5 characters. Also there I am losing much by playing those 3 instead of only one because I should be focusing on reaching lvl 300 to open the legendary slots for all characters. Besides that there should be a legendary coin pool between all characters so you need to get the legendary perk cards leveled only once per account.
---
Unless it's a random spawn then no they shouldn't do.
---
When you die, you have the option to either respawn (as non hostile), seek revenge, or ignore (which is a useless soft block.)
---
Ah, but now when a skin is applied, they no longer are hidden.
---
So it seems the bug has swung the other way now.
---
TP to Solomons Pond, turn around and run SW down the hill to the second, smaller pond. The Behemoth will be kneeling in the water. There is another one at the Abandoned Bog Town workshop in Cranberry Bog.
---
AFAIK, those are the only two Behemoth spawns. They can be either L65 or 95 if your level is high enough.
---
Ngl I break every power armor set I can when I see a dead foodbuild. Then not only has your shit been taken, I get to put you at a deficit. Like if they Are wearing excavator and I break their suit they likely won't be able to fast travel, which is fuckin hilarious
---
I love line in the sand but holy shit the lag after! So many piles of meat and goo
---
theres a lot of em because wellll there is lot of complaints to be made. The game is not great by a long shot. Maybe if Bethesda would listen to the community like they claim they do we would have less complaints. I do give Bethesda praise when they do good things but lately they seem to be doing the opposite.  I am not a grinder by any means. Im not even halfway through the legendary run. But it is still incredibly boring and you still forced to grind out things. I don't know what to do in game to have fun. Can you list off things to do?
---
Physicist? Only reason you need a physicist is to find out who the fuck gave them the power to tunnel through solid concrete like its dirt, and teleport six stories up.
---
Best of luck wandering the wasteland fellow dweller. Ad Victoriam
---
Was to be exspected - as fun as it was, Line in teh sand will be less often played as a result again :-/
---
ü§£ü§£
---
Thank you for your positive contributions the community! The game isn‚Äôt perfect and Bethesda has made some questionable decisions with it, but for the people looking to actually enjoy something and have fun with it, it is a great experience.
---
I came across a gulper that behaved like a sentry bot. It did the overheating thing and when it died it exploded. 
---
I think there's a bug going around!
---
Damn him to hellü§£ü§£üòÇ
---
Just to clear things up. Enemies aren‚Äôt full scaling like was suggested by Bethesda. Multiple enemies in currently low lvl zones are still going to be way to weak for us 50+ to get good rewards from or have any sorts of challenge anywhere North or West for the most part. So it‚Äôs not going to be the ‚Äúwasteland with friends of all lvls‚Äù mechanic we were hoping for.
---
On top of that, Bethesda just dropped a major change out of nowhere by making all in-game %+ stats additive instead of multiplicative, which wasn‚Äôt bad in and of itself, but they made zero changes to the current % bonuses before unveiling this in the PTS, so now all the cool new updates are overshadowed by the fact Bloodied builds dmg is half what it was Junkie‚Äôs and berserkers who were already feeling like 2nd best are now no better than a farm build, and all the generic builds are on equal footing to players who have spent 100+ lvls trying to perfect their character based on a specific armor or weapon type. The current update wasn‚Äôt just a nerf, it was a complete overhaul of many builds after countless players put in months of work to earn the gear for what is currently going to be a useless class. 
---
So long story short, it‚Äôs not we‚Äôre upset with the changes themselves. We‚Äôre upset Bethesda put in so little work beforehand to make the changes meet was was clearly being asked for. It doesn‚Äôt take a PTS to know this update in its current state is game ruining for a lot of ppl.
---
How is server hopping an exploit, given that it is a feature?
---
The biggest problem with the game is people who keep trying to find work arounds to problems that shouldn't be in the game. If y'all took all that energy from making the game work into getting on Bethesdas ass about fixing it the game would be much better off.
---
I've found that Gutsy a couple of times, and I had to sneak up on it to take it out with melee.
---
This, I work 40 hours a week as well, cook, shop and help take care of my kids and I have had no problem keeping up, people just like to cry, if they want the awards that bad they would quit crying on reddit and play the game.
---
Should move to a build system. Build a warrior/heavy gunner.  Get to level 50- start over at level 1 with warrior/heavy gunner + something new. Thief/ sniper / archer.  Get to level 50 with that and add a new one. Make special points movable not perk cards linked to each build. So during that 50 level climb you are given and select the cards that are either neutral or build based. Do a complex quest to get the Chance to multilevel each time. (Copyright medieva mud 1985) :p
---
wow now that is strange
---
You can do all of that. The math supports it. You simply have to make the relevant choices. 
---
And unless your main is at level 300+, XP ‚Äòfarming‚Äô is integral to this game, *if* you want to acquire as much as possible. Even beyond, technically, based on the current Legendary Perk/Perk Coin system being tested.
---
You just gave me an idea for a Lerooooy Jeeeeenkins!
---
Kill first ask question second :)
---
Just a heads up, support for this game is led by the same group of people as Elder Scrolls Online.
---
The reason this is important? The ESO team regularly allows players to purchase items (housing, event, etc) from the cash shop that were rotated out months ago.
---
They simply message support, have the available crowns (thinks ATOMS) on their character and support activates the pack or item remotely while removing the premium currency the item cost.
---
It‚Äôs worth it to see if they can do the same here.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the QOL fixes. There‚Äôs quite a list of what‚Äôs needed there.
---
If Bethesda can automatically shove goddamn missiles in my inventory, they sure as hell can make all events like that.
---
What bug is that you speak ofü§î
---
I would love additional sort options for this.  I agree it‚Äôs a cluster fuck and could be updated.  I recently have been adjusting my perks around weight and sorting my food or chems would be helpful.
---
Also a separate tab for magazines and bobble heads or Filters would also be nice as a QoL improvement.
---
Also a menu feature to see all completed quests instead of loading them each time, similar to challenges
---
There was *one* meaningful consequence. A legendary Free Radicals mask. But noooooo, enough people whinged and they bitched, and got it removed. Bethesda‚Äôs bullshit excuse of ‚Äúit was unintentional‚Äù is a cover up.
---
That hilarious
---
What makes you think that that is the case? FO76 is a GaaS, just like ESO. I won‚Äôt lie and say that the implementation has always been perfect (or even good for that matter) but this is no different than any other game that operates this way. The finances required to make something like FO76 viable for a company all but necessitate microtransactions between larger-scale expansions, which I will remind you come free with FO76, unlike most similar games.
---
Again, I‚Äôm in no way defending every decision that they have made here, but there is no indication that Bethesda will somehow be adding paywalls to all of there future games.
---
I'm almost 30 and am at 90 while working 60 hours a week, you can do it if you keep at it just fine
---
Shit i run 1h pa mellee and non-optimized gunslinger vats. Am i boinked, boys?
---
Sorry but I don‚Äôt follow, you don‚Äôt need thousands of levels to get all the cards on each of your builds, you only one character at level 300. The ranks 2-4 provide much less to the player the the first rank, already unlocked.
---
This got me laughing, thank youüòÅ
---
It can also happen sometimes if the server is over taxed.  I personally like it since if you get a legendary or two in there, once one blows up it creates a chain reaction of exp!
---
They need to make it take up a bit more of the screen first.
---
That 'relevant choice' though is: change your play style and grind.  It's not a *good* choice.
---
And no, I'm not 300 and I don't need to farm xp to acquire as much as possible.  As much *what* exactly?  I'm not even 300 and I haven't needed anything for many, many levels now.  Everything that's left for me to get is cosmetic or takes a massive RNG grind.
---
Yeah. Seems like they've managed to actually design a system where team work is needed. Sadly it also means PA is the must which means you have to find a way to organize stash somehow to save all weapons you otherwise have on yourself if you use legendary armor with weapon weight reduction (I use 4 pieces, and after switching even to Excavator PA with both calibrated shocks and motion-assist servos I'm still overencumbured). First thing is fine, second - not really.
---
FO76 trying to convince me it needs to be the only game I play ‚Äúto get all the things!‚Äù only caused me to fall off the game and it makes me sad cuz I otherwise enjoy just running around joining public teams :c
---
This.  I actually created a character after I got the free raider and settler costume recipe, and I could make both on the new toon
---
Have the courier from Skyrim show up at your CAMP. "I have something for you. Your eyes only."
---
Hmm, I'm gonna have to investigate that ... I thought it was somehow normal, as it usually happens indoors and in tight spaces ... plus I expected something like that being likely and normal in a game as "it just works" as FO76 :) And it happens to both me and my gf - and the headlamp trick also works for both of us... Altough we have gpu's that are pretty much on par - 1070 vs 1660Ti
---
Hmmm, the only one I saw was "respawn".  May be glitchy because Bethesda?
---
This post would probably make a lot more sense if you didnt assume we all know how the perk coin system works. You have supplied 0 hard numbers and 0 explanation of any the mechanics.
---
Gonna have to re-watch again and see it now.
---
Who won, and what did they win?
---
Ok! Thanks for the information!
---
Is the converter really tedious or is it me?  I can pull materials from my camp at another camp to repair a weapon, but I have to know how much ammo type I have for each ammo before I dip into the converter, then spam B (Xbox) to get out.
---
Its not for all rewards, but the Ammo Converter and Lunchboxes are definately on PTS for Buillon atm, some other items may pop in the Atom Shop I guess (Skins etc).
---
I'm in vacation for two weeks with no access to the game, was starting the third part of the board, i think i'm not gonna make it and i hate this.
---
Only if I can get a three star legendary fishing pole. Explosive bait, ffr (faster fishing rate) 90% father casting.....
---
Lol.
---
Edit: On the off chance that this is a sincere question and not sarcasm, because server hopping is a player abusing a game mechanic (server log in/out) for unintended purposes (such as spawning more enemies or loot) to circumvent (admittedly poor) game limitations (resource/enemy scarcity).  
---
It's bad design that it's the only way certain activities, like farming cork or faction reputation are even moderately tolerable.  Can you imagine doing those things WITHOUT server hopping?  
---
It's bad on the devs for turning a blind eye to it for so long that players depend on it like a feature.  The rage quitting would be unprecedented if they took it away now.
---
Players aren't bad for doing it, but it can't be good for server stability.  It is a giant blinking sign post for the game's flawed design and development team's lack of skill.
---
I literally did that yesterday, that doesnt work. The thing gave me 0 loot.
---
The flipside of this, if you're stuck on the map when you're out of PA, deploy your PA to unstick yourself.
---
The purpose is to add another ammo type to shotgun builds and give them some diversity instead of just being four ballistic shotguns and the gauss.
---
I‚Äôm failing to see why it wouldn‚Äôt affect your calculations, however. In fact, why are you including commando, rifleman and shotgunner at the same time in your calculations? That doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
---
If its trade able I can probably hook you up with some stuff from the event, just drop your GT
---
how long has it been around?
---
Stay out, Vault-Tec engineer at work.
---
As a newer player, only started a few months ago before the legendary run began, I was just trying to play casually and got to this same point of burnout from a daily "requirement" to keep up once the legendary run started. I didn't even finish the legendary run. I decided to finish the main story rather than explore the game any further and deleted the game from my console. I don't want to feel like I have to sign in daily to keep up, it's stressful to feel that control of my life. Going out of my way to finish dailies is exhausting in games and is one aspect of current gaming trends that's preventing me from trying a lot of games that look like they would be fun otherwise.
---
One of my characters has had the same location since beta....
---
That sounds more like a hardware issue than a Fallout 76 issue itself.
---
It would be kinda cool if there‚Äôs a small faction war mechanic where the different groups are fighting one another on each server. Idk why but my favorite part of Skyrim was the civil war fights even though the storytelling was meh. Would love it if we saw large skirmishes between the factions and player could choose to help either side. Pve‚Äôers could have fun fighting larger groups and since it‚Äôs an event a pvp‚Äôer may get some fun out of it without costing lower tier builds junk or caps at their expense?
---
For Supers (Gunpowder):
---
Grafton Steel Yard \[TV\]
---
Huntersville &gt; West Tec &gt; N.I.R.A (mega antenna) loop \[SD\]
---
Abandoned Bog Town \[CB\]
---
New Gadd has a bunch of low level Supers \[Forest\]
---
For Acid:
---
The Flooded Train Yard \[CB\] has a static spawn of 5-6 Snallys
---
The Hemlock Holes \[TV\] workshop has 2-3 acid pools you can just visit and loot or cap the workshop and farm with extractors
---
Tangara Town \[Mire\] is full of crickets
---
The pylon near ABT \[CB\] has an acid pool and occasionally a pair of Snallys.
---
Frequently the track shack between Watoga Railstation and Flooded Train Yard \[both CB\] will have a pack of Glowing Crickets.
---
To be optimally efficient, equip 2/2 Ammosmith and 3/3 Super Duper perks before bulk ammo crafting sessions.
---
Well, you have all mines because I always need a new one to enter to their house.
---
You must deal at least a small amount of damage. :(
---
CPG Combat, I‚Äôll DM you whenever i can get on, might be a week or 2 lol
---
I can confirm this is true, if you just let people take whatever i never have trouble collecting materials from my workshops nor do i hardly ever get attacked.
---
Maybe?
---
Day 0.
---
Just gonna drop this here. 
---
Containers you can put in your camp, why not use them for what they are? Follow me on this.... Ammo Box - allow us to put them in our camps and put all our ammo in them to store it, and wait... allow us to attach the related perk cards to it that will than effect the container(s) and once it's assigned to the container it passively effects the character as well.
---
EX: Ammo Box - Attach Bandoleer or Batteries Perk card to the item (effect all ammo type containers) Which than increase how much we can store, and how much we can carry. Same thing can go for the rest of the Storage type items in camps. Nuka Machines, Lockers, etc... Allow us to attach the respective perk cards that than gives us more storage both in camp and on character. Armor lockers, Normal Lockers, and the brand new ICE BOX. Terminals / Safes = Perspective perks. Planters = Green Thumb, Crafting Benches = Armorer, Scrapper, Super Duper, etc..., Scrap box = Junk Reduction, than give everyone the scrap box. Med Kits, you get where I am going with this.
---
Doing this will make plans more useful not just cosmetically, atomic shop items more useful as well. We know you like that idea.... Increase our camp budgets to reflect these items more allowing us to build more diversely with actual decorations that are truly functional. My fridge should be an actual fridge to put my food / drinks in, ammo box for ammo, etc....
---
This doesn't mean use the Atomic shop to start selling these items, I see you thinking....
---
Hold on, I am not done yet. Lets talk about the "Stash" instead of just having a 800 Stash which is basically useless after a few trips to collect junk, or fill with items like clothes etc... Take that "Stash" split it into 2 separate containers and wait for it, make 1 shared between characters along with the "Scrap box". If I find a nice weapon for another toon, I should be able to drop it in my new "Shared Stash" and my other toon(s) have access to it without trading, another account etc...
---
OK, I see your concern, but if we do this than people can put "Secret Service Armor / Weapons" in this stash and share them, hold up there champ. I didn't say take away the stash box and just make it shared, non transferable items don't go in this shared box, but the normal stash we already have that is no shared. Let's not confuse the 2.
---
Display Cases = Exactly what they are that's it. Display Cases no changes needed other than some nicer ones would be nice.
---
Vending Machines / Display cases should have their own storage capacities they should not be stuck in your stash. Just like other containers they should be their own separate things.
---
I am sure this can be altered / expanded on but I think this idea is a solid foothold in a better direction as it will address several concerns in an organized manner.
---
Also for the love of all let us drop keys, and give us a key ring.
---
I've tested this recently on a private server and it didn't work for me. Damage numbers appeared when I shot her multiple times before the pylons were taken. I was deliberately not on a team and remained on the roof until she was killed by the other players. I did not receive any loot from her body. Granted, I've only tested it once but it didn't work.
---
Some rare cases its health will go down as well, my troubleshooters Ultracite gatling laser will very slowly being its health down sometimes but doesn't show a damage number even though it goes down a few ticks.
---
This is what I do now. With all the duped cheese guns out there, she can be demolished in less than a second. I perk my character, load the card, and run the pylons. As soon   as I have the last pylon, I open fire on her and die. Then do it all again and take quantums and stim.
---
Only if you only want rank 1 cards, EACH OF YOUR CHARACTERS HAVE TO GET INTO the THOUSANDS TO GET MULTI STARED LEGENDARY PERKS!
---
Elder Scrolls Online another Zenimax owned mmo has the champion point system where after level 50 you earn champion points to put towards perks. These are universal across all of your characters and only costs gold [caps] to reset!
---
22 days is my guess. At the earliest.
---
I feel the same way. When Starfield or ES6 releases I am fully expecting them to pull some mega bullshit to milk players even more. Their marketing team is trying everything to see what the community will flip out about. Battle royale season/battle pass for a single player game with 40$ DLC, MTX player houses, horse armour, and maybe even time savers like in Ubisoft games. It will also be a time for bethesda to try an monotize mods further. Remember when Interplay made vault boy as a way to mock american consumerism. (I'm not sure if its consumerism exactly please correct me if im wrong)
---
:-( That had seemed to work out for me a couple of times, but maybe there were other factors involved or I managed to hit the Impostor when it wasn't shielded after all, despite having no idea where it was during those fights.
---
Fallout 4. The creation club. Skyrim. The creation club. Rather than release further DLC at a reasonable price to items added ratio then opt to sell inflated cosmetics or minimal content. They sell armours and individual weapons at prices that entire DLC were worth previously.
---
This trend was only further pushed by 76. Many assets directly ripped from 4 and even content that was quite clearly cut from the base game to be resold in the atom store. The caravanner is a great example item; it's directly added in wastelanders and is seen on the  NPC's, rather than being something to be earnt in game it is sold at an extortionate rate on the atom store.
---
They want the equivalent of ¬£4.00 for basic colour fills for your power armour. Fallout 4, being the same price as wastelanders 76 at release, has far more content. Fallout 4 gave you power armour skins by default as part of the content offered by the game. You had military, winter, vault, and an assortment of other interesting skin colours.
---
In 76 you get 2 nuka skins for 2 power armours and a handful of BOS t60 skins ripped from 4 locked behind an insane grind, with everything else being locked behind the atom store.
---
The trend is not leaning in the favour of the consumer.
---
there is no "new" meta. its the same, just will less gap to the next most viable stuff.
---
I have a spare plan if you would like it :) IGN Nukathulhu
---
He thinks OP exploited the raider faction rep glitch.
---
It‚Äôs a strange time to be a Fallout fan. In 76, we have one of the best maps ever made. We have some truly interesting story elements. We have some new factions waiting for deeper exploration. We also have no sign of a return to a proper single player entry in the series, so our choice is replay older Fallouts yet again or soldier on with 76. So we hang in there with 76 with hopes of where this game can go, and the crushing reality on how unambitious Bethesda chooses to make this. It‚Äôs sort of like watching Michael Scott in his improv class, entertaining but tediously predictable.
---
I use a junkies build my pa character uses a furious gauss shotty and super sledge with appropriate perks.
---
How bad will this hit me?
---
Ohhh ok right thanks for clearing that up. I liked the sound of the whole map being relevant again for players 50+, but it doesn't sound like that is what is happening.
---
So is bloodied now terrible? Do I have to start farming ammo like a madman to sustain my low-tier bloodied damage?
---
Good to know, thank you.  They look to be based on ancient Chinese pole weapons, which is logical given the US/China conflict prior to bombs.
---
It used to happen to me in PA - if I looked low down and my FPS went up to like 150+ I just couldn't move. Then if I turned around and looked into a busy scene I could move again.
---
Then going into internal cells I just couldn't move at all due to FPS being a lot higher.
---
It can happen out of PA too but you need even higher FPS because you move faster normally.
---
For what it's worth I use RTSS to cap my FPS to 142 and it's not a problem.
---
I hardly could not wait to go back to the Forest region exploring, read max lvl is 25 , i see no point in "scaling" if thats it.
---
Was expecting like in Eso
---
Yeah that range needs to be increased a ton more than what it is now. I feel like right now you need to be roughly 50 feet or less.
---
To be fair, they spent time to get the gear to be the way they are
---
If the gap is too small to justify not using Vampire, there will be a new meta.
---
It only works when you‚Äôre on a team. It‚Äôs been that way since the game launched. Since you seldom dig up treasure with a teammate standing next to you it would be easy to miss.
---
It‚Äôs the same thing with radiation rumble because you miss several legendaries while grabbing ore.
---
Others have suggested that the game should treat every participant who has the event quest up as having hit every (at least legendary) enemy within the local space sufficiently to get credit for the kill. I, personally, like this idea but just playing devils advocate, the drawback would be freeloading behavior. I bet you‚Äôd see that once in a while but 90+% of people would still take the events seriously in order to win. In fact, without the pressure of having to tag every enemy for xp and loot, I bet the community could start taking on more complex enemies as people become more willing to take on non-combat roles on the fly.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs new content in the way you‚Äôre describing. They‚Äôre looking for big ideas they can sell and have seemed pretty willing to make those changes if they sell well and are built simply. Daily ops sounds extremely straight forward and is just reusing existing assets mostly but is a big part of their next update.
---
Faction wars would be an easy seller as it‚Äôs mostly be existing assets but in order to create a unique game made, and would bring back a lot of people that felt the environment was too static. If there was enough public attention to an idea like this like there is for the BoS or more endgame content BGS would be all over it.
---
This is why I encase my Brahmin in a shack. So no one can kill him without picking a door and becoming Wanted, warranting a reason for me to kick their teeth in.
---
Radiation Rumble could easily be fixed by reducing the numbers and levels of ghouls and the health of the scavengers.
---
That's because you and others are treating it like a job.
---
I'm having so much enjoyment, wanna know the secret? I don't care about challenges or the Legendary run, I do what I want when I want.
---
I still do challenges and end-game content but I do it on my terms whenever I feel like it.
---
once I found a lot of radroaches
---
I pick up a m79 grenade launchef off a scorched. Keep 50 rounds on me. The launcher is quick and tags a bunch of them everytime. Around 2k xp on a full health build.
---
Yup. Got me yesterday. Said pay 25 caps to claim unowned workshop. Went to claim and it tells me someone else already claimed it and the turrets lit me up lol.
---
I‚Äôm lvl 92 and I just do the dailies for the most part. Every now and then I‚Äôll do a scorchbeast Queen or a few quests. The rest of the time I just build and play nw. The worst part about score for me is that the exp earned that transfers to adventure in nw doesn‚Äôt count. It‚Äôs not a huge amount but over a few weeks at two hours a day it would help.
---
While I agree with the sentiment OP I don't agree with your numbers. I would be able to max out my legendary cards on login the first day this went live.   
---
I believe they intend this system of progression to be more like ESOs veteran level system, so that people will always have a leveling carrot to chase after. Your suggestion would break that intention as well.
---
Hazmat suit or the stealth suit if you have it. Radshield helps as even with the suit and I'm collecting ore for the duration of the event you can soak up rads quite quickly if you have to take on the glowing ghouls if the place is getting overrun or they are in the way.
---
Who would've thought-- it's not your fault that people are dicks. Crazy, blaming the victim almost always works.
---
I encountered a cloaking colonel gutsy in cranberry bog about 7- 8 months ago so unless the files have been in the game for a v long time it's doubtful it's that.
---
It's more likely a glitch mob where the attributes from another enemy entirely got put in by mistake, happens all the time.
---
I've encountered rats with assaultron beam, rats that explode, a scorch that fired acid/poison shot rounds and the aforementioned  cloaking gutsy
---
40 claim tokens.  No magic shotgun either ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Lag and framerate are not the same thing
---
the gap from bloodied to everything else is still significant. 
---
vamps is about attack speed anyway. thats all that matters.
---
That must be what Beth is using to calculate damage
---
If you lick them you catch pink eye
---
Dont tell me how to play my broken game
---
They make an entire thread about it.
---
Hey, sounds like a more systematic test than I could accomplish (I find the Encryptid fight an overwhelming, chaotic mess, and not in a good sense). Crap, there goes that theory, then. :-(
---
They're probably all trying but they can't find the last molerat that's hidden under the map to clear the zone.
---
You never responded to my dm about those trade offers ;)
---
It‚Äôs not terrible, but a Bethesda dev compared it to a player with a mutant weapon(standard build prefix). At 5% hp a bloodied would only do 70% more dmg. It basically means we can 2-shot anything that normally takes 3 hits, but like always our chance at dying is still extremely high comparatively. AND some enemies are tankier now.
---
They‚Äôre still tweaking it as Bethesda literally just made the switch from multiplication to addition with no other changes, but atm one less punch isn‚Äôt worth getting brutalized everytime. Most the devs are bloodieds though! So I really hope they realize how bad an idea this was. At the least if they‚Äôre going to drop our dmg this much then our hp needs to only needs to be like 25-50% to get those benefits
---
it is. it signalizes that you have the entire set equipped for the bonus, it turns white then.
---
and you dont have to read the thread.
---
A bloodied build with a Vampire Fixer will deal 62 damage less per bullet than the same build with a Bloodied Fixer. That's not very significant anymore IMHO.
---
It sounds like it's something spot on for him and for you. Thank you for sharing with us all and I am sorry for your loss. Keeping his memory alive in your own way with your own shared memories is just.... pretty neat, honestly. I hope you got/are getting enjoyment out of doing it for him and sharing it with us. Keep us posted on updates to it!
---
Cool, thanks man.
---
It‚Äôs alright, you put in more effort than a lot of players probably. Currently I‚Äôm rank 90/100 and plan on finishing, though from what I have read or seen some season 1 rewards from the legendary run will be added to the game for gold buillion in the next handful of patches along with season 2
---
All I want are logic gates. 
---
I‚Äôve tried my best to create one out of the tools available but I keep hitting obstacles. 
---
This is absolutely incredible, and makes me feel a little guilty for giving up on something as simple as a two-way switch. 
---
I‚Äôve drawn the diagrams countless times, but I can‚Äôt work it out. Is there a way to create an and/or gate with the existing system?
---
Nevermind those. I wanna know how tough a mirelurk king is gonna be.
---
I think event boss kills should count both for loot and xp, and if it‚Äôs a legendary then it should also count for daily/weekly quests. You‚Äôre doing your part to finish the event which means you can‚Äôt tag everything, so you should also get the same loot/xp everyone else does.
---
Bethesda only needs to do one thing to make the pistols playable again. Duals. A pistol in each hand - and they will quite compete with carbines, less damage, but higher rate of fire, more ammunition (18x2), but longer reloading time.
---
I don't understand why this still hasn't been done
---
I need that sweet sweet contemporary building bundle or w.e it was called that allowed you to build actual good looking houses. Ofc i missed that oneüôÑ
---
Seriously! They should have it coded like they did with Faschnact, where all participants get a legendary drop, especially since half the time, when acting as conduit you are lucky enough to get a shot in or 2, the damn carcass disappears into the ground or flies off into oblivion. I spent 30 minutes after the last event with my camera out trying to find the stupid thing and still never did. The event is one of the hardest to complete anyway, especially with players doing it for the first time and not knowing about the pylon requirements to begin with, so it just seems like they could do us a solid on the rewards chances. It was almost impossible to fail the parade unless you had a jerk player sabotaging things, so it was a guaranteed reward and made it less necessary for everyone to bum rush the sloth at the end. Why can't it be like that with Encryptid? Especially since the ones tanking pylons are burning through their resources like mad for the good of the group and event.
---
Nicely done, this is awesome!
---
You mentioned wanting to build a multiplication calculator for a little while - did you go searching for a method or did the quarter square just come out of nowhere one day?
---
You'll notice the health will go right back up after a bit though, noticed the same with my bloodied fixer
---
If possible, id recommend switching to a minigun. It is ironically less of an ammo hog than a 50 cal.  And Primus Supers frequently drop 5mil in stacks of 100. I recommend carrying a laser gat as well. They are inherently more accurate than Minis and are a good way to burn fusion cores that you come across. They make good plinker guns for lesser enemies. I personally dislike plasma gats as their recoil even with stabilized makes them annoying to use.
---
The choice is to spend about 15-20 minutes clearing out the dailies and then go on with whatever you want to do. What I described isn‚Äôt a grind, and even if you think it is, it‚Äôs a very short and easy one. 
---
And I explained the reasoning behind the Xp gain drive; Legendary Perks. That‚Äôs not cosmetic or aesthetic or RNG.
---
This is a bug when you use the glitches ammo factory in your camp. ‚ÄúBusted‚Äù
---
*Since you seldom dig up treasure ever. Man I tried digging up a bunch of maps, but they just never feel worth the effort. They should have updated the loot pool to include legendary versions of the new craftable weapons or something.
---
The only good use I have ever found for a treasure map was in Skyrim when they could be used to anchor your corpses for the Death Thrall spell so they wouldn't despawn over time. Then you could keep a couple extra perma-corpses around to play with as a necromancer.
---
Bear Arms, and every weapon you get the plans for bullions.
---
Any gold bullion weapon (gauss weapons, plasma caster). Not sure about the bear arm.
---
Pipe revolvers can benefit from both rifleman and gunslinger perks if a stock is attached to them. That's the mentality I used for the calc.
---
If rifleman does +10% per star (30% per maxed card and +90% for all 3 maxed cards) and shotgunner perks do the exact same, there is no point in swapping it over because it would literally make no difference. It would then just be classed as a shotgun and benefit from skeet shooter (which wouldnt do much for the beam splitter cause it's already accurate) and enforcer (tormentor does the same but without stagger and a higher chance of crippling) The only thing that would make a difference is if the beam splitter reduced range and increased damage.
---
One thing Bethesda could do is make plasma shotguns and laser shotguns which would be pretty cool (individual weapons, not modes rifles)
---
Also the sheep staff, crook, and club
---
I'm just mad that some weapons won't display centered on the pegboards. (Looking at you, All Rise!)
---
I made a post about it here:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i93c3m/does_anyone_have_problems_with_their_gauss/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Also sheepsquatch weapons.
---
Name checks out
---
Pump action shotgun, junkies if he's an addict
---
Heavy weapons like the harpoon launcher use a different display. It under display just at the bottom of the list. And try different size pegboards for the assultron head
---
Other than rare drops from brotherhood events, treasure maps are the only place to find T60 plans. But yes, the average rewards are uninspiring at best.
---
Since vats cost reduced is pretty useless on a heavy gun, I would go with the TS 25
---
Yes sir they definitely stack Sentinel + zealots would be very strong against the queen üëç
---
Yeah that's also a major issue. My cryolators go way above the peg board
---
Basically everything in this crappy game is incredibly laggy. Service stability has gone downhill severely...
---
I mean, they do gain Brahmin meat, along with the feeling of ‚Äòaccomplishment‚Äô. 
---
It‚Äôs a jerk move, but some people are jerks. Don‚Äôt give them the satisfaction of seeing you get upset about it, though.
---
I‚Äôm definitely going to try and get a junkie gun eventually. Just gotta find one once I hit a high level
---
So every wastelanders  weapon basically. Was hoping buying the plasma gatling plan from the enclave would make legendaries of it drop
---
Still think Excavator should have bright by default and light up both the shoulder lamps.
---
You can learn the muzzle brake plan.  I have it unlocked.  You just cant do anything with it.  Why it's there, no one knows, but that's how it is.
---
You can display heavies on the normal peg board. All of my other heavies (flamers, cryolators, Gatling plasmas etc) all display on them perfectly fine
---
My game crashed 4 times in 30 minutes yesterday. Makes me not want to play at all.
---
Reducing the ghoul waves is probably a good first step. Except it's kinda nice to have an event where those enemy waves are actually hard. So I think it's better to reduce the XP from killing those ghouls to what the robots in the silos give (specifically to discourage farming). Otherwise you'd have to reduce the waves to the point were Radiation Rumble feels like Tea Time But With Ghouls, or failing that it will likely remain more lucrative to farm ghouls for XP than to actually do the event the way it is intended.
---
is that auto or semi?
---
I also think it‚Äôs horribly optimised, so if they add too much at any one time, it‚Äôll literally freeze up and stop working.
---
Wow!  I've got a whole assortment (because I can't stand to get rid of them since for the whole first year I only got one!) but I tend to run around with furious or instigating and then my exterminator when I'm taking on the mirelurk queen.
---
You on PS4? Lol
---
I know... I'm torn tbh. There is the completionist in me that wants to see it done, and then there is number of craptastic rewards that I would need to spend Atoms on to get to the end. Will have to dig deeper into the ROI for rewards vs. Atom cost and balance out the number of Atoms I'd get by unlocking levels along the way. Appreciate the advice!
---
auto
---
I didn't claim anything. I'm trying to understand how set of X-01 power armor at 200% durability can be destroyed in 10 seconds while dead, when 10 SBQ battles can't dent even one piece.
---
They do for many items. 
---
If it‚Äôs a ‚Äòmust have‚Äô for me, I‚Äôll get it when it first appears. If it‚Äôs a ‚Äònice to have‚Äô, I‚Äôll wait for a discount. Like the Clean Fridge. It was worth waiting for the discount in my opinion.
---
It‚Äôs pretty sometimes how the unnamed NPCs are randomly generated as humans or ghouls, cuz it results in shit like this or like random Ghoul settlers living in Foundation (which is funny bc according to a holotape and I think some dialogue Penelope Hornwright is supposed to be the first Ghoul to join Foundation)
---
I probably misunderstood, I took it as NPCs that kind of populate the place after players take it for the faction.
---
I would assume Tuesday, September 8.
---
Can‚Äôt wait. Truly think I‚Äôm going to take a vacation day tomorrow just to play it. Ready for it to go live
---
Well it's a good thing that I run heavys and have all the same weapons in bloodied, junkies, vamps, and even mutants for something such as this haha. I run vamps 90% of the time anyway
---
But yeah I do see your point, with how dmg is now calculated things are gunnu be shook up a bit
---
Is there a safe way to keep pets indoors? I'm pretty sure a cat (or anything else for that matter) would be killed and eaten within minutes at my CAMP, since grafton monster and snallygasters spawn there.
---
Just, why?...
---
I also tried the small pegboard for the assualtron head, still doesn't show up
---
Have you done all those events on pts?
---
Funny you should say that, I've heard so many brazen apologists for this dreadful system that I tried to rush through today's dailies as quick as I possibly could.  It took me 30 minutes, and I didn't do the NW one, and apart from the NW one today's dailies are I think you'll agree among the easier ones.  And on top of that today I was lucky enough not to have to switch characters or grind xp because I happened to quit the game yesterday when I was close to leveling (which is another change in playstyle encouraged by these challenges, I might add)
---
So, in short, I call shenanigans.  I reckon it would take 45 minutes a day *on average* to do all challenges.  I do it anyway because thanks to covid I have time to do that and still play the parts I actually enjoy.
---
Secondly, The perk trade-in system, which isn't in the game yet, is hot garbage too.
---
Edit: Oh and thirdly, I can't believe I missed this, but NO: the relevant choice is NOT "spend 15-20 minutes to do the dailies".  We're talking about my suggestion here: if I was missing a few days a week, I wouldnt be at 88, Id be at 60, or maybe 70 at the maximum.  And with 15 days away (including travel time) on holiday, I'd have 7 days left to make the last 30-40 levels.  So... no.
---
Makes me wish the dupers were printing VE25 Fixers by the thousands instead of the B2525s we all have now. Luckily I had also grabbed a QE25 which is the only other effect untouched by the nerf. I wish there were a few other effects that added utility instead of just damage increase (and no I don't count medics since I am horrible about using crits).
---
I wish I were on the pts. This system is just too grindy. I get the therm legendary or some kind of exclusivity,but we're really talking lvl 1000 for 3 maxed cards. This way beyond what the majority of players reach.  Using new character would still be grindy but would also speed it up a bit.
---
I have an entire set - it's amazing against the Queen or anything else Scorched for that matter.
---
There's no need for that.
---
If you do an event on a public team, you can loot any corpse that was killed by a teammate that was also doing the event. You don't need to have tagged the enemy. Even legendaries. Feature, not bug.
---
Source: literally me, Beefy Trout
---
 Did you respec to a max XP build?   
---
No, and I don't think that should be mandatory for people later on. Also I'm in a BoS RP group, so mutations are off the table.   
---
Honestly I am not a fan of min-maxing at all, this game breaks badly when pushed to extremes.
---
I remember about two years back when the original beta came out.  Everyone was up in arms about the limited stash size, the numerous bugs, server issues, etc. and they were told "you don't know what beta means...it will all be working perfectly in the release build."
---
Yeah, I think people understand what they are seeing well enough.
---
I know in the bog I‚Äôve had so many enemies just blow up like they‚Äôre the bot. Like mutants or rats. I‚Äôll kill them and they act like they‚Äôre sentry bots and explode. It surprised me at first so now I won‚Äôt loot anything for a couple seconds
---
Yep, the Legendary effects stack, so if you run a full set of Zealot's then you have 75% damage reduction from scorched things.
---
This is how I keep my Berserker toon on it's feet. I'm swapping out armor based on the situation I'm in, so during the SBQ event it's all Zealot's armor and I can tank down there at 0 DR due to the damage reduction.
---
These people have not seen a "insert any game" battle pass, the whole point of a battle pass is to get you to log in every day for some cosmetic you likely won't even use but go for anyway because you can't control your FOMO.
---
Truth.
---
I believe those are for nuclear winter
---
Pops up in my feed. And I'm tired of the whining.
---
For nuclear winter. You use them to buy perk cards you don‚Äôt have
---
That one word got me!  When I heard it, I knew out there, somewhere, was a medical scanner in need.
---
Every time you dupe a perk in NW, you get an Overseer Ticket. You can exchange them for perks you don't have in NW.
---
I know it does for thorn/solar armor. Without it takes 13 vault steel &amp; with it takes 10.
---
I was going to say the same. VATS only works on creatures &amp; bots in NW, and explosive weapons/Gauss are rare as hell. I suck at NW, but even I know the key is to git gud.
---
right.  Bethesda created a bunch of events that require teamwork but then you only get kill credit if you damage the enemy.  Like keeping brahmin alive...getting ore...keeping those workers alive....keeping friendly animals alive...nothing.  stupid.  stupid. stupid.  Give me a legendary.  Or xp.  I worked hard helping out.  Project paradise fails if I don't run around keeping pinchy the bloatfly healed.
---
That only makes the whole thing worse
---
Not better
---
Redstone engineer plays Fallout 76 makes a calculator in a camp. Lol.
---
Don't forget to run through the radiation decontamination showers when you come back up.
---
Hell no not even bothering with any of this. And why should I it‚Äôs not like my build has any shortcomings or the pve demands it
---
I need to try this, I always get stuck in the Lucky Hole Mine.
---
Mate... that‚Äôs from the daily ops. Resilient is one of the mods and you can only kill them with melee
---
I admit, this did make me laugh
---
Sorry if I hadn't been clear, but the legendary cards have been specifically designed so that all the cards provide diminishing returns. the first rank provides much of the potential of the cards; Of course rank 4 is still desirable but what are you even going to do with that power once you have it? I'm asking honestly.
---
Relishing in deliberately trying to make others feel bad sounds sociopathic to me.
---
I realized that Quad's were the way to go a while back I now have Quad Fixers, Handmades &amp; Plasma Rifles...they don't take a hit in the new damage calculations at all.
---
thats actually pretty significant still.
---
2nd star roll will become more important though.
---
b25 will dunk on a v10 for evample.
---
im testing a b25 and a VE auto fixer now. the B25 is better, higher dam, and the vamps effect on anything less than high ROF isnt worth it.
---
vamp fixer is good, because it always has been. all fixers are lol.
---
Yeah T-60 was the only decent one, but I'm not a plan completionist in this game and crafted doesn't differ from found power armor. So I would have only wanted them for trade value but post dupe waves they aren't even worth the effort either. Just feels like a real wasted opportunity with the maps in general sadly.
---
The most I have time for right now is dailies and it's still a problem for me that most of them are boring or not fun to do.  Build/delete 50 or so camp objects. It's brutal.  The last time I logged in, I just.... Ignored it and walked the highway.  Most fun I've had in a while, actually exploring.
---
Some. Others I saw from feedbacks. They even posted videos.
---
I agree with your premise but not your reasoning.
---
Even *Minecraft* has logic gates.
---
I am a working dad that watches my son after work and I still find time to get dailies done every day \*shrug\*
---
I wont play it without the glitch, it sucks otherwise
---
This is probably the best way to play SAS games anyway.  Content is slow to produce, quick to consume.  Play through it, have a good time, set it aside when the content runs out.  Wait a year, go back, do all the new stuff, set it aside, rinse and repeat.  Nice little annual event to look forward to :)
---
I don‚Äôt think it was supposed to spawn outside of the dailyops, but that‚Äôs just a mutation. Next time you see one just bash it with your gun when it‚Äôs at its final sliver of health, and it SHOULD die.
---
I use power armor + radshield. I do 1/4 ore location at a time and I use the radshower in between each location, works out ok :)
---
BTW: Do the explosions of your VE Fixer trigger an additional health boost?
---
For whatever reason I was thinking about something I'd seen or read about how some kids were learning to multiply (I grew up doing long multiplication but they were doing something with lines and grids). It just occurred to me to see what other methods of multiplying existed and whether you could do that with a camp. I read through the wiki here until I found quarter square multiplication:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication\_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_algorithm)
---
People have different definitions of what a two-way switch is so not sure if this answers the question but I have my own version here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yuwAC\_vfvA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yuwAC_vfvA)  
---
There is an example where flipping the switch on/off cycles between opening left/right doors
---
I've tried equipping it in the material cost stays the same
---
Recently picked up a QE25 Railway and I may just have to start maining that. If I drop absolutely everything else from my inventory I should be able to carry enough railway spikes to last me a good 45 minutes or so. Lol.
---
Nice! Two of the pieces are Sentinel, and the other is sneak. Plus all 3 have AP refresh. I‚Äôm pretty excited about that...
---
Steam counts your time in the main menu
---
I ran across a camp that had 5 collectrons going. I‚Äôm trying to figure that one out too
---
Pure flux is pulled from stable flux when you need it for crafting something. Stable flux is what you craft at the chemistry station. You also get some stable flux from completing Scorched Earth.
---
What if I fix the Brahmin thingy afterwards? Is it not acceptable to milk, kill, replace rinse and repeat?
---
Really? A horde surrounding him cant bring him down with their melee? And his health is always at the last drop... Wow... i must try again tomorrow
---
i dont remember.
---
Imo they can‚Äôt fix the bugged 2nd perks so making them additive makes it less broken.
---
I know the you can blueprint the ammo depot, but that is overboard.
---
We have a specific tab for holotapes anyway :)
---
I use a Vampire Explosive LMG on the Encryptid &amp; she can't deplete my health faster than I gain it back (even standing full in her beam)..the explosive does help a lot, I tested with a regular Vampire LMG &amp; it wasn't nearly as effective.
---
The same applies to my main character, which uses a Vampire Gauss Minigun - it is the best.
---
Yep, not overkilling everything even the SBQ in a few seconds is going to be better for the game over all. But I don't like consumables taking the same technical hit. They need to find a workaround or they will be destroying a part of the game.
---
I dont
---
These are the ones I've got like a hundred of each.
---
Negative,  Xbone...
---
There are people out there whose minds don't work like yours.  They literally can't stand NOT finishing what they start.  They have to count the spilled grains of rice, they have to solve every puzzle, finish each quest, complete every set.
---
A more cynical person might wonder if the companies providing these season passes (or loot boxes, etc.) are intentionally preying on these people, taking unfair advantage of their natures, etc.
---
So, while YOU might not HAVE to do it...there are others not as fortunate.
---
Why exactly?
---
I run bloodied build with a VE Handmade now. When I'm not bloodied I swap unyielding to Vanguards, its a great.
---
Damm that is some really good armour pieces
---
Those Battle Bot key cards are a pain. I was glad to learn that I can keep using the old ones. At least I quit adding them to my inventory.
---
Easy. One pistol is hung on the little finger by the bracket, the second is reloaded. Then the animation is mirrored. It will take a very long time, but this is such a revolver
---
You'd want to get it before parch 22 hits though.
---
Welcome to failour 76
---
Leave it to Bethesda to give the people what they don't want and even then do it poorly.
---
you assume that Bethesda would work faster if we stopped doing that. they wouldn't.
---
they game would be just as broken and we'd have no workarounds.
---
Don't really see him traveling to the East Coast.
---
All of you keep saying this like it's this giant surprise when that's what the entire genre is designed around. The game was built specifically with the intent of making you do daily gamer chores whether you really like it or not.
---
Everything is changeable, bloodied guns, your game, your car, your house, your money, your life. You die in the end, so I don't see your point.
---
Btw, I'd still buy a BE handmade / fixer or lever rifle if anyone is interested in selling just tell me.
---
Me either when I go full conduit and hide so it stays
---
bash him. at 1% health it should do the trick.
---
resilient and cloaked enemies are extremely annoying. I pity the poor souls who rely on vats because of some handicap.
---
The master? From doctor who? I feel like I'm missing something here haha
---
My buddies base is just like that. Has 2 floors of em. If you FT to his character when he‚Äôs in there afk you end up in his locked up base lol
---
O and that thing is really cool!!!!!!
---
All your doing is enabling them tho, if everyone who keeps trying to force the game to work took that energy and put it towards nagging Bethesda I guarantee you they'd at least have a sense of urgency and before you say that never works I'll direct you to the Sonic the Hedgehog movie.
---
Classic!ü§Ø
---
They're hard to find because everyone turns them in for scrip. I'm not playing melee anymore but I'm definitely keeping my junkies.
---
Now - not to argue the point here, I'm very much in the "play what you like" camp.
---
But - if they're having trouble balancing new game content because the meta build (bloodied...I think Junkies is in there as well) does say 10-20x the average damage of other builds then shouldn't they rebalance that build?
---
What if the new solution is that those builds are now 2-5x the damage of other builds? Still exceptional damage, just not the same astronomical levels as before. Now they can create content that everyone can reasonably participate in with some level of difficulty rather than making things tougher for the meta build and near impossible for other builds. The problem there is that it forces everyone into a meta build which kind of sucks for a game.
---
The alternative suggested is to buff all the other builds and then make everything tougher. That's definitely possible, but really that's just the same as rebalancing the damage on the meta builds isn't it? It just requires a lot less testing to get the balance right as the only change is to the meta builds instead of everything else plus the enemies.
---
Not meaning to say that you or anyone else is wrong for playing your way - just wanted to point this out.
---
You don't need to learn the plan for that weapon. Youve always had a chance to get one
---
They are earned from getting Duplicate perk cards (along with a small amount of XP) in Nuclear Winter. Overseer Tickets can be redeemed for NW perk cards that you do not own.
---
Its one of the most popular ways to get the Frog Legs perk. Requires 9 Agility SPECIAL to equip.
---
That game looks like ass and is buggy as hell, why would you suggest that to people. (also lmao the devs don't care about the community, they care about making players provide them free content under the guise of community, which is very different).
---
Because it's FUN! We're having *FUN!*
---
Don't forget my favorite - Possum Badges 
---
/s
---
Was it cloaked or completely invisible?  I've been having issues with mobs occasionally being completely invisible.  Ironically the spot I've seen it the most is in the Bog between the Watoga Train Station and the trainyard to the east (near the watch tower).
---
Did you submit feedback on the PTS forum?
---
You just a bitch, if you were strong you could stop me, but you ain't so I'mma keep doing it
---
makes sense if the explosive hit is also counting. basically double the vamps proc.
---
Hope you got some good items off it
---
Afaik, any weapons added after the game was released.
---
Fair. Description was terrible. 
---
Tried forever to make a door that opens from switches or inputs on either side without any loop or ‚Äòstuck‚Äô conditions, but I can‚Äôt find a easy to create an and/or gate to check/consider the status of the opposite switch before affecting the door.
---
Don't really want the same ol stuff we have already seen.  I would rather new stuff.
---
That is why I am not happy with the BoS this time.  They could have kept it as Taggerdy's people but NOOOO they have to have them come all the way from CA.  Ugh.
---
I want new stuff I don't want to see the stuff we have already done.
---
I must be super freaking lucky. Ive got 2 with around 50 tickets. My partner has the 2nd one i got. I have so many other guns that i like and do well, nothing overly special roll/stat wise but work well but i always always always have my trusty fancy shot gun. It sat on my wall for a while also until i did a hey why not try it out see what all the fuss is about. Holy freaking cheezles. Vat boom dead. Vat boom dead. Only annoying part is sometimes they get killed so fast that their bar comes back and you have to one shot again and sometimes even another time. Just make sure you don't vat shoot a legendary or mobs that people are also getting a hit on. Just normal shoot it. It's very easy to accidentally one shot even a legendary.
---
Don't give up! You harass that claim checking bot for as long as it takes.
---
So it works in similarity to how the Scorchbeast Queen works. Not Nuking Fissure site prime directly but just getting it within the confines of the blast zone.
---
 I think the next change would be to raise the max level of items, that would add a little bit more damage/defense and give people a reason to farm stuff and maybe make dupes and legacys obsolete.
---
...you just said you want PvP and non PvP players split into different servers.
---
Well shit
---
In my case it never updates.  It never shows the workshop as being taken and the only sign is the lights are at the top of the pole over the red machine.
---
EDIT: People keep downvoting without offering anything. Please share your thoughts too.
---
	Make stealth not so easy and more rewarding
---
		I can walk in front of enemies and remain in "Hidden" status with my Unyielding boosted Agility, without running shadowed or Sneak perk. This makes no sense. Stealth should be difficult to maintain and remain very damaging.
---
	Make sniping more rewarding
---
		Rifleman build should have way more damage per shot than commando builds. The current difference is negligible which makes commando have extremely more DPS, at the expense of some extra ammo.
---
			Boost Rifleman range and damage and
---
			Possibly Nerf Commando range and damage to balance.
---
	Make/Keep close range builds high damage
---
		Damage/danger ratio should be high. If you are risking melee range or shotgun range, you should be making lots of damage.
---
	Make Heavy Explosive builds scary
---
		Missile Launchers and Fatmans (Fatmen?) should be buffed a lot more. There is no universe where I should not be scared shitless when confronted with the business end of a mini nuke or missile.
---
	Make Power Armor a moving tank
---
		Power Armor should be a force to be reckoned with. I cannot describe my dissapointment when my 2STR rifleman build becomes overencumbered when entering what is effectively a fully armored exoskeleton.
---
			Boost carrying capacity by a lot and even allow for container mods, similar to pocketed/deep pocketed. Default carry weight bonus same as backpack of same level as PA.
---
			Boost melee damage and strength in general.
---
			Complete immunity to environmental diseases and probably radiation too. Radiation immunity could be provided with an additional mod if not by default.
---
			Power Armor users should effectively not be able to sneak attack, apart from logical distances and stealth boy mod.
---
			Incur Perception and Agility penalty
---
	Make death more costly
---
		There are 2 reasons that bloodied builds are OP. First is the synergy with perks, mutations and armor, but second is the insignificant cost of dying. Apart from an annoyance an a small chance of loosing some junk, there is no serious downside to be that close to death.
---
			Over level 50, when you die you can respawn wherever you want by paying some fixed cost (e.g 1000 caps or 1 gold bullion or something else. If you cannot afford it, then your junk is lost and you can only respawn at your camp, tent or 76.
---
	Make other builds more viable
---
		Medic effect could rely on damage rather than VATS crits, like a shared Vampire effect which only works on others for not crits and only works on you on crits.
---
		Nocturnal effect could lose it's daytime penalty get and increasingly greater rewards for damage/armor during the night, plus boost stealth.
---
		Assasins' effect should either apply to all humans (NPCs and players) or removed altogether.
---
		Mutant's effect should stack the more mutations you have and be boosted by Strange in Numbers too.
---
	
---
	Stop making bullet sponge bosses.
---
		The SBQ and Colossus are ridiculously spongy. It is not challenging to do the same thing for 10 more minutes and 2000 more bullets.
---
			Make bosses adhere to game mechanics (e.g crippling limbs) and create the challenge out of tactics rather than brute force only.
---
			Add mutations or mutation immunities to them.
---
			Add tactical ways to promote orchestrated teamwork, similar to the Encryptid event, by making bosses vulnerable upon crippling a limb or dismembering an appendage.
---
The tardis was in FO1.
---
in practice they do if you use any perk cards or any other buffs in your build though.
---
they dont get directly, but like everything else, they are a little bit less effective than before.
---
i tested my Q25 handmade. its worse than it was before by a little bit, not much.
---
Haha.  I'm gonna pester than sob right now XD
---
On a somewhat unrelated note, is anyone else slightly concerned about the BOS deciding to take up residence in a top secret government weather control machine?  One that actually works (well, worked) , at least to some extent?
---
I mean sure, they might have found records involving it (Big MT was also working on weather control so records might exist somewhere out west) and said "gosh, we better melt that sucker down before someone finds it and makes a mess" but...well...it might be the beginnings of the "gosh, that sounds like something that only WE should have access to...for the Greater Good of course..."  mentality that took hold in later years...
---
Oh yes, I see what you mean now. I didn't figure out a way to do that either except glitch a switch into the wall so you can use it from both sides. Pretty much any switch will let you click it on any part that's touchable. It's not pretty but it does work.
---
That would require them not recycling hairstyles from fallout 4. Minus I think the curly bun.
---
Part of the issue is that a lot of these "day one" bugs were there in FO4, as well. Some of these bugs are going on five years old, with no fix in sight. At that point, you either find a workaround and live with it, or throw your arms in the air and give up. 
---
I'd like to think they'll eventually fix some of the more glaring problems, but knowing Bethesda, I'm not going to hold my breath, and I'm not going to let it keep me from playing the game.
---
Was ages ago I cant een remember what I got
---
I suggest staggering for the sbq, and waves of scorched between phases. Its kind of already in place
---
I am against double gauntlets. Do not forget that you have a pipboy on one hand, that is, only the right one is free. But pistols and one-handed weapons - YES! I am strongly in favor of bringing in two revolvers or pistols or knives. This will balance the pistol and one-handed builds with the rest, at least.
---
I didn't know what foodbuild meant so I just looked it up. It says this is a player who is bad at PvP and uses food buffs etc for PvE.
---
Well yes, I'm disabled, so I'm very bad at PvP.
---
I do use aids like VATS, power armor, and buffs to help me so I am able to play this game.
---
I‚Äôm fine with it making poo, bulk the poo sell it ...
---
Laughs in power armor
---
Some time, sure. It's not like it's a hard thing to do though. God-rolls are handed out like candy because bethesda doesn't give a shit about the dupers. Most of the people on the blacklisted trading subs have entire spreadsheets of hundreds of unyielding sentinel sets/bloodied whatever handmades, fixers, plasmas, you name it. It's a valid argument but not a really good one
---
Send me your friend code.
---
Yes, i am like level 120 in 76. Haven't played since a little after wastelanders and i get all my info from this sub... Every time something comes up, it seems they have made it worse. I see no reason to come back and i don't predict anything will be able bring me back. They had a chance to bring the game back from the hole they buried it in, and they fucked it all up. They consistently fuck it all up. 76 had potential somewhere in there, but now it's just a sad money grab that isn't even really that fun. 
---
If you haven't yet, i suggest you play GROUNDED, a significantly better survival game only in the very beginning phases. Only going to get better!
---
Why would i need vampires when super stimpacks drop like candy for me
---
I do agree that companies are likely doing it on purpose. 
---
And I'm the same way - collecting everything, solving every puzzle. Especially in stuff like zelda. I'm always after every bobble head, magazine, ect in every fallout. But that's different than a free season pass - as its not actually in game content persay.
---
But you should never let a hobby such as video games work you like a job. I used to do that with ESO before I quit. If you find yourself no longer having fun, then adjust.
---
I think no one believes the crap they pulled on Cork - that is just plain and simple cheating their own system on their end.
---
I don't mind it, they need to learn, they maybe do, but at least a honest post like "WTF, we set a goal that was impossible, welp, we lowered it and give you teh reward X either way .." would make it more believable. 
---
Considering the meager rewards I doubt many people will drop hard earned resources, especially all those without 1st, where stash space is even more precious.
---
The brahmin at camps don't drop anything neither meat nor xp, there is literally no gain, just durability loss.
---
Even if they were going to fix it down the road, the lack of effort to make any balancing changes before releasing this update was upsetting. It‚Äôs obvious that most builds can‚Äôt even function rn, which is especially harmful for anyone who has spent their entire game trying to earn potentially nerfed gear. You can‚Äôt make these kinds of massive changes at once when RNG is so terrible.
---
Mostly
---
It'd be a bit difficult timeline wise. Unless there's a large time jump, I don't really see it happening. I would love to see him on a modern engine though.
---
Yes!!! I got so many 'rarerish' outfits from him so i camp hopped and chased people down to give them away! Plus cowboy outfits seems to sell so fast. I always sold em stupid cheap but who doesn't want a cowboy outfit eh?
---
I doubt it. based on their track record so far and even their customer service. 'Bethesda' and 'urgency' don't go hand in hand, unless it directly affects their revenue model.
---
correct me if I'm wrong but I think they ***still*** haven't fixed the wastelanders' premium edition PA skins. there's no workaround for this mind you, people who paid what, 30 bucks? for their skins are simply not able to use them. 4 months later it still hasn't been fixed. this is 101% absurd and they just don't care.
---
on the other hand, a week ago someone disclosed a score glitch. it was patched within a few hours.
---
yes but those people are dwindling and the 29 people that end up staying at the end won't be able to keep Bethesda from going bankrupt.
---
Says the anonymous person hiding somewhere on the internet. There's nothing strong there.
---
Aside from those man child with explosive energy weapon who stand there just waiting to melt it instantly. 
---
I pay for the damn card, take all 3 pylons for nothing. Can‚Äôt even just wait 3 secs for everyone to hit it once.
---
Good job on you actually explained the bug without being an absolute twat about it.
---
They did do that for the concrete goal. The main goal isn‚Äôt to drum up the game to players, but moreso for outside sources like investors. ‚ÄúOur players love the game so much they came up with a quarter billion resources that were super hard to get‚Äù
---
Yep √∏.
---
Survivsl mode was full on pvp.
---
I have a bunch of sogns around the pen that say go away
---
And that only refreshed it for like a week
---
Beth did it, I doubt teh community amassed 150m Cork, after the concrete shenanigans by Bethesda this ist just unbelievable.
---
done
---
If this is true this really sucks. That is why I left Destiny, because they couldn't leave well enough alone! They're always nerfing the wrong shit! I was a day one Destiny player until about 4 months ago when I got this game and I love it. I'm only level 135, but I'm finding it funner. However, if they nerf like you say, I'm done with this game too. I'm done wasting all of my precious spare time to grind anymore in video games. Life's too short. If they want us to spend all our time and their games and grind for things, they better make it worth it to us and not so they can fudge their numbers!
---
Something i recently notice with the sbq: people tend to stand on the roof of dropsite v9 which also prevents her from landing. (Had a few runs where she didnt land at all)
---
So always stand on the open field next to dropsite v9
---
be careful bethesda might do it but not give you the points to add back your specials
---
but jokes aside I absolutely love this idea.
---
And then the courier reveals himself to be Todd Howard with the package being a Skyrim port for your CAMP‚Äôs TV.
---
Most of the time it's random creatures that kill your Brahmin or at least it's that's what kills my Brahmin üòä
---
You certainly CAN make changes like these if a) you are exceptionally optimistic, b) don't have a clue what you're doing, c) aren't worried about making a mess as it can all be cleaned up, eventually, with further updates.
---
Or d) all of the above, I suppose.
---
I was hoping they would have taken back Camp Venture and Fort Defiance in the Cranberry Bog area, or one of the Airports like in Fallout 4
---
FO4 is a different situation tho, I only had to pay once and it wasn't an MMO so people were a bit forgiving because of modding but you can't do that in an MMO. The attitude you have is just enabling them because of your lack of concern they have a lack of urgency which is why there's only half measures when it comes to updates and bug fixes.
---
Don't change you a bitch. Ign Nekrosias. My doxx is out there too if you wanna delve :P still waiting on the pipe bombs I was promised by those guys
---
I can't get a stupid foundation to stop saying item is floating when it clearly is in the dam ground and you built a flipping TI-89 Titanium in your camp just for shits and gigs SMH
---
Neat, but maybe it would just allow for reset of your perk assignment on special points. Idk but I like the idea. üëç
---
Assuming that the PTS will launch exactly the same as it is now (which it won't), if you're running shotgun perks and slugger perks, you'll still steamroll pretty much everything with those two weapons. It's **unarmed** that has taken a completely unreasonable hit to damage, not 1h/2h melee.
---
I would :D When do you normally play?
---
Bush Wookie Reynolds pose.
---
right. My bad.
---
its only on the Public Test Server right now, its not in the main game yet
---
My partner and i sat and watched as not only his WHOLE camp got obliterated, but also his body.  Glowing red bones then into ash. Was actually hilarious.
---
&gt; keeping brahmin alive
---
Why do they run into the Sheepsquatch!  Why NukaCowla!  Why!
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
This would be the most lorebreaking thing ever.
---
Killing cow is a crime anyways :-)
---
Yes, posted this so people who don‚Äôt want pts video knows. I generally don‚Äôt play in PA and I‚Äôm not fond of always having to jump in my Chinese stealth armor just to reequip everything
---
Ahh okay thank you! I do use those perks, and it takes a little time to rev up for furious from both weapons. 
---
Dare i ask if they fixed that weird vats hit% bug?
---
he also repaired everyones camp that stayed and let their camp get nuked. and bought out new players entire vending machines no matter the price and gave for free to new players a whole bunch of plans. But yeah, using nukes on players that charge 100's of caps for an extremely easy to get item like purified water which some noobs might get tricked by makes him an 'arsehole'
---
And the master!
---
im already transferring stuff like crazy with 1st world, no reason not to extend that to everyone and make it a supported feature.
---
Been holding on to a load of atoms hoping for the blackbird paints to return 
---
I stg i better not miss them again
---
Wait? People destroy the SBQ in seconds?????? Everytime I've killed her with a huge group, it takes like 20 minutes.
---
Hmm actually when you mention it i Think there was..? 
---
But i‚Äôve been playing a lot of destiny lately so I might mix things up lol.
---
You can treat yourself to these nuts
---
it is known.
---
Oh I fully agree that you should not, if you have any actual choice in the matter, not let this sort of thing happen.
---
The problem is that not everyone has a choice in the matter.  Worse, they aren't having fun because they are never having fun...they are fighting a never ending battle against their own brains...and losing.
---
Telling these people "if it's not pleasant, adjust" is like shooting someone and saying "if you aren't having fun bleeding, just stop."
---
Bloodied needed a good kick in the sack, and everyone knows it. If there's not some attempt to balance-out the high end, everyone just ends up rolling the same boring equipment.
---
He was the main antagonist in Fallout 1.
---
 Boyfriend got a god tier junkie's roll on his bloodied character. Of course it's one of the non transferable items.
---
You've never played any previous Fallout games, have you?
---
Because if you had, you would have at least a basic understanding of how the community fixed most of the issues with the previous games.
---
funny enough it looks straight out of f76 lol
---
Shame I didn't know that then :(
---
Looked in his tent and around the platform
---
but how can they damage you if your not in like pvp mode
---
Fast travel is the largest cap sink in the game.
---
If your teammates tag it you can still get the legendaries.
---
I'm not sure what being disabled has to do with PvP skill.
---
Your name still gets me everytime.... 
---
The master was the main antagonist of the first fallout game. He is basically a mutant brain who built a mutant army (super mutants) which roams the NCR.
---
Definitely one of the best parts of the old games were the story. Not a fan of the birds eye tactical rpg shit, but the quality of that story was worth playing it.
---
No. It‚Äôs sho Nuff..........please don‚Äôt let be the only one to know this!
---
I'm gonna guess a camp super close to a vendor
---
...so under your line of reasoning, wouldn't it be helpful to get that back?
---
If this is why the server is unstable, I don't mind.
---
I‚Äôve done zero NW dailies. I‚Äôm going to finish the board.
---
Mi IGN is scott723 I'm on between 7am and 10am eastern find me and I'll fix the gun and power armor issue
---
I enjoy the game and find it a fun time killer. it's fun to build camps and follow people about, but ultimately it kills me because they constantly add FOMO stuff to the store. 
---
I completed the raider wastelander campaign and you know what I got? 1 outfit (that was pretty shit) and access to a daily grind. I now have to grind out bullion. I initially browsed the bullion store and was like "oh cool that's not bad" then found out you can only buy 200 bullion a day.
---
It would take me literal weeks to get a single t65 part because of the fucking cap. I want to sit there and grind out my stuff all at once or as I want to. Everything being locked behind a paywall or an insane grind is so cheap.
---
Like yay I completed the campaign and now rather than give me raider camp gear and stuff to actually RP as one you want to to give you ¬£15 on the atom store to buy it? ¬£15 PER PACK as there are multiple raider packs.
---
Why not give equal or greater XP for the gathering portion if the event?
---
all the time
---
Yet you said anything they *build*. If you were talking about the giant plants which you claim aren‚Äôt built, why‚Äôd you say built?
---
[Yep](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Atomic_Shop/Photomode?file=Atx_photomode_pose_lyingout_l.png)
---
I'm a crippled veteran, unless your skull has the consistency of mashed potatoes you should be able to play the game just fine, foodbuild
---
I has a TSE shotgun and it still kicks out about 400+ damage without shotgunner perks. It's enough to kill a ghoul in two shots, but I'm considering getting a quad explosive or anti armour explosive instead
---
You just went from ‚Äòcomputer scientist‚Äô to ‚Äòengineer‚Äô in 2 minutes flat and I absolutely love it. 
---
Never even thought of that. More duct tape!
---
This camp is actually running the server
---
Lmao I prefer not playing in my t65... just saying
---
BTW, I think I have the Bear Arms plan in my vendor for 5000 caps.  (XBox)
---
I keep the ripper for that problem
---
They should just add XP to event actions and ALL legendaries should drop their loot for everyone who is killing enemies or getting Event XP.
---
For example, each irradiated ore you deposite should give you XP and/or it should automatically "tag" all event enemies for a set period of time. Likewise, while acting as a Conduit for the Imposter Sheepsquatch event, you should be getting reduced XP (1/3rd per active pylon you have on yourself) for each kill in the event and ALL legendaries should be given to ALL players who contribute. Wether it's killing enemies, repairing mineral extractors, being a conduit, tanking a certain amount of damage, or collecting ores. Anything would be better than the current state tbh.
---
That way people actually have a reason to not build the highest DPS possible and actually support one another with the support perks and such.
---
The battle scaling like they have in ESO would be awesome, but I think it would require a complete overhaul of the combat system. Bethesda isn't likely to be ready to put that kind of effort into it, tbh...
---
1* Bloodied, Anti Armor, Instigating, and Junkies
---
2* Faster fire/Swing, Explosive, Vats hit
---
3* +S, Faster reloading, let's vats cost, reduced weight.
---
These are what people want the most.
---
I did... I just have terrible luck :/
---
&gt; just a waste of time, stimpaks and ammo.
---
You've just defined pretty much any hard tier event (Radiation Rumble &amp; Project Paradise) in the game.  If you're not farming XP, those events (and several others) aren't worth the time.
---
I wonder if camp design and proximity to the nuke strike matters.
---
Because of a herd of sometimes violent radstags, I have a concrete wall built facing north. I think the center point of the nuke was northeast, on the lake.
---
Imo since the past base damage of weapons was made to complement the past damage formula, the change also calls for greatly raising the base damage of all weapons. The divide between bloodied and everyone else is still smaller than before, but at least it doesn't take half a mag to down a lv 75 ghoul.
---
I rarely have that kind of luck with armor. Kind find AP refresh, but rarely with the other good effects. Plus I always overlooked zealots until recently.
---
The last few SBQ runs have gone pretty easy -- I think most people have gotten the memo about the staggering effect.
---
I watched the video and I mostly agree, especially on the unarmed part.
---
I play bloodied unarmed with rifles as a side and today in the PTS I was literally unable to kill a mirelurk queen despite having end-game gear (unyielding SS armor + bloodied gauntlet + bloodied black powder and tesla rifle, I know those aren't the best but it's what was fun for me) I also had the armor pen perks but just didn't dent her health in the slightest.
---
For normal enemys/creatures it's fine, just a bit sad that perk-cards almost do nothing, so it would be nice if they buffed them a bit, which should be possible now because of the change to additive damage and also either get other weapon types up to the DPS of fire-rate based weapons (commando and heavy) or nerf their damage. I do less damage with my gauntlet than some still do with those while they can attack so much faster and be ranged.
---
I can give you some examples with numbers if you want as well \^\^ But I don't have specific numbers for the mirelurk queen as I didn't note those down
---
Duhthesda won't change it because it forces people to buy fallout 1st
---
That's because the fanbase doesn't make enough noise when it comes to this subject and it's sad. You'd think them encountering the fast travel glitch live at Quakecon would at least embarrass them enough to fix that but no because y'all keep finding work arounds and because of that Bethesda gets lazy. Also you do know you can get atoms from the legendary run which is why they fixed it so fast. Getting free atoms affects them but you buying something from the and being unhappy doesn't because they already have your money. If the people who got screwed over the PA skins aren't making enough noise then it's not a priority.
---
Honestly, if you Solo all the Story content, things will unfold in a natural fashion.  I never played with anyone until I completed Main + Wastelander story content.   Just listen to what NPCs say and read things you find, and you will figure it all out, no extra people needed :)  It gets confusing when new players try to play like seasoned players.     
---
How you play the game is different at different stages of the game.
---
Who cares?  It doesn't matter. Seriously that's such a tiny thing to argue about. OP knew what I meant. Jesus.
---
No, but if your Gauss Shotgun has 33/50limb/40bash as its second star, just jump and then enter VATS to fire. Or hit VATS, exit, then enter VATS again and BAM. Frankly, that works even if it doesn't have those.
---
In all honesty, it takes pretty much the same amount of time to do those workarounds as it does to charge the weapon. Also it's more fun to jump around with that thing, in my opinion. I didn't even realize it was a workaround to a bug; I just did it instinctively because Marsupial + VATS is fun as hell.
---
You take Helock Holes and a warning pops up that this can happen.
---
I still occasionally pick one up by accident, trying to loot the Gutsies.  Never not a bad feeling.
---
Had a guy on the fence give me thumbs down for being in the field   Nuke hadn‚Äôt landed yet so we weren‚Äôt in teams so I just shoot him back and he was squishy and died.   Have to admit I don‚Äôt enjoy PVP but I had to laugh at this    Edit he lit me up with his minigun first and I shot him while he was emoting
---
You do realize that you can make a level 1 and level and it counts right ? Lawd.
---
The time gap between this game and fallout 1 is roughly 60 years. Is it possible the master is alive at this point, yeah... is it possible that he has an army, and they somehow march across the country? I don‚Äôt think so from a canonical standpoint. 
---
With that being said, this whole game is a big step away from that canon. Never did I think I‚Äôd be riding coin op rides, and wearing masks to march around in circles endlessly for a week straight. So I guess never say never

And on top of what your saying don't be logged into the game at reset or you may have over half of the dailies are ready completed and you get no points.
---
Mines furious,  limb dmg and reload speed, and thank you for that :-)
---
The game was designed with more PVP interactions in mind.  Turns out, people that wanted multiplayer Fallout didn't want to play PVP.
---
Imagine how well you might play if your head and hands were shaking, and you get the idea.
---
If the legendary run item is cosmetic you'll find it's been unlocked in the atomic shop menu, and can be crafted at an appropriate crafting station. Some items such as the supply boxes you'll find in your junk tab or lunchboxes in your aid tab, and anything crafting related will simply be unlocked in the crafting menu.        
---
Raiding new players? Generally the community tends to be pretty nice, most players are more inclined to drop supplies for new players than do anything else.       
---
You'll find plans for new CAMP items as you progress - rewards for quests or events, random loot in containers, sold in player camps, sold by vendors (the whitesprings hotel to the south east of the forest is a good location for vendors).
---
I think hiding cards or "scrapping" them for coins to get normal cards would be nice
---
I guess they don't want people creating "burner babes" to level up to 50 and then scrap all the cards for coins.
---
Damn.
---
You obviously didn't fully read my comment because I stated I only had to pay for FO4 once and it wasn't an MMO, same for FO3, New Vegas, Skyrim, etc.
---
I had no idea that Brahmin Plinko existed and my life is better for having seen that. I had thought about building it recently but it looks like this guy already did it months ago and did a way better job. You left out [Brahmin Disco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFHxPViWLzE) though and that's unforgiveable.
---
I doubt the master would be added but I'd love for there to be SOMETHING fucked up to fight by nuking the west tek building. Hell give us a Frank Horrigan type superboss to fight.
---
Legendaries and special bosses/enemies just need standard death animations. I'm so sick of SB/Q turning into an ash pile in the air or the Imposter Sheepsquatch rolling downhill somewhere in some bushes to then turn into a nigh invisible scrap pile while I'm fighting for my life or hiding with pylons active.
---
If you join an event team, and they do events, you get XP by not doing anything to help the team. You can get more/extra XP by actually trying to help them out, but the game does let you mooch.
---
I personally feel like mooching off event XP is acceptable up through level 20 (since that's the level you need to reach to progress the main storyline of the game). After that, if you aren't pulling your weight with low level events you can run solo, or trying to help out, I'd kick you off the team.
---
Ok that got me lmfao
---
What do you mean by "caps vendor"?  Like the camp vendors but instead of selling you buy things?
---
Thumbs up for Scrip and Bullion vendors/machines, but for B to even consider that, they would probably have to count towards that person's daily limits just like the other machines.  Still, would be nice.
---
In the legendary run, items like lunchboxes and caps go right into your character's inventory. The camp items aren't plans, they just unlock in your build menu. 
---
The community is really cool. Just stash your junk when taking a workshop. That still opens you up to pvp. 
---
Taking workshops is also a good way to get more plans for building your camp. Plans also pop up in toolboxes. 
---
Send me your ign, I play on the Bethesda net client not steam. I got some camp plans you can have and I'll build some stuff for you since I got pretty much all the camp plans unlocked.
---
I've only noticed it since wastelanders
---
Don't confuse my desire to derive enjoyment from an investment as a lack of concern. I *want* them to fix the issues; I simply don't have faith that they ever will, and while I'll keep the embers of hope alive with the breath of angst, I will continue to play the game as best I can.
---
Do you have a neurological tremor that causes your head and hands to shake uncontrollably? Maybe imagine how that might affect your vision and aim.
---
I am sorry for your injury, and honor your service.
---
One thing that is probably underappreciated here is how nicely lined up all the switches are. That takes a lot of patience. Kudos!
---
Yes, and you do realize that some of us already have full character slots with toons that are not level one right?
---
You don‚Äôt have to do anything. There is nothing in game that is requires the run to be complete as a prerequisite. 
---
Want and need or have to are different things.
---
Throw your code my way and if your interested I can throw a discord invite to a very active enclave discord
---
One arm two legs.  Not bad IMO
---
Nothing.
---
THEY. DO. NOT. CARE. If they cared in even the slightest the game would not be in the state it is now.
---
I'm sorry you suck even genetically.
---
I fear not the fishy four legged fiend.  I fear the new Assaultron.
---
Wow! Today I Learned! That just makes them frustrating. If the transactions go to server stability/the server &amp; dev teams, I don't see an issue with them.
---
If you want more $$$ for the corporation in general, at least have the decency to hide behind a subscription model.
---
Easy solution, add back daily atoms, turn score into weekly challenges and add a bit more to the list. This way u don‚Äôt get boned if you miss a week. It‚Äôs alrdy a lot of work for cosmetics, tho I guess that‚Äôs most of what takes up ppls time in this game anyway, Cosmetics grinding *sigh*
---
I pretty much grabbed them for quick food honestly especially with the extra meat perk. Probably a lot of times killing them off from players houses without even recognizing that they were player houses until much later. I saw Brahmin and immediately thought "meat" as a new player and there's no indication that you won't gain anything from killing them either besides killing them and receiving nothing.
---
Maybe just make it so player livestock cannot be attacked by other players much like the other quest NPCs unless you've specifically let them join your group.
---
Agreed. My q2525 handmade was my priority dps weapon. The damage is sufficient and the sustain is really nice in fights
---
Title says "players are also part of the problem"
---
Post quickly turned into "Bethesda sucks"
---
Ah sweet, I couldn't find the roadmap and I was just going off the second helping date, nice to know its sooner than I thought
---
I addec you :D
---
i have corrected this oversight.
---
So was it submitted in the test server forum or not? That‚Äôs the purpose of the PTS.
---
Yes an explosive vamps gun will proc 2 heals
---
Yeah... you‚Äôre literally warned by a message that pauses gameplay until you click ok. If you want to avoid pvp, set up the workshop and leave and just come every so often to collect supplies, then store junk immediately in a stash box you build at the workshop. If you want no chance of entering pvp... don‚Äôt claim the workshop. It‚Äôs a game which pvp is a part of and level makes all the difference when it comes to raw strength of a character, so I think that it‚Äôs just as it should be. I mean, no one can grief you elsewhere for the most part, and there‚Äôs next to no pvp pushed onto us in adventure mode anywhere else. Some people even want pvp to be more integral to the game U.K.? So I think we should just leave it as it is... there, but at the back of our minds where it can be easily ignored.
---
Fallout 76 was designed as a survival-lite, mmo-lite game.  It took elements from fallout (the lore, enemies, factions, etc) and put it in a multiplayer environment.  The original design of the game was to have some drama and PVP.  Not to the extent of games like RUST or other survival games.  
---
Over time and through complaints, many of the PVP elements have been removed, such as slap damage.  
---
Right now work shops are the ONLY True source of PVP.  They generate a ton of resources with very little PVE risk.  The ‚ÄúDefend &lt;workshop&gt;‚Äú events are not risks.  They even  give you some free resources to start with so you can effectively, after taking one, get tons of useful resources.
---
The only risk for workshops are other players, When you take a workshop, you sign up for PVP.  Many online games have a small PVP aspect that you can simply opt out of by not taking workshops.  
---
You‚Äôre basically mad you couldn‚Äôt have unlimited free resources.  
---
If you don‚Äôt want people to kill you, don‚Äôt engage in the PVP aspect of the game.
---
I would like to see a follower of the Master trying to spread the word in West Virginia. Abit like the Children of Atom (or the Mothman Cultists). The Master was iconic as a villain (the nearest Bethesda have come since they took over the game is the AI Enclave president).
---
Then level one of them. Not all of your slots are 500. If they were then playtime isn‚Äôt an issue for you. Level your lowest level toon or delete it if you don‚Äôt play it and make another one. 
---
If youre lvl 500 then you know doing the 10k exp repeatable quest takes like 10 minutes. Do it 3 times. Bam. 50 more score than the level up once daily would give you. 
---
There are ALWAYS options.
---
You think you deserve unlimited access to workshop resources uncontested?
---
Bless
---
Max Caps
---
What exactly on the board can you "not live without"??
---
There isn't anything on there that's game changing, it's all cosmetic doo-dads. You don't make it to 100? Well, welcome to the real world with the rest of us, I guess.
---
I'm sorry that you choose to be a bad person.
---
I agree with you, except for the glitch-use. As long as I have no negative consequences from it, people can do what the fuck they choose to.
---
Duping? Fine, I don't buy on ebay anyways, I want to get my gear by myself.
---
Building glitches? Hell if I care, it doesn't impact me, except when Beth tries to "fix" it by curtailing building further.
---
Xp glitching? Pffft, the faster the cheats level up, the faster they have nothing left to do and are gone.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Apparently leveling your main isn't one of them
---
Now beth needs to announce adding the logic gates from FO4, so we can make even better calculators.
---
Yes. I have it
---
No problem
---
Better question: why bother with workshops? if it's not for a Daily Challenge then I don't see the benefit, especially knowing that you are willingly putting a target on your own back.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt.  Before 1st was even a thing people figured out the easiest thing is simply don‚Äôt take workshops.  That‚Äôs the PVP of the game.  If you dont‚Äô want PVP, don‚Äôt join PVP activities.  If you want acid, you can build your camp at one of the acid extractors and you can get free resources without any PVP that way.
---
Ahh good question!  It was crater that was nuked and a small basic camp south of crater. Probably a bit over halfway from the point of impact? Just a bit south of crater. I still laugh when that image comes to mind. Was great!! I would actually recommend building a little shack with a view in a nukezone and prepare,  just to watch it and your character in the hot seat. Or maybe there's a youtube clip somewhere.
---
I've got a QE 10mm on my low health guerrilla guy and although it's an ammo hog it's awesome. By far my favorite gun.
---
I mean, I've missed two weeks and am still going to finish it. But yeah it requires a lot of grind.
---
Thats 8 HP healing per hit instead of plus 62 dmg per hit. Everybody will play 20% health with vampire explo (11-12% health per hit instead of 62 dmg per hit). Oh my god, I think I'm done with this game. My whole collection just transforms into scrip...
---
Sadly, I can only give one single upvote.
---
I will be a small nerf to legacies as well, and likely will remove some of the magic effects of some weapons.  It's just the abusers of all the multipliers that will be affected significantly.  So stealth commandos will lose a bit.  Not so much that they won't still be fine though, because currently a stealth commando can hit a small mob for 3 times their entire hp in one bullet.  People are really exaggerating how impactful the changes will be.  Most builds won't change much, especially when low hp will become even safer with all the %dmg reduction and poison and fire resist legendary perks.
---
The thing is I do agree that games are a little pricier to make now
---
But in terms of revenue and net loss its staggering how little that affects them in the long run
---
Mappacks were a little bonus, a little extra bit of the pie for the publishers.
---
Devs very RARELY saw any of that money
---
Now games are rampant with money schemes and publishers got huge bonuses while (and I can't stress this enough) activision blizzard developers and staff members are faced with the choice of either having food to eat or a place to stay
---
I am not kidding when I say some of them couldnt even afford the lunch provided by the cafeteria AT the studios office
---
The whole thing is a scam, a lie and a big joke
---
I watch Alrex play. Dude is level 2190 or something crazy. You damned sure can get a level of that guy can. Less whinging. More playing.
---
I have yet to see this perk coin system in game I‚Äôm lvl 103-104
---
One of the kids in that patriotism test sound like kid gohan on DBZ
---
It's nice to be mobile, but occasionally I find spots that hold my attention/camp for a good long while.  I swear one of the devs must have made this spot just for themselves: two resource nodes, two aluminum veins, two silver veins, water, wild silt beans, and I routinely get "visited" by the Flatwoods Monster and Mothman.
---
The weapon stealing glitch was fixed like a week after it started.
---
And no excavator would not increase your ore yield
---
Yea. The GP is a regular weapon that always is able to drop in a legendary version. Doesn't matter if you have the plans or not. Just RNG.
---
I'm lvl 262 and only got 5 or 6 GP drops in my ~900hours of gameplay lol.
---
All sheepsquatch weapons, fixer, bear arms, and all weapons from Wastelanders.
---
Same. I'll usually hang around after the challenges to hunt down my legendaries for scrip if I don't already have enough to hit my 150 turn in. MAYBE if I'm close to the 100 I'll do some dailies otherwise I'm out.
---
for lead: raid the gyms (charleston fire dept, inside vault university, inside the nuking sites, the one north of flatwoods,...), top of monorail elevator is a lot or go to lucky hole mine with the exec PA.  
---
but most important, as you dont mention it: use super duper rank 3 perk while crafting. 30% chance to double the outcome is something you dont want to miss.
---
So you condone exploiting, good to know.
---
You don't get to 2190 or something without abusing major XP exploits in this game.
---
i did that for the first 6 months or so, then i found my current home and loved my build there so much is become permanent. i just can't imagine a better spot, i feel cozy and safe there.
---
Have the headaches stopped?
---
I agree, it's quite strange. Especially in Fallout 4 when it's based after Fallout 76, you'd think to see a lot more information about Appalachia in Fallout 4 since the BoS thought Appalachia was a big enough deal to go all the way to there.
---
I feel as if Bethesda isn't very good lore-wise.
---
Medics doesn't work.
---
Yeah fixed. By Bethesda. I didn‚Äôt wanna take any chances. So how do I get more ore?
---
Having more than one person helps you to complete the event in a timely fashion. I don't think 1 person will get 100 ore spawn.
---
Absolutey amazing! Very well done!
---
I found out that Brahmin do not like high places and will walk through walls and fall to their death. Do you keep your Brahmin high off the ground?
---
Oh I 100% understand and agree that that could be the case - in fact I struggle with it myself, especially in certain avenues of my life. But neither of us can say that is the case, as they didn't state it. Maybe it is, maybe not. 
---
But when there are dozens of posts, comments, and complaints very similar every day, its safe to assume its not for a lot of them and it gets tiring and frustrating to see for a lot of people. 
---
Its a good thing, in the cases where that IS the reason, to step away from the game. But it then becomes a personal problem/choice - so then to post about it online just seems odd to me. That then makes it seem like another complain post that points the finger at bethesda/the pass itself. (Not that we technically shouldn't point the finger at Beth, as we all know, but the pass isn't too bad.)
---
To my knowledge, perk coins will not be purchasable with real world money, so this doesn't apply here.
---
Rad Rats with frickin laser beams...is that too much to ask?
---
So the ore spawns individually for everyone to collect?
---
Couldn‚Äôt say it better myself. I‚Äôve heard that Todd originally wanted 76 to evolve more like the survival mode and less like the 76 we know today, with a more brutal pvp aspect. I, for one, am thankful we got it as is, but OP should consider just how much pvp could have been in this game..
---
You should look into the Lucky Hole Mine lead farming video that Angry Turtle has up on YouTube. If you use the Excavator power armor, you can walk away with an absurd amount of lead ore that, with a little bit of acid at the chem station, will let you craft more ammo than you could possibly need.
---
Depends on the creators at Bethesda; a lot of them don't really have the creative skills which Black Isles Studios had. Thats why The Outer Worlds was so great to play (felt like the original Fallout series).
---
I keep getting base ones lol. Thats a horrible rng rate. I wish they'd implement places to farm certain weapons
---
I would like to see more mods for double barrel shotguns. Let us add a third barrel or a slug modification
---
It's not pretty but it's practical. I actually cover this (somewhat) in this video where I make some hidden switches and doors. I would recommend glitching a switch into some prettier objects and just having a part of it stick out (since you only need a small part to be clickable):  
---

---
Fishing so needs to be in the game. I don't even care if we don't catch actual fish, we need it
---
He doesn‚Äôt exploit. He plays a lot. He server hops and farms exp mob grinding routes. You should look him up. That would be more beneficial than sitting here crying about not being able to level.  Lunchboxes + grouping + bed rest + food gives a big exp bonus. 
---
You‚Äôre sitting here coming up with excuses.
---
Well it was and has been fixed haha. There have been no reports of it happening since the fix was implemented
---
Finding more ore spawns is your only option. Think you need a minimum of 4 people finding all the spawns to get the bar filled. Which sadly doesn't happen often. Most people use it as an xp farm since you get so many ghouls running at you
---
With basic pre-planning, it doesn‚Äôt take that long. Like having a Blueprint that fulfills the Build challenge. 
---
1x1 shack with doors in each wall and a short stairwell at one of them. One decoration on each interior corner and one on an outside wall. A small generator on top with three Construction Lights (along with four turrets) and two lightbulbs inside.  Stack five footlockers in a corner.  
---
The associated costs are very low and usually covered completely by a workshop‚Äôs green budget, even without Contractor equipped. 
---
All that‚Äôs left for that Weekly is the x10 Crops or Water Sources. I‚Äôm still working on a way to get Water Pumps as part of the blueprint, but planting 10 crops is easy enough so I probably won‚Äôt worry about it. 
---
The point is, if you plan ahead just a bit you can greatly minimize the ‚Äògrind‚Äô. Last week I did the Build challenge at Billings Homestead and it took me longer to clear the enemies out than it did to drop the blueprint and harvest/plant 10 Razorgrain. 
---
But I tell you wait; I‚Äôll time myself with the next reset and report back.
---
Why is traveling around that map that big of a deal?  You travel to any one of the multiple train stations, and you can do every thing there minus the gold bullion.  
---
I can see adding the scrip machine at crater and foundation, but I don‚Äôt think the need to remove one of the few cap sinks we have in the game (which seriously doesn‚Äôt even take enough caps out of the economy, what 60 caps per fast travel..that‚Äôs nothing)
---
It‚Äôs not a big deal if you run out into a nuke zone or not. Stop telling people how to do shit, if they launch the nuke they can put it where they want
---
I mostly agree but after they nerfed the WS bots you more or less have to take over workshops for fusion cores.
---
"A level gazillion" lol I was taking down level 80+ players on a level 30 something character.
---
Also. You motherfucker. There used to be tons more PvP mechanics in the game, like slap damage, until you foodies bitched and whined so it got nerfed. So be happy I can't stalk you around the map and kill your bitch ass. Cause I would if I could. 
---
Workshops are the last true, consistent source of PvP. Sorry not sorry you suck at farming junk and can't read the "this opens you up to pvp" warning when you take a workshop.
---
Have you seen what happens to the mutant hounds when they get hit by scorchbeasts?
---
More to the point. Spread out. 
---
The queen wants to land on a melee target after her circling animation. 
---
When she hovers she will take damage from multiple directions. She will change who she agros on several times. Once she is finished.... * Please take note of this * She will fly directly forward and begin a circling arc animation. When she completes this animation  she will want a player underneath her to land on. If her altitude is too low she won't want to land. If everyone is out of range she will initiate a fart attack. That will likely put her well out of range again meaning that she will repeat fart attacks over and over.
---
Get under her when she finishes her circling move and is at high altitude. 
---
And FFS stop staggering her.
---
The reason we want people to get off the fences is becuase the fence is one square of the chessboard. We need people to cover more squares on the chessboard.
---
Diseased Protectron Guardian...
---
I can't take credit for that, I was doing clusters of powered speakers on rugs and using that as a method to glitch the wires through the wall.
---
If two people collect ores you can make it to 100 AND when all scavenger are kept alive you may get rare rewards (hazmat suite and barrel plan). But people are too lazy and too incompetent so most of the time they are just there to kill ghouls to get some xp and maybe a couple of low level scrip legendaries.
---
That's US Style Chicken coops for you: [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/17/us-chickens-literally-sitting-in-each-others-waste-says-rspca-brexit](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/17/us-chickens-literally-sitting-in-each-others-waste-says-rspca-brexit)
---
All I hear is whining.  I for one am happy that it might actually become difficult to kill enemies (new mutated ones), and having a duped/hacked/eBay weapon won't change that.
---
Yea some kind of dedicated loot/drops would be nice. But this is a RNG only game when it comes to drops or rolling weapons at the purveyor / workbench haha
---
I do wish we had more survival aspects to the game, but not the PVP side.  I constantly mod my FO4 &amp; Skyrim with survival modes.  It just makes finding those fancy lad snack cakes and cheese wheels feel like something valuable, other than something to flood my home with.
---
You never know... I feel like Fallout 76 could use a bit more lore and excitement anyways, it's a bit stale. The thing that got New Vegas and all the other Fallout games known wasn't just their gameplay but their lore as well.   
---
I hope Bethesda's "big plans" for 76 in the future are as good as they say they are.
---
Indeed it would be Nice. Cause the adventure servers were so much better without all the pvp tryharders
---
Mutated human/ cyborg who looked like an octopus from Fallout 1. Created those lovely super mutants which frolic across the Wasteland.
---
Yes it‚Äôs right beside military, which I do not at all know from playing NW.
---
Not my point, smh
---
Do you have punji boards in your camp? Because that might be why people keep murdering your Brahmin
---
Sorry you were at 76 upvotes and i ruined it being the 77th but great post!
---
Stash size increased within days after the BETA ended. Bugs have been reduced significantly since BETA (still more to go, however). Server stability has improved. 
---
I never saw anyone say ‚Äòit will all be working perfectly in the release build‚Äô. At least, not Bethesda or any competent third-party.
---
Thank you oh holy mega sloth. I hope you have a wonderful day,
---
Xbox
---
So are there just the four corridors to grab the ore from?  I think I got 46 or something in total. But didn‚Äôt start for maybe two minutes because I didn‚Äôt know what to do and was blasting ghouls
---
You can frequently get them from the BOS tagged events, full ones even.  Or just craft them,
---
StOp TeLliNg PeOpLe HoW tO pLaY. Calm down, if telling people the event activates like the sbq event eliminates a mile wide nuke zone, I‚Äôm ok with that. Some people don‚Äôt know it activates like sbq. When was the last time you enjoyed the sbq event running around in a nuke zone. Off this post if you‚Äôre going to whine good sir
---
What a god
---
&gt;AND DON'T MAKE THIS A FALLOUT FIRST THING.
---
But please make scrapbox account wide.
---
I also play alot, and I am not making excuses. You are embracing XP exploiting and the worst gameplay loop ever described as a way to sidestep a system that needs tweaking.
---
And no shit all those things give you an XP buff, I use all of them daily.
---
As someone using pistols, how are you fairing? I am thinking of starting a new character with a pistol, vats build
---
grab 3 tunnels worth. deposit after the first 2 and you should have 18-20 (may have missed a couple) Then grab a 3rd tunnel but DO NOT put the ore in until there's 1 minute left. You will have enough for rank 1 of the rewards which is better than nothing.
---
IF nobody else is grabbing ore then just go back and defend those NPCs. best thing to do is just camp on the one on the raised platform in the middle. IF someone else is grabbing ore and NPCs are being looked after then grab the 4th tunnel. after a few mins go back to the first tunnels you did and grab what you can. I have done this probably 100+ times easily and most of the time nobody gets ore and nobody looks after the npcs. It's balls! And if i go for the ore nobody heals the npcs and if i heal the npcs nobody goes for the ore. BALLS!
---
If you have some charisma slap friendly fire on and use a shishkebab to heal the NPCs. even just 1 point in FF is enough to get them some health.
---
I'm so confused about all the jazz I hear about fighting the queen. So I try it solo and it doesn't always add up. 
---
I use Tank killer perk and a BE25 fixer. I only stay on the ground (no fence or tent) and I unload on her in the air. I see the stager effect animation (I think I do?) And she still lands all the time so long as I'm not hidden. I don't think anyone really has this figured out. But that's just my experience. 
---
Definitely easier on the ground.
---
Ahhh, didn't even think of that perk, thanks
---
I have been wanting this for so long! I have tons of great pictures the world needs to see haha.
---
Watch out. It can fail and you will lose stuff. I've seen a few posts around here claiming they lost items doing that.
---
Ah if you were pc I end up giving away 45 I pick up
---
Balancing and breaking are 2 different things. There‚Äôs no reasonable logic for why you would sacrifice 95% of your health for a 70% boost. That‚Äôs a 5/3rds boosts for a 1/20th penalty
---
It helps them on Saturday and Sunday. And if they start playing before noon ET on Saturday, that‚Äôs potentially three sets of dailies that helps them.
---
Haha, well you need to be taking more credit for bringing something so creative into the game. I feel like I"m playing a very different game... I don't think I've even used a power speaker before. 
---
Oh well, back to shooting squirrels.
---
I‚Äôm not so sure it‚Äôs the ‚Äúpseudo damage‚Äù or instead your teammates in your group doing damage when itsuncloaked
---
This is a good one, last time I did lucky hole mine I ended up with 1000 lead after processing. Thank god for super duper!
---
People know. If they know how to even launch a nuke, they can use 2 brain cells to figure out it doesn‚Äôt have to be a direct hit
---
This is exactly correct.  If execs and ownership cared, they'd hire in a few experienced folks from elsewhere to make changes, or make internal moves.
---
A leadership change can right a pretty fucked up ship - look at how much Diablo 3 improved after moving Jay Wilson's incompetent ass out of the lead position.
---
Max special is 100.
---
Go here and Defend twice, then hunt a specific group, followed by a boss. You don't have to kill everything, but you're going to have a hell of a time avoiding them if you're going bloody. Good luck!
---
Plus, it‚Äôs not like this is a PSA that it doesn‚Äôt have to be direct, in the title, you‚Äôre literally telling them DO NOT hit it directly
---
Yes four tunnels total. If you start grabbing ores right from the start, another person does the same, you can do a second trip after the ores respawn and make 100.
---
So many bugs around workshops right now!
---
* Sometimes a workshop will show up as unowned until you travel to it, then after spending the caps it turns out it is already claimed.
---
* Sometimes it will not show on the map as a workshop (but will have a different icon instead) but as a side benefit you can fast travel to it.  Still claimable though.
---
* Sometimes you can't fast travel to a workshop even though it says it's claimed by you.
---
Wow did not know that thank you
---
Never said it was. Just said I'd love to spend more time in CAMPs be those mine or other's.
---
Ok there‚Äôs people to protect?  Are they the ones on the computer terminals or whatever
---
I have it on the Bethesda launcher so swing your in game name and discord. I‚Äôm just shy of level 100 but always willing to help somebody who is new to the game.
---
No punji boards, my camp is set out to pretty much be a plan store, I sell my plans under 10 caps regardless of value to try and help out other players who love building camps as much as I do, so I honestly don't know why people kill  tessie. :(
---
&lt;This got out of hand, sorry&gt;
---
It's not entirely clear how much communications bandwidth they actually had with their Eastern counterparts.  It was obviously cut off before the final catastrophe that was Operation Touchdown.
---
In other words, they have no idea how it turned out and what, if anyone, is waiting for them at the end of the journey.  Given that, it's reasonable for them to select a different destination for their initial arrival.
---
We also don't actually know how they are getting here.  Unless I've missed something, all we know is that they are "en route."  Crossing 2k to 3k miles of devastated wasteland is...problematic at best.
---
I'd prefer traveling by air (plus it's the standard way the BOS arrives on the east coast) but given that even at 250 mph it's only a 10 to 12 hour trip (depending on flight range, refueling, rest stops, etc.) so if they have been on their way as long as they appear to have been...doesn't seem like they are flying.
---
Train?  In the real world nuclear targets were chosen to maximize the damage to the enemy transportation and supply infrastructure so I'm betting getting a train all the way from the west to the east without basically laying a new railroad as they go isn't practical.
---
Drive?  As above, with major cities having been destroyed, the interstate highway system is going to be a mess.  If they had good maps, scouted carefully and didn't actually turn up anything awful (this is Fallout, anything from city sized monsters, alien invasion forces, supernatural monsters drawn to all the death, Chinese armies, rogue AIs with robot armies, the mind boggles) they might make it by using secondary roads.  Would take the "as the crow flies" distance and multiply it, plus being slower than planes or trains.  Might work.
---
By ship?  To West Virginia?  Even if the BOS had access to a ship, there's no telling the state of the Panama Canal, if it even exists in Fallout,  They might have to sail around South America and then back up and THEN travel overland quite a ways.  Sailing up a river might be doable if they had a river capable craft...and they rivers weren't blocked and their channels were still in the same places...  Hard pass.
---
On foot?  March 2500+ miles, through everything mentioned above, on foot, even in power armor...  If they could maintain an average pace of five miles per hour, eight hours a day, it would take over two months.  And that assumes they don't run into anything that they either can't handle at all or lose significant time/resources getting around.  Possible, but fairly absurd :(
---
And then there is the question of "why are they coming?"  If it's to finish the fight with the Scorched, they better be bringing a LOT of guys.  Given what they knew of the situation when communication was cut they have to assume that a) Operation Touchdown worked and all is well or b) it failed and it's up to them to stop this plague before it kills everyone on earth.  Given that they'd have to be fools to believe a) I can only assume they are coming in force, i.e. everything (or most everything) they've got.
---
Of course historically we know they didn't come in force, with everything they had, because there are still sizable BOS forces out west 150-200 years after the war.  Further there appear to be messages from the West Coast bunch to the expeditionary force, further reinforcing the notion that it's a contingent of the BOS, not the whole thing.
---
So, if they aren't coming to finish the Scorched...what ARE they coming to do?
---
Cool, I'll try it out next time I'm on
---
They gave us server hopping for a reason. 
---
The mob grinding loop is the main core mechanic in FO76.  Doing the route let‚Äôs you kill 12 + legendary mobs. 
---
You go on and struggle bus it bro if you want. Not everyone is meant to finish the legendary run. It will be alright at the end of the day.
---
Applause to you for taking the pylons.  So many don't, partly for the reasons you point out.
---
It‚Äôs like, what, 5 minutes tops to make a stop at a station. You still have plenty of time to just sit around and do whatever.  Camps are already pretty useful, far more useful than they used too.
---
The maximum amount of XP you can get from a single kill is 4000xp. The maximum amount from completing a quest/event is 6000xp
---
Why is the quad untouched by the nerf. I thought it was the way the damage multipliers stacked. Like adrenal reaction and nerd rage not the actual weapon perks?
---
It's the same thing with Class Freak. It's just a visual bug. It's still working properly.
---
I think some things broke in the pipboy when they fixed the collections tab.
---
Ok.  But follow up does it actually mean I am getting plus 200% percent experience when I kill a super mutant?
---
Reupload to Youtube if you want anyone to watch that video. I aint gonna make an account for that.
---
The solution is for them to just let the modding community fix the game.
---
It's very baffling how alt-unfriendly 76 is, and how updates have only made the problem even worse.
---
You can do damage with a Tesla rifle by shooting the ground near the ISS. I used to do it to get some damage in before the pylons were active.
---
As long as my brahmin is alive and well after you finish then go crazy. üòÅ
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of games with structures to encourage you to log in daily, and some that see to penalize your progress if you don‚Äôt. 
---
I don‚Äôt see any ‚Äòpenalty to progress‚Äô for not logging in daily to FO76. Just some potential missed aesthetics. 
---
My wife is out of town for a few days so I had to log on to her account to snag the Halloween and Winter vending machine skins for her. But if she hadn‚Äôt gotten them, she would have been just fine.
---
Yes, that's what happens when someone leaves a server -- things they built at a workshop stay there.  I've claimed workshops that people really spent a lot of effort on, putting up barricades, building complete structures, etc.  Workshops do get cleared out, probably when the server recycles, but I have no idea how often that is.
---
And I think it‚Äôs good bloodied is being nerfed, just not to this degree. The amount of hp being sacrificed in the PTS just doesn‚Äôt warrant the dmg gain, especially for a build that requires you have an exact armor, weapon, and perk loadout to be at all useful. It‚Äôs a lot of work for what I think is a build that is now going to be worse than most standard loadouts.
---
You need about 3 people getting ore. There is 40 ore, so 2 people getting ore = 80 + 1 person getting 20, for 100. Ore does slowly come back so 2 people maybe able to rarely do it.
---
What's crazy is there was a keyring in New Vegas and FO3 as well I believe. They removed it with FO4/FO76.
---
Completely agree. I refuse to set up a mule on sheer principle that I should not have to employ a cheesy, unreliable workaround for a basic looter shooter GaaS feature that should already be in the game. A mailbox in camp that allows vaulting of limited number of items for an alt character to retrieve. Database tags said items as account shareable. Doesn‚Äôt have to be an elaborate solution.
---
who the hell is gonna waste resources crafting a ton of gatling lasers just for cores?
---
or even worse, flux. cores are relatively common but outside workshops, farming them in a fixed location can be tricky.
---
I generally will tank all 3. My usual plan is to pick up the pylon closest to the cabin last and jump up to the roof. Don‚Äôt  use jet packs here, with the number of players in one area the game lag will cause your jet pack will send you up 30,000 feet. Anyway jump on the roof spamming stimpacks and tag the imposter long range from up there. Stealth is your friend here, Every Col. Gutsy in WV is gunning for you at that moment. Once I get my tag in I usually try to crouch in between that big yellow thing and the slope of the roof to try for some cover. 
---
That‚Äôs what I do if everything goes right and there‚Äôs not some jerk with a Bloodied TS explosive Gatling plasma one shooting the imposter as soon as I take the 3rd pylon.
---
Struggle Bus? Main Mechanic?
---
Bro stop grinding XP for a bit and talk to some other people, I really think you need to put down the Ayn Rand for a while and talk to your fellow gamers a bit.
---
Is there a bug for _____?  Yes.  Yes there is.
---
Just curious if you ever had the gutsy shooting assaultron laser in sugar grove? I had it few times but have never seen anyone post it.
---
A vendor bot selling basic stuff and buying your loot, like the station protectrons. And as much as I'd like an increase of daily limits I thought of those still having the shared limit.   :)
---
Ore spawns individually for everyone. A tunnel will respawn ore, but only about half, so difficult for one person to get to 100.
---
While you get max rewards for all scavengers alive, and 100 ore, there‚Äôs a range of what folks are hoping to get out of the event, from getting a lot of experience and legendaries, to also getting credit for the event, to be eligible for max rewards.
---
Most of the time I‚Äôm in this event, folks are working towards max.
---
Ah. I‚Äôve never killed another player‚Äôs Brahmin so I didn‚Äôt realize that. 
---
I‚Äôve accidentally disarmed a Bone Chime before, and felt bad about that, lol. I dropped some materials and five Stimpaks as a ‚Äòsorry‚Äô. 
---
I could have used that ‚ÄòSo Sorry‚Äô emote then!
---
For however long you can get the chem, bobblehead and food buffs to work. Usually about 3 minutes.
---
I think i am going to try that. I didn't full dedicate to the shotgun build, so I could go back until I am done with the legendary run at least. I might roll a bloody build and swap out for an alternative gear and weapon set if needed
---
There is no god here, only math.
---
It's real odd given that shared stashes in ARPG type games have been a thing for over a decade. If I remember right  Titan Quest Immortal Throne was one of the first to implement a shared stash to toss items between your alts. Which many games have done since.
---
Don't mind the caps, just wanted to spend more time in CAMPs. They could charge a 5% for all sales, no biggie.
---
62 damage a bullet from a faster fire fixer isn‚Äôt significant?  You empty a clip in 4 seconds so that‚Äôs 1500 less damage every 4 seconds. And that isn‚Äôt right either as I head shot currently for over 2000
---
I found that out too at my old camp at the top of seneca rocks unfortunately. This time my brahmin is at ground level so that anyone who wants to can milk it can do.
---
Im almost positive that‚Äôs true. I haven‚Äôt played either for a while. 
---
But with my wife recently getting into F076, I plan to introduce her to those soon so then I‚Äôll know for sure.
---
But that's only 2 unique items, and doesn't actually slow things down. As /u/LastWeeksFreak stated it's the number of unique items that is slowing you down.
---
I stored all holos except the games in my stash. Lots of misc BS is in my stash as well and everything runs fine for me.
---
Yes. I thought it was at first lol
---
For me, a workshop is unowned on the map, unowned when I am there, not built at all, but after I say I want to claim it, then it is suddenly owned and says I'm contesting it. I can usually exit the perimeter and the owner seems to understand this was unintentional.
---
Yeah, I have been grabbing spare weapons, and Instigating is what I generally look for just now. Before I hopped on the bloody bandwagon for the Int boost, I mostly rolled with instigating, and it generally did the job.
---
Do you mean all attribute together or each on you can buff to 100?
---
I submit that it was never intended to be used the way it's being used. Running around with 90%+ rad damage to prevent your max health from rising above an arbitrary threshold needed to trigger max emergency buffs on different equipment sets.... That just wasn't the design, and everyone knows it. That we've been allowed to get away with it so long doesn't change that; the bloodied build was and is a broken mechanic.
---
Well it was said that brahmin at camps don't drop anythign by the OP but it's all good \^\^ And well let's hope they got there before it de-spawned or somebody else took it
---
one*
---
These glitches do affect you tho because I'm sure you've tried to trade something before because the trade market is crap as a direct result of Bethesda's laziness.
---
Lol... I meant known/common bug I guess.
---
Light step fixes that, just be sceptical of camps. 
---
I dont have a trap camp but I have all the signs of a trap camp except for the stash/scrap box out front. My camp has a Vendor full of 50 odd legendary weapons, a vendor labeled FREE, and it's suspended over a cliff. You have to walk through a Nuka cola machine with a pressure plate on the base. It sets off a buzzer for my non-existing secretary. Almost everyone stops to put on power armor on before going inside. 
---
Just be careful and real trap camps can be fun.
---
there's 4. 1 on the raised bit in the middle. 1 near the rad shower. and i think the other 2 are inside the room with the tinkers table. Easiest to defend is the one in the middle as they are on a raised but and enemies have to go around and up some stairs to get to them. You can sit up high and just murder everything that goes near them. (unless you're melee). They have job titles which you'll see when aiming at them
---
Display assets are held locally, so they would have to push all users pictures to all other users, not going to happen :-)
---
I never joined a party till public teams, and by then, I was lvl100+.
---
If you want to min/max everything, rush through the storyline.
---
I played at my own pace exploring everything and being scared of anything big.
---
I never even looked at builds till I was 70+, I just took perks as they came and picked whatever I needed the most at that time. Is it inefficient, yeah, but I don't regret it. I learned so much playing at my own pace, exploring, reading terminals and notes.
---
If you want to talk to people in game, you can install the chat mod, it enables a global chat for everyone who has the mod installed. Sometimes it's pointless banter, sometimes people event hopping. But if you are stuck on something or need help, people on the chat mod are generally helpful.
---
Feel free to add me if you want, same name in game, just no underscore.
---
I just wish fo4 quests were more interesting. Maybe I should look at mods
---
As we saw during Quakecon, the devs mostly run Bloodied. They know what is up with the build.
---
I almost *always* get a shot on the legendary when I'm in a public team where the leader at least is using their mic. 
---
I usually volunteer to be a conduit and the leader is pretty sharp about shouting "there's the bastard, make sure you get a shot", or something along those lines. 
---
Then again, I was playing Uranium Fever not too long ago and some overleveled griefer was waiting for every legendary and immediately killing it. Lots of angry gestures. 
---
Bethesda obviously needs to address this, but the people you end up playing with really make the whole experience, imo.
---
My big guns character wears PA so no issue there. Its my Bloodied charactet that might have an issue.
---
Filthy dupers /s
---
A keyring would be awesome!
---
I wouldn't have put it so bluntly, maybe... but yes, I agree. lol
---
Your heart still beating after reading my post? You‚Äôll survive Chief
---
The sad truth... Technical talk haha.
---
Yeah in the end there is almost nothing on the pass that effects gameplay, the ammo converter is super early on the board and will be purchasable with gold. Its not like if you don't finish that you'll miss out on some meta weapon or armor that other passes have.
---
Are you suggesting that 8-20 players isnt a mmo? /s
---
Yeah, you're absolutely still viable but I'd definitely recommend focusing on headshots (concentrated fire 3 ftw) and lean more on an armor set than the CSA
---
Lol little kiddie response.
---
I skimmed past that part apparently. 
---
So all they get is the ‚ÄòJerkMode +1‚Äô Achievement. 
---
At least killing Wanted Players gets you Atoms. Is there an Atom Challenge for killing Brahmin, lol?
---
its got the grind of a mmo without any of the functionality of a mmo
---
No text chat
---
No item transfers
---
etc ...
---
At least let *me* see them! Everyone else can see The Barn or whatnot.
---
I do workshops on privates every once in a while.. but even then, yeah it's resources, but more of a pain in the ass than it's worth tbh.
---
Gotcha, was not sure in the exact numbers. Thank you for the clarification!
---
Harder to craft, but the ArmCo machine spews it out very quickly, like it also does 5.56 and 10mm.  There are some ammo types that are overproduced by it.  This, to me, puts certain weapons at a distinct advantage in that department.
---
Yea i dont usually have issue. I toss on born survivor rank 3 and field surgeon drop my normal stims so all thats left is supers, and equip my ve 10mm . I grab 3 pylons ,tag the imposter and than proceede to shoot the eyebots and gutsys or  whatever i can to keep healing.
---
This last time the lag was ridiculous, and although i had grabbed all 3 pylons and theye were all sparking, the game still said activate pylon 2 , so i went back down to it to try and click it again (wouldnt let me) all of a sudden the pylon said it was activated and at that point I went back up the hill towards the shack the imposter was already dead.
---
Fair, which is why I mentioned I said it like, 'if you happened to have any lying around'. More an off-chance situation if you still have lunchboxes lying around
---
I‚Äôm constantly walking away with cores after doing Distant Thunder, Surface to Air, and Line in the Sand. I wouldn‚Äôt waste resources myself, not when at this point i‚Äôm usually just dropping them on the ground
---
There are pets now?
---
Its cause they released a game they wanted to be a Rust with PvE type of game. But then nobody wanted PvP. So now they've got a Fallout where players want to play it like a MMORPG. They're probably experimenting as they go to figure out what works. 
---
Honestly, to me it doesn't seem that complicated. Quick run down of what reward systems they should do, with most important at the top.
---
1. New Legendary Effects
---
2. Armor/Weapon Skins
---
3. CAMP items
---
4. Perk Cards/Legendary Perk Cards
---
They've been relying heavily on #2 and #3. And when they do implement them, it isn't always a good implementation (Legendary run unreasonable playtime requirements for example. But at least they're offering us option to get some of the key items for gold later on. Or the miner pails). 
---
Then as they get those fleshed out and into systems, they can start working on more advance reward structures
---
1. Building/CAMP locations locked to users with specific achievements or reputation
---
2. "Training" to be able to buy and use new weapon types
---
3. New sources of currency or gold bullion.
---
Just fast travel as soon as you get out, not really a big deal.
---
In theory you could have all SPECIAL attributes be 100. In practice, not so much. Food and chem buffs don‚Äôt stack, and only one bobblehead is active at a time. If you use a chem that buffs intelligence and then one that buffs strength, the one that buffed intelligence will stop working.
---
Um wut?
---
As soon as Zorbo's spaceship (the green spaceship) reaches the end of the board. I believe that is the 8th September.
---
There might be but if you want to do that you could go to spots they actually spawn and kill as many as you want, or make them at your own camp.
---
And well wanted players giving atoms doesn't really help you if they don#t even get wanted for killing your lifestock
---
Go back and review the posts from those bygone days and you will see lots of people claiming that everything would be fixed on release.  Of course if you want to argue that none of those folk were competent I don't have any issue with that :)
---
The bigger thing that may push some to V (already has) is the fix they did to liifegiver, since now you don't get that autoregen of health.  Stims are heavy, so vampires is a good solution. I still prefer my AAFFR combat rifle to my V33 fixer. VFFR might be better. Idk
---
Quad is nice too.
---
455 lead ore my last run over the weekend.
---
My ign is Loooooooser with 7 os.
---
Bruh eat shit, enjoy getting griefed because you refuse to read
---
I like the VE 10mm idea. I know what I‚Äôm going to be looking for in the vending machines later.
---
That's because they do suck at what their doing, my post is calling them and players out. You can keep enabling them if you want to but it's only gonna hurt the franchise long term.
---
Cries in 37 mutants SS 3 star chests on my heavy gunner .. rifleman got it (unyielding) 3rd try :/
---
Depending on your level, high level Scorched can carry short combat rifles that come with 10 .45 shells. Line in the Sand can give you a lot of them.   
---
Glass Cavern and Berkley Springs both have a lot of Scorched that you could farm easily also.
---
I would add two shot if it also has explosive, and quad and vampire on some guns.
---
Hmm don't give him any ideas. Skyrim Pip-Boy edition.
---
You can do this in Ark, so its very possible. But with bethesdas engine.. probably not
---
Yw
---
I don‚Äôt think we have any evidence if it was intended or not, especially seeing as a lot of the devs do specifically that. Seems unlikely they played the entire game just thinking no one was could play that way then so many of them flipped the switch and started doing it.
---
That being said, I think that just warrants why the build has been nerfed way too far. If the devs didn‚Äôt expect players to run below 20%, then the bloodied buff is even less substantial when compared to other generic weapon builds. Why would anyone spend months collecting the perfect armor and weapons when any dmg buffing prefix weapon can boost them nearly the same amount but at full hp and more flexibility in perk loadouts?
---
I mean, I guess the Chicken Coop *might* affect gameplay. But I‚Äôve never been short of fertilizer myself. I may use it for aesthetics for a ‚Äòfarmer‚Äô alt.
---
And unless you just want to waste everything you can only get 150 scrip worth of them every day.
---
Bethesda would just monetize it
---
Gonna use my heavy gunner, emergency protocols is a lifesaver ;)
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree with that more. Of the modern games: 3 really did the brotherhood and enclave right. New vegas did the NCR right. 
---
This game has really treated each faction quite lackluster, in lieu of world building around the plague. The one portion of this game that had awesome lore to me was the enclave. I so hope we see a lot more enclave, it makes sense for this game. The greenbrier is the government fallout shelter, the nukes are here, the secret service is here, it would really be cool to meet the cabinet of the US holed up somewhere, we know they ain‚Äôt in DC!!!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Last_President_of_the_United_States
---
The original game design revolved around workshops being way more important than they are right now. I.e.: they were the only build areas on the map; there was no CAMP mechanic. As the game design evolved, the workshop idea just refused to die, and so now it's a hanger-on with no real purpose beyond the handful of plans you can get from the related take and defend events, all of which are easily obtainable from player vendors now.
---
Nope :(
---
Looking forward to attempting this solo just to see if I can do it. I've been hoarding/crafting lots of 308 and 5 mm ammo. Also, I finally got my main to the point I don't have to use any weight reduction perks which makes room for other offense &amp; defense perks.
---
#truth
---
I am waiting for the price to drop to play it myself.  With two kids you got to wait for sales =)
---
In your opinion it is worth 600.  I still see a ton of those items so it must be worth it to someone.
---
All that's doing is enabling them tho, people need to start speaking up. Y'all act like they don't have employees reading this Reddit.
---
  If you hit almost all of the deposits, Lucky hole mine in excavator will yield about 600 lead ore.
---
I dont remember if smelted ore gives 2 lead or 5 lead, so if you have the acid, you‚Äôll end up with somewhere between 1200 and 3000 lead scrap.  More if super duper procs while you are smelting.
---
I didn't say it wasn't possible, I said it's not going to happen :-)
---
You should tell them on the ots forum like many others.  The system is too grindy x se and if perk coins are character locked,you're just forced to lvl up your main.That means playing unyielding as a must if you don't want to lvl up once a week(i'm talking lvl 600+). 
---
I can't see how having every high level player as unyielding, is in any way a method of adding variety. 
---
Maaaybe if scrapping each card was worth 5 coins,we would have a decent grind.
---
But they had to fix it so we couldn't have double walls! 
---
Priorities. 
---
I know they fixed it so people couldn't crash a server with it, but still, it really got to me that *that* was what they decided to fix.
---
She ain't a little kiddie. Also if you wanna get griefed I'll face you on a level 5 if you prefer. Add Ign Nekrosias. You don't like PvP because you're bad at the game, there's farming runs that can get you more supplies than workshops. Look em up and quit bitching
---
Yeah, with your 1500dmg in 4 secs calculation it feels better. But for the headshots, arent they calculated from base damage too in the pts?
---
If everyone got more for their atoms they would fill their camp budgets faster and ultimately spend less
---
What are some of your favorite random spawn locations?
---
Well, what I meant was some people see killing a Wanted player as ‚Äòbeing a jerk‚Äô, but since it can earn you Atoms (and the ‚Äòvictim‚Äô brought it on themselves) it‚Äôs essentially justified. 
---
If there‚Äôs no reward at all for killing a player‚Äôs Brahmin, then it‚Äôs just being a jerk.
---
Any auto VE will work, im a handgun main so thats why i use the 10mm . I always have two VE25 10mms on me one auto, one  semi auto so i can swap gunslinger and geurilla on the fly. I ALWAYS have a healing weaponnon swap incase thjngs get hairy.
---
The auto VE heals very nicely. Highly recommend grabbing one!
---
Agreed. I only just hit rank 86 yesterday, and will probably hit 87 today - assuming this weekend (20 - 24, Thursday thru Sunday) is Double Dailies like last time, I'm predicting that I should *just* complete the Season no later than next Monday, assuming I don't miss any days. So, that should see me done with two weeks to spare... after having only missed **one** day, completing *every* weekly challenge, all the dailies, and at least half of the NW ones.
---
Now, granted, maybe I *could* be further if I were still playing more - the past couple weeks now all I've been doing is signing in, completing the dailies, then going to play something else - but even when I was still playing more, managing a good 3 - 5 hours every fricking night, the repeatable challenge didn't seem to pop *that* frequently enough to really make a difference. Only possible way I could see being done "legitimately" already would be from going insane grinding.
---
Oh, but that time where yo were a pylon and actually shot the impostor but it kills you with lag, i mean its op laser beam. Then you can't find its corpse and it blows up to oblivion never to be found. Lastly you'll get some ammo and a white wolf fedora. Best event ever.
---
Because people want people to spend more on one item then they would on the whole game and find ways to justify it when there isn't. 
---
Your talking like some one who has disposable income. Sure if someones got the money to waste then it's their choice, but it doesn't change that it's a waste. When you pay for the game you have the game forever as opossed to paying for one item within the game that you could earn just through playing and which at a later stage can be taken from you.
---
The way I see it, I hate cheaters.
---
They are or well they were.  Any time you go back in time for a series it gets rough cause you have to try and remember the future happening stuff.
---
Honestly they should have just set 76 after 4 and kept the time line going forward.
---
Based in the tree house at Alpine Meadows! 
---
"It would've worked if it weren't for those meddling level tens!"
---
No idea. Against the queen I head shot at over 300. Run full bloodied build.
---
That's NOT A SOLUTION, it's not up to us consumers to fix something we're buying from them, they need to sell a finished product.
---
Nothing wrong with some arguing! 
---
The biggest issue with them nerfing is the fact that after over two years and thousands of hours played a certain way, doing certain damage, etc... suddenly you're going to feel a lot weaker. No one that I've ever spoken to has said they play games to feel weak. If they, for instance, were to buff instead of nerf then yes, you're right; it's essentially the same thing. However, current "meta" builds would not feel any less weak and the people who play other builds would feel much stronger.
---
This is talking about if they were to touch only weapons and not enemies. If they buff enemies too then i really see no point in messing with any of it to begin with. Is bloodied too strong? As a bloodied build myself i say yes, it is. When i can solo guard both tunnel entances in Radiation Rumble then there is definitely an issue.
---
It's just about 20 months too late to finally decide to do something about it in my opinion. As i previously mentioned - Start fresh with brand new, challenging content, new and improved gear, and start from there. People will be much more understanding if it takes 6-10 shots to kill a new ghoul than they would killing ghouls they're used to killing in 1-5 shots for the last two years. Newer and harder content would be received much better than tweaking the same old content to make them eat more bullets with no changes otherwise to loot for example.
---
My question to Bethesda is how long do they plan on waiting to release 4 and 5 star stuff? Seriously, this would fix the issues because they could balance the builds out then without hurting/destroying people's builds they worked so hard to get. Id gladly farm new gear even if i spent hundreds of hours getting what i currently have. To me, nerfing after SO long is a big "FU" from Bethesda to the people running these builds and dedicating the time to do so.
---
Even 600 atoms is a stretch, I understand they have to pay designers to make these things but the prices are way to high for what little you get, I have Fallout 1st and use those Atoms and any Atoms I earn through challenges and Legendary Run but I could never bring myself to purchase an Atom pack
---
All cheats. I don't like cheaters.
---
well yeah I mean there is a reason tehy are wanted... and it's not like they can get rid of it without being killed by a player so it's more of a help than anything.
---
Killing brahmin at camps is just a dick move.
---
Another solution is have a full squad and take all 3 power plants and defend your stuff. Should get you more than enough fusion cores. Or if even one of you guys have fallout first
---
Perhaps they were competent *trolls*. 
---
I‚Äôve played Bethesda games for many years and Fallout for over 20 years.  I had no illusions that it would be a ‚Äòperfect‚Äô release. 
---
It‚Äôs gotten better but has a long way to go.
---
Got it!  Having one of the train station vendor bots installed in your camp.
---
Ppl can take stuff out of your vendor via a glitch. Happened on ps4, possible on other platforms
---
They not stored as two there stored individual so they all have a separate line don't know if this matters. I literally have a hundred separate line saying hornwright key Alpha and beta..  I will do as you both had suggested and try putting them Into the stash but does this not slow my stash inventory. Still it can't be doing the server load any good having all the extra
---
Dont buy anything. Just redeem free items. Tons of items ingame.
---
Crossbow plan can be found on a table at the archery range at the 'swarm of suiters' scout camp.
---
My entire time playing 76, (over 700 hours) I have had my workshop contested I think 3 times.
---
It just doesn't happen. So i wouldn't worry about it, its extremely rare.
---
 Just because you can be a dick in the game and take someone's workshop, doesn't mean you have to.  Fortunately the vast majority of people playing agree.
---
The bug with pipe revolvers was fixed several patches ago. In addition, the cards only go to 20% each, for a max of a 60% bonus.
---
And yes, it wouldn‚Äôt add very much to the weapon, but the main point is to give shotgun builds some diversity in ammo types and weapon choices, not create something exceptionally powerful.
---
Your point seems to be well hidden amongst all that whiney bitching about workshop pvp then.
---
Only √≠tem you have on sale?
---
Most legendary run items go to your camp build menu.   
---
  Some will go to armor/weapons mods menu at the appropriate workbench.
---
   A few (caps, atoms, bullion) go to their respective lines in the pip boy.
---
camp plans can be bought from player, NPC, and bot vendors, completing events, and taking over workshops.
---
They only boost the Condition, not Durability.
---
Well, say you're a FO76 dev- I know, I know, you have eyes and ears and think and feel like a real person, but for a moment imagine you are one of the automatons that puts skins in the game without testing them, or makes unannounced changes or nerfs things that are fun.
---
So you've come up with this legendary perk system, and you want higher level players to be more rewarded right? I mean you're looking at some of the levels on some of these players and they are in the literal thousands (by xp exploit or not) so you have to cater to them somehow.
---
But you also cannot leave out the little guy. That level 45 dude that does log in and play some times, and even bought fallout 1st so he can play on his own private server and do workshops without level 584 people coming in and blasting his ass into space dust. Can't leave that guy hanging, so you can't make the perks *that* good, otherwise that person might start screeching about having to grind out a bunch of levels outside their pace so they can get the special perks.
---
So you go to balance, well things can't be *too* powerful because of the little guy who will never crest level 200, but they also can't be worthless otherwise the big players won't care either and not engage with the system. So you have to make *everything* lukewarm. Nothing can be OP but nothing can be P. Just.....bland. Minor impact, but it *looks* like you've done something. Hell, you got a coin thing! and a new perk! Woo!
---
As someone who has played WoW during Legion and BFA, this sounds like an even shittier grind than WoW, which is *fucking saying something.* These last two expansions have featured infinite grinds for player power at tiny incremental levels, and it is endlessly frustrating. You'll *never* reach your peak power, you'll *never* finish the grind, and that is by design. You finish the grind, you log off, you might not log back on. Maybe to come on and pwn some noobs, but your engagement drops off.
---
So you make every perk an infinite, unattainable grind, and you make them bland and not impactful, but also impactful enough so that people will *notice* them but not notice them doing basically nothing. Luckily there are no DPS meters as far as I've seen.
---
FO76 has been an interesting experiment, but they need to turn over the keys to the players. They need to unleash mod support and *REAL* private servers that people can play on and host themselves, and they need to just let the community run wild. Can you imagine what this game would be like if players could purchase and run their own servers? With their own drop-rates, their own additions or alterations to the map, added NPCs and unique items, fixed bugs, loosened storage space rules, bigger camp size. Fallout 76 has the potential to be one of the greatest multiplayer games of all time, if the developer would just fucking let go and realize they fucking suck at supporting the community and making content that does anything other than try to squeeze a few more dollars out of you.
---
I mean, they probably looked at the random SCORE losses and figured, hell, means more people will buy atoms to level! LOL!
---
I tried, I really did. I tried to like this game as it is and support it in the hopes that they would take off the fucking leash and let people make their own servers with mods and adjusted settings, but I was wrong. They do not intend to, and never will, open the game up like that. Even after they end support for it, I would be willing to bet they just fucking drop it, tell everyone "we're sorry" and give any angry players a discount on purchasing Fallout 5, where they expect there to be a "new and improved" multiplayer mode, from the team that brought you Fallout 76!!!!! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
And from me please x
---
Hmm, this would be very interesting to know. I play B33 Commando, always aiming for the heads. If the headshot damage and perhaps even the sneak damage will be calculated from your full dmg output in the pts (and 300 on the queen seems as it does) and not from the base damage, my posting is compete bullshit, then the 62 will count and the meta wont change and I'm happy again. :) This would be so good. :)
---
EDIT: Just traded in a VE250 Handmade just in case. :)
---
I mean, if damage modifiers are now additive, a bloody build can still potentially crank out  quite a large amount of damage. The base damage for a gauss minigun with Tribarrel and capacitor is about 63 damage per shot.
---
Assuming you run at 19% health:
---
\+60% damage for heavy weapons perks= = +38
---
\+50% damage for adrenal reaction = +32
---
\+80% damage for bloodied weapon = +50
---
\+20% damage for Nerd Rage = +13
---
\+25% damage for Psychotats = +16
---
\+15% damage for Ballistic Bock =  +10
---
\+ 50% explosive damage from Demolitions = (I have no idea what fraction of the damage is explosive, so not sure how much it will be) ?
---
= 222 damage + explosive damage bonus.
---
222+ damage per shot on a high rate of fire weapon like a minigun is nothing to scoff at.
---
Also the 'Silly walk' one.. i don't remember the actually name
---
I've had this problem and wasted caps on travel only to arrive in a claimed workshop.  Yesterday it happened and it turned out to be a teammate who owned it.  I didn't realize it, of course, until I went to the workbench to claim it and was given the option to build.  Anyhow, I learned you can then build anything you like as if you owned it.  I spent the next while testing it by jumping teams, it didn't work every time but I would say there was about a 75% rate it did.  The one thing I noticed was when it did I first had to clear out enemies that were there.
---
Also add a bunch of random ppl to join back to same server
---
Totally just took the opportunity to slight the ‚Äúcreation‚Äù engine
---
He reminds me of the Butler from Hunter x Hunter
---
Wow, somebody is overly aggressive......
---
this has been a topic for discussion ever since the game came out and the people noticed the atom shop prices for the first time.  The idea that lower price = more revenue has been suggested many times in the past.
---
But the reality is that prices hasnt really changed that much even though smaller adjustments can be found.  This seems to indicate  that people are buying at current prices .  Maybe Bethesda could sell even more with lower prices - who knows .  But bethesda themselves doesnt seem to think so - otherwise i would assume they would have changed thier pricing strategy.
---
Agreed.  Even if it did grant loot or xp, just go to Flatwoods if that‚Äôs what you need to do. 
---
Unless that player can‚Äôt even handle the challenge of ‚ÄòWild Brahmin‚Äô...
---
Yeah I just figured this out today üòÜ.
---
That would be far too straightforward and logical! :-D But yes, anything that makes it more worthwhile for the XP farmers to do the event properly instead of farming the ghoul waves would do wonders for the success rate of the event.
---
But as I said before, Bethesda is not really good at thinking through the incentive structures in this game.
---
I agree. Considering that they release 'bundles' every week, you would have spend at least 40 dollars/ 28 pounds/ 32 euros a month (on top of the Fallout 1st membership). I
---
I'm not saying that they should give items away for free but Bethesda installing a reasonable 'atom price' for items (following consultation with its players) would encourage a healthy 'atom market' (which can then be put back into games development).
---
They haven‚Äôt nerfed the bloodied perk. They‚Äôve nerfed the way damage stacks. So a strong bloodied build will still outperform everything else just will do less damage. But so will everything else. If u follow.
---
Happy cake day. You dropped this king üëë
---
No it did not, I want to get my gear by myself. That's why it doesn't really affect me. I also never once used the trade function IG.
---
I‚Äôm a heavy guns build but I like having an explosive handgun in my load out so I can tag the mobs in events and not one shot them and take xp from every one else. I started doing that after I accidentally one shot the sheepsquach in home range with my brand new gauss mini gun.
---
We for sure need an account shared space for transferring stuff between alts!
---
Slow day at the office eh?   Me too.
---
I think it was the multipliers and the legendary effects that were both switched from multiplicative to additive. So the adrenal and nerd rage effects everything equally, so everything was nerfed. But bloodied was effected by those and the bloodied multiplier so the drop was bigger. I am not an expert on the change itself or the old calculation so my numbers are more theoretical based on the assumption that all were multiplicative before and all are now additive.
---
Look at 100 base damage, Bloodied, Adrenal, Nerd, Bloody Mess, Weapon Perks.
---
Old 100 x 1.95 x 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.15 x 1.6 = 646.
---
New 100 x (1 + .95 + .5 + .2 + .15 + .6) = 340.
---
Quad low health
---
Old 100 x 1.0 x 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.15 x 1.6 = 331.
---
New 100 x (1 + 0 + .5 + .2 + .15 + .6) = 245.
---
Quad high health
---
Old 100 x 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.15 x 1.6 = 184.
---
New 100 x (1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + .15 + .6) = 175.
---
If there are lots of people who are tired and frustrated by encountering fellow human beings with views and opinions different from theirs...well, it doesn't bode well for us as a species. 
---
As for the game pass not being too bad...I can agree with that to a point.  I mean I am getting a fairly steady supply of atoms, caps, script, skins, items, etc. for basically doing what I was doing anyway, so that's nice.
---
On the other hand, I worry that they hadn't actually done the math on the thing.  Early posts warned that completing the pass weren't even mathematically possible without completing every single challenge, every single day and week, without additional exp grinding.  On top of that, there is a persistent bug that makes actually earning all the score impossible for a lot of people as some of the challenges auto complete.
---
Now it's possible that they always intended to add "double score" events or more challenges as time went on.  It's also possible that they just didn't even KNOW that it wasn't possible.  They clearly had some similar issues with the current BOS resource collection event after all.
---
Finally, perhaps they DID know and just hoped that their player base wouldn't...and that they only way to succeed would be to buy steps for money...I mean if you want to paint Bethesda as Machiavellian masterminds.  From experience with them I am leaning toward the "didn't do the math" option.
---
Still, I have seen far worse systems.
---
Would a tse tommy gun or 10mm be any good or a anti-armor ffr gatling?
---
Twice actually. It‚Äôll come back for sure, it‚Äôs popular
---
A real cool idea, a cool way to be remembered.
---
You mentioned playing on xbox, if you need someone to drop pieces in your camp that you might not have plans for, let me know. I have most of the vanilla game plans, and I wouldn't mind dropping them for you to place where you like. There's a lot of cool benches and lights that you might be able to detail with if you like. If you decide you want something, just send me a PM with your GT, I'd be happy to lend a hand, obviously at no charge.
---
And thank you for the information.
---
I think the fake sales on things exasperate this too
---
Doesn't necessarily mean its worth it; people want it and reluctantly agree to pay the price because no one makes a stand against it.
---
I'm not saying that they should give items away for free but their prices should be based on consultation with its players.
---
That's totally bullshit but okay
---
I have over 700 overseer tickets and can't do anything with them because nuclear winter is always overlooked for adding new content because someone figures out a new exploit every week and they are having to spend their time fixing that.. It would be nice if we could get a new map at least
---
22 days

https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html
---
Yesterday 1 second, 22 second way to slow;) (didn't bother to see the video) We where several melee character doing more then 10k damage I managed to get in two punches and she was dead, that was fun.
---
At the very least, and this applies to a lot of the QOL things they don‚Äôt do ingame I want to know why they haven‚Äôt and are not.
---
I run X-01 Power Armor and use Rad-X Diluted ( to not lose my mutations) and after finishing gathering all the ore nodes in one section I hop into the decontamination shower to get rid of the rads.
---
I tried using Excavator Armor to increase the yield but it doesn't work on this event.
---
Where one violent night takes place
---
Yep. For the next 2 hours I don't have much to do, and then it's rush rush rush.
---
Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.
---
I think they just really, really WANTED the game to be perfect and just couldn't accept that that was never, ever, going to happen (to this game, any game or anything else for that matter).
---
Money earned from working can be exchanged for goods and services (such as atoms).
---
"enabling" LOL

I get what your saying, but that only holds true if you give value to others.    
---
Meaning,  ALL duping in the game has impacted my game ZERO.  I'm around lvl 250.  I could care less what others have.  What others have doesn't impact in any way.   If everyone has a Bloodied Handmade, I don't see how that impacts anyone.  I personally, have never duped, nor do I intend.  I merely play the game and enjoy it.   
---
 If I worked really long/hard/grind for something, like my fully buttressed SS, I'm happy and proud of it.  But if I see everyone wearing it, it doesn't diminish how I feel about myself and my accomplishments. 
---
Just don't let what others do, impact how you view yourself, and you'll have fun without the drama/stress.
---
Wicked Smaht
---
They were infused with rare material named howardium-76, they can do whatever they want.
---
You don't.if there aren't at least 2-3 people grabbing ores,the event will not reach max rewards.
---
West Virginia would be full of dick pics, no thanks.
---
Right but your assuming a base of 100 for quad and for bloodied. It‚Äôs simply not. There‚Äôs no damage perk on a quad. I‚Äôd wait for it to actually go live. As we‚Äôve seen countless times over countless games. What‚Äôs in a Beta or test server rarely makes to game unchanged if at all
---
Eh free fast travel to parts of the map i dont go often. Used to take them all the time for supplies but where i am now in the game ive got all i need. If anything i take them for the defend events hoping for Wave 1/4s which in the Mire and Bog at least give you max lvl enemies for that sweet sweet XP
---
Haven‚Äôt watched any of his vids yet, is he the outrage guy?
---
Well red pulls you out of defensive for missions that need it and puts you back in when they‚Äôre over so it‚Äôs doable
---
Sons of Danes compound. I'm pretty sure
---
I think they could actually make a lot more money if the items where much cheaper, say like a dollar or 2, more players would be likely to spend even just 2 to 5 dollars per month than a smaller amount of players spending 40 or 50 dollars.
---
5 lead.  Usually a Lucky mine run yields 1200-1400 lead for me.  I check everywhere too, including the secret passage behind the vines.  
---
Then use ammo smith level 2 and super duper level 3.  Chemist for smelting.
---
You aren‚Äôt paying enough
---
Thats certainly one way around it. 
---
Although, without any investment, the game will not receive any new developments (like the new seasons). I think there should be consultation between players and Bethesda around pricing and what should be considered 'reasonable'.
---
She
---
You get what you pay for
---
I‚Äôm just gonna keep server hopping until I find it there
---
agreed! i got atoms to spend
---
Some scorched also carry death tambos
---
What do you mean by fake sales?
---
To play?  A lot of people‚Äôs camps have them.
---
My point is everyone has a number yours is less tha 600 mine is higher.  They are selling them so why would they change?  Customers already set the price by buying or not buying.  The customer has shown the $12 for 1st is a great deal and $12 dollars for a bugged PA skin is worth it.
---
yep- just got my fallout 1st atoms and there's literally nothing i want
---
No the weapons
---
Sons of Dane Compound - Death Tambo, Guitar Sword, or whatever that drum hammer is called.
---
I find a number of Scorched also have Death Tambos on them.
---
There is a level 15 guitar sword near the vault just to the right at a house, at the back near a fireplace leaning against the door. PM me if you still looking and I can try help with the exact location
---
Bummer. If it‚Äôs so amazing he can just change his build though.
---
&gt;Meaning,  ALL duping in the game has impacted my game ZERO.  I'm around lvl 250.  I could care less what others have.  What others have doesn't impact in any way.   If everyone has a Bloodied Handmade, I don't see how that impacts anyone. 
---
Duping and cheating affects game-play development.  Why do you think we got an entire wastelanders update where all of the new gear is character locked?  Because of real-money trading/duping etc.  It affects everyone.
---
Is a known bug, it should be fixed in an upcoming patch
---
My b2525 assault rifle just decided to stop displaying itself a week or two ago.
---
You are very, very wrong. Pipe revolvers still double dip in rifleman and gunslinger perks. Mine is kicking out 400+ damage.
---
Adding more shotguns makes it more diverse. I suppose they could add cooler mods to shotguns, like slug pellets and a third barrel for double barrels
---
Thought the patchnotes earlier this month mentioned a fix on that.
---
Guess it was just a hoax.
---
Perhaps. But I find most angry people on the internet about games is just simply that - angry, and want others to be too. I've seen it time and time again. Can't let others have fun. Not saying OP is one.
---
And I agree, probably didn't do the math tbh. At least they are trying. Sure hope they make S2 easier to level like they said. 
---
I actually didn't know there was such a bug (but I'm not at all surprised.) I'll have to look into that.
---
Whew! Okay.
---
I don‚Äôt think this particular bug is a year old. Either way it‚Äôs supposed to be patched tomorrow.
---
He ain't even got legs
---
You can find a Guitar Sword at Striker Row, propped up on the stage.
---
You can find a Wardum on the second floor of the Top of the World (and sometimes at the Sons of Dane Compound...all of the musical weapons can spawn there so give it a shot).
---
It could go for any MMO, too
---
That is honestly a very valid point. I was really just looking at it from a vendor or trader standpoint. I myself don't have a Bloodied Handmade, as I'm a Shotgun build, but if I see a bunch of players with the same weapon as me, most times I think nothing of it. I know how long it took me to get my hands on one, and I enjoy the reward to my grind. Thanks for the input üëç
---
Well apparently it used to be 3 blood samples. Now it‚Äôs one and it still doesn‚Äôt work 100% :‚Äô)
---
I‚Äôve stopped playing it and it‚Äôs sad because although it wasn‚Äôt Bethesda best game I was enjoying it....until I hit that crappy bug.
---
This makes sense I guess. I still don‚Äôt understand so much of this game, but it‚Äôs entertaining enough to keep me playing.
---
Can you explain how legendary mods work? None of the online articles make any sense. Can I add legendary effects to 3-star items making them 4 or 5 stars? What are the rules? Is there a crafting station I need to unlock? Should I keep items with good 1-star effect‚Äôs so I can eventually add more stars? Is there a reason to keep items without legendary effects? Is there such a thing as legendary power armor?
---
Meanwhile here‚Äôs me with no caps and no bloodied handmade.
---
Blind Optimism, basically. I can understand that. 
---
I‚Äôve learned to be more cautious in my optimism and prepare for adversity, in general. It‚Äôs less stressful to have a plan that I don‚Äôt need to use than to have no plan at all when I need one.
---
Especially now with reduced atoms, prices need to drop, but yeah, my spending habits have dropped, I only buy stuff I think is cool and targeted for what I want, I avoid bundles and won't spent any real money on cosmetics, it's just a game and eventually I will stop playing and I would have wasted money on virtual items which will die with the game.
---
Certainly makes sense. Ironically their overall profit margins would probably be better as people wouldn't consider spending a dollar or two as a major drain on their monthly expenditure.
---
Own and played every survival game out there. Ark doesn't do it for me. Grounded scratches a nostalgia itch, but I like the setting and gamplay of FO76 for what it is. Thanks.
---
I've only had the bug once myself (yesterday, after it was supposedly fixed mind you) that I know of but I've seen lots and lots of posts on it here.
---
There are other factors, such as it is not necessary to participate in order to make a living. The key factors in me not participating in the BOS grind were:
---
I am already employed. I'm working Legendary Run, at least with all the time I can commit to the game.
---
I am not a garbage collector. Want something killed? I'm your guy. Want someone to mindlessly grind cork? Find someone else.
---
I dunno, when I hit the impostor, I had damage numbers above 0. Doing damage apparently isnt enough.
---
To add to other's responses: don't forget to use green thumb perk, I haven't tried it myself to see if it works, but I read it doubles the raw flux you pick up.
---
I've always loved vampire weapons and have been hoarding them. I played PTS with my VE 50 and was surprised at it's damage compared to the current version. I think generally speaking the idea of this weapon adjustment is to even out the power curve on legendary effects.
---
I haven't heard of them doing so?  Though, to be fair, I didn't know it was a bug/issue.
---
It's funny to think about it, more of a nasty surprise when it happens.
---
Me and a teammate certainly wasn't expecting it, killed me because my char is bloodied and a strong wind could kill me but my friend had more time to prepare after I said WTF and dead lol
---
And the glitch where the courier would unequip his clothes comes back
---
Holy fuck
---
It is?! Thank the gods! I was so upset because I‚Äôm a big fallout fanboy and yes I didn‚Äôt buy it at release like with fallout 4 and queue in the store at midnight but I was enjoying it for what it was.
---
Got it! Thank you
---
Charisma is capped at 20 for selling and 25 for buying when it comes to giving you better prices at robot vendors. Neither perks nor chems will improve the prices beyond that point, where you're selling for 25% and buying for 175% of face value.
---
I liked outer worlds but I don't see how you could say the writing and creativity in it was better than anything in fo76 tbh lol
---
It was a fun game, but was nothing memorable imo
---
They played it very safe, I didn't find anything exceptionally creative
---
I have found that it's easier to buy from other players and use the Ammo Converter than to straight up farm .45 ammo. I use that caliber about 95% of the time (2mm is the only other type I use).
---
Line in the Sand provides a ton of ammo, and a good portion is .45. Uranium Fever provides a lot of shotgun ammo for conversion. One Violet Night is a decent source of ammo too. 
---
I do as many events/dailies as possible, because they reward ammo and it builds up and you can get a decent haul at the converter.
---
When it comes to PvP they should have released it by separating it from PvE. Stats should scale different when playing Nuclear Winter for example. It's almost impossible to completely balance PvP and PvE together simply because it's two different play styles. But that's not the case nor will it be so hopefully it will improve PvP! Now if after that they would only do something about the Nuka Quantums, Frog Legs, and hackers I read so much of.
---
Glad to hear it - not everyone can see a discussion as a discussion and not an argument!
---
The problem with introducing bigger tougher enemies is that it does the exact same thing as reducing the bloodied damage, but now it renders every other build seriously under strength.
---
It is of course tough to see your damage come down a bit after doing so much work, but it's still going to be the highest DPS around it's just that instead of inflating everything else in the game to try and match it, they're reducing bloodied builds. 
---
I completely understand the concern after doing all that building but ultimately reducing the damage for one build vs adjusting the damage on everyone else and the enemies isn't really much of a decision.
---
It isn't really abuse if you server hop for something that simply isnt there due to another player having looted it. If the devs have said server hopping is fine, then it is fine.
---
I agree about the stability, though. It is a bad feature, but apparently not an issue where they are fixing it.
---
I agree with what you say and I understand that its been an ongoing debate since 2018. Maybe that just shows that Bethesda really doesn't care what its players think. 
---
Capitalism  trumps consumerism I guess.
---
Games as a service is a thing where they aren't static purchases like floppy trapped titles of yesteryear, but can grow, expand and evolve. 
---
Maintaining a "game as a service" title costs money a single purchase will not sustain. 
---
You will see paywalls continue to rise in prominence not because of my spending in FO76, but because it is a sound revenue driving practice to help the continued funding of a game as a service. Including server costs, manpower, resources, licenses, etc.  
---
The market (whether people stop playing and stop paying) will determine if a game thrives or vanishes.
---
Grow up kid.
---
I havnt myself encountered one like that but a teammate has when I wasn't online
---
I think they should rebuff the other weapon builds back to what they were, do something with the useless prefixes. Release one wasteland see how all the builds deal with the increased damage and go from there.
---
It seems like they designed this legendary perk system for longevity, so that as people play the game over the course of the next few years they will gradually rank them up and everyone who's already level 400 or more won't just automatically have every card maxed out. With people needing to level 100 levels to complete a season it makes sense not to have the legendary perk cards max out in 420 level like you're suggesting.
---
Also, instead of people saving cards for respec they should be saving unused level-ups. That way perk packs aren't effected by existing cards and you're not stuck holding onto cards you may never use even after a respec. I try to keep 40 level ups banked in case of a respec.
---
Also, on my level 380 character I was able to buy a rank 3 and rank 2  (along with all the free rank 1 cards) and that was just scrapping cards, I didn't even dig into my 5 saved per packs or the 82 unused level ups.
---
Really, if they just got rid of the increasing cost for each rank up and kept it 100 coins per rank it would be fine I think. I don't want to max the thing out already.
---
What you are really asking is what can we do to have Zenimax and Bethesda (Board of directors to be more precisely) to pay attention to the players. Now we all know that their primary concerns is money in form of dividends. So that's what you have to address. Take their money away, they will listen. Now, how you do it is the real question. Quit playing and buying all their games?
---
Yea but considering most of the lost items use drop bags instead of a 0/0 world container actual loses are far and few in-between.  Nothing is safe than person to person but I do a 3 toon transfer every week and haven't lost a single load of gunpowder with 4-5 log outs and log ins.
---
When an item is only available for 7 days or whatever, and it says its price is discounted. This is illegal in several countries.
---
I'm looking forward to the new fall items, yes.
---
I guess they watch the sales and because so many actually spend the money whether they think it is worth it or not, it sells. A lot of people are addicted to cosmetics, people buy whether they use it or not, they know this. But people like myself do talk with my money and don't buy those items, I am sure a lot buy but. I am sure a lot don't either, people are stupid, at least not all of us, so we speak with our money. I can see the prices maybe dropping eventually or the game will eventually die anyway, so won't really matter.
---
Potentially. Although not necessarily with the CAMP budget.
---
I didn't even know that you could damage player houses without becoming hostile.
---
Brahmin yes, but I assumd they just respawned after a while. I mean I was playing Brahmin golf in this other player's home that he put underground with an explosive arrow. 
---
Basically you shoot the brahmin, and the arrow explodes sending the Brahmin skyrocketing into the nothingness below. He was cool dood :)
---
And i care why
---
I can hop on anytime (am actually on now!) so let me know what is best for you. I have it on me just to be safe!
---
You don't get it. They go to the workshops, destroy everything and leave. They don't even try to take the workshop. That isn't PVP. It's griefing, plain and simple. Learn the difference.
---
Destiny sort of did the same thing. The focus was all about rewards and progression at the sake of fun.
---
I just use a chicken coop
---
To quote the Hunt for Red October: "Russians don't take a dump, son, without a plan."  It was a good idea then, it's a good idea today :)
---
Blind ANYTHING is a bad idea though.  If you believe something is true, great, but make sure you a) have good reasons for believing it and b) keep your eyes bloody open in case your reasons turn out to be completely wrong :(
---
This is probably just the first step in a giant rebalance of the game, by changing the damage to additive instead of multiplicitive it brings damage closer together so it's easier to see what needs buffed and easier to plan new and old events instead of designing them super hard for the meta players or super easy for more casual players
---
I am on now as well. I think I added you!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Keyring
---
Wait for a good sale, it's an alright game but it's nothing exciting 
---
Once you beat it (if you get through it, since it has a lot of recycled content) you'll probably never play it again, and won't remember much of it at all
---
I love obsidian but it was just an "okay" game for me

---
&gt;	As part of next week‚Äôs update, we‚Äôre aiming to include fixes for replacing walls with doorways in build mode, add pocketed and deep pocketed mods for Secret Service Armor limbs, and address **an issue blocking ‚ÄúAn Ounce of Prevention‚Äù quest progress, among others.**
---
Lunchboxes are pretty good, especially if you are on a Build team.  The group I usually  run with - we get together in the same place, everyone opens a lunchbox Or two.  Add in the 4x bond bonus.  Someone makes brain fungus soup and cranberry relish to share....we end up with a 100% XP bonus. 
---
then run WS loop, radiation rumble, uranium fever.... Thats a lot of XP and a lot of score levels.  I think the last time we did RR, all of us ( L200+) gained enough XP for a full character level, and 1/2 way to the next level), and enough score points from the repeatable XP to gain a couple of legendary run levels.
---
We will see how the instanced bunkers work, could give people more creative space and incentive to get more stuff for their camp
---
Did you even read the post? It wasn't for "no reason".
---
It used to work until Wastelanders. They said it was going to be fixed when they would release the new public team system but surprise surprise...
---
Why?  Why is it bullsh** that he doesn‚Äôt see it your way?  So, he doesn‚Äôt frequent the market?  So what?  The only time a cheater bothers me is when I am attempting to get a specific kill and they drop-in with an OP and obviously illegally modded weapon. Then, I just relocate to a private server. Other than that, I too go get my own weapons, materials, and the like. People react differently to the things Bethesda has and hasn‚Äôt done to the game. Don‚Äôt be so narrow minded.
---
Every Bethesda game since Morrowind has slowly become simpler and more MTX. Hop off the high horse and step back down to reality.
---
Yeah the Pussies vs Players in this game sucks.
---
Dude you should play FO4, it's probably the best game I have ever played (personal opinion). But may be hard to digest now you have played 76 .. but still an incredible game.
---
This has been my concern too. Certain events and enemies are nearly impossible to clear without an overpowered build or magic weapon. They need to review the health and defenses of high level enemies along with nerfing those builds.
---
I always make sure to drop all the junk out of my inventory before I go around visiting other camps.
---
The game is pretty shit these days, fully understand. The thing is with me, I move on, play another game then I'm drawn back. Just finished Breakpoint, before that The Division 2, finally completed RDR 2. Now I'm back to 76... It's a really shit addiction with no high.
---
Can you send the request again or let me know your IGN?
---
That's an ok reason to not wanna play, but the stale end game is the bigger reason.
---
Once you do both sides on two characters, 100% all achievement
---
There's fuck all left.  Just dailies in the exact same locations.  No new stuff.  Boring.
---
That's lame :c
---
I love building my camp on cliffs and always sell ammo or plans for a cap each. Just trying to help everyone out.
---
Yeah like it‚Äôs been said son of Dane has a war drum or guitar sword. I was lucky enough to have a legendary one to use.
---
Beautiful. Thanks so much for your help guys :)
---
The thing is. A quad fixer and a bloodied fixer. Modded the same. At high health do the same damage. Add in the exact same mods and perks. Identical. If u drop the bloodied to 19% it‚Äôs damage increases by 80%. So if that 80%
---
Affects any multiplier it‚Äôs a hell of a lot more
---
Powerful still. I don‚Äôt know all the calculations but a weapon with an 80% damage increase against a weapon with 0
---
Is going to massively outperform that weapon
---
Any kind of mechanic in that fight would be helpful so it‚Äôs not just a dps comp. make it to where you have to set off a certain node that efffcts her in some way which makes her land so you can dps her. If you don‚Äôt get the node in a certain time then add spawn which do a certain damage type. There are countless ways to make bosses feel challenging without nerfing damage.
---
My IGN is Raztatic and I sent another one ;)
---
So, they got autocompleted?
---
One of the vendors in whitesprings resort had a bunch of cheap guitar swords when I was there last night, though that may be level based. I think it was the raider one, though possibly the free states. 
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox, I could make you one later tonight.
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature!
---
Ah, another paid Wasteland Mercenary I see üòÅ But the point remains that, while you may be able to make a living, you and I not participating in the cork grind inadvertently is what keeps the goals from being met, because I'm sure many more people think this way. It's not fun or worthwhile.
---
Got it!
---
Yea thats a good idea! Pipe pistol, or laser pistols would be another good canidate find a can find a 10mm.
---
Oh gotcha.  Sorry.
---
Play Beckett's ally quest and you'll find out
---
I love radiation rumble. I'm usually the only person getting the ore tho. I can gather between 50 to 90 before I have to dump, depending on my weight when I put the suit on. (I'm a bloodied build). If a friend is on, they'll help gather, unless noone else shows up, then they kill and we settle for whatever.
---
But they should have something where as long as you participate some how, you get loot. Not just stand in the corner and be able to loot.
---
Wait, what is meat week? Must‚Äôve missed that memo
---
Nope just hasn't updated for today, did all my dailys yesterday and they update at 5pm everyday
---
I agree. Its certainly become more profit-driven from Bethesda's side (removing free atoms but not dropping atom prices). 
---
Effectively you buy the game four times over (if you decide to buy four bundles over the month).
---
That's exactly why they changed the game because of pussies like you stalking and shooting people in the back, this isn't exactly PvP. You pvp pussies don't know what true pvp is, go play pvp games if you want true pvp, the reason you play Fo76 because it is like shooting fish in a barrel and empowers you and gives you a false sense of skill which you clearly don't have. You guys show up with your Op TSE's and like to pretend you have some skills, laughable at best. Shooting someone at a workshop in the back doesn't take any skill.
---
OH! I saw your camp a while back :D
---
Totally agree. Eso does this rly well, loads of things are account wide but it does NOT deter from playing diff chars at all. Even the secondary  leveling system champion points is account wide. Imagine in 76 that beyond lvl50 every level up is shared!
---
No, he's very level headed and has some great informative videos. The three F76 YouTubers I follow are angryturtle, juicehead and innovsurvivalist, though she's been getting more and more sensationalist, so I watch her stuff less often.
---
Every time I do radiation rumble the frame rate drops to almost 0. It is unplayable for.me.
---
Yeah. Always have been overpriced. Any time I brought it up the popular counter argument has been "JUST PLAY THE GAME AND GET ATOMS FOR FREE HURR DURR."
---
Which I did, but everything was still so expensive. If you got more atoms for your dollars, I'd have spent more. Then they reduced the number of atoms you get with the seasons update, so that argument is even less valid.
---
Correct.
---
When they were handing out free atoms all willy nilly with daily/weekly challenges, I'd say the atomic shop was priced appropriately. With the severely limited free atoms available now, the prices are too high for me. Now I debate whether I really need *another* set of wallpapers (spoiler, I do). As my atom stockpile dwindles, I'll be more picky about what I buy. That doesn't equate to more or less money for Beth as I don't want anything I've seen enough to buy more atoms and I'd rather pass on something I'm feeling iffy on to see what better things come along. Assuming I'm still playing in a couple months, Halloween season has a good chance to deplete my atom savings, and I'm okay with that.
---
There's also the issue of camp budget, which may be changing with this whole "instanced interiors" thing but I don't really know enough about it at this point to speculate further. All I know is that I don't have room to display everything I've already bought and that doesn't lend itself to opening my wallet for more stuff.
---
I say leave it and see how it goes lol I mean people have camps at white springs and mines in the bog. I only ha e to fix mine like 3 times a week haha
---
Oh yes, he has tetanus.
---
I started with Game Pass (sword I would never pay Bethesda a cent to play this game while knowing that I would find some way to play it for free eventually ;) so I never saw the pre Wastelanders world.
---
Shame really as I have had to do some mental gymnastics to reconcile the 2102 vault opening with the current 2103 story line date.  I'm basically treating anything form the original story line as a "flashback" of sorts while I work through the "current day" story.  It's worked out surprisingly well.
---
You have my interest. I'm in!
---
And who tf hasn‚Äôt?
---
Pretty simple? A PvP event automatically de-flags your passive, and re-enabled when the event ends. It's not rocket science, just game development.
---
And there you go. 
---
*Why you gotta bring in external sources like that?  I was happy in my undetermined state!*
---
LOL
---
Jesus.... That takes all the feeling of epicness out of the boss fight. That's like downing a raid boss in WoW right away.... lol
---
It‚Äôs only the raddest cookout with the coolest super mutant in all of Appalachia!
---
A food build are players who carry around lots of junk and meds and are likely to be grinding workshops or visiting camp vendors...which makes them easy targets for griefers.
---
I'm not being narrow minded it's just so statistically unlikely to not trade not even once in a game where drops are so crappy that it might as well be bullshit. Has nothing to do with my way of seeing things or being narrow minded.
---
Yeah no one crafts, the resources needed are stupid.
---
They‚Äôll add more though ;)
---
 Raider main quests explain
---
You could do the golf outfit.
---
Find a guy named Beckett. Roam near the Ash Heap and you might trigger a Quest to go find him. You'll find out through that.
---
Again, since I rely on myself for getting gear/weapons. It hasn't impacted me AT ALL.  The game plays and acts the same over the last couple years (aside from patches &amp; Updates). Trading and Duping only effects traders and dupers.   
---
Character locking gear/weapons impacts me ZERO.   I dont' play for others, I play for myself.  Since I'm permanently pegged at 30k and have all plans for everything, I sell things super cheap without paying attention to the Trader/Duper market.   The most expensive thing I sell is, ALL 3\*'s are 499, 2\*'s are 299, ALL ammo 1cap.   I could care less what others trade and thus, they don't impact my game, AT ALL.
---
I have an inadvertent trap camp...
---
It is at the base of the cliff just north of site Alpha right on the lake. I built a set of winding steps that goes to the top, but there is a small gap between the steps and the cliff that many players don't notice. 
---
All too often I will be at my camp lamenting my poor decorating skills when I will see a save me emote and go Stimpak the person or stand guard over their bag until they return.
---
Don‚Äôt use staggering perks. 
---
Don‚Äôt stand on tents.  
---
Don‚Äôt put down tents. 
---
Don‚Äôt stay on top of the bunker. 
---
Don‚Äôt stay on fences. 
---
Don‚Äôt fart while wearing power armour. 
---
So which one is that prevents SBQ from landing? Ever freaking person has their own / different theory. 
---
Is there actually any PROOF behind any of this?
---
I would love for them to show me their service costs if it is something they are struggling with. They clearly make enough money to run the game and pump out atom store content.
---
The game is bad. It is buggy. It is unpolished. It's core systems are poorly designed and maintained, and it is weak in comparison to almost all of it's competition. It has a small niche market that it is able to exploit.
---
Also what is your argument? That shitty business practices should be excused because they work and are becoming more common? Overall the game is a skeletal structure designed to exploit FOMO and addictive behaviour through micro-transactions (macro-transactions).
---
It's pretty incredible that people like you are willing to have someone shit down their throat then beg for more. The content is suffering a steep decline in quality, and it quite clearly is not equivelant to the amount Bethesda wants to charge.
---
If live services are delivering us terrible quality games and are struggling to fund their own existence (as a lot of people claim) then surely it would be easier to save your company money and lost reputation by creating smaller but more refined gameplay.
---
It's interesting to see what they release; it's just that there should be consultation with its players regarding prices (actually talking with its players and understanding what is generally considered 'reasonable' based on polling).
---
Instead of new content without bugs we will just make the grind slower . Brilliant idea
---
From what I have seen, anywhere between 1 and 9 months, depending on the item.
---
I might have to check out the gat laser, been awhile since I played around with one. 
---
I've tried the miniguns. I despise the spin up time, that's why I generally stick to a .50 or LMG.
---
No, the point is more that there are plenty of other options besides taking workshops (even if they aren‚Äôt the best options) if you REALLY want to avoid PVP
---
That's a different location.
---
I guess one reason would be that it kind of clashes with one of the other atomic shop catalogues + endgame loot, sweet armor. I guess they could get around it with a ‚Äúhide helmet‚Äù option...
---
TOW was free to download on Xbox for a limited time; not sure if its on there still though.
---
Yeah I agree with this, then again I only take a workshop when I need fusion cores and when I need to do a challenge, then I just abandon the workshop, I never actually build at a workshop. I take thunder mountain and rarely do I get contested, I think people hate the area or couldn't be bothered to travel. Some do but it's only been 1 or 2 times, a lot of people show up and just wave. also the workshop is bugged half the time so maybe that is why. And if someone does show up and kill me, then I jump servers and use blue prints to setup again in less than 5 mins, so no biggie.
---
I've never gotten 1 handmade drop for me, 610+ hours. I also never had a death tambo drop either. I get the plans for the tambo and I get one to drop the same day. Still no handmade. Maybe it is only the bear arm, fixer and wastelanders weapons but that can't be ignored.
---
Maybe once a week, once a month is too long.
---
Ahh
---
Imposter would be great at hide and seek. I swear I can be looking right at it and still never find the body.
---
You obviously don‚Äôt follow the Bethesda Facebook page. That place is chock FULL of complainers coming out of the woodwork. At the end of the day, Bethesda is going to release a game, people are going to put down the money to buy it because it‚Äôs an IP they are familiar with, and someone isn‚Äôt going to be happy with it for one reason or another. I‚Äôm one of them, I like Fallout, but there are things I‚Äôm not thrilled with. I‚Äôll keep giving them my monthly fee for Fallout 1st, because it offers me something that entertains me. The silent majority out there, the masses that understand Bethesda games are buggy and still play them, don‚Äôt come here and read or post. They play alone, with family and/or friends, and just play the game. It is what it is. Believe me, you aren‚Äôt going to start a crusade by your rants here.
---
There‚Äôs 10 ore in each cave so do all 4 for 40 but then it starts spawning back in really slowly. I find most players don‚Äôt bother and are just there to get xp and legendaries. If someone else is collecting you can complete it with plenty of time.  I saw someone say wait till the last mi ute but if you do that and the team your with aren‚Äôt very good it will fail so I put all 40 in as soon as I‚Äôve collected so it‚Äôs level 1. 5 more ore and its level 2.
---
Is it harder to play though? You spend much less on ammo then full health builds currently do. You kill most enemies before they can kill you as well. Your perk card bonuses keep you alive far more then what a full health build would get. I tried bloodied once for a week, just to see for myself how the game was with the build. 
---
Sure, sometimes it is harder to play but most of the time I would say no, it‚Äôs not. You simply do way too much damage to ever realistically have to worry about most threats. The main three are radiation, poison, and your own mistakes. If something does get a hit on you, it has to bypass nerd rages DR, your normal defenses, serendipity, and if you use it dodger. That‚Äôs assuming it lives long enough to land a hit. 
---
Instigating is centered around the one shot one kill or at least big burst play style. It doesn‚Äôt keep that damage for subsequent hits, the target also must be full health. Bloodied does not have these caveats, it just does the damage in every single hit regardless of the enemies current health pool. It‚Äôs easy to see why one is being changed and one isn‚Äôt. 
---
This is balance though. It‚Äôs painful balance only because Bethesda allowed things to fester for a long time. Even after these changes, bloodied will still do the most damage. You just won‚Äôt 1 shot/1 clip everything anymore. The game could never evolve if players had that kind of damage. 
---
I disagree that only nerfing bloodied would be the way to go. Although it‚Äôs the biggest offender here, junkies also did way too much damage. Everyone‚Äôs damage had to go down if any meaningful balance could ever be achieved. Now they can make adjustments from here without worrying about what crazy multipliers for damage players are using because there aren‚Äôt any to deal with anymore. 
---
Other MMOs do balance passes like this all the time. This feels crappy because people had too much for far too long, and now that the balancing is here they do not like to lose that. I can sympathize with that feeling but to me, for any worthwhile difficult content to come into the game, everyone‚Äôs damage had to be toned down. Period.
---
Right, agreed. I generally farm like 60 fusion cores and it lasts me a long while and the only time I have to take them is for challenges and rarely am I there long enough to be contested. It does happen but very rare.
---
I can already feel the sweats coming on.
---
&gt;Again, since I rely on myself for getting gear/weapons. It hasn't impacted me AT ALL.
---
Just because it has not impacted you at all does not mean it has not impacted the vast majority of players.  It still affects you, you just don't care.  Which is fine but just saying.
---
The problem is that not enough people quit so they don‚Äôt care.
---
  The problem without PA may damage avoidance - those ghouls can hit hard - and the nether the Chinese stealth suit nor the hazmat suit offer much DR.
---
PA + diluted radx (so I don‚Äôt lose mutations), plus the decontamination shower on the right side helped a lot.
---
I wish this post picked up more steam because the style shop is the most underused one and needs more love for sure. Players running around using like the same 3 hairstyles because all the other ones look like shit. Bethesda seems more interested in adding Fortnite-style masks, outfits and dances than giving us a couple nice new hairstyles or makeup options.
---
Is someone from Bethesda holding a gun to your head forcing you to 100% everything?
---
No, it‚Äôs ginger you soulless bastard! You should have joined the Enclave, not the Brotherhood!
---
I'm a high level player, I'm not upset about the coming changes. Stop being upset for me. 
---
I already changed my build multiple times, one more wouldn't matter.
---
The most prized and fun event in this game. Graham hosts a cookout and you simply do some chores around his BBQ area. On the hour every hour too!
---
It‚Äôs really fun. I was using rifles for the longest time, but pistols are quite satisfying (especially the 10mm). If you have 15 agility, the damage really isn‚Äôt that big of an issue. Of course, it‚Äôs no where near commandos or heavy guns, but it‚Äôs not bad. If Bethesda keeps the nerf that‚Äôs on the PTS right now, though, they might not be that good. 
---
Very good and fun for day-to-day stuff, but not really viable for things like the SBQ.
---
I think I‚Äôve only completed this event 4 times and only once got max but didn‚Äôt get nothing rare. Like many ppl said most wont even collect it. I usually have the whole top locked down with help of one person. But I think I‚Äôm going to change it to grabbing ore. I have the stealth suit and power armor but always was maxed. But I want the good rewards. Wish I could solo this event. Like violent night, I had so many event failed because ppl would not repair juke box or they would keep turning it off so I now solo that event and it‚Äôs so so so easy plus you get all rewards
---
Nor does it mean that it DOES. It seems to only impact traders/dupers. You are making your perspective the majority, when that is unsubstantiated.
---
You are entitled to your opinion, it has impacted you.. .but that doesn't mean it impacts the majority.   The game is the game and be COMPLETELY playable without other people or impacted by others... only the trading/selling, which again, is not necessary.
---
Like I said I do not know all the underlying facts and am merely making assumptions for now. Until it goes live for real I just don't care enough to dig into it further.
---
But if everything is additive instead of multiplicative then Bloodied is not an 80% damage increase. I think it maxes out at 95% at 5% health anyway. So if all are additive adrenal, nerd rage, Bloody Mess, Weapon Perks all 3 maxed to rank 3, then the multiplier is base X 2.45. when you add Bloodied as additive then it just goes to base X 3.40. (3.4/2.45= 1.38 ignoring any change in actual damage from DR versus the higher output). So Bloodied potentially only does 38% more damage than a weapon with no damage increase like quad or vampires.
---
no prob. works also for cooking and crafting weapons :)
---
*cricket chirp*
---
"Where?!"
---
Thanks for the link and info!
---
Exactly but I have yet to have the urge to spend real money, I mean some of the cosmetics are nice, but there is no way I am paying $18 for a skin, that's stupid and I earn enough I can afford it, but I am a practical guy. I paid for the game, I don't think I should spend money on in game items, but that's me personally.  At the end of the day it is just a time waster for me and I see no reason to actually spend money, it already does what I need without me needing to buy stuff. 
---
Also if Rockstar can make money off their cosmetics, so can Bethesda. Bethesda still hasn't figured out the right strategy for the atomic shop. GTA has so many ways to make virtual currency and they still sell shark cards, hand over fist. Here Bethesda is limiting virtual currency with the hope people will op to spend real money and I don't believe that is a good strategy.
---
Yeah but there's a limit; eventually, you'll hit this limit and then all subsequent cards you get are discarded.
---
Accumulating perk coins shouldn't have a component that's based on RNG and being lucky not to open a pack that will discard random cards.
---
&gt;The game is the game and be COMPLETELY plaid without other people.
---
Why anyone would want to play like that is beyond me.  This game is infinitely better with friends and interacting with others.  
---
It can be played that way.  But you're missing out on a lot of the experience the game is supposed to offer.  To each their own.  Either way, you play the game which has had updates and changes made based upon the fact that folks cheated.  It affects you.  To which degree is up to the individual player
---
Bonus points if it starts clapping, has glowing eyes and a grenade drops on you from the ceiling when you get close to it.
---
I am a bloodied build and just run though the radiation shower when I get there, I use my T-65 to collect, after I dump the ore I collected I just run through the radiation shower again then go for another run.  Before I leave I build my rads back up and go.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
To add on with this... assuming it hasn't changed since I last heard about it, the upcoming Legendary Perks system is *strange*. It'll unlock up to six card slots, for *all* characters on your account, as soon as any one of them hits the required milestones... *but* each character needs to level up their cards independently??? It makes no sense. I should be able to equip different cards for each character, yes, but the perk coins and ranking up cards should be account-wide.
---
Poison isn't even that much of a risk if your godroll unyielding pieces are also poisoner's.
---
Don't forget the animal hunts every 15 minutes for cuts of meat you can donate for Scrip!

You're again correct. It does do the same thing as reducing their damage but in a much better way i feel. As for the second part that would be a more suitable time to buff other builds. I think a good majority of prefixs severely lack as is. You can use pretty much any build to play the game; challenge has really truly never been an issue. I don't see a valid point in trying to make fights more challenging with the content already in the game. It's just going to be a slightly more tedious process of recycled material. 
---
With the introduction of new enemies, new gear, and new content, it would be a better time to adjust things accordingly. Whenever new expansions came out in MMOs such as WoW, EQ, or FF14, I welcomed the new grind for gear and stronger enemies. Even if I spent the last year getting what I currently had. They didn't make it to where prior enemies took slightly longer to kill or do more damage. They made the new stuff harder in increments.
---
Get yourself a raider collectron. If you're not using an automatic you'll have more .45 ammo than you know what to do with
---
lol I just introduced my Freind into the game, and I leave him alone around the overseers camp for a bit. When I come back, carnage on earth as every Brahmin from the tavern and like 6 player Brahmin are dead and he just sits there and says ‚ÄúI was hungry‚Äù
---
Agreed. Reducing the atoms you can get for free but keeping the 'atom prices' the same shows that they really don't care about the F76 players and their long-term connection to the franchise (which is actually needed when they release their next Fallout game). Their only focus is 'How much money can I take out of their wallet over the next month?'
---
Milking a player‚Äôs Brahmin &gt; killing a player‚Äôs Brahmin.
---
Thanks for the comment. I'm sure there are more of us out there playing. They just don't advertise their age.
---
Well since you don‚Äôt have to worry about radiation, poison, acid or your own mistakes nearly as much as you do in bloodied id say yes it is harder to play. You‚Äôre correct that in most cases I can kill an enemy before they kill me and that‚Äôs the trade off I‚Äôm making for playing at 30 hp. And I do agree that bloodied was over performing and could have used a tuning. This isn‚Äôt that. A tuning would be lowering the bloodied bonus for playing at low health from 100% to 50%. This would bring it inline with furious, junkies and berserker. But keeping the perk card stacking the way it is. This means no other build loses damage and bloodied gets tuned. Done. 
---
But that‚Äôs not what they did they nerfed everything and did it in a way that the top builds lose the most damage while the low level builds which weren‚Äôt being used took almost no hit. That‚Äôs not balance. 
---
No other MMO that I‚Äôve played for the last 25 years does it like this. DCUO for example did a huge damage balance about 3-4 years ago called stats revamp but they did it comprehensively over the course of like a year and they made sure that top builds didn‚Äôt take huge steps backwards.
---
Also you can‚Äôt one shot anything now except a super low level enemy and two bloodied does not do the most anymore on test. TSE is out performing it.
---
I said in a different thread a few days ago that I‚Äôd like a keyring. I think all players would. But if there were separate tabs for all the stuff y‚Äôall are suggesting we would have like 20 inventory tabs and that would make inventory even more annoying to navigate. 
---
In most cases with weapons and armor/apparel all you have to do is rename your good stuff with a ‚Äúz‚Äù or an asterisk in the front to sort stuff.
---
With key duplicates, idk why we can even pick up keys we already have in the first place. Seems simple to a dumb guy like me but yeah
---
What? Also yes, but it'll do q fraction of what it should
---
Or tweak Assassin's to "Humans" instead of "other Players" now that there are actually humans to attack now, and likely more coming.
---
No I'm actually one of the very vocal people there also curb your arrogance because you like others is just enabling them with that attitude. You come in here talking like you know so much but you couldn't possibly back up anything with facts or statistics just opinion. Also the reason I posted here is because Bethesda actually pays attention to the reddit almost no company pays much attention to Facebook pages if any. If you're okay with eating shit sandwiches that's fine but don't act like everyone else thinks like you.
---
similar to radiation rumble, which I know has been discussed length. we're helping complete the event in a critical way. rewards for that would be nice.
---
I love this. 
---
Im the guys running like a border collie around the cluster of fence walkers. Ive had people ask if i am hacking. Nope, i pissed her off, she wants to hit my face. Erry time.
---
Making mongrels scatter.
---
I won‚Äôt disagree that there is a decent chunk of cosmetics that would have made much more sense to release as part of updates than on the Atomic Shop, but it‚Äôs also just cosmetics. I will also agree that Atomic Shop prices for most items are probably higher than they should be, especially now that they‚Äôve nerfed the number of Atoms freely available to players. But, they don‚Äôt put any new game content behind paywalls and all large updates are free, which again is not the case for similar games.
---
GaaS games by nature aren‚Äôt supposed to have ‚Äúall‚Äù of their content available at launch ‚Äî they evolve over time as changes are made and content is added. I think that your argument about lack of cosmetics is flawed because you‚Äôre comparing apples to oranges. In Fallout 4, sure there were more options for making cosmetic changes to your power armor, but you were also limited to your cosmetic look in regular armor because of how that system worked in FO4. Not only are there two more sets of power armor available in ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù FO76, any outfit can be worn over any armor, increasing the amount of available cosmetic options by orders of magnitude. 
---
You also seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Creation Club works. Creation Club content is commissioned content from the community that is then offered to players. It‚Äôs not Bethesda trying to squeeze more money out of players, it‚Äôs actively engaging and supporting the strong modding community around their games by paying modders to create premium content. While Bethesda certainly makes money off of it, purchases on the Creation Club primarily support the modders.
---
Bloodied isnt just about damage.
---
Carry Weight, Buy/Sell price, Exp Boost, AP, Sneak.
---
All massive quality of life improvements not granted by the other builds.
---
I‚Äôd rather pay double or triple scrip to get a prefix I want
---
Patience young Padawan, you don't have it.
---
I don't have god rolls and I never got around to getting a full uny scout set, but with SS now in Play, even patience is not need soo much anymore.
---
eg. Scoutmasks, I could have traded for them looong ago. But NO, I ground the 4 events for over 6 months, and when I got them it was THE DAY.
---
Lok, I get it that you don't believe me, but your statistics can really kiss my ass, I don't care. Just as I don't care how anyone else plays this game.
---
I'm in it for long haul, from Beta on. If other idiots want to ruin the game by denying themselves the sweet victories from grinding, so be it. Like I said before, let them cheat and dupe, then we are faster rid of them because they no longer have a goal in this game.
---
Hopefully its fixed tomorrow. Because they said several of the Raider quest were fixed this patch an arent.
---
I remember when you used to be a Deathclaw
---
Or at least have it apply to all human enemies
---
That's far worse.
---
Never rub another man's rhubarb.
---
Whaaaaaaaaaat
---
Absolutely horrid. This has to be a top priority fix.
---
IMO this is the only event that you should get something even if you don't shoot the imposter, tanking the pylons take alot of stims and we should get a reward for your efforts

Where is meat week? My tasks auto completed! and for old times sake i bought this bacpack skin but it wont let me put it on my backpack.
---
Have you tried the usual? Server hop, re launching the game/system?
---
I use scrapper perk and get so much steel and like they said lucky hole mine with excavator you get so much lead when you smelt with max super duper perk. I never run out of 45 ammo now with this method. I‚Äôve played since beta but used melee most time and used guns I had ammo for. But when recently I started using my bloodied rifles I ran out of ammo and I would buy steel and lead from vendors and it sucked but with this method it‚Äôs easy
---
Very true. They can charge 1200 atoms (10 dollars/ 8 euros/ 7 pounds) for a 'bundle' yet the CAMP budget will stop you from actually displaying the item. 
---
Then you have subsequently 'wasted' money as you can't place it within your CAMP as a cosmetic.
---
Got a 3star dropped yesterday. Dont think they are legacy.
---
Yeah I canned that thing immediately after finding out there is no food output. I don't even have budget for crops, I just hunt as my hunger drops low. Would love to have some Appalachian Scrambled Eggs from that thing.
---
120 levels to rully rank up a card seems like a really nice choice. Would be around level 720 to rank up all 6. Which isnt absolutely horrible. Also this system would be a lot more reliable.
---
Excellent! I knew it was one of those. Thanks for the clarification üòä
---
I've got two, a Bloodied and a Furious. Pretty sure I got one of them within the past 2 months.
---
This is why I built a barn.
---
That's what I was thinking, I just wanted to check. Seemed a little odd. Thanks!
---
Yesterday was the first time it happened to me, and indeed I was looking at the challenges at the time the reset landed. Maybe it's related, maybe it's not, we'll probably never know.
---
I think it's the cultist blade (the big sword one) that's legacy not the dagger.
---
I killed it in 2 seconds before the event even started once, players were mad but I really didn't expect it to take damage nevermind die.
---
Yeah I haven't got one in a while but I did have an old AA one collecting dust. Thought it might be worth something now lol. Ah well
---
Today it was the first time for me that i had this bug. All complete but only the NW one. Hope it does not stay this way im almost finished, im like 91 or so.
---
pool balls scrap to plastic.  so do Fancy hairbrushes, bottles, cat/dog bowls, golf balls....
---
I did this yesterday.  When I went to add mods to it, it makes the sound of completion but never takes my mats and never adds the mod.
---
Then I did it with the regular ss underarmor and it worked fine.
---
I see. Yes I was aware of that; Bethesda saying that they had reduced something by 100 atoms when it hadn't actually been put up originally for that price originally.
---
Unfortunately they know that some people will see the word 'discount' and automatically hand over their credit card.
---
It's better and worse
---
This subreddit only represents a small fraction of this game‚Äôs community. There are tens of thousands of people that will continue to play this game and spend whatever money they see fit to spend to keep it going. Numbers will always dwindle in GaaS games ‚Äî there is an expected bump in players with every large update which will then fall back towards the core player base. Fallout 76 will not bankrupt Bethesda. They will be fine and continue to be profitable.
---
Yess. I usually put on my refrigerator backpack and used salt perk card... Selling meat for months. I'm excited.
---
Can the queen do anything other than her staggering animation when she is being staggered. I think the staggering perk is pretty self explanatory
---
That does seem fair enough - death loot should also be marked as such
---
It's an interesting idea. Given Bethesda's past record, I'm doubtful that it will be successful first time round.
---
I play with others ever since public teams and bonus's.   But nothing they do impacts my game...  again, it only effects traders/dupers.   I don't participate, yet I sell so much i'm stuck at 30k.  So there is no reason to be part of the trade/dupe community, unless you want to be.
---
What sort of wares do you carry about? Any rare clothing?
---
The same thing happened to me, didnt get a damn thing.
---
I built a little 4x4 barn and managed to keep mine inside up on Seneca. I just came down because I was tired of spawning inside the ridge.
---
Yea this is one of my favorite features. Still unfortunate the XP doesn‚Äôt get to you but it‚Äôs better than nothing
---
If they could get some playtesters and a veteran game designer up in there I'd agree.
---
It‚Äôs about the milk.
---
I doubt it will be compared to new vegas...
---
Well damn I just got the game a week ago, still have managed to play every day so I guess there's that üôÉ
---
I didn't!
---
... they patched it before I heard about it...
---
I‚Äôm not 100% sure how it works, but I do KNOW that there‚Äôs a ‚Äúseeking revenge‚Äù mechanic. I‚Äôve had numerous occasions where someone initiated pvp with me, I took them out, and then I got a message saying ‚Äúso-and-so is seeking revenge‚Äù. The next time I saw them, they were already hostile as if we had both attacked each other again; this leads me to believe there is some way of coming back to hunt them down for your stolen loot. If they make it to a stash box, however, then it‚Äôs really gone.
---
Cool dude, that's my opinion but thanks for yours!
---
Yes seems fair. If claiming a workshop makes you vulnerable and picking locks on a camp does than picking up loot should at least make you vulnerable to that player.
---
I don't disagree with this at all lol
---
You can wait till your armor breaks, it not gonna give you dr or er, but legendary prefixes still gonna work
---
I do love my cream.
---
best game ever. :)
---
Legend!
---
Thank you. I didn't even think to look for a reset option and it worked a charm
---
I didn't clarify that but yeah, there are things that each game does better than the other. But I believe that 76 does more things better than 4 does.
---
yes like it had chameleon on it but it stayed invisible after I killed it.  It was located at one of the surface to air sites just to the left of the fissure site.
---
Yeah you're definitely apart of the problem also you keep that same energy once you try actually getting just a decent SS set of armor but that's fine continue to enjoy your shit sandwich eventually people who want a finished product and enjoy nice things will drown voices like yours out.
---
I'd say they're pretty separate and similar  at the same time. They both have different goals of delivering their product‚ÄîFallout 4 being a story-based single player experience and Fallout76 being a Live Service, multiplayer experience.
---
Me too.  All auto completed today.   I work about every third day but I was able to hit every day because   I usually login in the morning and complete the previous day's challenges then log off for 2 hours and log back on afternoon and do that day's.  My work schedule is getting busy I think I'm pretty much done with this daily play stuff the legendary run has it been worth the amount of work it is made the game for me.  Games are supposed to be fun not a work commitment.
---
So you are saying that junkies are NOT full hp build, lol
---
&gt; 40$ is exactly...
---
‚Ä¶the price of a whole new game.
---
Game bad
---
innocently unlocked, said every robber that got caught.
---
Agreed. I'm not a big fan of the system overall as-is (I'd prefer if they'd gone with something more like Diablo 3's Paragon system), but it'd at least be bearable if they make coins and card ranks account-wide. It's awkward enough to try to run multiple characters already, and having the legendary perks coins and ranks be character-bound would just kill any incentive to run more than one character.
---
I play in pacifist mode 100% of the time, and there was no ‚Äúseeking revenge‚Äù mechanic presented to me. Maybe it was just buggy for me, but I really wanted my loot back on that occasion.
---
Yes!, they should give a notification before you steal someone's bag similar to a workshop one saying "if you claim the items in this bag the owner may attack you" this would save a lot of headache, of course there has to be a difference between "dropped loot" and "death loot", they are already considered 2 different things, since you can assign both a different cosmetic from the atom shop.
---
I agree, but it depends what you use as criteria. If you put a lot of weight in companions, 76 will fail. 
---
76 runs better and looks better for me also (especially in the new instanced locations)
---
Yes! I agree, my fiance brutally struck down my Marybelle. She didn't nothing, my poor baby üò≠üò≠
---
I wasn‚Äôt talking about *their* situation, I was talking about a thing that has happened to *me*. 
---
The other night I had a guy follow me around to different teams until I blocked them. He was sharing sun kissed 2 just to ruin our builds for literally no reason. 
---
I gave them no reason to do this to me.
---
That‚Äôs why I said ‚Äúmeanwhile‚Äù. Showing the way this can be used to grief.
---
they did a number on their reputation. A ton of people who would have bought any Bethesda game will now most likely have a bad taste in their mouth when they make other games. Me included.
---
Hah, I like 76 but 4 had attention to detail and fleshed out lore that simply isn't present in this game. Appalachia, while diverse in landscape and location, isn't as exciting to explore as other Fallout worldspaces which featured varying stories and Easter eggs at every turn. 76 feels like a world still halfway through development...
---
As an Alien Blaster user, if that's true it'd be terrible.
---
Come on! I want an affect Alien Blaster, at least buff it to Fallout 4 stats x3
---
With all Gunslinger perks, at lv 50, it's 50 damage per shot.
---
That's FO4 base damage, it's so bad! :(
---
Only reason people like fallout 4 is nude mods.
---
(Ofc modding in general not just the nudes^Maybe)
---
*Are you sure?*
---
First time it happening for.me.today too. Annoying as well, as the dailies are literally the only reason I log on anymore
---
Then again, if you seek revenge and they just sit somewhere in stealth armor, you have 2 mi utes to find them or your seeking revenge will be useless... even in a teammates workshop, you will end up doing 0 damage to the one your shooting at and then your met with a salvo of a 100 damage per shot before you can defend yourself, when you are, already, defending yourself
---
Wait what?
---
It is craftable, you are just unlucky
---
4 i's better in many areas. Enemy intelligence and fights are way better: raiders, synths, gunners... They THINK. 
---
You have killing animations, big bad bosses are tough and some other little things (map is smaller but feels bigger).
---
F76 is better in terms of how camping works, the multiplayer element, the legendary system and -maybe- learning mods. Also, outfits on top of armor. 
---
Surviving in 4 was harder. I liked that.
---
All kinds of goodies. Come check out what I have lol
---
You gonna struggle yourself to kill things with this one (if lvl 50) when One Wasteland comes.
---
Had the same thing happen. Server got unstable on the reset and kicked me and my random group off. I was able to get back in but looting wasn't working half the time so I changed worlds. After that I noticed they had autocompleted
---
How long have you been exploring 76 for? I think the opposite. There are a ton of Easter eggs and stuff people are still figuring out (I‚Äôm looking at you alien writing on stones).
---
The event ends when you reach 100 ore, so your best option is to collect the 100, and hold it right until the end. More time = more ghouls = more xp = more legendaries.
---
At each 25 ore deposited, there's a horde spawn that can easily kill  one of the NPC's, so holding it until the end makes it easier to get 100% completion.
---
Excavator does increase the ore gained, and there are only 4 tunnels. After you clear the 4th, you can start over in the 1st, as the ore respawns.
---
Of course. But despite that, I still find 76 to be the superior product no matter how much love I have for 4.
---
Fair enough - just trying to help.
---
I got 2 unyielding sentinel secret service pieces on my junkies vanguard build, I'm hoping they make them transferable in the future too.
---
There is no trade off, stop that bullshit, i can die from poison or surprise asaulttrons laser only. Berserker should be top dmg, being a real glass cannon. There is nothing hard playing bloodied (i have 4 bloodied and 1 full hp junky chars)
---
Absolutely. Hit the nail on the head!!!!
---
Yes please they need to do it just like elder scrolls online 
---
The game need an independent banker type of npc apart from the stash limit so we can transfer items and cap 
---
Share non-cap currency(gold bullion,scrip) also needs to be shared without limits between characters 
---
And the legendary perk/perk coin should mirror eso‚Äôs champion point system.. legendary slot and perk coin should be account wide.
---
Just maxed out Raider reputation, got the Gauss Minigun, and in my first batch of five rolls I got a Bloodied. Its possible.
---
&gt;as I have had to do some mental gymnastics to reconcile the 2102 vault opening with the current 2103 story line date
---
But... you don't have to - the game did that for you! If you talk to the robots before leaving the Vault, or the Overseer once you meet her, it turns out you somehow stayed behind in the Vault after everyone else left on Reclamation Day, and you hung around in there for a whole year before leaving. And nothing else ever really makes any direct mention of the date - the original storyline and the Wastelanders story can run side-by-side without any major issues.
---
Tomorrow they're adding the colossal problem. Presumably..  ofc I have doubts about it. (Namely another delay probably)
---
And the meat week on 20th
---
That's fair. I've put more time into 76 than 4.
---
I'm level 150 so I'd say a hefty amount of time. 76 has some cool locations but I think it pales in comparison to 4's map which, IMO, was incredibly well done. Like I said, it feels half way fleshed out.
---
No I do get it , you don‚Äôt . You‚Äôre griefing them by going to a pvp arena and not pvping . It‚Äôs so many better/faster ways to farm resources
---
Which also needs QOL updating honestly..
---
Onestly I go or in lucky hole mine where You can get lead and steel from the cultist or if You Need only lead go on the high point of monorail lift and if You follow the train You Will find a lot of Gym equipment and weights.
---
4 by far has the better companions and that's definitely one edge I'd put in its favor. I didn't want to go too in depth in my post or else people wouldn't bother reading it all lol
---
Did you get all of those Assassins drops on the same server, or were you hopping around to different servers?
---
yeah i know id also love it to be more effective üò¨
---
With you bro.  I‚Äôm only there for xp and legendary drops.  Will slip on my stealth gear and grab ore if needed for the team.
---
Well in that case, that guy was just being a dick lol
---
Interesting. I thought the one thing everyone agreed upon was the map was way better in 76. To you fast travel a lot or go hiking?
---
I mean everything you caomplain about is easily fixable. At launch, grant high level players some points to make up for potentially lost duplicate cards (yes, that is going to overreward/underreward some but I don¬¥t think that would be a big deal) and introduce a respec serum or something. Not having that in the game so far - from what I can tell - was just to give level up¬¥s some semblance of importance. 
---
Personally, I really like having a very long term grind.
---
Take my upvote! Those links cracked me, in a restaurant at the mall. I had no idea, that people did this kind of stuff!
---
Well I‚Äôm the person that wants to collect the ore and finish it as early as possible. It‚Äôs all good if you‚Äôre on a good team and they don‚Äôt get the npc‚Äôs killed but most of the time it‚Äôs players that have no idea what they‚Äôre doing. I‚Äôm there to get the chance of rare rewards and the longer the event goes on the more chance of a npc dying. There‚Äôs better places to farm xp and legendaries.
---
And you know legendary perk system and one wasteland is base off of eso..  but they ain‚Äôt embrace it 100%
---
Yes. I have gotten several. But I am a full health build, so not real helpful. Maybe it‚Äôs a reverse psychology thing. The RNG gives you the perfect rolls for what you don‚Äôt really need.
---
This is the real reason lengendary perks are currently stupid and full of grind. I can level an alt from 1 to 100 in about the same time I gain 10 levels on my main.
---
PA frame + crafted baseball bat and game becomes easy peasy mod since lvl 15
---
They autocompleted for me too. After that i just closed the game.
---
Yes, and picking deathbags should show pop-up that it initiates PvP.
---
TV food trays are pure plastic.
---
I use the stagger perk all the time and she lands just fine when my team is not standing on fences and shit and she‚Äôs not chasing some robot in the nuke zone. 
---
I actually prefer her NOT landing just to fuck with all these kids with magic or hacked weapons killing her in 10secs. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have magic weapons too, but I let everyone get their damage in before I melt her. 
---
Nobody forces anyone to shoot her in the air. That‚Äôs a waste of bullets anyways. 
---
Instead of making a post telling others not to use the stagger perk, why not make a post to not shoot her in the air at all? Effect will be the same. Same amount will read it and same amount if people will actually listen: no one.
---
I *wish* I had spared myself that grind.
---
Gets my vote, add death blossoms &amp; breach to the list
---
I have never collected ore and never will.
---
What? Those things arnt even connected. Uny has nothing to do with dr
---
as a slight devil's advocate here... i really like the blood eagle bundle.  the emote is a big "meh" for me, but that outfit is sick (goes great with a bowler hat and a plague mask), the GIANT FLAMING eagle is awesome, and that pavilion thing is a solid prefab.
---
some things in the shop i feel are overpriced, but most are pretty fair.  power armor skins and stand alone outfits are overpriced imo.  the bundles tend to be solid buys.  but nobody is forcing anyone to buy anything from the atom shop.  i really wanted the train car, but had no interest in the rest of the slocums bundle, so i didn't buy it.  the greenhouse and spring bundles... super mega worth it.
---
a LOT of the atom shop pricing i think is subjective.  overall, i feel compared to some games, the atom shop is FAR from the worst in game shop.  i love my elder scrolls online, but gods is that shop/game a money sink.
---
it isn't perfect, but we should be grateful it isn't nearly as much of a garbage fire compared to other parts of the game (looking at you great idea left neglected and languishing nuclear winter)
---
i for one welcome the fact that even if it does cost us money, i've spent less in the atom shop than other game's shops and felt like i came out with some really good stuff.
---
unyielding doesn't add dr.
---
Cosmetics are unfortunately, by nature, a major component of multiplayer games. Every single multiplayer game with any level of customization understands this. Destiny 1/2 are a great example of how important and fundamental cosmetics are to a community and how negatively farming them for cash can, and will, lead to serious pushback and consumer trust loss.
---
The outfit examples you have given are valid, but you have to remember that all of Bethesda's singleplayer games have been reliant on mods/modders to fix them. You cannot wear outfits over armour etc in the base game so modders added that functionality. There were game breaking bugs in every major Bethesda sandbox release and Bethesda simply pushed them out and knew that modders would fix them so they didn't have to worry about it.
---
The creation club is content created by the community then sold on to the community, but you have to evaluate it's evolution. The creation club is the base introduction of micro-transactions in to the game. This then evolved with 76. You can look at the progression and evaluate how much content you can expect for what price and how Bethesda plans to implement micro-transaction systems in the future. 
---
Traditional games &gt; dlc packs &gt; CC store &gt; atom store
---
You can see a very clear decline in the content and quality of content provided vs the amount they expect you to pay.
---
That's really surprising because I felt like fo4's map was incredibly bland and filled with missed opportunities 
---
One of the few things I remember from the game was the deathclaw encounter in Salem
---
Except that means tedious leveling and giving up progress toward legendary perks.
---
This game's "respec" option is a disgrace.
---
Ideally you should get close to 100 ASAP so you get all the strong spawns  then hold off on the last few ore until the timer runs close to done.
---
I feel like I'm in the minority where I like that Appalachia still isn't entirely fleshed out because there's so much left to explore and being an online only game makes me think Bethesda isn't planning on stopping the updates any time soon. But I will disagree that 4 has better lore and is more diverse in landscape than 76. 4's map is great and there's so much to explore but for some reason, I get incredibly bored returning to the same locations while that same feeling never comes over me while playing 76.
---
My XP farming method is as follows:  Int [all buffs active, is 32] herbivore mutation, cranberry relish, egghead mutation, brain fungus soup.  Strange in number, inspirational, building team.
---
This gives around 30% XP boost, and with the high intelligence, I level up every time I do any event with any leveled mobs; rad rumble, project paradise, scorched earth, or line in the sand, one violent night, I‚Äôll often level up twice.
---
I mean, that's just a bonus!
---
What really impacts the game is hacked weapons, and magic weapons. Two different things that have caused &amp; still causing many players frustration due to legendary 3 stars dying too fast especially SBQ
---
Do you know when you died it is not your junks anymore until you get them back or you just think death drops are trademarked buy person who dropped it
---
Mine:
---
 * Show up, Chinese Stealth suit, Radaway (I'm bloodied), Diluted Rad-X
---
 * Mission start, clear front two areas of Ore in Stealth
---
 * Run to back, clear back two areas of Ore in Stealth
---
 * Marsupial up onto the room where the Decon Shower is
---
 * Swap armor
---
 * Set up a two-chassis funnel in one of the halls near the entrance to main room
---
 * Kill, kill, kill
---
 * 1:30 left, dump all Ore in - if Reward level is already at 3, wait until closer to 0:00 on timer
---
 * If only one scavenger is left alive, once their health hits 50% - deposit all my Ore in regardless of Reward level
---
My goal is to finish the event, but to also keep it going as long as possible.
---
I don't know, the Charleston landfill has resources you can get elsewhere, sure, but it often has EVERY resource I'm looking for. I'd much rather claim that and only worry about the one workshop than claim 2 or 3.
---
I hope you buddy knows the budget is perma lost when you put them down. 
---
You can‚Äôt remove them ..only way is to move your camp. And they still take up budget, if you scrap all your stuff you will still see % stored. Do this with enough machines and move a few times you will use up lots of budget.
---
Be smart do it at a workshop , underground ;)
---
Downvote away!! Lol
---
What's the source on this? How much is the nerf?
---
Exactly. Though 1 star versions can still drop from certain events. It‚Äôs really 2 and 3 star versions that are legacy. Anyone with a B/SS/Str cultist blade is holding a Kings ransom in their stash. Very very very few of those is circulation.
---
Both games look like trash without mods. Fo4 at least keeps a good FPS while doing that. A game only looks as good as it‚Äôs worst version and my god fo76 can look ugly
---
Thanks!  Looks fantastic man, well done.
---
**Working dad here!** I am able to complete the daily challenges within an hour. Below I will have some **simple tips/guidelines for getting your max amount of SCORE as quickly as possible**:
---
It takes mere SECONDS for certain ones... such as: Join a Group, Use photomode in a group, Buy or Sell an item from another Player, Eat 5 Pre-War Food.. All of these should be self-explanatory. 
---
The challenges that take a couple MINUTES are: Kill 10 Scorched, 10 Robots, or a Deathclaw (Simply travel to Fairgrounds or Vault 76/Watoga or Deathclaw Island), Claim a Workshop, Build 5 items in a CAMP/Workshop.. After claiming a workshop stick around for a little bit for an Defend Workshop Event to pop-up.
---
The challenges that are more time consuming but can be completed within 15 minutes: Kill a Glowing or Legendary Creature (Go to your favorite Legendary grinding spot and/or random events that pop up), Level Up (Create a new character or run a low level character through a quest or 2), NW Challenges (Most of these can be done simply by hiding in bushes, deploying 3 camps in a row, or using stimpacks - if they seem too time consuming skip them).
---
Rinse and repeat these daily challenges and you will typically complete the weekly challenges as you progress.
---
It is not nerf but rework welcome to online gaming
---
I had the same thing, with one exception: one of them weren't even touched (NW), seven were completed and one were half through (3 out of 5 Pre-War meals have been eaten). I'm suspecting i've been rewarded with someone else's leftovers.
---
My camp is next to the pond behind the lumber mill. The lumber protectrons kill my Brahman every day. Lol
---
"Every Bethesda game has become simpler and implemented shitty and non-consumer friendly practices, therefore you should accept it". No I absolutely should not. Just because a company, for example mcdonalds, began selling female or male only package discounts based upon their gender does not mean it is something I, or you, should accept.
---
When a company implements a hostile business practice you cannot, and should not ignore it.
---
Mine autocompleted too, so I decided to submit a bug report.  Chrome gives an error message, and Internet Exploder says "Select a product" but presents no selections.  Awesomeness.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve almost killed it once but it had regenerated all its health which was a big L for me
---
LOL! Have an upvote!
---
76 is def easyer, than fo4 survival. I remember being killed by rad roaches leaving first vault lol
---
I work 50 hours a week and I'm at level 96.
---
My first (and last), was bloody faster fire. Still have only one piece of unyielding though.
---
I agree with u in the I don‚Äôt care enough until it‚Äôs live aspect. And strangely the only people I see on here really moaning about it, not saying u are btw, are people who haven‚Äôt actually played on the pts. Rarely to things thrown onto a beta or a test server make it to the game unchanged
---
Thank you!
---
Well your name checks out at least.
---
I‚Äôve been saying this for almost 2 years lol
---
I walk. I think the map is interesting in terms of its unique sections (i.e. the forest, the savage divide, etc) but those locations feel empty. Wastelanders partially addressed this but it still doesn't feel like a proper fallout game to me. NPCs really should've been incorporated from the start, now these developers have to figure out how to retcon them into the world. The more I play this game the more I see how 76 represents a (continually repeating) series of poor development decisions and consequential lack of direction, both of which Fallout 4 didn't seem to suffer from.
---
The only thing that made survival more difficult in 4 to me was no fast travel, only being able to save on sleep and having to sleep in general. Other than that, I find both games pretty similar in difficulty...I die in 76 way, way more than I ever did in 4. Personally, I feel like enemies are smarter in 76. I'm constantly being outflanked or overrun in 76 while in 4 you pretty much always know how many enemies you're going to encounter in an area and just where they're going to be. Both games unfortunately suffer from the bullet sponge enemy effect.
---
&gt; Yeah you're definitely apart of the problem
---
I already knew that I am not a part of the problem.
---
&gt; keep that same energy once you try actually getting just a decent SS set of armor
---
I already have it, full uny.
---
As for the rest of your rambling...
---
Dude grow up, if you can't stand any opinion other than your own, you'll have a real hard live once you get out of school.
---
PTS. check Bethesda's forums.
---
up to 50% depending. the less damage bonuses your build stack, the lesser the hit. bloodied and specially melee have been hit the hardest for example.
---
I appreciate your stance on the matter but your expectations are completely unrealistic.
---
They had to balance it this way. The top builds in this game did so much more then the bottom builds that there simply was no other way. You‚Äôre right, other games do it over the course of a year or month long periods, Bethesda should have been doing that but they messed up. They left the status quo for far too long, and this is the result of that. 
---
Like I said, bloodied wasn‚Äôt the only culprit here. Junkies did too much damage too. I reckon that most games don‚Äôt have multiplicative bonuses to contend with, and if they do then most builds have them or something that can be an alternative. Fallout 76 had no alternative to bloodied for full health builds, no full health perks and no full health mutations. 
---
Now I play an AA build, in some cases I felt like my damage was too high even then. Add in multipliers and boom, the damage is too much.  No one was ever meant to do this much damage, enemies weren‚Äôt meant to die this fast. By changing damage sources from multiplicative to additive, they‚Äôve taken one huge step towards making the game balanced. 
---
Should they have done it over the course of many years incrementally? Yup, I would say so. But they didn‚Äôt. Even if they implemented the changes you stated, the damage would still be too high. They can‚Äôt add new challenging content if people 1 shot everything. People who aren‚Äôt bloodied shouldn‚Äôt be penalized because someone 1 shot everything before they could properly tag. 
---
I‚Äôve never played any online game where a build like bloodied or even junkies existed, where the damage disparity is that high between the first build to the second to the third and so forth. Even when I started this game in early May, I quickly realized that the games balance was atrocious and that damage would need to go down while enemies had to become tougher for the game to ever have any meaningful gameplay beyond 1 shorting everything.
---
I‚Äôve decided to do it he pioneer scout badges because I didn‚Äôt really have anything else to do, actually kind of fun.
---
Sorry but its basicly a nerf, if your sacraficing addictions or health for damage then whats the point?
---
I say bring it on!
---
Who gives a shit about the event rewards? They SUCK in comparison to legendary drops and the xp from kills. I'm level 245, and last night I leveled up TWICE during this event and picked up 8 legendary items. Egg head, Carnivore &amp; Strange in numbers + canned stew &amp; broiled SB brain, stacked with lovers embrace, berry mentats, inspirational, and 4 lunchboxes. The lowest xp per kill I was getting was like 479. No stat buffing armor either, just power armor and mutations. I shudder to think how much xp/kill you could get with a good unyielding build.
---
I just sat there in the center room swatting ghouls the instant they come around the corners with my gauss shotgun and VATS. Sometimes 2-3 at a time killed by the AoE damage. The hallways were absolutely carpeted with meatpiles afterward. It was glorious.
---
I feel like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fart while wearing power armor‚Äù is just good advice in general.
---
Sorry! I ment the stat bonuses you get!
---
You probably already do this, but sorting aid by spoil rate is pretty close to dividing food and medicine. Unless you use canned/preserved food, in which case you're SOL.
---
And I sort Misc by wt when I want to get rid of things like ores, extra repair kits, etc.
---
Sorry, I ment that stat bonuses you get!
---
I sadly fall in this bracket i lost 3 weeks of it for various reasons , ive been grinding for weeks non stop , procing the 10k xp 2/3 times a night
---
ive reached rank 75 with a little help from subscribing to fallout 1st for the atoms.
---
pray for me and my thirst for a trap door.
---
Lol if he doesn‚Äôt know he is going to be a very unhappy person. Should have done it with a useless mule. I never touched it because Bethesda can see who has it in their camp space and decide to ban if they want anyways.
---
I use ultracite ammo so it was a waste for me anyways unless I‚Äôm selling it in a vendor
---
Maybe I just had a shitty group who just wanted to shoot. Weird thing is I bagged 3 legendarys whilst collecting the ore. Not sure what the spawn rate of legendarys is in that event is but I‚Äôll take that
---
I played Fallout 4 quite a bit, but nowhere compared to how much time I have in 76. That supports your argument for me.
---
Buffing mobs so they present a challenge to overpowered builds only forces everyone to play the overpowered builds.
---
Then why you wasting your time quibbling?
---
Encrypted: 1st time got fixer plan.
---
2nd as chest piece unyielding.
---
1st fixer drop 2nd day after plans: 2* soppressors explosive.
---
The secret is literal karma. I just give shit away like candy, mama murph abides.
---
no, still 3 points max per piece.
---
That would be nice sadly it doesn't happen. Had a guy steal my friends loot. My friend nuked his base. The guy ran off with a bunch of screws and stable flux so even after a base nuke im pretty sure he still made out better than my buddy.
---
Unarmed is bugged on pts, 1h and 2h doing more dmg, so wait before release and hope they fix it (lol)
---
Coz it‚Äôs lonely on the shitter ;)
---
Lmao, I‚Äôll buy that :)
---
Farting in power armor is OBVIOUSLY the culprit! (Thank you for this, btw LOL)
---
Please tell me how and why they are unrealistic. 
---
Major pushback is the only way to prevent a corporation from continuing negative practices. In the case of destiny major pushback worked. Their developers are completely overhauling the DLC and content systems within the game and they have won back a good portion of their players.
---
Other companies outside of the gaming industry have also tried to pursue negative, or harmful, practices and been prevented only through pushback and public relations harm.
---
You shouldn't develop a defeatist attitude just because "it's the norm".
---
This. Plenty if people still pvp and thus makes everyone happy.
---
What if we got the option with the 'Shelters' to craft a Cryogenics chamber, where all of our other characters are "stored" until they're needed. Then, if you wanted to swap character, you just go to your shelter, and wake up one of your alts. You could then drop whatever from that character into a shared mailbox, desk drawer, or whatever container for your other characters to pick up.
---
&gt;And you do realise bloodied is still gonna do way more damage than everyone else yeah?
---
Yes, respec is a fucking nightmare.
---
It doesn't take that long to get a legendary weapon though, 1 and 2 star weapons especially anti armour go cheap as
---
I have the ID card
---
Yes but your AA didn‚Äôt even get touched with this ‚Äú balance ‚Äú. Neither did TSE or instigating. I‚Äôve been playing 3000 hours and have tried a lot of builds and like I said bloodied could have used a tuning but not this. 
---
And likewise bloodied players shouldn‚Äôt be penalized because noobs dont tag stuff before they kill it. The door swings both ways. The people who are complaining about that aren‚Äôt players who use builds and spend their time tuning them and maximizing them. They‚Äôre doofs running around with pipe rifles and boards and stuff like that. That‚Äôs NOT the player to build your game around.
---
Also you say they had no alternative for full health but that‚Äôs exactly what junkies was. And you already said it was too OP. So either it was or it wasn‚Äôt.
---
Dark souls has a easier respec lol
---
You have to download practically a suite of mods to keep F4 stable while installing mods to make it look better. 76 honestly looks beautiful out of the box. Did it at launch? Hell no. But it does now. Bethesda has never been at the top of the game with textures or character models or even lighting. But 76 is by far the best looking Fallout game yet and when everything is running smoothly, can be considered beautiful despite its flaws.
---
I know it drops from one violent night and is called the nailer
---
What backpack skin?
---
If your prices in your vending machines are shit im killing your brahmin EVERYTIME.
---
I believe monster mash can also still spit a 1 star out.
---
yup, now THAT impacts  the game of others.
---
Have you played fo76 on consoles? That‚Äôs the standard I‚Äôm going off of.
---
Watch angry turtles video. Changes aren't that bad it seems.
---
Yea Idk about that haven‚Äôt done monster mash in a long time
---
Crafting is still the best solution for getting large quantities of this ammo.  If you want to farm some, the South Cutthroat camp (near Top of the World) has four generic green ammo boxes; make sure to equip the Luck - Scrounger perk card.  The North Cutthroat camp has three .45-specific ammo boxes that spawn on a bookcase near the Tinkers Workbench.
---
Are we to be impressed with your 5 characters?
---
So first off, TSEs suck giant nads. Second off, PvP in fallout is broken, but if you can kill your target it doesn't matter. I'll come to your workshop from the front, and give you a timer till I tap it to prove that you just suck. Face me in darksouls(any of them) if you wanna act like true PvP would make it any different. Or Arma, where bullet drop and accuracy matter.
---
So... I dont want them to change that, but I'm surprised they wouldn't want to, considering unyielding helps out tremendously with speech checks
---
Bethesda has never even been in the same generation as other AAA devs in terms of graphics. They mainly just push open world boundaries.
---
"OP tse"
---
Bro. I've never played with that. I was kicking ass in bare bones sentinel armor, a low level handmade, and next to no mutations. Even purposely nerfed myself for a bit because people were bitching. I still kick ass, legacies or no.
---
Ok
---
I haven't, so I honestly can't say anything about that. I played 4 for about 2 years on Xbox before buying a gaming pc and never looked back lol
---
I wonder how big the graphical and performance differences for 76 are between pc and consoles...
---
I‚Äôm sure Digital Foundry made a video
---
O no I needs to use one extra bullet. 
---
Did you even try pts? There are people still one shooting some mobs.
---
The fastest SBQ death I seen is 3 minutes on pts. 
---
Edit : no magic weapons. 
---
You leaving is pretty sad. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll lick your wounds and come back.
---
You also need to realize that it‚Äôs pts and damage can be adjusted on weapons.
---
&gt; least that game has freedom and action. and repayablility. and actually has story.
---
And you have console commands so you never have to worry about running out of ammo at lower levels!
---
As far as i know you've always had to have live.
---
I got lucky making my SS chest piece for my jet pack.  Got a 3 star unyielding on my 1st try.
---

---
They are going to freeze Apalacchia to wipe out the scorcheds.
---
No Text Chat
---
No Item Transferring options
---
...you have always needed an xbox live membership to play this game. because it is an online game.
---
Nope, I kinda stopped playing the game...
---
The only reason I play a Bloodied Unyielding as a main is you reduce the number of bullet sponges. I stopped playing Fallout 4 because immersion is relatively important to me, and there were Gunners taking ten-twenty shots to the face before dying.
---
ok so I hopped on and tested my melee character.  I run a 2 handed junky with a jss supersledge and a vampire buzzblade.  I was 1 shotting lvl 75 super mutants with a power attack just like I can on live server vs lvl 68's and the buzzblade ttk feels the same to me.
---
Are you running unarmed?  If so, there is either a bug or problem with unarmed and judging the pts on unarmed isn't valid until they address that.
---
but if you are running 2 handed then I'm sorry but this is just hyperbole.  despite the lower paper damage number my melee kills shit exactly as fast as before, it actually feels MORE powerful than my junkies commando or even my bloodied sniper atm.
---
I rolled a Bloodied 1\* a few weeks back and now it seems about 25% of the weapons I get on drops are Bloodied.  In this case I went back yesterday and stored any nonBloodied weapons and rolled three times and got a 3\* Bloodied FFR.  I think there is something to what you have in your inventory.  Maybe.
---
Go with the 3\*AA, I had a 2 shot FFR and it was weak.
---
Um dude what? Any game online requires xbox live.
---
Oh my bad, I misread something. 
---
Really weird bug you find, the reader is just outside the office with the marked terminal.
---
Lol you‚Äôll find that the majority of the time no one collects the ore. I‚Äôve done this event 100s of times and nearly everyone wants to shoot. The legendaries aren‚Äôt max level so I collect my 40 and then protect the npc‚Äôs and usually find legendaries in the cave while collecting. I‚Äôm there for the rare rewards that needs all 4 npc‚Äôs to stay alive but don‚Äôt think anyone else cares.
---
Top rightish or map btw
---
It's an online-only game, you need online access.
---
5x4 accomplished +3 in the making at the beginning right now
---
If I had stuck with just one main character regularly, I might have it now at 400+ level - but why? Always doing the same things over and over?
---
I mean, the SBQ is probably because they still haven‚Äôt fixed magic weapons.
---
Just use the 90% spoil perk. So much better and worth the 3 points in luck
---
Yea that's the thing there's no reader
---
Bruh!xbox live is always 1st
---
Lmao another fo76 player who can't read but can write in reddit how original ... When you claim workshop it means you are fine with pvp If you can't understand this fucking very basic logic you should go to kindergarten and learn what it means
---
Really anything man. My alts stash is full of assasins weapons I cant even scrip because I'm capped.
---
Yes, it‚Äôs possible. I got one with +50% Limb Damage and 15% faster critical meter fill on my 2nd try. I know there are certain servers with better legendary drops, not sure if it pertains to crafting with legendary modules too.
---
If I missed something in the math department let me know!! Not my strong suit!! üòÇüòÇ
---
It feels like some developer fell in love with the "2 birds, 1 stone" concept where you clean up all the perk card clutter while also fueling perk coins/legendary perk progression.  Great idea but in practice it's a horrific trainwreck.
---
It's supposed to be that way, and has been since launch.
---
It's just the rewards for doing so are so miniscule, it's not worth standing around.
---
Yawn...
---
Best place to farm 45 is to make thousands of railway spikes and ammo converter conversion.
---
So duping is allowed now?
---
Different servers across the weekend. A lot did come from my private but across different days.
---
People throwing a massive tantrum and quitting over this is hilarious.
---
Anyways. Goodbye.
---
You probably got a free Xbox live subscription for a month and it ran out.
---
Goddamn this is a great joke. 
---
&gt; New Vegas.
---
New Vegas had 4 interesting factions with unique storylines and characters.
---
Nah there was no magic weapons I forgot to put that in. 
---
No big jumps in hp bar.
---
Of course I did - with my 2 best characters.
---
Oh, and BTW - to me, spending bullets to kill any enemy in 5 or so shots (semi-auto) is pretty OK
---
The Wayward. Introduce newer players to the horrors of the nuclear age, plus plenty of varied plants and thick spawns so you can collect resources, not to mention near enough to 76 to make travel cheap.
---
Well you obviously got it through illegal means because to get a full Unyielding set regularly takes an astronomical amount of luck which is why you hardly see posts about people having full sets because the way you claim to play the game you would have to grind like it's a job. You're the one who needs to grow up became you don't seem to like different ideas.
---
I‚Äôve never been required to have a paid subscription for this. First time I‚Äôm receiving the message.
---
*sigh*
---
Yeah my Bloodied Melee does insane damage. But I've got FSS weapons and Martial Artist, so I'm sure having to squeeze in any swing or two is not a big deal. My Bloodied Sniper will likely still drop something before it gets close to me. If the Encryptid, Colossus, and SBQ are still difficult, I'm really not going to sweat the changes.
---
&gt; when everything is running smoothly, 
---
So 1 out of ten times?
---
i use pickmans blade early level and a baseball bat. you can also use workshop dlc and get tons of lead from mr handy gallery and buy shipments of fertilzer from conny at abernathy farms. just need science one and gunnut one both are available witin two levels if you spec in intelligence.
---
That lasted for 12 months?
---
It's mostly when an enemy move fast or in a middle of an animation.
---
Also when they are not moving.
---
It just works.
---
All I'm saying is when me and my friend are doing monster mash for fun, some one shouldn't be able to just run in and grab my baggy of wonderglue and then run out again thinking hes funny.. that's how you get your C.A.M.P nuked..
---
I used to think so but shit.... it's not real life so I let it go. I just revive my lil man and he's back.
---
I know.... it's the principle.
---
:)
---
My harpoon gun sucks in vats anyways. Resilient will be familiar for Gears of Wars players too
---
I'm really hoping the instanced camp interiors are a step towards a shared box. Once it's behind a load screen and instanced I would imagine it's going to reduce the risk of duping/exploits.
---
All events should be like this.
---
If it were possible to make the CAMP building as in depth and expansive as the settlement building in 4, I don‚Äôt know how I would find time to sleep.
---
Shame there isn't a bounty system where if they take loot you can place one on them
---
You don't even know what "illegal" means, so bye Felicia.
---
....
---
I have one, and tested it. It sure SEEMED to work, but it‚Äôs hard-ish to know for sure when 8 other 300+ players are also wupping her ass.
---
I just scripted a nailer...smh
---
No, it just means you have to swap weapons back and forth after entering or exiting PA to reapply the reload speed.
---
All platforms, not sure if it‚Äôs a bug known by the devs yet. But most likely not their priority rn
---
It should award exp for collecting each ore and depositing it.  This would motivate more people to actually do the event and promote teamwork.
---
I didn't even realize that was a thing because I've had so many people shot at my deathclaw out of fright but still takes no damage
---
Yeah look under the lighting tab , forewarning they ain‚Äôt bright
---
I can‚Äôt imagine they won‚Äôt break the game trying to figure that out
---
I'd like bashing to be useful.
---
See I'm right you immediately responded with an insult
---
Daily events give a lot of XP.
---
forgive me for not believing you. you always needed Xbox Live or PS Plus to play 76 on consoles.
---
Remember when in GTA Online you‚Äôd randomly get a bounty from stealing NPC cars? I stole a golf cart one time from a hillbilly in Sandy Shores and got a 9000$ Bounty, the highest Bounty you can get.
---
Now I don‚Äôt know what the highest bounty you can obtain on 76 is, but how funny would it be if you got a bounty of 10k for killing someone‚Äôs Brahmin? 
---
(INB4 Someone says ‚ÄúWhat If I ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù kill someone‚Äôs Brahmin while visiting not meaning to? That isn‚Äôt fair-‚Äú Be more careful around camps and or don‚Äôt take your weapon out I guess. You‚Äôre visiting to buy stuff, not defend their house.)
---
Just a head's up, that glitch is fixed in the PTS so don't expect it to stick around much longer.
---
Well what I meant was magic weapons still work. it‚Äôs just that the time to death of SBQ is not much of a difference if no one is using one.
---
Rather a 3 minute fight then a 10 second one.
---
Don‚Äôt be hasty, they will added into the game like we usually play the game 
---
Now they add Gold bullion into daily Ops as A Basic Rewards so very likely we will earn Coin perk point via other activities like Public event or Daily ops or even the upcoming Map-off Quest ‚Äú Expedition‚Äù with Fractured Steel Expansion later this year
---
What level are you? For the amount of time you spend in a daily event, killing things will always be faster.
---
why in the name of god are you paying for 5 fallout 1st subscriptions? Oh, wait, you probably aren't.
---
Aw that's too bad can I have your weapons and outfits  since you're saying goodbye to this game k thx
---
in the words of Grahm, ahem,
---
"MEET WEEK IS GOOD FOR HUMAN FRIENDS. COOK GOOD MEATS. GIVE PRIZES."
---
It absolutely is true. I started elementary school in 82 and they were "a thing" by the time I was in 3rd grade or so.
---
Given that you can differentiate between bags in the atom shop between ‚Äúdeath‚Äù and ‚Äúdrop‚Äù, the game can already tell. My death bags are a tombstone. It works well because it‚Äôs not generally recognizable, and when it is, well, you know what it‚Äôs about.
---
Tis the last day for you melee builds
---
*plays world‚Äôs smallest violin*
---
because only bloodied and junkie reworked right lmao . EVERY thing in game gives you more dmg is reworked your great mega epic bloodied still doing more damage than every weapon in game don't worry okay. You bloodied  people are so scaried you can't deal 1000 damage per shoot but 600 damage per shoot how fucking scary fo76 is easy and system we got is broken now it is got fixed also there is no risk in dying at fo76 stop talking like dying is huge thing :" OH NO MY 2 STEEL AND 5 ADHESIVE DROPPED I WILL NEVER FINANCIALLY RECOVER FROM THIS" lmao
---
Just start a new character, leave the vault and run to the wayward. Discover the 3 or 4 locations on the way there but don‚Äôt worry about killing anything. Go to the overseers camp and craft one weapon and one outfit or armor piece. Then walk into the wayward and skip through the dialog. It takes about 8-10 minutes, then you can delete the character and go about your day with your main
---
oh so it‚Äôs kind of like fashnacht? Just with different things to do?
---
User account suspended;
---
Reason:
---
Too much logic
---
Really though, impressive. Good on you for figuring that out. Finding a camp with a working calculator would impress me way more than a floating box with stairs!
---
Why do people feel the need to mention when they started playing and what level their character is?
---
Yea same here lol I always get bad armor n yea iv always overlooked zealots because queens r to easy but if you got armour like that then why not use itüôå
---
I just create a new character every day. Get out of the vault, go to the wayward, create 1 piece of armor and one weapon. Boom, level up. Delete that character and the cycle repeats.
---
This is actually really good advice, thank you
---
259
---
I hit the level up goal every day. 
---
I wasn't suggesting Daily events as a replacement for killing things. I was saying that the additional XP you get from quick Daily events makes leveling up a little easier.
---
"Give me cause profligate"
---
Yes I run unarmed.  And its still way worse
---
Ammo too?
---
This is the general state of their event design.  Another one that annoys me is One Violent Night.  Play an instrument, miss out on all that ghoul XP.
---
Do you play on a private server 100% of the time, alone? Because if the answer is no, it absolutely has affected your game. 
---
You may not mind how it has affected your game, but it has affected it. Easy access to the best gear in the game has altered the difficulty of events and enemy encounters, and thus has changed the entire loot accumulation curve of the game.   
---
I would even argue that this has subtly changed future content as Devs balancing for the power curve of the current player base.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to streamline the leveling up challenge and this is the fastest route I could come up with. Works every time and it really doesn‚Äôt take too long. But I agree with your original point, this challenge should be removed or changed to something else.
---
It's not fun or worthwhile is the core of my argument. I went hells bells on the 32 million scorched challenge.This is not worth my time.
---
It took me awhile to get a Bloodied Gauss Minigun at first. Just gotta hope you get lucky. It'll happen eventually.
---
lol welcome to the club
---
I would say both games are pretty unimmersive in that respect. Some scorched and high level ferals can become quite bullet spongey. I don't mind Scorchbeasts of cryptids being bullet sponges, but humanoid characters should go down a bit easier when they're pumped full of lead or energy ammo.
---
It usually happens a few more times a year than Fadnacht, too, and Graham is available to get rare plans from the whole time.
---
Don't say Goddbye yet - it is not yet in production - things may still evolve positivelly!
---
Melee got hit the hardest, because they also changed the way strength gives you damage. So possibly
---
They gave us two free days too beat the ever living shit out of Earle Williams before having a grand feast.
---
Right? Half my time in 4 was spent building settlements and I hope someday the CAMP feature becomes as in depth as that! It's already fun...we just need more CAMP items and they need to make placing stairs easier lol
---
Just running out on a free trial or Ultimate Gamepass?
---
I couldn't imagine that fucking outrage. This is probably the last Fallout game until 2025/2030. Unless they somehow made it single player, they'd ruin their reputation entirely.
---
Damn, angry turtle said it was a magic effect. Thank you
---
To give a picture that I‚Äôve been playing this for a year-and-a-half and have never been prompted to need a subscription.
---
My assault rifle and adsaultron head do do this since update 21.  They show as displayed in the menu but never show up on the display
---
I fully agree. Any unlocked recipes/plans should be account-wide. I really don't look forward unlocking all the mods for weapons/armors on new characters.
---
Yes I am. It's my current way of enjoying a game, start characters all over again is so much fun. Besides, I like to play with myself :-D
---
As someone that has literally never touched a bloodied weapon, I find myself unconcerned. I always thought it was bizarre that people wanted to be able to one shot anything larger than a Super Mutant, and render the boss encounters trivial. Sure, I think that the solution should probably be to just create more viable builds with as much synergy as bloodied (which benefits from bloodied, unyielding, adrenal reaction, nerd rage, and even more,) but I was here for the TSE nerf so I am fully aware that it's not going to go down like that. Do you remember how we walked the earth as gods with like +360% damage just by holding a gun and equipping 3 perk cards? They nerfed that shit by like 200%, and we all moved on. It's not the end of the world to lose your favorite toy.
---
and they won‚Äôt cause they want you to spend atoms and buy levels
---
Well yeah, seems like somehow with some patch they broke it. Searched in this sub and people are getting this same bug.
---
I'd say take a screenshot of the office's door where the reader is supposed to be and submit a ticket to support. Hopefully they'll fix it sometime.
---
If that time comes, I might as well sell it all by zero caps ;-)
---
when you are doing monster mash you are accepting that you are in pvp event he is not thinking he is funny he is doing what event told him to you can't just to pvp event for "FUN" what type of logic is this he is not being funny but smart
---
In other words the failed Austin studio that went under developing a mobile game ended up developing a mobile game under guise of Fallout. Right now,  it's nothing more than a mobile game with their success metric based on daily log ins.
---
[I feel attacked](https://youtu.be/fX0iEIVAgD8?t=24)
---
That's my policy as well. Get in, get it done with all 4 alive and max ore in the bank, job done.
---
Just use the duffle bag. They'll still be trying to find the molecule sized opening to extract loot by the time you respawn you'll have a chance to pick it up yourself
---
Why? I know it can be frustrating a bit, but 1. person might not know it's your lost loot and you need it back. 2. a lot of people if they see a bag they just pick it up without much thinking. 3. you found it it's yours, rule of the Wasteland. I'm not talking about griefers, that kind of toxicity shouldn't be allowed in games, I'm talking about simple thing as what's on the ground is nobody's until somebody picks this up. It might not be exactly fair, but it's not exactly stealing either. you died, you lost it. it's not like they initiated your death. nuking someone's camp because they picked up your dropped glue is just toxic.
---
no treble
---
i got that set of stuff from uranium fever awhile back
---
The Deathclaw in Salem was one of the most memorable moments in all of my time playing 4. I'd probably even put it in my top 3 overall.
---
Yeah, i gave up on that. I did the same thing. Wastelander first came out I saved 70 modules up. Crafted up some pieces an got not one useful out of 70 rolls. Never again..
---
Jeff Gardiner the project lead for F76 must either be the most oblivious or apathetic person in game design industry. So many forum posts, so many steam posts, so many reddit post all giving accurate feedback about this perk system being lackluster and way too grindy for terrible reward - and he's made no attempt to rectify it.
---
Playing bloodied made me lazy and complacent. Never worrying about ammo because my lever was one shotting everything but the queen and Sheepsquatch, never getting mobbed because everything was dead shortly after I walked in to a situation. The only things I worried about at a queen fight were mirelurk kings, bloatflies and ticks. Never had to repair my armour because I rarely got hit. 
---
Now I have to work to survive, I will need to learn the intricate parts of build making again too.
---
I am starting to like the sounds of this.
---
https://twitter.com/jg93
---
F76 project lead if you want to send him more direct feedback. I'm 100% sure he doesn't read the forums or here.
---
Hey hey hey. You get this kind of thing back to Factorio where it belongs.
---
Jfc this is insanely impressive.
---
This is the kind of stuff I think about in the shower, OP.  Just last night, my brain went on a very long monologue about how duped items and glitched ammo factories are a great representation of the fallacy of ethical consumption.   Because it‚Äôs so common, anything worth buying from players, you kind of have to assume there‚Äôs at least a 50/50 chance that the item was gained illicitly, which presents you with a few choices, none of which are strictly ethical.
---
You don‚Äôt give a shit about rare rewards but do about not even max legendariesüòú
---
This. Yes.
---
I have never smashed the upvote arrow so fast in my life. I get around this by putting my brahmin in the Red Rocket Garage and lvl 3 locking him in, but I honestly shouldn't have to do that level of runaround to keep my  brahmin safe.
---
That's my property, that's an attack on my farm, put at least a 5 cap bounty on his head.
---
I thought it was universally accepted among Fallout fans that 4 made poor development decisions and suffered from lack of direction xD
---
No, AA didn't. Neither did TS. I hear Instigating did receive some changes in the form of bug fixes but I can't confirm. AA works off an enemies armor and caps out around 28.9% damage increase, last I checked. TS received a bigger nerf awhile back then Bloodied players are receiving now, it's damage is already additive. That's why those weren't changed. Any multipliers they were using, like Adrenaline, were changed though. So in theory they still lost damage too.
---
Sorry, but what? 'before noobs tag it' If I hear a Scorchbeast, look up and it's already dead, then there's a problem. In the same light, if an enemy immediately dies once someone sees it, there's a problem. Just because you spent time optimizing and tweaking your build doesn't mean you should be 1 shotting everything. That's not game balance, and in the event that you believe it is then I can fully see why you're against this change, but we will never, ever agree on balance.
---
https://cdn.bethesda.net/forum/uploads/f698a8c7-6fd9-4fb0-a1c0-0df9d92d0861.png
---
This graph comes courtesy of Mapex on the Bethesda forums, who worked out a lot of the new damage calculations from live to what they are on the PTS. See that disparity on the left? That's where we are now, on live. That isn't balanced, in any realistic sense. Now look at the right, see that's a vast improvement. Optimized Bloodied still comes out on top, but not to the point that it invalidates other prefixes. No more 1 shotting, no more denying other people kills or credit, and no more event ruining.
---
**That's balance.**
---
&gt;There‚Äôs no reasonable logic for why you would sacrifice 95% of your health for a 70% boost
---
Then don't... A 70% damage boost is insane anyway. You've got people with low-caliber bullets outdamaging mininukes and heavy weapons. Show me the reasonable logic for that.
---
I‚Äôve occasionally subscribed to the free/$1 one-month deals when it‚Äôs paired with a specific game discounted in the membership. But only once I think I‚Äôve ever let it lapse into one month (GamePass or Live).
---
I‚Äôm not lying, and I‚Äôm really confused as to why others are not curious and instead saying ‚Äúshould have bought live‚Äù when I‚Äôm here saying I‚Äôve never needed it in the first place. I‚Äôm genuinely confused which is why I made this post!
---
You can only seek revenge if you had a PvP battle and you lost.
---
you missing a lot then, best xp/legendaries grind event
---
You could have started yesterday and be level 1, and you'd still need a subscription to play
---
Ok I will, I'm gonna get my friend online to come open the door for me
---
120 modules = 60 gauss minigun. Not a single junkies, only 1 bloodied, 4 anti-armour. I am sitting on like 15k 2mm ammo, that come from the minigun crafting.
---
And I only want a junkies with ffr, nothing else. Yet, I did not crafter a single junkies...
---
So RNG is a bitch.
---
Similar yes but much less chance of failure. The hourly event itself has no enemy at all. But the gathering meat part between the hourly event is hard enemy. You don't need to get meat to participate or even succeed at the hourly event but it helps.
---
The devs taking part in this is absolutely shameful. It's gamebreaking and everyone knows this. It totally bypasses every aspect of normal play for something that makes no sense.
---
r/showerthoughts lol. Love your username by the way
---
Of course it will be fixed üòÅüòÅ... Fun while it lasted. Eh?
---
There will always be more interesting little but harmless glitches to help out the lower level players get a bit more out of the game.
---
Mine did not refresh from yesterday, the same set of challenges remained and all completed from yesterday except the NW one which I never do.
---
That's crazy they all drop at once. Early on in the game I remember getting just the scout mask alone an flipping out.
---
I always love this kind of stuff! nice work!
---
yes. thats what makes this perk so great.
---
76 also has many different factions unique storylines and characters...so did literally every other Fallout game. New Vegas definitely wins in the "fleshed out characters and story" department but I'm so tired of people putting it up on some grand pedestal that no other Fallout game can reach. 76 is right there in my opinion. No, that doesn't mean it's "up there" with NV. But it absolutely has the potential to be. I'm hoping over the next couple years that Bethesda continues adding new story content and characters to the game, which is exactly how a game of this type should be handled...and so far they've done a good job with it.
---
I disagree I don‚Äôt think a nerf balances anything. It‚Äôs lazy devs. As I‚Äôve said over a over there are MANY ways to actually balance a game that dont require invalidating people‚Äôs builds or work they‚Äôve done. 
---
Also, I can tell you as a fact this graph is not accurate because on test my TSE handmade does more than my bloodied handmade.
---
And I‚Äôve already stated my opinion on noobs crying  about ‚Äú not getting credit ‚Äú for kills. That‚Äôs on them.
---
And again for the thousandth time, nobody is one shotting a scorchbeast except meleee. It‚Äôs still takes me 5-6 shots on a non queen. Now it will take a lot more.
---
I‚Äôd also like to see what he‚Äôs using as ‚Äú optimized bloodied ‚Äú. This graph has no use without context.
---
I didn't play the game in first 10 days and missed 2 weekly challenges lets take a look at where am I   
---
...  
---
rank 79 WOW thanks to double dailies double xp events I manage to come here. also If you can't just open game and finish dailies in less than hour it is your problem
---
Been saying this since launch man, i get flamed so hard by people here. For some reason some F76 players are hell bent on the thinking each character is it's own play-through. Yeah that may work for their single player titles and you're definitely allowed to do that, but F76 is a live service and there needs to be waaay more alt-friendly features.
---
The addition of wastelanders legendary binding to character is so dumb. I'm okay if i can't sell or trade it to someone else, but please let me send it to an alt at least.
---
I know some xbox bundles come with a year of xbox live..ie if you purchased it directly from the Microsoft store on credit they throw a year of live in...
---
yeah so that is likely a bug. so just keep your shirt on for now and freak out later if it goes like.
---
Don't delete right away.  The next level up is even quicker the next day.  Plop your camp down, walk to flatwoods and register for the responders.  Takes about 5 or so minutes.
---
It also gives you a chance to get the rare responders fireman outfit every time you do it with a new character.
---
They wont use it. It will be seen as an abuse of science.
---
My suggestions for account-wide functionality:  
---
Unlockable C.A.M.P. item (like NW rewards) once you got max rep with a faction. This item is placed in your camp and you will receive 3x faction rep. Only 1 faction camp boost item can be active (like Beckett's Bar).  
---
 Treasure Notes should be account-wide. Sometimes one just want to play with a shotgun, but your character is stealth/sniping specced. Keep the daily restrictions.   
---
An option to craft (unlocked) Armor &amp;  Weapon mods as a tradeable standalone item. (so not to put on weapons or armor only, but like the items we can already find in the world) Add flux or ultracite to the crafting materials to compensate for the increased avaiability. Hunting recipes is a feature, closely connected to exploring and questing. Fine if someone does not like that aspect of a game, but don't dull down the game for others when one does not like to do something ingame. Crafteable tradeable mods is a good solution for all.    
---
I will **not** support a shared storage unless it's connected to the upcoming shelter, underground camp. Then again I believe a lot of players want each character to have its own instance, but I rather see 1 shared persistent instance per account. Items dropped on the ground stay there for 1 hour (I wish it was for ever, but I lost already too many items from server hickups and I don't want Bethesda support being swamped by item restore requests) and there's also a shared stash that can hold up to 100lb for an unlimited time. I know it's small, but it is only there to safely transfer valuable items and (tradeable) legendaries to other characters on your account.
---
I'm still gonna keep playing, if that's cool.
---
Lol only a thief would defend a thief
---
Damn I have a hard enough time finding events I don't even want to do. Seems like there's hardly anything happening these days and you want a filter üòÇ
---
I'm not overweight with junk by the formal definition of junk.I'm a pack rat and I usually just walk around the map. I think I've got three sets of power armor, way more grenades than I need, and enough aid to feed and cure all of Appalachia.
---
Had stated I really claimed the workshop because I wanted to get the 250 season activity points. And I stuck around for the defend of the workshop event.
---
I then dropped a stash box and literally had dropped almost all of my junk into it. I was killed while in the stash box menu pretty much by a one shot. Was actually maybe three hits, but since I was in the stash box dialog by the time I got out of the dialogue and tried to bring my weapon up I was already dead.
---
It was the fallout 76 equivalent of being spawn camp I guess? The guy had 5 to 10 times my level.
---
This is the first time I've ever had anybody force PVP on me, and maybe the sixth time I had been instigated since I turned on pacifist mode the day it was added to the game.
---
I've been a casual player since the first day of release. But being a casual player I am neither MinMaxed nor super high level. I'm just sort of role-playing the game out.
---
He debunked it in a newer video. ;)
---
At that point I'd rather get rid of the whole card aspect and have ranks of things to click into that we could reset at certain vendors or camp gadgets rather than the current interface. 
---
What I'm referring to as non combat cards is the crafting cards, lockpicking, and hacking. They could have gone with mechanic used in other games and let us place ranks in things as we level up. Instead we get cards that we can upgrade and have multiple ranks of to make different builds. The whole concept includes the ability to "hot-swap" cards as needed. If I spot a glowing enemy, I can swap in cards to do more damage to it. It sounds fun in theory but it is cumbersome and not fun in practice.
---
I don't disagree with your solution. But if they're going to let us hot swap, we should have slots for cards that we'd normally swap in for discrete tasks when not in combat.
---
I crafted 60 gauss miniguns. I got 1 bloodied, 4 anti-armour, a few two-shots, and zero junkies...
---
I want a junkies with ffr, but RNG is a bitch.
---
Bad luck man. First thorn ra rolled an autostim ap sent. Second rolled uny 25pr sent
---
I truly love the event but most times no one will finish the event. But I tell you, farming legendaries it‚Äôs amazing. One event I got 7 legendary weapons. But most time the server no one goes there but if I see at least one person that isn‚Äôt a level 8 I go to it.
---
&gt; 76 is right there in my opinion. 
---
I'm sorry, but it's not in my opinion. It took 76 over a year to get NPCs in the game which every other Fallout game had from the start.
---
&gt;76 also has many different factions unique storylines
---
Not in the game world at launch.
---
I was a heavy gunner PA build until level 320, I got my first Bloodied weapon and go back and forth using Unyielding and PA.  My problem is that I carry so much shit if my carry weight isn't close to 480 I am dragging ass.  So I just stick with the low health benefit to move around, pull out the PA if needed..
---
I got a B25 2\* after going on a really long rant about not seeing a single bloodied so maybe your luck will change too.
---
Probably to do what Taggerdy's Brotherhood did not, and that is to execute Scribe Takano's plan to wipe out the scorched, which absolutely does not require a LOT of guys.
---
I got that bundle drop on me after uranium fever one night...havent traded a single piece yet even though I had good offers.i use that mask though
---
Mine used to suicide them selves off the top of my camp lol üòÜ
---
get a good rifle. a fixer or a handmade. even if it‚Äôs not legendary.
---
then work towards a build, junkie or bloodied.
---
then find a weapon. fixer or handmade for said build or a furious or anti armor version of it.
---
if you cant find a fixer or handmade try an assault rifle or combat rifle until you can find that top tier version.
---
then try different weapons for that effect (bloodied/junkie/antiarmor/furious) like lever action, teslas, laser rifles...
---
then start searching for armor for your build.
---
this should get you engaged for a while...
---
Don't forget that if for some reason your challenges auto complete, they wont do anything about it. The whole system is such a depressing slog for lack luster things. Only thing out of it that I love is my adorable Sheepsquatch plushie.
---
Just to be clear even though he is in the event area it is not possible to attack him but, he can run in grab a junk baggy because her be gat plasma tore me apart, and run right back  out with my wonderglue, which, he in turn, had to use to rebuild his base after said nuke strike.. we could have avoided this nuke strike if I could have taken my bag back =)
---
I don't know. I played fallout 4 when it was out, I completed it and I really hated it. It's just my opinion, I really hated everything about it except maybe building. I was sceptical about 76 because I thought it would be the same and to my surprise I enjoyed it 10 times more. ofc it's far from perfect and has a lot of frustrating bugs and mechanics, but I personally liked it much more. it doesn't mean it's better and some people might disagree, but it's my opinion
---
THIS! been saying it since day one
---
It's RNG. What did you expect from it? Do you think Beth rigged all your rolls?
---
Craftable. I have one with +Limb +Reload
---
We'll have to agree to disagree then. As someone who has played a few games with multiplicative damage sources, I'm happy to see them go here.  
---
There's apparently a bug with some rifles on the PTS right now. But other bloodied weapons check out with the above graph according to the new calculations.   
---
Well, now it won't be on them and that's going to be the new normal. Everyone will be able to realistically tag now, like it should have always been.
---
You're trying too hard. I craft a piece here and there and then walk away. Besides if you start watching vendors a lot of this stuff is starting to sell really cheap because we're all getting into crafting.
---
It was a joke.
---
Imagine thinking that an event should be purposely failed just because you want easy mode XP. Events are meant to be completed, that's why stuff like Radiation Rumble has plans you can't get anywhere else.
---
Yea the camo one is so buggered
---
They should make dyes in the game too. Like something you can actually buy with caps. I want to color my swag plz....
---
Tommy gun doesn‚Äôt get much love due to low damage. 10mm SMG doesn‚Äôt get much love due to lack of suppressor and scope. 
---
AAFFR Gatling gun is pretty decent, and will be even better (relatively) when the weapon changes on the PTS go live!
---
you would think that but they don't
---
Its not a scam, it's RNG. Sounds like you just need to put it down or take a break.
---
It's not?  ü§îüòèü§†
---
You can't sell or trade SS armor. It can't show up in vendors.
---
The kind of people to post "where's meat week?!?" are not the kind of people who read this sub with any regularity where they might see this post, nor are they the kind to use the search bar or make any attempt to inform themselves. Is what it is.
---
you would think so but they don't mute me they just complain
---
Hmm, is there a chance that it is 50 unique terminals? I play on pc so I could not tell you but maybe try to get in touch with someone else that has the achievement to ask if they got it naturally or did some grind method to get it. People that got it naturally probably hit 50 unique terminals. Best of luck with your achievement OCD.
---
I think we‚Äôre in the minority. If the legendaries were max level then yes it‚Äôs a whole different thing but I‚Äôm overflowing with scrip. As for xp farming there‚Äôs much better places where you‚Äôre not all fighting over hitting them. And there‚Äôs so much satisfaction receiving a rare drop e be if you gave it.
---
I rolled one. ONE Secret Service Armor. and it was a chest piece. and this only secret service I rolled was a 3 star. and it was a vanguard/resist disease/reduced fall damage.
---
I rolled it for the jet pack and only really wanted was the reduced fall damage. but as I play full health having a vanguard was good. 
---
RNG mate, RNG.
---
From my understanding this is a proposed change. There are many assuming it is going to drop. Wait and see.
---
Happens all the time, tends to get downvoted.  Join the club is all i can say, as it‚Äôs supposedly fixed as of last patch.
---
I shall hang onto these, thank you my guy have a good day.
---
I guess as you say agree to disagree. Bethesda is going to find this a barren game because they‚Äôve taken away the incentive for top tier players to play. If I‚Äôm going to be the same as some low level power armor heavy gun build then what‚Äôs the point. 
---
Just more evidence they dont play their own game.
---
Right but vanguard, unyielding, and bolstering armors can be purchased. And no they are not secret service. They also can have mods.
---
Did you craft them on the same server?
---
One of the challenges for today is kill 10 scorch.....go kill some and see if it pops for you
---
Can't you use them in 76 as long as you aren't playing nuclear winter?
---
You must be new here.
---
Purveyor outside?its a whole band out there.is that what u mean?or instrument you can pick up and loot
---
Agreed
---
Best one I crafted was a two shot I gave up crafting it and other weapons. I got a bloodied shot gun on first roll. Plasma caster only crafted once and got assassins and gauss pistol crafted once got a junkies. Mini is the one I crafted the most by 4 but best I got was the two shot. I just got a magic one from purveyor the other day. I‚Äôve gotten a couple shotguns but not good from purveyor and I got another junkies pistol from her and a berserkers plasma. But what I‚Äôm getting at, it‚Äôs possible but I refuse to waste scrip on modules after I crafted the secret service armor. I got both arms and chest 3 star unyielding with in two rolls but the legs took me I swear 80 times each to get them and I am so put off from that I refuse to craft anymore. So only way I‚Äôll get a bloodied is of any of them will have to be from the purveyor.
---
I‚Äôd throw it in the pile of unaddressed bug.  I‚Äôve never bothered to look it up but I wonder if the savage divide lotto is the same odds as other regions individual ones.
---
I enjoy Fallout 4 a great deal more than 76. Asides from the ability to mod the game (on console and also ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è to the lovely people who made those mods and uploaded them) 
---
Overall its a much more fun of an experience for me, no where near as grindy and I get Paladin (Too much booty in the pants) Danse and a partner. The relationships in the game are far better as well.
---
76 in my eyes needs a crapton of work before it has a good balance like Fallout 4
---
Brotherhood of Communism. I always knew they were bad.
---
That was the design, and it's the only complex build working as intended. There are other builds that are weaker than they should be, the smarter option would be to focus on balancing them. Mutants and berserker needs modified to make them more viable, not nerfing bloodied.
---
Your opinion on the matter, is unnecessarily biased.
---
When I want something bloodied I have my health all the way up. Lovely enough this works for me. I only craft one or two pieces of anything at a time and then I walk away and try again another time.
---
excuse me while i lol
---
You should've added an emoji or something because people are so stupid here I thought you were dead ass serious lol
---
Which you‚Äôre basing on the current game mechanics. a bloodied fatman immediately outclasses in dmg just the same. why would being addicted to alcohol make my gun stronger or wearing wood armor be able to make me smarter? Because it‚Äôs a balancing mechanic. You‚Äôre using broken logic to explain away bad balancing. And to be clear, I‚Äôm not saying bloodied isn‚Äôt too strong currently, but you either haven‚Äôt looked at the math or just want to dislike bloodied builds because it‚Äôs been the meta for awhile now.

70% dmg isn‚Äôt much compared to what you‚Äôre giving up, which defeats the purpose of a bloodied build. Saying ‚Äúthen don‚Äôt‚Äù means nothing. Plenty of us chose berserker/bloodied cause we prefer rusher play styles and want quicker combat, whether that means we die or the enemy does. Celebrating multiple builds being ruined cause you‚Äôre upset over the current meta is just giving Bethesda another free pass on lazy design.
---
I am indeed. üòÄ Only started playing a couple of weeks ago. Ah well, roll on tomorrow.
---
I had this same problem. You have to go back to the previous step and pick up the ID card:  
---
&gt;!It's on a corpse, inside a trailer, inside a shed, in the Abandoned Bog Town.!&lt;
---
I mean.
---
I go to milk the cow.
---
If the cow doesn't give me any milk or can't even BE milked.
---
She's gone sour and should be put down.
---
First lesson, never carry junk at all if possible. And I think the bag should explode should another player pick it up.
---
Here‚Äôs the update on today‚Äôs dailies. 
---
- Buy or Sell 3 items from/to another player: **60 seconds**.  That‚Äôs from the time I loaded into his camp to the final purchase. It took me longer to find his vending machine than it did to buy three Arrows. 
---
- Complete an Event: **68 seconds**. Manhunt. Killed the outside super mutants, ran in and killed Mad Dog‚Äôs gang, found Mad Dog and downed him for the Marshalls. 
---
- Eat Pre-War Food: **11 seconds**. That‚Äôs how long it took me to open my Pip-Boy, tab over to Aid, scroll down to Halloween Candy and press a button five times.
---
- Kill 3 Glowing Creatures: **32 seconds**. After fast-traveling to Black Water Mine, I killed three Glowing Mole Miners.
---
- Gold Star: **0 seconds**; above actions competed this for me. 
---
- Kill 10 Scorched: **65 seconds**. Fast travelled to Pleasant Valley Ski Resort and killed the Scorched from the main entrance and up into the main lobby.
---
- Level Up: **0 seconds**, because that happened after Manhunt completed. I log out of a character regularly when they are just about to level up, and go over to a different one if I plan to keep playing. Then when the daily resets, I log into that one and get my level up. 
---
- Use Photomode while in a Group: **13 seconds**. That‚Äôs how long it took to create a team, go into Photomode, and take a picture.  If you want to add in the time to delete it, that took another 13 seconds, so let‚Äôs call it **26** to be fair.
---
I haven‚Äôt loaded over to Nuclear Winter yet, but deploying a camp three times shouldn‚Äôt take very long. Let‚Äôs say it takes 30 seconds to do that. 
---
That‚Äôs 4 minutes and 22 seconds. That‚Äôs less than one-tenth the time you quoted of 45 minutes. 
---
As I said. A little bit of focus and planning makes this a **non-grind**.
---
Will give that a go and see what happens. Does eveyone get the same challenges?
---
30% chance of 1 Star fits, since it is a 1/3 chance to get either a 1 star, 2 star, or 3 star.
---
Also, chances are you would have spent even more scrip in the purveyor to get even more worthless pieces of leather and wood armor. Being able to directly craft specific legendary pieces of specific gear types should not be easy.
---
I appreciate you respecting me and not being an asshole
---
Hundreds of hours and thousands of crafted rounds and I did not think to equip SD while making ammo. FML.
---
Maybe you can't read, he said he's trying to craft the end game armor with legendary effects, you can't trade sell buy or drop secret service armor and it's the best armor in the game
---
Junkies should do more damage than Mutants, it has more downside, but mutants should get a Bump to 25-30%
---
Yes.  I dont know if it will help but it sure won't hurt right?
---
Lol!!! I would give you some Reddit reward for making me laugh, but I spent all my money on Fallout 1st.
---
Well that‚Äôs luck I‚Äôd pray for. When I was rolling for vanguard I got a couple unyeilding sent pieces so I switched to bloodied. Now I‚Äôve got 2 vanguards AP pieces in a eeek lol. Just pretend you‚Äôre bloodied now and RNGesus will help you out.
---
" Optimized Bloodied = 20% HP + Adrenal Reaction + Nerd Rage " From that thread, I will leave a link for you and you can give it a read.

[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423746/all-damage-modifiers-were-nerfed-not-just-bloodied-explanation-inside/45?language%5B%5D=en&amp;page=3&amp;lang=en-US](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423746/all-damage-modifiers-were-nerfed-not-just-bloodied-explanation-inside/45?language%5B%5D=en&amp;page=3&amp;lang=en-US)
---
That's for sure. Thanks.
---
I wish more events spawned enemies like radiation rumble. Imagine that many ghouls spawning in to try and take down the death blossoms.
---
You‚Äôre welcome to that opinion, it doesn‚Äôt really relate to the original discussion though.
---
There's nothing wrong with them adding things into the game later. Had it been an offline, single-player game from the start, the lack of NPCs would've been so much worse. But they're in the game now and you're just gonna keep holding that against the game, huh?
---
Good thought.
---
Ricochet is vanilla godmode. Fear the assaultron no more
---
No, this would be a terrible change. Be more responsible and plant razorgrain next to it.
---
Odds are, player was milking your cow and ran out of grain.
---
Keep in mind that things like mutants and weightless are almost like vanguard because of the exceptional stats on SS armor. With buttressed a mutants piece can be better than a vanguard scout piece of the same limb.
---
If you get a shit pc, it obviously won't perform. If you get a shit console, you will crash a lot. No console or pc last forever boi especially if it was designed 7 years ago. Use common sense and stop jumping like a worm when someone point that out. Some of the current gen console is 7 years old. Keep that in mind. No one should expect this game to run just fine when your system is rocking 8gb ram. Period. And yes, my PC is a lot better than your outdated ps4
---
This is why you use a TS auto grenade launcher and launch Imposter's corpse into orbit so nobody gets to loot her. Crab bucket mentality at its finest!
---
Never saw it, its usually invisible.
---
Just go power armor t-65 and end your suffering. Work smart, not hard my friend. 
---
If you really want to not use power armor, and you already paying for fallout first or atoms; you might as well shill out 30 hots for a full set of your liking. It‚Äôs ok, we won‚Äôt tell anyone
---
Yes I will, most other MMOS have some form of NPCs, and the Fallout franchise is known for its NPCs so removing them was a stupid as fuck idea.
---
Ah!  I am on PC.
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
Wait so I need to get a second Id card?
---
This is not how I want Bethesda spending their time.
---
This is why consoles suck diickkk
---
Sounds like someone is looking to trade
---
mental  deficiency  of some humans are ... fascinating we must examine you and learn more about human brains about how it is keep working and telling this sentences ... I mean of course if it is still working
---
Don't think it's a bug have gotten that bundle at least three time over the last 5000 hours of play I think they were all on different characters not sure I like to start new characters every couple months or so
---
Hell yes on the plans; especially because there are some plans ***that only have a chance of dropping after certain non-repeatable quests*** which just means chances are most people will *never* have in their main
---
You keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means.
---
Isn't there some account setting where you can see if you ever had live, even a transaction history would show you more info than you can get here.
---
Would rather than they fix some random lightbulb in watoga
---
They reduced the strength and intelligence bones from unyielding I believe
---
What lol I didn‚Äôt know that was a thing
---
"why can't I get this one very specific thing I want out of thousands (? lol idk) of possibilities??? NOT FAIR!! MOM!!!!!"
---
Victim? Jesus christ
---
You see I wouldn‚Äôt consider that even close to ‚Äú optimized‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs played a bloody build then. Especially since he‚Äôs not even mentioning TSE which as I‚Äôve said is higher then bloodied per shot on test. 
---
Tyr is live streaming PTS right now and his thoughts align with mine. So do captain Noobs who is the grand daddy of bloodied stealth commando. 
---
It seems the only people who think this was a good thing are the people who can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt play bloodied so they‚Äôre happy that now they‚Äôre down with them. Just my opinion but it‚Äôs sad when instead of taking the risk to play a harder style that performs better people just want that style dragged down instead.
---
I hwve a plan shop and sell plans for 10 caps regardless of value so new players can better build their camps. I used to give them out for free but I found high level players who didn't need them taking advantage by taking them all to then resell.
---
Fuck yeah dude!!
---
Same here, stopped logging on entirely now. Waiting for the next update , if they really nerf as hard as the PTS might not be interested in returning.
---
It‚Äôs stupid you can‚Äôt trade these besides hacking it so it is tradeable
---
Yeah im with you on the gold bullion thing. Id be getting bloodied gauss miniguns on my non bloodied character.
---
Ok so I do have decent weapons, they just aren't all legendary or all fully modded. I mainly use a handmade and lever action, and I also carry around a tesla rifle and quad ammo combat rifle. The combat rifle is mostly just to make use of .38 ammo in lowbie areas.
---
Mostly I just want a daily routine I can log in and complete.
---
I got a nocturnal FSS + e yesterday. Not legacy.
---
Sorry I can only go by your post. You stated one month later, so that was my guess.
---
But you can check you transactions history to see what was charged or redeemed.
---
Its quite possible you had a card on file and it been charging each month for the membership
---
You should. That still drips and is garbage. I also scripted one.
---
You see Ed. Ed is downvoted by salty manchildren.
---
I made a post about this about 4 weeks ago. I was met with "Just play the game more" and "Its the same stuff you would buy in the atomic shop so just spend the atoms to complete."
---
So my wife and myself  just stopped playing the game. I will not renew my 1st membership (that I bought by the year) My wife will not renew hers nor spend money on Atoms because the things we want from the run would cost waaaay more and I would get stuff I do not want just to get to the stuff I do. The old system was not perfect but at lease you had a choice to buy the things you wanted at a better price. And an easy way to get some Atoms with out all the grind. Good job Bethesda, always finding ways to run off the groups with the money.
---
Same here.  Looks like challenges failed to update from yesterday (as opposed to newly assigned challenges "auto-completing").
---
Eleven times?
---
**ELEVEN TIMES**
---
I don't wanna sound like a dick but it's an apocalypse so people do and take whatever they want to survive... well that might not be SwagDaddy69's intentions but that's kinda what bethesda's going for. Maybe the players in the game can setup some law system
---
It has since launch...
---
From faq on their website:
---
&gt;	Yes, you will need a subscription to Xbox Live Gold or PlayStation Plus to play Fallout 76 on console.
---
It has always been this way. Clearly you had Xbox gold or gamepass going and didn‚Äôt realize it.
---
agree totally, Fallout season pass feel like a Job. its about 1:30 hour of your life wasted every day if you do it fast enough and the quests are easy enough.
---
well lack of endgame just a normal thing in this kinda grind games, they want us to expend as much time as possible in the game and yet they do not know better than give us renewable content to keep players in without burning them out... in warframe scarlet spear burned me out so good, and i was just comming back after the burnout that was fortuna, and now they'll release an infested world with more grind :/
---
Fallout is the same, i log on every day, complete the daily Job, turn in the legendaries that i got, do the 2 daily faction quest and get out as soon as i can.
---
What's with the Bloodied Handmade. Other than being rare, which, apparently it isn't anymore, what makes it desirable?
---
Sir, the fact that you still play this buggy broken and glitch ridden dupefest shows a clear lack of good mental health already.
---
Seek help.
---
Last November I got the GamePass trial, $1 for like one month or something, but when I canceled it, they gave me 9 months of it without charging. I'm still coasting on it for another 5 weeks. Maybe something similar happened?
---
No you can attack people even you are pasifist in events  source : myself because I shred someone who try to kill me in monster mash what she did is smart she just killed someone who didn't drop their junk before going in pvp event and when she saw her camp is getting nuked she left server while laughing at she got someone junk for free and also make them to waste their time ammo and nuclear keycard even she is buying stuff from vendor she will buy it in given time and left server If you are gonna do pvp events where all pvpers got legacy energy weapons make or buy heavy assasin sentinel armor set
---
What platform do you play on? My group is always looking for chill people to play with. I find its easier to stay on track when you play with people you like. I get very bored when my friends aren't on. I'm on like my fifth character and all of mine are over 90. Daily grinds can vary person to person and build to build. I usually start my play by gathering things I'll need such as getting foods and chems. Then I move on to knocking out my daily scrip, bullion, and cap grind. After that I end my night by doing like 10-12 nukes on the Queen with my friends and finish up with a bit of scrapping/ammo farming/and vendor shopping.
---
With Strange in Numbers and Class Freak, Mutations are far more manageable compared to chems. It having a lower damage boost makes sense.
---
Maybe next patch then ü§û thanks.
---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Are you saying the ID reader tells you that you don't have the right ID card, or are you saying the ID card reader isn't even there?
---
Yeah I wish there was a long hair style for girls so my character can look more like me :( none of the default hairstyles come even close to my hair length. I want to look pretty :(
---
Those 'sort' options are life changers after you play around with them.
---
No reason to be an asshole, everyone's allowed to have their opinions even when we disagree.
---
I blew through 40 modules yesterday looking for a uny right leg. It‚Äôs the last one I need for the set. I didn‚Äôt get one out of the 40. I‚Äôve actually had to drop some pieces in the past as I had no storage space left.
---
West Tek scientists: "Yes... Yes, a bug, that's what that was."
---
Modifiers used to all multiply together, along with base damage.  Now you add all multipliers together and then multiply base damage by that. 
---
Old: 100 √ó 1.2 √ó 1.2 √ó 1.2 √ó 1.8 √ó 1.15 = 357.7
---
Old: 50 √ó 1.2 √ó 1.1 √ó 1.1 = 72.6
---
New: 100 √ó (1 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.8 + 1.15) = 255.5
---
New: 50 √ó (1 + 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.1) = 70
---
Hi. Great list I hit many of the green locations and found some great stuff. My question is what do the other colors on the map represent? Thanks again.
---
Not sure why people struggle with this one. My main is level 204 and I leveled up 4 times yesterday without even trying? I'm too dumb to stack food and chems and whatnot. I just play? And do dailies &amp; events like I would do anyway?? And level up? Without even trying?? It's unheard of. They should take it out though. It's hard for people who only want to play for 20 minutes and be done ‚òπÔ∏è
---
The AA25, knowing how things are working on the PTS right now and not wanting to rely on exploit guns to be effective.
---
I found the nuke quest really difficult to solo, I guess I don't even really know where to start with those.
---
I play on PC. I don't really know what to do for scrip/bullion to farm it effectively either.
---
Yup. Literally one of the first quests reinforces Cows being intended for the slaughter.
---
People are posting videos of literally 5 shotting SBQ. NERF damage. Nerf has to be harder, bigger
---
Toss it in the bin of all the other bugs they dont fix. Ask for a refund if you're unhappy with your purchase. I personally like the gray under the camo, its a good color contrast imo.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
But they're in the game now. There are NPCs in Fallout 76. Hold that against the game all you will, but they're in the game. There's no debate that the game was rushed out and that Bethesda completely dropped the ball by not adding NPCs at launch. I really don't think anyone would disagree with that. But Wastelanders has been a fantastic update and there's more on the way. So if you wanna keep holding that against the game, whatever. Stay mad, I guess.
---
Ooh yes! I had a [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/32377) for Fallout 4 that allowed me to fish and I loved it. I could find a fishing pole in sanctuary and flies in the houses and nearby island. So instead of searching the surrounding areas for junk like I did before getting this mod, I‚Äôd spend the first few days fishing for food and junk. I loved it.
---
(Also trout nuggets added movement speed every time you ate one and it stacked, so you could literally eat enough nuggets to transcend time and space. I ate over a hundred of them one time and ran from sanctuary to the glowing sea in like 30 seconds. It was awesome. Then I immediately died to a Deathclaw and a group of Radscorpions.)
---
This is why I've been saving my Scrip (well floating it between 900-1000) and haven't cashed in any of my Scrip rewards from the Legendary Run board. Next Purveyor Sale, if Modules have a price decrease, I'm buying &gt; server hopping &gt; buying, until I've spent my ~2000 Scrip on them.
---
Same. Always happens to me.
---
Especially annoying when the challenge is to get resources and one of those is 25 fertiliser so I have to wait for those and it's annoying coming after half an hour or so to bring it back to life rather than get what I was waiting for. 
---
I've wasted resources on it and I made it so people killing it and destroying the fertiliser producer should at least make them wanted
---
Same here! PS4... I just submitted a support ticket but let's be clear about this. They clearly state that they cannot change or modify our points. Therefore, if they don't reset before the day is over, then we have been screwed over on inching closer to finishing the Legendary Run. A few atoms doesn't compensate enough, unless it's enough to progress a space or 2 (that we would normally get in our daily grinding... because that's is exactly what it is, a grind!)
---
Bloodied hard to play? Yeah, disagree there. In the week that I tried the build, with a basic unyielding 1\* set, it was stupidly easy. Guess we can agree to disagree here too.  
---
In terms of damage, adrenal and nerd rage are the biggest multipliers that Bloodied builds specifically have access to. You could throw in Adrenaline but I don't know if many people take that as it's a heavy perk cost vs taking stealth/sneak perks in AGI, and chem damage buffs are available to everyone so no use factoring those in.  
---
What's your opinion on optimized Bloody?
---
Some people believe it's not fully RNG, but that some Prefixes actually carry lower odds than others. Unyielding, Vanguards, and Bolstering.
---
How am I supposed to tell the difference between a wild Brahmin and a pet Brahmin? I don‚Äôt even know what the Brahmin pen looks like.
---
Mine is usually in my rooftop garden but sometimes it spawns outside of their and teleports around so when people load my camp they can probably kill it
---
Fishing was one of the funner distractions in FFXIV before the 3.5/3.6 grind levels chased me out
---
Yeah I hit up the search bar and took a look.
---
I wish that was the case, I‚Äôve been attacked on this sub nearly every time I voice my displeasure with 76... and as you can see from my downvotes already, people who like the game like to downvote nay sayers
---
Where are all the classical economists?
---
You're a fucking monster.
---
As far as I know, there are some mods that Bethesda will allow in Adventure Mode though it's definitely at your own risk. I won't take that chance. I'll wait for official mod support however long it takes.
---
Scrip is from scrapping legendary items, check out LoneVaultWanderers latest video in where to farm legendaries. You also don't need to do the solo yourself, join a fallout discord. People post events for those all the time. Bullion comes from treasury notes you get from events with exclamation marks and the wastelanders dailies. You can redeem twenty a day at the bullion machine at Crater or Foundation. I play on Xbox but im sure you can find some friends
---
I don't think many people understand the support people don't work for Bethesda. They work for a 3rd party company that gets contracted. They don't have access to the games code and can't do much more than simple troubleshooting and refunding Atoms. They can't tell you they'll work the on daily bug because they're not Bethesda and can't do anything about it. You might as well be yelling at brick wall.
---
I threw up on the grave, and tried to shoot her afterwards.The wasteland is a cruel and unfair place.
---
I did all of today‚Äôs Dailies in about 4 minutes, except the NW one.  
---
That‚Äôs 4 minutes and 22 seconds, if my math is correct.
---
I have never once gotten a good reward for completing this event. Is there supposed to be something in the event loot pool that is actually worth it? Because all I've ever gotten is the same crap you get for completing any other event. At least with legendary drops I can cash them in for scrip.
---
Are you able to buy stuff from Grahm at the event?
---
It was me. I meant to buy it all. I realized I needed more than 3 pieces of ammo. Silly me.
---
The mods are what make 4 to me. The base game is okay and the story is generic but mods really open the game up and make it something special. I prefer playing 76 but there's no denying the countless hours of fun I've had playing 4.
---
They are all tedious ;)
---
I think I did hunter, archer, and backpacker
---
Overencumbered, so I hoofed it to all the towers for backpacker.  OTOH, took care of most of the other two in the process.
---
Why do you keep visiting our looney bin of a sub?
---
Ah, the 908th HTT
---
Coincidentally I also booted up FO4 this weekend out of boredom. FO76 definitely has better graphics and framerate...  But I really miss FO4‚Äôs settlement development capabilities.  I enjoyed making all the settlements fully-fortified against enemies (heck, my defense rating on Spectacle Island was almost 2000), while also providing all the resources/shops my settlers needed. In Sanctuary Hills I built a museum for all my PA paints...  Stuff like that was the fun post-endgame content that I wish was somehow in FO76, although I recognize there are limitations on what can be implemented in an online game.  I enjoy FO76, but am not ready to say it‚Äôs better than FO4.
---
Idk man just tryna prevent it
---
Neat.
---
I second this. My buddy is higher level than you and does this every time.
---
This video is completely outdated since many of 76's updates have taken care of issues that were spoken of.
---
Like in ark
---
John Maynard Keynes prefers playing The Outer Worlds.
---
A brahmin pen is a wheelbarrow accompanied by two haystacks which the brahmin usually don't stray far from (you can view it under resources in your camp menu.) These are located at player camps so it's it's pretty hard to mistake it for a brahmin that isn't a players but if you don't know it existed or what you're looking for I can understand it may be confusing.
---
Are you on ps4? If so I flew up onto your roof and killed your brahm...
---
I would do it again too
---
I definitely want to be able to pick up multiple outfits, as some of them are among the most valuable items in the game for trading purposes.
---
If you thought it was too easy you weren‚Äôt soloing queens and encrypted. Bloody is the most high risk play style as you‚Äôre always one acid hit or radiation. Hit from a ghoul away from going down. High health builds are for weenies. Especially power armor builds. 
---
I would consider optimized to be with nerd rage, adrenaline, stealth Perry‚Äôs, commando or rifleman perks, Balistic Boch and blight soup and berry mentats, adrenal reaction, mr sandman. 
---
I think that people ‚Äú try ‚Äú bloodied for a week or whatever but that‚Äôs not enough time to formulate a proper opinion. Playing it every day for months and maximizing the build will give a better understanding.
---
The brahmin can still die from fall damage at ground level. When you see those "randomly dying npcs" this is what happened to them. It's a physics bug. Keep this in mind.
---
Who cares if the game is not balance for PvEers?
---
So essentially a large hit to higher damage builds, and a lower hit to lower damage builds.
---
Ahhh! I‚Äôm so pleased you actually meant to Ahahah I saw it and was like ohhhh nooo?!
---
I agree: it‚Äôs just poor game design.
---
Some people suggested me to create a new character, but that shouldn‚Äôt be necessary for a challenge. Plus there are people that do use their 4 character slots, either for role playing or as mules, specially for caps given the in-game limits.
---
It's not even there, there is no ID reader at all
---
Of course you haven‚Äôt as I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôve never collected ore once as your goal is to shoot as many things as you can. You can get a rad barrel plan or an Emmet hazmat suit as the rare reward.
---
I'll admit - early on - I killed a camp Brahman not realizing it wasn't just there to be slaughtered :(
---
If I don't like someone's camp or vendor prices, your brahmin is going to pay the price üò§
---
I only ever kill a player's Brahmin for 2 reasons: they locked everything off and the only thing you have access to is the vending machine, and/or they don't leave even a single water purifier open.
---
I admit I am petty.
---
I walked into the Wayward house, did some dialogue, shot some guy in the head, left and didn't talk to her again and wondered why the quest didn't continue.
---
Turns out shooting someone and the head and leaving wasn't the objective. I am now lost in the DMV which, is funny and fitting. JUST CALL MY FUCKING NUMBER.
---
Exactly, we all run enough mutations no matter the build. A mutants bump would have to be significant but not overshadow bloodied or junkies. All for a 30-40% bump. Maybe higher if it required you to REALLY invest in mutations.
---
I never play on private servers, unless I want to farm a resource without competition such as Lucky Hole/Glass Cavern run.
---
No, there is no change to any loot, it's RNG.  Traders/Dupers only affect other trader dupers.   It doesn't change loot drops.  There is no evidence, that people Trading/Duping has non-trader/druper impact ongame.
---
Events arent' affected by it... what they ARE affected by is people making guns magic and using other glitches.  You making and selling bloodied Handmades doesn't affect anyone.  At least there is no proof that it does, just speculation.
---
I disagree, some build were too OP and the nerf is necessary to start balancing things out.
---
I would like this, I spent hours trying to find a new spot only to end up back where I already was
---
Yes. My camp is by whitesprings golf course on the stream so I have water purifiers indoors with the foundation around it
---
If you're in pacifist mode, you shouldn't be able to take someones death bag.
---
at least about Fallout 76 it is
---
&gt; If you're at the event you should get boss loot. I'm even going to go a step further and say that legendary loot you don't pick up should find its way into your inventory anyway.
---
But let's separate what defines as a boss.
---
The 3 legendary mobs in Uranian Fever are not bosses.  
---
Nitestalker (the noise event) - is.
---
The issue with this is that mutations already have positive effects that make them worth using, regardless of Mutant's weapons. In comparison, addictions are a straight up negative: the only reason you'd keep them is purely for a Junkie's weapon.
---
Your brahmin died quickly, of that I can assure you
---
They don't get anything from killing a player owned brahmin, a brahmin is a camp item the same as walls for instance, if you damage a wall you get a bounty, so why not a brahmin as both are camp items? It's an oversight from the developers which will hopefully be fixed soon
---
There haven't been many changes lately, other than the shrine. I've just never made a video of it.
---
What's the use of vampire's when you won't die anyways?
---
Totally agree with this. I‚Äôm full health and the amount of bloodied stuff I get is unreal lol
---
Where is this lol?
---
Thanks. I'ii check that out tomorrow.
---
No, I did the first few times I played the mission. Never got either of those though, and it never seemed worth doing so I quit. Besides, why on earth would I care about EITHER of those? I already have a chinese stealth suit, which is an armored hazmat suit that can turn invisible. I live next to a pool of toxic water with radioactive barrels in it, so I don't need a convenient rad source either.
---
Isn‚Äôt gunsmith @ level 11?
---
The biggest impact of that, for me, is attending an event, then some goober whips out a modified Fatman that shoots a couple dozen mininukes that white out the sky and often crash my game.
---
No, I could not attack him, I pumped 20 explosive bullets in his head for 0 damage, and he just smiled and walked out the door  if that is your idea of a pvp event.
---
Meh. I don't NEED to do 2000 damage to Brahmin to get some steaks...
---
üëéüèª
---
Seeing some people reporting that bloodied mess is still multiplicative with some dmg modifiers when they do their dmg comparison.
---
They're super low level anyway. The issue is when things like super mutants break some crops and I need razorgrain to fix the brahmin and the fertiliser to fix the razorgrain. Killing it is just a big inconvenience because I need to find feriliser or razorgrain just to fix one first
---
what about 
---
- junkies at 50%. 
---
- mutants at 40% (four mutations); 
---
- two shot at 30% (accuracy and durabilty penalties) 
---
- and anti armor 25% (no downsides). 
---
then enemy specific (zealot, troublshooters, etc) could go 40%. 
---
just and idea...
---
when your prices are too high it's a message
---
Thanks! I will look into all that!
---
Besides the satisfaction of getting a rare drop you can trade them for something pretty decent.
---
The biggest problem with this event overall is getting a squad together to do this properly and agree on their roles. I'd love to run Rumble as a killer/runner mix, but if nobody is watching the workers because everybody wants to run ore and/kill and not guard you might as well not even play.
---
And we got this playerbase screaming out for revert when actual management is about to take place cause they don't like their builds getting nerfed. Smh
---
I can see griefers using this mechanic to initiating PVP.
---
As someone who has been playing on consoles since release and between various models on ps4 and Xbox I can assure you that the graphics and performance with this game is mediocre at its absolute best. What issues you did specifically see that have been patched out? Only one I can think of maybe is god rays through rocks and I‚Äôm pretty sure that still happens just not so bad.
---
Ps4??
---
...
---
I spent about 60 modules between 2 characters the other night.
---
Zero unyielding.
---
It's the best non-heavy in the game. A properly tuned &amp; primed Handmade will go through things like butter, without the lag of a heavy spin-up.   It allows full run &amp; gun.
---
Its a random encounter
---
You can also cheese it a bit if you put two power armour chassis in the openings to the two NPC inside the cage thing keeps them nice and safe.
---
The jumpsuit/scout mask bundle drops as one package. Three jumpsuits and two scout masks. It us a pretty rare drop.
---
I usually only kill them if the camp vendors are hard to find or the prices are ridiculous. 
---
I only wish there was an option to write a message on the wall like you do with the free radicals.
---
"YOUR PRICES ARE TOO DAMN HIGH"

&gt;  backpacker
---
Backpacker is a Pioneer challenge, not Tadpole D:
---
Then look where you're shooting?
---
1.2k hours in and still enjoy it
---
I do.  I want to turn those brahmin into pink paste.
---
Yeah outfits are a giving it's the multiple useless items we all want to get rid of.
---
I've been banned for 3 days and I'm still Gunna finish ü§î
---
Oh the suit is an actual item not a plan? I figured it would be yet another untradeable crafted item. I can see selling the hazmat suit for decent caps then maybe yeah. I know the arktos lab coat sells pretty well when I get them.
---
so? I play the game without any problems? And guess what? Every other person on ps4 has equal capabilities unlike PC where some people have extremely great systems vs low quality systems. So what if its an older system? enjoy your pc and console players will enjoy their consoles. pC mAsT3R rAcE!!!111
---
Great, all I need to do is... \*checks notes\* be lucky enough to level up while doing other events or *play in a different way* and grind to keep someone on edge at all times; be lucky enough to be able to farm in *two* areas that both haven't already been farmed because it's the daily (like happened to me twice in a row when Super Mutants was the daily); be lucky enough to have an event *immediately* happen that can be done in one minute flat ; buy a better computer that loads up significantly quicker than mine as yours obviously does (and hope that I don't get one of many bugs that mean it takes 10x longer or even fails entirely); and most importantly of all, be lucky enough to get a set of *especially* simple dailies.
---
I mean, if it took 5 minutes every time that would be cool and all but... thats why I said on average.  Me and Bill gates have an average of 50 billion dollars each.
---
E: None of which, by the way, addresses the idea of being able to take days and weeks away from the CHORE challenges like I suggested, and catch up later.  Is that not amenable to you?
---
This is an old and rare bug when spawns get mixed up somehow, turning an Assaultron into a gutsy but keeping the laser effect and cloak. I've been finding these at Dyer Chemical mostly.

Xbox.
---
Depends what you like/didn‚Äôt like. I say yes. If you already own it just boot it up. The sub info page has a good guide to returning.
---
So.. it does affect the amount of top-tier loot that is in play. 
---
If we were playing a game where duping was not a thing top-tier godroll weapons would not be anywhere near as prolific as they are.   
---
The people who are playing in events are doing far more damage than they would without access to these weapons. The entire event balance goes out the window with more access to these things.   
---
Your point on magic/glitched weapons also supports this point, because guess what, those are getting duped and spread through the community at a higher rate than they should be as well.   
---
The players using duped gear are affecting your game in ways that you are just not seeing directly.
---
Love the 4x times they've fixed this. Expect downvotes from people cause no matter how many times we say it isnt fixed someone gonna come here to tell us it was.
---
It has gotten a lot better then when it first launched. Wastelands has dropped with NPC‚Äôs and a whole new story line to play
---
"This empty, barren husk is better than the stuffed-to-the-brim counterpart!"
---
Hahaha! Those last two are so creative!
---
This is a personal question that requires a personal answer. The only person who can appropriately answer this is you.
---
I mean people are gonna downvote things they disagree with. Exactly why my post hasn't even passed 10 likes lol, people just can't stand to see my opinion that 76 is almost on par with NV. I have my displeasures with 76 too but there are way less now than there was at launch for me.
---
woosh
---
This would be fantastic!  In addition to food, a rare chance that the fish could be a legendary.
---
I‚Äôm always looking for new spots that have water
---
Benefits from both!? Wow, I guess I've been overlooking instigating. I've got to give it a go soon then. I run a sneak rifleman build that uses TSE Handmade which doesnt do that much apparently but I assume it's due to my perks; I havent gotten so lucky with legendary drops, I dont want bloodied damage I just want good damage.
---
I agree. More ways to get a bounty to grief players
---
Man i wish fo76 had the ghoul mask like fo3. Then you could full roleplay freddy kruger
---
&gt; bullion or scrip limits and how RNG isn‚Äôt fun!
---
It isn't
---
That's because too many players have become adjusted to, even dependent on the status quo. Opening up the number of viable builds is almost always a good thing, in any game.
---
Really I'd take the toy scrap it and give her the scrap , ü§£
---
There are always yesmen who will love a game so much they are willing to let it die instead of giving valid criticisms. Shame.
---
Look at star wars episodes 1, 2, and 3 for examples.
---
For me, the answer is a resounding yes.
---
Okay that's not me. 
---
My vendors are out front, the only thing outside my rectangle shaped house so not complicated to navigate or get around and I just throw the plans in a base price since I have hundreds and the lag makes it extremely difficult to set specific prices and makes it tedious per item.
---
My first 2 vendors are entirely just the plans, extra ultracite ones at the base price frome the queen, etc. The last its .45 and 5.56 ammo for a cap each and fusion cores for 55 and flux for 100
---
Sounds like a dying server
---
How do you do this? Id like to xfer my old survival mode legendary drops with my new character since they are no longer available
---
I have a plan shop and sell plans for 10 caps regardless of value, so I don't think the price is the reason.
---
Seriously, there‚Äôs a post every 30 minutes now with someone pontificating .  I wish they would all just move on and stop clogging up the sub with this drivel.
---
There's no fix for it sadly
---
Possible, cuz i server hopped and everything was fine, RIP to the dude who wasted a nuke tho lol
---
Assault rifles are invisible for sure.
---
Personally I think the mutants prefix should apply plus 5% damage permutation up to the maximum number of mutations your character can have. however if you use class freak the positive bonus is diminished by how much or negative mutations are suppressed. so example if you have Max rank class freak you're positive damage bonus is reduced by 75% before being applied.
---
It seemed a lot of those people were also upset because Beth patched a pointless to patch bug when there's countless bugs that hinder game experience and are just game breaking. I'd 100% rather them fix the frequent CTD and bugs of that sort rather than fix some stupid CAMP bug. Their priorities make no sense
---
Yeah man still nothing, no biggie though, just another big F U from Bethesda üòÇ
---
that's why most people do it do you sell all ammunition for 1 cap
---
Lol it was an old bug with a random encounter. 
---
There was a dead deathclaw and when you went to loot the body it was labeled ‚Äútraveling merchant.‚Äù
---
You know it might not always be players.
---
Yeah, those seem to be having problems as well. Just tried one and it doesn't work
---
I'm playing until my wife gets tired and stops. I'm ok with grind but this is ridiculous.
---
Thank you for taking the downvotes just to speak the truth bethesda needs to hear. I love this game but it needs a rehaul if we are going to continue to play. It's only fun with friends for me and only really because we hang out when we couldn't otherwise cause we live across country from each other. That can happen any game and I already see friends being pulled to better games.
---
If I can run around rockin a dress that shows off my manly chest,  you should be able to wear pants!
---
Speaking of which,  is the Tattered Dress seriously the only outfit that has any kind of bonuses? 
---
I mean, I've got no problem running around in an evening gown and cowboy hat, but I do enjoy some variety.
---
Me
---
Um... no. You can come up with a shitty ps4 even tho every single console should perform exactly the same theoretically. Same goes for pc. That's why people are doing this benchmark testing so they can tell if they bought a shitty hardware or not. As I said, common sense. Good on you for being lucky and not picking up a shitty console
---
Duping doesn't effect RNG god rolls.   
---
People are NOT doing more damage than they should because of a duped weapon. zero credibility/proof in that statement.    
---
Duping does NOT impact events.  What does, are people using glitches and making magic weapons,  THAT is problem that impacts gameplay... having 10 more additional people with Handmade does not.   
---
Again, without glitches like magic, duping doesn't impact non-nupers. The only impact would be killing Legendary before others get hit.. but this is not a duping/trading issue, it's a magic/glitch issue.  They are not the same.   
---
Nothing anyone does (except the magic legendary killers) in the game impacts me or anyone I know.  I've been a daily player and have never seen impact because you duped.    
---
Your money &amp; items, simply dont' impact anyone other than the people that also want to dupe/trade.   Don't be a duper or trader and no impact.
---
I‚Äôm using too many other critical luck perks (serendipity, class freak, bloody mess, ricochet, starched genes)
---
Could just be it was killed by creatures
---
Happens to a lot of people.
---
No fix, Bethesda support can't help, and the devs are "tracking" the issue i.e. they know about it, but can't figure out how to fix it.
---
Best bet is to log off 30 mins or so before dailies reset, and don't log back on til a half hour later. Even then, there's still a chance it'll happen ü§∑
---
I got it a few weeks so during the steam summer sale, and its been well worth the(half price) money. Quest overload for me at the moment. Other than the events it seems like a solo game to me, which i was concerned about.
---
The current season is interesting with different minor challenges each day to redeem for awards.
---
Ive had a few glitches but nothing thats a deal breaker.
---
Also it does show it as owned, if you mouse over there is the faintest of outlines where a players ICON should be. Definitely annoying though
---
you go to the social menu, right click on their name, and click on report player.   
---
BUT: you also have to either respond to the email that support will send you or go to [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) \&gt; Help Site &gt; My Support    and then fill out more supporting information there.   
---
In addition to that unless you have photographic or video evidence they are just going to tell you to block to the person (this will not keep them out of your lobby) and do nothing, so please film or get photos of whatever your are trying to report.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs rare clothing. Before the dupe the rad barrel plan was going for legacies as it‚Äôs so rare as not many ppl were finishing the event with max ore and all npc‚Äôs alive. The Emmet suit is worth about 20-30k caps.
---
I hate to break this to you, but a console is just a computer. Even a computer you build can have issues. Technology isn't in these teams of pc vs console. Have fun!
---
If you're talking about Fallout 4, I'm sorry to disappoint you but 4 has as many barren locations as 76 does. The only difference being that 4 is done being updated and there's still potential for plenty of 76's emptier locations to end up being used. Plenty of unused locations in 76 have already been made livelier.
---
put the dense mod on your torso armor if you arent in PA and max out the fireproof endurance perk, should help a ton
---
No one is saying it does affect RNG god rolls. It affects the amount of them that are available to the populace.   
---
There is a higher supply of these weapons in the game than there would be otherwise. The amount of them absolutely affects damage done by the playerbase.   
---
They should be far more rare than they are.  
---
If they were more rare, more players would be stuck with lesser weapons, and thus doing less damage.
---
I experience CTD like once a month. Maybe you should lower your settings
---
Yes. I spent a few weeks off and on trying to find who was killing mine. Sometimes mobs but I spent some time making sure it was barricaded. Turned out after a lot of experimentation the poor bastard was killing itself on my own punji boards.   
---
Build --&gt; Scrap
---
Ok I'll add ya. Ill be on around 4pm CT
---
what are you talking about it isn't live yet fuck out of here complaining about how the test servers handle things
---
Yes, and you're in luck, theres alot of content coming next month + towards the end of the year and early next year
---
Yes, it's absolutely worth giving it another shot. I bought the game at launch, played for a week and things were so bad that I didn't play it again until 2 weeks before Wastelanders dropped. I haven't been able to play anything else on the regular since.
---
Thing is, I don't have any issues cause my ram isn't 8gbs. I don't have a shit PC cause I can spend more than 400 bucks
---
you are  exaggeration it no way you fire someone 20 times and they just watch you with their low hp build
---
Is it that big of a deal? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right but can‚Äôt you just repair it for 1 razor grain and 1 steel? I put mine behind my house and hardly have it die
---
Works like a charm on the rocks of the savage divide.
---
For a very long time you couldn't equip skins on the "small" backpack.
---
People would come to the sub to complain. It happened 
---
fairly regularly.
---
This game really is cruel to content creators. Whether it be because there's barely any actual content to begin with or because of game mechanics in place to punish long play sessions, which streamers usually tend to do so they have a larger audience. The legendary crafting RNG is just icing on the entire soured cake that is the experience for them.
---
I mean, the gap between bloodied and every single other build in the game... likely combined... is expansive. So, not as biased as you might think. Maybe you're just concerned that your broken build will get fixed and you'll have to play the game like everyone else? Because that's certainly not biased at all.
---
this ended up being my problem. i waited around one day and watched the poor brah kill itself.
---
I‚Äôll do it again tomorrow with other locations and events. Yesterday‚Äôs were just as easy, and ***almost identical***. 
---
What was different?
---
- Cook five plant meals: Corn Soup
---
- Kill 10 Super Mutants: If you don‚Äôt know where to find Super Mutants, then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. 
---
- Build 10 things in a camp or workshop. Plant corn, scrap it. Repeat. 
---
Those three and the NW are the **only ones** that are different between today and yesterday. Buy/Sell x3, Complete an Event, Kill 3 Glowing Creatures, Level Up and Gold Star were there yesterday as well. Five out of nine were the same. 
---
Hell, I prefer Tea Time over Manhunt because I get plenty of Tick Blood from that one.  That will take a little longer, but has better rewards and is a Public Event. Free Fast Travel and Treasury Notes. 
---
The dailies are **always** simple. 
---
Cite me the ones you‚Äôre having issues with. I‚Äôll be more than glad to help you out. 
---
As I said previously, it only takes a little bit of planning to make this easier.  You‚Äôre now blaming your gaming rig for some of your issues. I‚Äôm curious how that is Bethesda‚Äôs responsibility.
---
You‚Äôve inspired me to keep a running tab on this. Let‚Äôs see what the real ‚Äòaverage time‚Äô is.
---
You complain about having to ‚Äòplay a different way‚Äô. That almost sounds like it might be a little bit of a... ***Challenge***. If only they had told us this might be a bit ***challenging***. 
---
*Edit due to your edit:* I‚Äôve already demonstrated that you can skip about 25-30% of the dailies and still complete the season. Do I really have to go through the math with you ***again?***
---
*Meat
---
FTFY
---
No I'm not, because he has to shoot me back before I can damage him even though we are in monster mash area, do you see how frustrating that is at least?
---
That whole server thing is a myth.
---
69 seconds
---
on a side note for the fertilizer challenge - just do the pumpkin house daily. The robot will give you 10 pumpkins seeks which you can then scrap down to 40 fertilizer.
---
Have you tried completing them anyway and see if it credits them? I've seen posts before where challenges are greyed out, but still completable.
---
Because I made a post asking about the rare outfits all dropping at once? Ok??
---
My answer is yes, but I went into with the mindset that it was a spinoff, so I wasn't that disappointed.
---
Doesn't matter how many in the game.  Unless you are constantly comparing yourself to the Jones's, what others have is irrelevant.  which circles back, it doesn't really impact others if 10k more people had a handmade.
---
Yes they should be more rare... but that doesnt' impact people.  If everyone in the game had the same gun, it changes zero for any individual.   What billy-bob &amp; friends do by all having a legit (albeit duped) gun, impacts nobody else's game.  So what if everyone has the outfit you like... that is on you.  
---
I've never seen someone's game ruined, because someone else had the same gun or outfit.
---
I agree with OP 100%. I have sat there and watched player after player come by and kill my Brahman. If someone who is reading this is a Brahman killer can you just tell me why. No judgement. I am just actually curious why this happens. I live by a rule not to put negative actions out there unless there is some kind of gain that outweighs my conscience. Since there is nothing to gain by killing my Brahman I sincerely wonder why it keeps happening.
---
Pretty stupid. They should be split up honestly. No wonder it took so long to get. Only ever got scout long time ago on my main.
---
Me: ‚Äúthinks my shit shack looks good‚Äù
---
This mad lad: ‚Äúbuilds a calculator capable of multiplication, addition and subtraction using complex wiring and building‚Äù I built a calculator
---
I would say yes, but there is a lot of ifs and buts in there. They added a lot of content, there are a lot of different things you could be doing with your time in Appalachia. I find using public teams does a lot for giving a good experience if you get a good team going and run a lot of events. The initial story is still a bit of a slog to get through in places, but for the most part the newer content is great, locations have been revamped to be more interesting, there are interesting encounters and a lot of the content added in the first year is kind of hidden now that everyone isn't playing it. I would give it a go, if you have a mic look for people willing to help you get through some of  the slower parts of the game. Put up a post looking for a group, there are people who will help you through the story where it drags, because once you have things fully unlocked the game really opens up with things to do.
---
No one cares about these posts why are they so frequent
---
nice
---
Long overdo , peeps obsessed with power and nothing else really are the worse types of humans ..
---
Meat.
---
Yeah. It's time for a change.
---
Hold on. My main has over 100 levels I haven't even used up. So what exactly happens with all of those levels if I start opening them up? Sorry, I'm out of the loop.
---
wow looks like I was playing diffrent game yesterday when the guy joined event just showed as enemy and we start fighting thanks I should start playing the game you are talking about hmmm ... what was it name ... fo76 oh okay gonna check now
---
Not literally, my guy.
---
In terms of "Barren" I meant that the NPCs of 76 have no depth, there's no creative quests, the weapons are so imbalanced it's only worth using a handful of them, etc.
---
The DESIGN is barren and empty. Like you scooped everything out of 4 and tried to fill the leftover shell with whatever you had lying around.
---
I just look for the ones around whitesprings. When I have some to fix the razorgrain I can use it to fix the brahmin then that fertiliser to fix the test of the crops
---
The queen sometimes stays in fissue site until you approach it then flies out. Ive had this happen numerous times lately
---
I was debating on that. Especially where you can change your character appearance on the fly. Just make him skinnier, apply the best scarring and burns to the face, throw on a stripped top (if there is any), a fedora, and a Mole Miner Gauntlet.
---
When I made Jason, I actually have his face set up to look like Negan from The Walking Dead (comic version), as I have a Bloodied FSS Baseball Bat with the Barbed Wire mod on it. So a quick costume change into some Road Leathers, and a weapon swap and I'm good to go.
---
Gotta get that leather for Atlas somehow.
---
This happened to me for the first time yesterday. There was 3 that were half completed and the rest done. But when I did them I did get score for nearly all of them. Not sure if it‚Äôs a visual glitch but 1 of them I didn‚Äôt get any score for.
---
You'd think their frequency would be an indicator as to the state of the game.
---
I hate that event. I die multiple times, find it a bit frustrating. I only do it for the World Challenge now but then again, I rarely see that event come up. Anyway, yes, you need to get a few shots in so it registers, like the SBQ, you need to do a certain amount of damage or you get 0 loot. I burned through just under 3k .50 rounds on the SBQ the other day &amp; got norhing. But next time, I stayed hidden, when she landed, I went at her with melee attacks &amp; got the best loot I've ever had. I can't understand this game logic sometimes. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
At least you have rice Comrade.
---
Nice.i hold on to some junk .I have a j ss shiskabob that kinda blows but its nice too look at.lol
---
That‚Äôs awesome! If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôd love to come take a look
---
Yeah I was really against it till my session today where I redid all of my perk cards and tested out a few dozen weapons.
---
Now I think it's really not bad, and it makes previously useless low level areas a lot more fun to scavenge.
---
The short version of it is, now what a perk  card says it does is exactly what it does. No convoluted "this stacks before that and this enhances that" math like before. If you run rank 3 covert operative for a 50% sneak ranged buff you get 50% more damage on top of the gun's base damage, which is what logically you always expected, not that it was after legendary modifiers or other perks were already applied like it is right now.
---
So previously with that weird stacking of perks it made it so that critical hit damage perks were not worth the points. They were good when you were low level but once you got powerful legendary weapons and mutations critical hits were much less effective than perk cards that didn't calculate off base damage (all the sneak damage cards pretty much).
---
So now I redid my commando sneak build around critical hits and and took some points out of agility and put them into luck.
---
*Way better.*
---
Now I'm about 75% as powerful as I was before, but going back to using critical hits adds back in more strategy in combat, which is always nice. I'm not even using any consumables for buffs right now, except for some psychotats when I would fight a level 100 scorchbeast.
---
Level 75 scorchbeasts aren't a bullet sponge anymore, they take about 40 rounds to take down, and about one minute if they don't land. Granted that was with a B2525 Fixer (same with a BE25 combat rifle), but a TSE Assault rifle was only a little worse (sometimes only one projectile hit and it really suffered for it) and a Quad/bash/50dr Handmade took it down within one mag.
---
Level 100 3 star legendary scorchbeasts are still pretty spongy. Not SBQ spongy, but with a Primed B10 LMG it took about 6 mags at point blank range to drop the thing. Despite a magic J25 LMG working to instantly kill big stuff like this yesterday, today it didn't work. Same for the insane damage I was getting with a two shot gauss minigun yesterday. Just wasn't doing it today. The quad shotgun that was doing "magic" yesterday was still magic today though. It seems like maybe they partially fixed the magic effect so now it only works reliably on stuff that puts out multiple shots at once, but doesn't always trigger on rapid fire stuff like LMGs. Maybe that will be different when it's on a laggier public server.
---
Also, Plasma rifles and Radium rifles are now both a lot better. I had the Slug plasma rifle with me and B1050 and B25 Radium rifles and they were all working really well compared to how much they suck right now. I think it has something to do with them doing multiple damage types.
---
There's still a weird damage lag where sometimes it seems to lose the damage from some of the shots but on the three severs I played on today it wasn't nearly as bad as yesterday. I only saw it happen a few times.
---
About today's daily op though...  I didn't do it.
---
&gt;!Didn't even try the daily op. The special enemy was super mutants that can only die from a melee hit and they have max perception and if they're like the robots with max perception from yesterday they'd be impossible to hide from. So I noped out of that one.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Interestingly though the event was in Vault 94, which is cool to see back in the game.!&lt;
---
Also, I played a while on my low level character who has no legendary stuff and has never interacted with another player or player vendor (hard mode, lol). She's level 19 and her good gun is a pipe revolver rifle.
---
It was fine, really not much different than before, except that everything that use to be a level 1 is now level 19 and is the same difficulty it was when you left the vault. So those liberators at the vault take 3 shots each, and so do weak ghouls and such. Not bad. Tomorrow she ventures to the bog, which I feel isn't going to be so easy.
---
I intend to grind the event for the rewards as much as possible over the next few weeks.
---
I posted in another thread about how they could really change how they could overhaul legendary enemies in events. That solution is a prime example of what I'm talking about.
---
Most events give you lots of good junk though.  It's not realistic to say don't carry junk to events. When you're getting junk from events.  My opinion is: they've already stripped so much pvp out of this game, and what remains is so terrible, that other players killing you shouldn't cause you to drop junk.  Only if enemies kill you, and only you can pick it up.
---
This happened to me last night during feed the people.  7 of us running around and no enemies ever showed
---
Noice.
---
The pipe revolver rifle and pipe bolt action rifle benefit from both rifleman and gunslinger. 
---
Instigating has only one purpose to do double damage on a full health. It is usually overlooked because after the first hit there is no bonus.
---
The way i look at it is if you kill something with the first bullet you don't need a bonus on the following shots. My instigating  pipe revolver rifle can one shot almost everything in the game except bosses.
---
I use AAE handmade for bigger creatures with more hp like squatches. I use a Zealots/vats/vats handmade for SBQ.
---
Lol see ya!
---
&gt;  I truly believe 76 will eventually be regarded as highly as the OG Fallout or New Vegas 
---
I almost spit my drink out reading this.
---
Upvoted so that people can see this quicker
---
If you don‚Äôt like it, play something else?
---
https://youtu.be/Gw7gNf_9njs this is going to be stuck in my head everytime i do the event now.
---
I have a job, am attending 12 college classes a week, and play 5 other games just as much if not more than 76. If I have time for it, you have even more time than me
---
I've done this before and accidentally bought 8 glowing head mounts on accident
---
Good job with the extra side account for the downvotes and upvotes.  Stay Gold David.
---
Someone call?
---
Are you implying I can't afford a PC? I have 3 Ps4s, one for my wife and son so we can play together. You're dumb and now blocked
---
Heck no, it's my lead now
---
I am, while also providing feedback on Bethesda's general approach to development in the likely vain hope it will improve enough to make me want to return. "Play it or go away and don't provide feedback" is not how we get more polished AAA experiences.
---
*Stay off mah land, ya young‚Äôns!!*
---
Seriously, though, sounds like it would be a useful resource!
---
It is a grind indeed. With 48 more legendary run slots still to get l, eveyday counts. Really sucks missing out.
---
YES! Bethesda PLEASE! We need a way to leave a note of some sort! Imagine the possibilities of content and gameplay if you could leave notes scattered across the wasteland.
---
Lol this has still yet to happen to me
---
thanks for coming to my Ted Talk
---
I've been playing this game completely wrong.
---
I am curious how tanky the colossus is
---
The ones that spawn by fissure site prime seem to take a hell of a lot of bullets
---
Where do you get the screaming eagle?
---
I really hope that the campground just east of ATLAS isn‚Äôt in the radius of the average nuke. I love that spot to deatu
---
exciting stuff
---
3 ps4s won't afford my pc
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but no. The only ways it‚Äôs superior is map size, weapon/creature variants, weather, and camp building
---
I understand this one is a much harder fight.
---
Fallout 76 is truly the modern story about exploitative capitalism in so many ways and we don‚Äôt talk about it enough. 
---
It may be the best fallout game ever for truly embodying and communicating what the franchise was warning us about all along.
---
The rework, as far as I can tell, is done in a way to minimize damage reduction for low level players while increasing in severity as damage increases.
---
Thank the dupers man, they are the reason we no longer have the ability to trade this gear.
---
Yes, they added NPCs, but again I'd like to reiterate that these NPCs lack any sense of depth compared to the characters found in the older games.
---
That's probably why. No one wants useless common plans. You should never sell any mounted plans, christmas plans, or common ultracite plans they are useless. If your on ps4 i might have wacked your brahmin.
---
John wick stares at picture of lost brahmin.
---
Intensifying revenge music
---
So what youre saying is that when you start a new character you literally just want to only have to run through the story.
---
mine was routinely killed by a scorched that spawned outside of render range but still could shoot my crops and cows
---
I doubt you need to go through the math again, unless you think you can come up with some magic formula that gets me 30 or more ranks in 3 days without any real grinding.
---
I'm rank 89 now.  There's 22 days left if what you said earlier was correct.  15 of those days I'd be on holiday, remember?  That's the whole point of this.
---
So.. actually 8 days left.  But I want to only play a few days at weekends instead of every day.  So... 3 days to make 30 ranks.
---
Only, if I'd not been playing every day and doing nearly all challenges that weren't auto-completed, I wouldn't be 89.  I'd probably be 70 or lower but maybe your math can fix that, I dunno.
---
Or were you still just making the point that you can do the 100 ranks with a couple weeks to spare?  That would be weird though because *I literally said there would be time to spare, in my very first post*.
---
By the way, I notice you didn't mention yesterday's NW daily.  I'm Wondering why that might be...?
---
So much wrong with your post, I could edit this all day.  Yeah sure, they use the word 'challenge', and *actual* challenges might require changing your play.  Switching to an alt to get a quick level, or server hopping until you get what you need, or running into the fire in NW, is not a fucking challenge though, don't kid yourself.  Raises a good point though: if there could be something genuinely difficult as a challenge, that would be pretty cool!
---
Keep your little diary if you want, it's no skin off my nose because I can always just point to the list of all challenges on the wiki, including such gems as "kill 3 deathclaws", "find a bobblehead", "kill 9 creatures in NW", and even "survive 30 minutes in NW".  If challenges are getting more and more simplistic then fair enough, but your average won't reflect that then.  Never mind the fact that I'm not even really bothered about how long they take, much more about them encouraging unenjoyable gameplay and less flexible play schedules.
---
But I don‚Äôt have to do the whole fix the reactor destroy/fix the mainframe stuff right?
---
Ran a an event and killed some scorched. But unfortunately, nothing happened üòî, no rewards.
---
Much how they eventually added all vendors cap pools into a single shared pool (before there were 7 ‚Äúfactions‚Äù with a 200 cap pool each, which meant having to travel around the map if you wanted the daily 1400 caps), our cap limit should be combined &amp; shared among characters, for a single pool of 120,000 caps. Same can be said about some other limited currencies.
---
Also, NW Overseer rank should be account wide, considering how sluggish it is to level up.
---
The private server is persistent, so you go in and use containers. Drop what you want to transfer in the container, leave the world then rejoin your private on the character you want the stuff to go to and go loot the container.
---
I wonder if anyone is dissatisfied with the power armor module being attached to each part one by one.
---
This. Tio many people don't get this. It nerfs damage buff stacking builds. Low levels don't stack damage buffs, they only have one or maybe two at a time
---
I'm sorry my friend.  Im sure you have tried all the usual restarts and stuff as well. Hopefully its just today.
---
This isnt an ARPG in case you hadnt noticed.
---
There are no humanoid enemies in 76 that can survive 2 bloodied shots to the face! What are you shooting with?
---
Multipliers doing their job, my commando/rifleman/Archer oneshoots all humanoids.
---
If you're on PC, a mod called TZMap shows unmarked bodies of water as part of the replacement map. [Link!](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/419)
---
I figured thats how it worked, thanks for the quick reply. Is there a time limit before you get a new server or anything? Id hate to accidentally lose some of those items.
---
I have and thanks for your suggestion, always worth a go. Fingers crossed for tomorrow.
---
It goes from a struggle to get clean food and water, to a struggle to find a weapon that isn‚Äôt a hunting rifle, to a struggle to find a viable build, to a struggle to find a decent legendary for that build, to an Endgame of getting the best camp and gear possible while grinding levels for perk points
---
Im level 255. 4 levels would probably take me a few hours.
---
Feedbacks don't do jack shit especially if it's talking about how a game company should be monetizing their product or managing their game cause they are already paying professionals millions of dollars to do that for them and would rather listen to these people than some random blocks on reddit
---
It they are doing more damage to things at the events you are also at. It 100% affects the event length and difficulty of the event.  
---
You just don't mind that it is happening, but it is happening.
---
You're right, it's not always players but 3/4 of the time it usually is.
---
I've tried lowering everything since this game runs horribly. That didn't help much at all with performance nor crashing. I have above and on par specs. Also my friends with better specs also frequently crash. You're really lucky to only crash once a month
---
Agree, mutants isn‚Äôt a build. It‚Äôs an extra lvl of perks basically. The reason junkie‚Äôs has a good buff is because it requires a certain  lvl of commitment to that build. Mutants requires very little in order to maintain or improve.
---
I can't believe you are being downvoted.
---
I mean...I have no life and play all day, but yeah, leveling up is totally possible with this method.
---
lol no i mean pictures from photomode
---
Try dense torso for the screech attacks, I was fighting a level 100 3 star today and it's screeches were doing nothing to me. The poison was tolerable (but I have 50 poison resist armor) but it's melee attacks would one-hit me if serendipity didn't proc. Sort of would expect that though so it doesn't bother me.
---
Also not sure what perks you run but try out the armor penetration perks and tenderizer and suppressor. Also critical hit perks now outpower a lot of the other damage output perks again so I swapped those back in again after not using them for a long time. Bloody mess is no longer worth the slots with the new calcs, better off running critical savvy so you can crit every 3 shots for 100% damage increase. I'm also a bloodied commando build, btw.
---
You are a hero. Doing anything creative like that with CAMPS is hugely difficult. I really wish they fixed the powered speakers :(
---
I still never found him on Xbox and the girl everytime I find her she has chem recipes or bow recipes or just junk. Ugh been trying forever
---
Damn bro. No way we can help but to say sorry. Needs to get fixed
---
I've invented new cuss words. My latest: cocktits shittle bitch
---
No. Nerfs have to be precisely targeted where things are out of hand, NOT made so general and painful.
---
You're very lucky then.
---
It is nearly every time I fast travel.
---
It takes between four and eight times for me usually.
---
I doubt I'll ever even bother with it, that's how tanky
---
is the refrigerator backpack better than the salt perk? i havent got the refrigerator backpack mod yet.
---
Even then I will never stop.
---
While I prefer that people do what you suggested, you‚Äôre a fucking prick
---
I have the others ones do this. Sometimes I can kill it before it even flies out but never saw the queen do this
---
....loads up nocturnal bash movement speed fixer.....LEMME AT HIM!!!
---
You should try managing your inventory then. Hoarders tend to crash a lot and tell your friend to clear out their inventory as well. Your game will crash if you are near a hoarder
---
It really seems like there have been a lot of "here read my essay" posts recently.
---
There should be a separate slot for jetpacks and mods.
---
Going for the slow burn @ 420 seconds
---
This^^
---
I Love to get a good 3-6 hour binge in once or twice a week. Personally the legendary run is a joke to me. I understand the frustration. Everything they seem to add has strings attached and its really starting to wear on me.
---
There lucky so many people love the franchise like they do. Its the only reason its lasted as long as it has. I keep hoping this will become a great game but the more time passes the less likely this seems that will be.
---
Ill probably keep playing but the legendary run, the limits, the poor rng, the weak end game content. Its a real bummer.
---
I‚Äôve long maintained there are too many legendary prefixes, and only a handful are useful. Things like exterminators, hunters, assassins, and nocturnal seem really too niche and could easily phased out of the game to increase the odds of the loot pool awarding more desirable legendaries. I don‚Äôt see much upside in trying to buff them, sorry. Why would I invest in legendaries that shine in a specific situation, when there are others that work in almost every situation?
---
The bonuses from special stats are additive as well, so technically it was nerfed, but because special stats are worth less now.
---
I know about that method but don‚Äôt want to use it. It‚Äôs obnoxiously difficult and prevents you being able to enter nuke zones
---
Become a junkies build and try and get a junkies one
---
It‚Äôll be the first roll you get/s
---
Dude this community is pettily vindictive about basic things like this.  
---
I upvoted but that still wont stem the tide.   
---
As an experiment, if you really want to see how bad it is post anything critical of an exploit being abused by the community.
---
Isn't that what hunter/hunted is?
---
Just use combat armor
---
Sounds good sign me up
---
I mean to be fair, if you know where to look you can find dozens of free hazmats suits
---
Food builds are not affected by this change. Meta builds are hit the most so I think Bethesda is on the right track
---
Found her first time in the bog. I tell you what I have found so many random encounters that I never knew where there. I‚Äôve had near the grove a gusty with cattle and when you talk to it a sheepsqautch comes and when you kill it you get 50 caps. Can‚Äôt kill the brahim either. I‚Äôve had one where I had to recon bugs and got caps. I‚Äôve been playing since beta and there‚Äôs still so much I find everyday
---
I got a B33 PC And my god it‚Äôs amazing
---
Oh the joys of children on Reddit.
---
Still no point, everything will be taken away from you one way or another, in this game or in real life. Everything is a "waste" as you call it. 
---
Also, there is no forever, this game is still alive because people pay monthly for Fallout 1st so they can keep theirs servers and their jobs, if everyone decides to "buy only one time" this game wouldn't exist.
---
CTD? I've been playing since beta... I can count a handful of CTD over almost two years. Are you playing on a potato?
---
I could believe that!
---
It's not happening at the scale you think.  I have the best Handmade in the game and I can't beat queen by myself or even with a few others with the same gun.   I have several guns that will mow through EVERYTHING except the queen, so it isn't just one gun type.   The over damage you keep trying to imply happening is for magic guns.  Everyone having a handmade (impossible), would have no impact on your game.  
---
Also, those same people would need to be able to maintain primed ammo, something non-dupers/traders would have  difficult time with, unless they were high enough level to farm (like myself).   So duped weapons still don't impact, because the majority wont' be able to use them to their potential.
---
SS jet pack skin?
---
I get a lot of sales, people love common plans especially for alts. No mounted heads in my camp, too many times I've been to someone's camp to buy plans which has been full of mounted clickbait.
---
I‚Äôve heard. I mean the one I crafted was pretty nice. So I will wait until the purveyors sweet ass gives me one.
---
Agreed.
---
oh my.... and all this done with this wonky thing of a camp building system.... biggest respect!
---
Still borrows more than a few design elements from them, same for borrowing a lot of MMO things (which also have tools made to have alts being a bit easier like item transferring).
---
This game seems adamant on repeating design problems that have been solved for over a decade, sometimes 2.
---
With most enemies, yeah, but a colonel gutsy already takes like 10 shots with my JFFR fixer with a Junkie commando stealth VATS build
---
It gets worse the higher level you are. At level 500 there is almost no possible way for this to happen anymore without abusing exploits or solely focusing on leveling to the point of it being literally the only thing I do in an entire day.   
---
Even at 250 it required a substantial focused time-sink to level.
---
Yes yes yes, who ever had the idea to scrap perk cards for perk coins, fire them, absolute idiot who obviously has never played the game. ‚ÄúLegendary perks encourage players to try different builds‚Äù ya nope, they just lock us in our builds permanently.
---
I‚Äôd crafted ~10 or 20 and the fiber optics costs... just to get another crap roll
---
same with Gauss mini, just settled for a 1* bloodied
---
After a VFFR
---
last I checked... feedback is what players do. And not on Reddit.
---
1k bounty
---
Weren‚Äôt you just asking somebody why they didn‚Äôt reply to your dm? And most of your comments have 5+ downvotes. You‚Äôre clearly very immature and likely a troll
---
Ribeye steaks increase your carry weight just as much as grilled radstag does, and they can be easier to get. That's probably why it happens a lot of the time...
---
Isn‚Äôt that only between 4 people at a time? At least with this groups of friends squad up and fight. I‚Äôve tried hunter/hunted but very few people bother to do it. Unless they are just trying to get the trophy then it‚Äôs 1 and done.
---
It's not really on the player either way, but I think it is abuse by definition even though it doesn't hurt anyone and Beth is okay with it.  I have no intention of shaming anyone for doing it.  I do it.  We all kinda have to.  It's bad design, though, that it's easier to log out/in to find stuff instead of having other ways to get it.
---
Lore-wise, it wouldn‚Äôt make sense:
---
Richard Grey fell into the FEV tank in mid 2102 (which is the same year Vault 76 opens), but it wouldn‚Äôt be until the end of the year when he gained the ability to link with computers:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Master
---
Between 2103 &amp; 2130, he began creating (&amp; assimilating a few) Super Mutants, so he will be rather busy for a while in the west coast, as the story of FO76 continues on the east coast.
---
Im willing to give it a go, but the 8 person limit does have me a little concerned
---
I have to be actively playing in order to provide feedback? What's the cutoff? Is playing sometime within the last week good enough?
---
Ben leave me alone you‚Äôre cyber bullying please you‚Äôre relentless I can‚Äôt take it
---
So was this essay brought on by the recent dmg nerf? Or just  a general gripe?
---
If plans and recipes became account wide id actually make new characters
---
If you look at the PTS or videos from people regarding the recent PTS update, you'll see some/all of the rewards will be available for gold bullion.
---
Nobody knows.
---
I've already got a decent set of Heavy Combat. I was trying to upgrade from that. Now I'm not going to bother. Just try to get slightly better Combat pieces.
---
I keep saying this and they complain that no body joins, guessing that means there aren't as many people that want pvp in fallout adventure as op thinks.
---
Pick a different game, fallout players want to build and kill creatures and when I want to hunt people I play Nw.
---
Well I still have to meet there level requirements to use said gear. They could also bind bullion gear to only be usable after you complete the wasteland quest.
---
An amalgamation of the issues I've observed since before launch.
---
I love that that's their go-to excuse... "But it won't make sense to do the thing I'm doing that totally breaks the game." Don't fucking do it! That's why it's being fixed!
---
Might actually happen if pvpers weren't such tryhards
---
They stated that BGS is working on something PvP related (not NW) &amp; I am thinking it may be something along the lines of a public PvP team option...but then again, I am just guessing here.
---
if you already own it and haven't done wastelanders you should at least do that imo
---
Yeah after the legs taking me forever I don‚Äôt wanna do legendary modules anymore lol. Like when I crafted both arms and chest with in two rolls to be 3 star unyielding I said oh this will be easy. Yeah Todd Howard laughed while I said that. When I crafted the guass shotgun first roll was a two star bloodied I said oh I‚Äôm good. But since then nothing good. Got ghoul one and mutants from purveyor but I just scrip them. Ugh this rng sucks. One night four weeks ago I only had 300 scrip so I goto purveyor I roll once get a bloodied lever action roll again get my first bloodied fixer ( 250 damage resistance while reloading and and 50 more critical damage) then I scrip my last 40 for daily limit walk back over and get bloodied Tesla. Like if there wasn‚Äôt a daily limit I would‚Äôve kept going. But since then best thing I‚Äôve gotten was a bloodied light machine gun. Everything else is junk and a bunch of pipe pistols. From legendaries when I get a good gun anymore it‚Äôs a one star or bad prefixes. Wish there was a little better rng
---
So it's a non-transferable item and his character isn't spec'd for it and he doesn't want to respec, but because he rolled it he wants the benefits of it?
---
Try armor penetraion perks and tenderizer and suppressor and for the sneak build try swapping out bloodied mess for crittical savvy and spamming critical hits. Also  primed guns make a much bigger difference than before. I know a lot of people weren't bothering with them anymore but now they'll be needed.
---
I was fighting a few of them earlier and while it was definitely a hard fight it was nothing near SBQ level, I was still able to solo one of them in a few minutes with a B2525 fixer and then took another out in about one minute along with another player, I had a B10 LMG that time and they had some sort of gauss minigun. Both of those were level 100 3 star (one might have been 2 star).
---
I soloed Encryptid with the build, but not the queen. Was still too easy. Too much damage, and far too much avoidance of incoming damage.  
---
Bloodied isn't the highest risk playstyle in the game. Not even a little bit. I think you meant to say Berserkers yeah? You know Berserkers right? Does about half the damage bloodied does, can't get any raw armor stats, dies in 1 hit for real, actually needs to worry about incoming damage, Can't do certain activities in the game without vastly nerfing it's damage potential, doesn't have insanely stupid damage steroids at low HP, doesn't have serendipity, doesn't have unyielding, is balanced?  
---
Bloodied builds are for 'weenies' as you state compared to any Berserker build. Your hand is being held by multiple synergies that other builds do not have. You'll still have all those fun advantages even after the balance pass though, and the most damage. Even if we applied all your criteria, the damage for each build would go up but the overall disparity would stay mostly the same, as any build can use adrenaline, ballistic bock, generic weapon damage perks, sneak perks, blight soup, etc.   
---
Berry Mentats have no barring on damage so I'm not sure why you threw them in there unless they affect damage somehow?   
---
At any rate, I feel like there's nothing more to discuss here. We have very different views on balance, and probably won't agree on much. I'm sorry you are losing damage, but the silver linings are still there. You'll still deal the most once the patch hits. I hope you can adapt to the changes.
---
Mutations are already a net positive as opposed to addictions.  There is no reason to make them more powerful.
---
The perk Last Laugh should be about dropping a live grenade AND blowing up the loot. High risk if you die a stupid death while alone, highly satisfying if someone wants to take your stuff.
---
I‚Äôll give you the same lecture I give every infant on here that wants to be insufferable. If you don‚Äôt like a post - move along. If you would like to go out of your way to look like the guy in the straining meme and start throwing out insults, don‚Äôt whine when I say something back at you.
---
Second, the dm thing was an ongoing trade offer that he responded back to. Sometimes people get direct messages lost in the weeds if they‚Äôre doing a bunch of things at once. 
---
And third, you clearly are a child. YoU gOt So MaNy DoWnVoTeS! You are probably the type of person that gets self esteem off of likes and retweets on social media. I welcome dissent because if I see things differently than others, I‚Äôd like to hear their opinion and side. You clearly offer nothing to this conversation and are a child.
---
Off this post too if you want to whine
---
Bethesda:FINE,you will now get 3 perk card coins from scrapping perkcards!
---
I watched, it's his opinion which I disagree. For me it's too much nerf. Bethesda need to learn how to buff stuff to make it viable, not nerf everything. I know it's easier that way, but it's again lazy developing.
---
I think it would actually fit into the game really well! Perhaps you could encounter legendary water monsters, too?
---
First fallout I have played and I'm hooked. Only been on it a month though. Heard it's alot better than when it first came out. The people you meet in game are some of the nicest in any gaming community I've been a part of in the past 20 years. 
---
This sub is full of whiney little bitches though... Hence the downvotes. Have fun mate!
---
What are the rest of the legendary effects
---
I would embrace any power armor love.
---
Yeah not everyone goes easy mode and buys their stuff outside the game though. A lot of us only play with drops and in-game finds.
---
I was initially upset with the changes but I redid my build today and now I think it's fine. All the rare stuff I had still works a little better than the other stuff, so it's still worth the effort and time I put into getting it.
---
I'm not one of the hardest hit builds though, so maybe a guy with a lot of rare melee stuff feels differently about it.
---
Your mother isn't a bully, David.  We talked about this in family therapy.
---
I've been server hopping lately at Lost Home and have found the rare outfit vendor several times that way (not the responder vendor bot but they have some of the same things I think). The bow and chem lady spawn there as well, so maybe you're already checking there but thought it was worth mentioning.
---
You didn't actually need the codes you need keycards codes can be found on tje internet
---
What system are you on, (probably says it and I didn't see it)
---
The furious unfortunately is a single star it‚Äôs the stalkers that has the extra damage while aiming and extra perception point
---
You seem like a very toxic and narcissistic person. Consider seeing a therapist. And no, I didn‚Äôt read those paragraphs you sent me
---
I agree, team PvP sounds like a winner. Bring some of the NW elements into the Adventure mode. But it might not be super popular, so teams might be hard to come by. It does seem like a majority of people are adverse to any people fighting, but there might be enough to support your vision.
---
Same thing with Beckett, one day his brother is alive, next day he is dead.
---
Pretty much all the wastelanders NPC's flip flop on dialog for me.
---
Hey, it could just give them a space to do what they do and not have to blow up a camp or swoop in and kill you mid workshop capture. Hell I‚Äôd build a space for big team battles at my camp just so I could watch.
---
paragraphs!
---
I have my fingers crossed for tomorrow, but I honestly don‚Äôt know.
---
My first rolls of a GM was a 1-star bloodied.  I'm building up scrip for the sale.  Then again, Big Bethe is going to nerf the fuck out of bloody in next major patch.  So you might be better off with anti-armor or something.
---
probably tomorrow
---
I don‚Äôt even have rice
---
If you're a level 300 and you grief me, you can be damn well sure I'm going to kill your Brahmin. It may not be much, but it's honest revenge.
---
You can bypass fixing the reactor with lockpick 3 (locked door in the room). Fixing the mainframe is mandatory unless you're glitching to bypass it
---
Yes, PA needs an update.
---
When do we get ultra-light SS armor limb modes?
---
Beserkers is higher risk than bloodied and needs a buff badly. But bloodied is right behind it as far as risk. Berry mentats increase you‚Äôre perception. Which makes your vats accuracy better. While not specific to bloodied it definitely is an optimization on a bloodied stealth commando or rifleman build. 
---
I agree I think we‚Äôve gone as far as we can here. Thank you for the chat.  I hope Bethesda sees the error of their ways and does not implement this in the current form.
---
You inhuman monster, I bet your are mutated Bloodied build as well.
---
If you die, your loot is forfeit to anyone who comes along to claim it. It's that simple, it's a penalty for death. 
---
It's just scrap, it isn't hard to replace.
---
He has a full set of SS Unyielding. Far from unlucky.
---
Then i would say the first one but i am no pro in legendaries so get a seccond opinion on that
---
I always thought that stalker on automatic guns is useless, because after the first round sent you'll be in combat and the effect useless.
---
true, altough what concerns is really the increasing of ammo gridding as part of they beefing up mob in general !
---
How do bases like this not go way over build budget?
---
Thanks for the suggestion. I‚Äôll check them out. So far AT had been my best source, but it‚Äôs nice to branch out.
---
Not really, don‚Äôt be a prick and you won‚Äôt get responded to like one. If you want to constructively disagree with my post, say why. Otherwise, stop acting like a 4 year old
---
No, a PA heavy guns build:]
---
Seems to make sense. Just need a lobby to do perk cards, then hop into one of three portals - Flatwoods, Morgantown, or don't care. That would be nice.
---
If you're on PS4 I have a troubleshooters Gatling plasma you can have. Should make all the difference.
---
Sorry I forgot to add it but Xbox
---
I did it with a War Drum I randomly got.
---
So they just dont do much damage and just carry a ton of stuff. Weird
---
My bad bro I have a nasty habbit of punching any creature that moves into oblivion. Even the Brahmin at the  wayward aren't safe. I'll try my best but if they look at me with intent there getting a powerfist to there skull no cap.
---
I managed to pass everything using the chinese stealth armor. And the codes you can get every week at nukacrypt.com
---
Lol, we‚Äôre actually making our way through the capital building rn. Literally later today we‚Äôre gonna finish the quest and get roses information. Good luck to you fellow wastelander!
---
I don‚Äôt ever pvp but if I could with my friends and fight a bunch of teams across the map and not have to go through 4 load screens and then death 5 minutes into a NW match, I‚Äôd do this all the damn time.
---
I thought they gimped the GS in last major patch.  But yeah, I've noticed I can't VATS snipe with my GS across the map anymore.
---
Shadow Prime was at the store around 3 weeks ago.
---
Duty.  Sacrifice.  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.
---
I think salt perk max is perfect. 90% slower CND rate is more than enough. What I do too is when I sell the meat I sort by spoiled so I sell the oldest food first. You can also wait to cook the food. It returns the food to max CND after cooking.
---
Then you might have a heart after all..
---
Bruh wow that sucks i have it on ps4 and pc I don't own an Xbox hopefully someone offers to help you.
---
Hold the back button.. You'll exit the terminal completely, no backing out required :)
---
Bummer, I was in the hospital around that time for a while
---
i mean, i came here for content regarding 76, here it is
---
What would you like us to do about it?
---
Sad face
---
I keep wasting flux testing to see if it was fixed.  It literally crafts it, says it's shielded, and then immediately reverts back.
---
It's worse than the camera mods that seem to last a full game session before going back to default.
---
That happened to me and re-installing it fixed it. You can try to rebuild the database first but deleting and re-installing did the trick.
---
i care, i find it interesting
---
Ahh shit, my bad. That would be pretty sweet. üëç
---
Same dude, it baffles me. I honestly cannot relate to people who invest so much time and effort into min-maxing the game like this.
---
good idea. but (at least) pacifist players should not do any damage to it even if they shoot it then. also, Chicken coup should give eggs or chicken thighs !
---
You forgot to actually write something or are we supposed to guess what you are on about?
---
Hunter hunted is boring as fuck. The only pvp players want is open world, no slap damage, no players on map. None of this minigame garbage
---
The only thing they fully thought through were the micro-transactions. The reason for the limits on junk, as well as the whole "drop junk on death" thing, are to make money. Both in the form of Fallout 1st with its infinite storage, and the scrap-boxes, which cost "atoms".
---
Yup I check there also near vault 76 and there‚Äôs another one near Berkeley. But I found her at lost home 4 weeks ago and I saw someone posted they found her there too but I was at work and couldn‚Äôt join server. I‚Äôm pretty sure I when I found her near Berkeley she had rare outfits but I didn‚Äôt know they where rare until I started reading fallout reddit. I have played since beta and never really paid attention to the rare outfits or even guns until recently. I had legacies back then but used carry weight glitch so when they patched it I was 3k over weight and no player trading so I sold to vendor bots or dropped because I never knew they would be taken out or worth so much. Ugh I live and I learn lol. I will find her one day.
---
There is a good mod for that and it's support controller, I don't know why Bethesda don't add the same features ? That not hard right ?
---
im unsure, I just do it as quickly as i possibly can. Something I also do is make sure both characters are in the same spot before i do it, that way i dont have to fast travel somewhere once i jump on the second character. This game is too janky.
---
What platform?
---
They just continued to prove your point really so you didn't miss much
---
Pvpers pvp because its the only dangerous thing in the game. The whole point is that its not casual.
---
I'd rather not give them any space to do their stuff. I used to be in a pvp group and they use every single exploits to win a fight and they dupe, use aimhacks, get hacked weapons and dupe, do rmt and everything they can to win. Bring competitiveness into this bug-ridden game and you will see some nasty stuff. I am actually happy pvpers are quitting.
---
I think F76 has better QoL features, better HUD, better lighting, and better weapon selection, and even a way better map than F4. But if F4 received all those aspects of 76, I probably wouldn't go back to 76 except for the story content. 
---
The online infrustructure is so buggy, and the daily content turned into such a chore to complete. Fallout should always be offline SP first, and MP second. Don't get me wrong, I like the MP side of Fallout, I just don't want it as the base/foundation.
---
I‚Äôve only been playing over a month, so those are the only ones I‚Äôve ever known. Sad. :P
---
Dude, even the magic guns hath been duped. But no, that is not what I am implying. 
---
Also dupers dupe flux dude, and get more prime ammo per run than non-primed ammo soooo....   
---
I don't think you're ever going to see that it is affecting you, but it is affecting you.
---
I'm going to nerf my FO1st subscription and monthly $20-40 atom purchase to compensate.
---
I think that is the problem, we don‚Äôt pay for expansions.  If we did, it would make them work harder on content, so it would sell and they would be getting ‚Äúsupport‚Äù at the same time.
---
Yup same thing for me.  I've done it a few times now.  I thought it was just me.  Didnt know this was a known bug.  I'd ask for a refund but I doubt I'd ever hear anything back.  I do like the camo though
---
Depends what you want to run
---
Personally i do a medium health uny build
---
But if you want to run a full health tanky set, then you'd want pieces that negate 15% dmg for enemies
---
Same here, but one a few different occasions. Thought it was just Feed the People that was bugged. The weird part was it just failed us after the first pause to fix something. No idea.
---
I feel like I am gonna get lynched but... I don‚Äôt find the ammo converter that bad?
---
Thing is, they bring exploits, hacks, rmt with them cause they want to win really bad
---
Upvoted for making me chuckle üòÇ
---
Yeah I'm literally a full time fine artist and half of my time is spent creating artwork in collaboration with charitable humanitarian causes. I don't really understand the ego of "I worry about more important things". Fallout is my only escape and for it to be so broken, and a community I love so much to be so upset, makes me want to rally people together for positive change. It doesn't discredit my other efforts. I know how all these things work too, which is why I'm saying it'd be great to have a weekly AMA/discussion with devs. They'll make more money if they push the game in a direction the community wants.
---
My point of this post is that the bitching and moaning isn't doing anything, so we should try to use our energy positively just like many of us do in our political stances.
---
Grindout Seventy Glitch.
---
(as Thor) "Is it though?"
---
Go for it
---
He's talking about models previously displayed are not showing up. Try dislaying an assault rifle on a display board and you'll see what he's talking about. Harpoons and assaultron heads too, apparently.
---
Whoops...been a while, couldnt remember clearly - must have taken too many rads to the head ... :)
---
I mean the answer to PVP is dedicated servers
---
Its kinda sad that even high level players are super scared to die in that event. I sometimes get even all 3 conduits and still shoot the impostor (in PA, with no sneak), even try to get in between players and her! Try to rez anyone who is down. Yet, some turds still sit in far far away, cloaked and (almost glitch like) explosive couple shot her.
---
So even if she is not taking damage, i make sure i shoot her at least couple times....
---
Yup.. so again, the problem is with the magic gun. Only because it shortens fight so much people can't get a hit in.   
---
So again, it only affects the dupers.. non-dupers/traders aren't impacted. 
---
Out of 10 queen runs yesterday, only 1 had someone that killed it in 10 seconds.    
---
I'm not saying duping isn't an issue for some, but it's a choice.  I dont' play in the duping/trading community so it has NO impact on me.  It doesnt' change any battles or anything in the game... only the Magic does.
---
Yep. Hold the back button.
---
I think we all know nobody would fish with a pole. Not when grenades are so readily available.
---
My concern is that just starts a cycle of power creep where each new release just brings more and more power into the game and the old material just becomes more and more worthless.
---
My hope is that by rebalancing some meta items (and I mean anything that's considered really OP as I hate to just say bloodied) and with the new F for everyone they can rebalance the game so that power level is controlled and when new items and material is introduced it just adds to the game rather than being the "must have" power creep of the week - I've seen that power creep in so many games that just ruined them...get a little behind on the grind and you get run over by new material as it's always balanced to the latest power creep.
---
Wish I knew this outfit was rare when I started. I got it and Think I sold it cuz I did t like how it looked
---
I've burned dozens to build a full UY set.  UY is going to be sorta nerfed in next big update, but you'll still enjoy the extra intelligence boost for XP.
---
Exactly.  I swear this is a "tax the rich" mentality.  Ya boi out hear makin' 30k a year so scared he gonna get taxed.  Boi, ya ain't gettin' taxed. The unarmed nukashine user that 2 or 3 punches the sbq is getting the damage tax.
---
I've trashed a couple player houses. One was worth remembering. All accidental mind you. I got attacked by a scorchbeast right in a players camp. I did kill the SB and repair some of the house that had been destroyed in the battle after though.
---
Until the scorchbeast comes by...
---
What are the current mods on the gun? Rarely do you get an all standard drop.
---
Again I say find a different game. I want them to focus on adventure mode and not spreading time over another game mode
---
I think melee should be more powerful than some ranged builds (maybe not better than a sniper build, but on par with it as far as damage per hit).
---
I think maybe buffs to incoming damage reduction that only benefit melee are the answer.
---
There should be a chest armor mod that gives a percent based damage reduction when holding a melee weapon or an armor mod that has a percent based damage reduction but doesn't let you equip a ranged weapon.
---
4gb GPU and CPU. My friend with a 3.Xgb cpu and 8gb GPU also gets crashes just as often
---
Sounds like you just need a new location.
---
Some tips (I get it about 40%ott): Be a little deliberate in your pacing between stopping your movement, opening the map, clicking on the location, clicking on the following dialogue box(es). Also, and most importantly, only use the mouse and make sure you get the center and the tip of the cursor arrow in the yellow selection boxes. This helps me most of the time. If not, try walking to a different elevation or to an area furthest from likely spawns.
---
 I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre quite a low lvl?
---
I agree, we shouldnt have to make new characters to complete this. I appreciate everyone giving me solutions, but ultimately the quest should be looked at, or we should get easier ways to accumulate lots of exp besides going on a wasteland wide rampage for ~45mins
---
Yeah, I tried the Uny/bloodied thing and didn‚Äôt like it too much. I play melee and was too squishy, even with the right perks and full unyielding.
---
Well yeah of course but in general I see the biggest issue being that the end game is just an eternity of grind. That's why I stopped playing. Nothin to do any more
---
So, you want to take off 15 days (over 20%) of the season and *still* get to Rank 100?  Well, luckily the math supports that, **if you plan ahead.**
---
Yesterday‚Äôs NW daily was Revive 2 Players. Why does that matter?  As I said, five of the nine were the same between yesterday and today. And it‚Äôs one of the few Dailies that requires a little extra coordination. 
---
You can ignore the NW challenges completely and still finish. Some of them are easy, others are not. Do the ones that are easy if you choose. But that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs only one per day.
---
Your entire argument boils down to ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to have any change to the way I ***personally*** play at all and still get enough SCORE to finish the Season.‚Äô
---
Too bad. If you want the rewards you need to put in some effort. The fact that you don‚Äôt like the *kind* of effort is irrelevant. 
---
The majority of the community does most (but not all) of these actions anyways. The fact that they‚Äôre now listed as specific goals seems to bother you.
---
If your preferred play style doesn‚Äôt fit into any of the daily challenges, then you wouldn‚Äôt get any of the higher rewards anyways. Regardless of how many days you could miss or even if they were weeklies or **monthlies** instead of dailies.
---
Your demeanor comes across as very entitled. 
---
Gimme the stuff but I don‚Äôt want to have to do anything different than ***MY*** normal to get it. 
---
You just want them given to you. You don‚Äôt want to **earn** them. 
---
And all this over some cosmetics and aesthetics. Tsk, tsk.
---
Ouch!! That sucks. It would be cool if we had a sub where people posted when they found this merchant so others could join. There probably is one I just don't know about it.
---
I forgot about the crit misses, I've had a bunch of those today!
---
Back button is your friend for sure. Hold to exit the machine. Tap to return to previous transaction. Not ideal, but makes the machine more usable.
---
Lol I‚Äôm used to the fO76 market where you don‚Äôt have to explain the full thing. üòÇ basically you can use scrip to craft bigger bulks of ammo at a tinkerers bench. You‚Äôll still have to use the other resources but like 1 scrip would be enough to make the bigger bulk. Just a thought that popped in my head because I use a gauss minigun and getting ammo for that is a pain.
---
Which platform are you on?
---
I'd say bloodied isn't as enticing now with the upcoming damage nerf (if it stands). Unyielding vampire is gonna be very popular. I'd look for vampires, anti armor, junkies, instigating. Furious is cool too.
---
Odd. I had the same issue, but I had used the tool to let me see components of objects (modifying strings).  I had to remove it and it fixed itself, but you apparently haven't done this.  Odd.
---
They still have request now for video not screen shots, want me to upload to web? Where
---
his is to much trouble to play their todler game board
---
It's such a bummer, because their past games have been so great and you could feel the passion. Sure they're buggy but they're still /fun/ for a long time. The ideal answer is that a huge portion of players just stop playing for a while, but that's a really hard thing to organize.
---
That‚Äôs a system problem. You want bugs and hacks to stop, then that‚Äôs on BGS. If people are given tools and paths to create chaos they will do so. I‚Äôm on PS4 so I don‚Äôt really bump into this as much as say a PC player but at least pvpers will do this to each other more and hopefully less to the pve players.
---
Trying not to laugh out at these at work was hard, but worth it!
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if *you* added any mods. It matters if the weapon has mods on it right now. 
---
Go to a weapon workbench and mod it back to standard, then look at the weight ***again***.
---
Mutant's should give a large damage bonus for having a single mutation, then give diminishing returns the more mutations you have. That could create some interesting builds. As it stands, there just really isn't that much of a downside if specced for mutations.
---
Haven't added a thing
---
It could have a different magazine than standard...and rifles weigh a ton, just FYI.
---
I haven't, I'll give it a whirl and see what if it helps.
---
When its a scorchbeast, its a little less easy.
---
No?  They are two different effects that require the same star.  They are mutually exclusive.
---
2 star with a Penta barrel would be pretty epic.  Not sure if AA works against SBQ.
---
I only have a standard receiver 
---
Havent added anything yet
---
A mix of 15% damage reduction armour would probably be good for a tanky set
---
Not sure about perks but blocker is a good one, and i believe theres a perk that avoids damage by using AP
---
Somebody call Hitler,he just lost his title.
---
Tomorrow
---
Yes. Jetpacks need to have a separate slot of their own for the chestpiece. They are pretty heavily underused since a lot of people go for emergency protocols, and this is a shame since there are so many skins.
---
Have my upvote!  I was thinking the same thing, until I continued reading.
---
It's funny that an opinion can do that to a person!
---
I did like fallout 4 but for me it felt like a rehash of fallout 3 in new generation graphics, fallout 76 was fun and I like the grinding but both failed to be as good for me personally as fallout 3, new Vegas, 1 and 2 as fallout 4 and 76 had incredible bland campaign and the dlc for 4 was bland the only one I liked was far harbor and Nuka cola was ok, wastelanders was ok, better then the main campaign but new Vegas definitely has some of the best dlc because they were written really well, fallout 3 dlc was fun and personally 4 was there primarily for dlc but to choose between fallout 4 and 76  I would choose 4 because of the mods. as the endgame of 76 you have really nothing to do and fallout 4 you have mods which can expand the endgame
---
Removing pvp can be a solution as well cause it work as a hatchery of exploiters. I don't know about consoles but PC has seen massive decrease of griefers, hackers in public session since wastelanders
---
Very ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
I won't like o accidentally killed a players megasloth I forgot you could have pets and I cut him in half with the light machine gun big F for me
---
Dodgy?  Yeah, I got that guy already from the bloodied build I ran
---
oh wow, thank you! I just never would have imagined.
---
Those are all pluses I would give to 76, yes.
---
Does 4.9 weight count as reduced by 90% ???
---
Bloodied weapons and Junkies are mutually exclusive. But the true power of a "bloodied build" comes from the low life synergies of unyielding armor, nerd rage, serendipity, and adrenal reaction. Junkies *can* use that synergy to tremendous effect.
---
Low life Junkies is not as good as bloodied on paper, but in practice its still so good as not to matter.
---
What are the mods **on** the weapon?  You‚Äôre telling me that everything on it is the base mod?  Stock, Barrel, etc?
---
Yes that would be nice. I‚Äôve seen a couple ppl saying they found her but unfortunately I was always working.
---
I guess that's what happens when the only decide to add NPCs with the most recent big update. Imagine what the game could've been had they been there since launch.
---
Just check its 4.9lbs 
---
But is that really 90% reduced?
---
Wait.....I can kill player Brahmin? 
---
Sweet ü§ô
---
I didn't find it all that bad, but I would have liked if they included the ammo count for the type you are converting. I found myself trying the x100 or x10 and getting kicked to error since I didn't have enough ammo. I'd then have to re-access and use a lower "x' modifier.
---
I went to the SBQ for the first time with a newer character (just passed 50), but whomever dropped the nuke dropped it to cover over the glassed cavern and the bunker then started the fight to the east of the cavern. It was a pretty long fight as she just wouldn't land (and once or twice when she did she lost a lot of health fast) and when it ended she seized up and then lunged over the fence and out of bounds...JUST out of reach and no more.
---
But I want them to be cooked after one hit
---
If they hadn't chickened out of the presidential seal system in the bunker, that would have been an epic reward.  Nuclear football with a day or week cooldown.
---
No, we don't need the ability to scrap cards. We simply need a better perk management system where we can choose between perk levels, save loadputs, and aren't forced to scroll through a million unused cards every time we want to swap something out.
---
Thank you! Glad I asked!
---
I don't disagree with any of that. Imo, Fallout should always be single player first. But I don't necessarily think it ended up in a bad place with 76...and if this is the only multiplayer Fallout we get for the foreseeable future, then that's fine with me. I've been having a blast exploring Appalachia with friends (one of which 76 is his first Fallout game ever).
---
There is nothing super mutants love more than shooting some razorgrain.
---
Fallout has a bargain economy.. 
---
hence why the 30k cap and the way we trade items
---
Thank you! Glad I asked! I intend on using it periodically for sure, as opposed to just dumping ammo at train stations.
---
Yes. It reduces off the stock weapon, then adds the weight of any mods. 
---
You say there are no mods on it, everyone is trying to tell you there are. It might be a long barrel. It might be a magazine. Your gun is simply not stock at 4.9 lbs with 90% rw.
---
Yep, I have one. It is GLORIOUS.
---
Lol. FR. I've got a brahmin that works as a porter in my diner kitchen and people be blowing her brains all over the walls daily.
---
Just look at this mess... [Poor Bertha](https://imgur.com/FVoaehn)
---
For the daily challenge "buy/sell 3 items".
---
I will buy 3 individual rounds of ammo most days to get that completed quick
---
For the daily challenge buy 3 things from a player
---
I just re-installed last week... ffs
---
Guns drop with mods pre-installed. Mods dont get their weight reduced.
---
It's when you stagger her at a very particular point in time.
---
After she does her circling animation where she flies around a bit she will search for a target then take 1 of 3 options, land to melee if the target is in range and valid, do her scream cycle if the target is in line of sight, or crop dust if else. She chooses at random and if her attack fails defaults to crop dusting.
---
If you stagger her during this time it causes her to lose her target and try to find a new one, there is a whole lot of behind the scene math and prioritization we are not privy to, but in general she prefers players with a high visibility (think stealth, so noise, movement, ect), dealing damage to her, and line of sight, proximity, recently targeted/not targeted, with a random factor. If you have 5 dummies standing in invalid locations firing away at her she is more likely to target them, meaning less likely to be able to land.
---
If you are the only target, or all targets are valid it is not a problem in itself.
---
It is. I've seen many good companies go sideways for the sake of saving a dollar and there to make the investors happy. Investments and return expectations will always be a priority. If people keep buying digital currencies and subscribe to FO 1st, then they will see it as a demand and will continue in the same way.
---
That doesn‚Äôt matter. Guns drop with a random assortment of mods already installed. No matter the source of the modification, 90% weight reduction doesn‚Äôt effect it. Look at the mods on the gun when you inspect it. If anything is not standard it is adding weight. I get a minimum weight sub machine gun you have to un-mod it back to standard everything.
---
Can you list the current mod state for the receiver, stock, barrel, and magazine? Maybe post a pic.
---
Have you been doing the dalies for the legendary run? There's a challenge every day for buying 3 items from other players, I assume that's why because it's the cheapest thing for sale
---
That's my problem too...I check this shit way too much while I'm at work üòÇüòÇ then when I get home and jump online I'm too busy to be checking Reddit
---
A bounty AND Graham becomes hostile to that player.
---
Yes, but it‚Äôs better to use Bloodied weapons if you‚Äôre running a low health character.  You‚Äôd be a weird ‚Äòhybrid‚Äô until you got your desired Bloodied weapon, but all you really need to do is get some addictions. If you have Unyielding armor that mitigates the stat drop from addictions. 
---
Once you get your Bloodied weapon, pop some Addictol to get rid of the addictions.
---
Lol, I vendor hop until I find 5.56.  I wont waste 3 caps on .38 ammo.
---
I use the track option almost daily and have never had an autocomplete
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/fvbaFc8
---
I‚Äôve had the bug happen once (fingers crossed later today) and yes I always ‚Äútrack‚Äù them.
---
Do you not understand the concept of alts in games in general?
---
Also even if he wanted to do a respec doing it in 76 is one of the slowest and stupidest ways to do it, having to grind out levels to change your special one piddly point at a time. And if that doesn't come out well then you gotta do it **all over again**.
---
Take some lessons from games like Grim Dawn (skills points can be refunded for a small iron cost each, and Devotion stars with Aether Crystals that are easily gathered) and Borderlands (New U stations can let you respec your skill points anytime for a % of your current funds).
---
Just checked its all standard nothing added to it 
---
If i add short light barrel it jumps to 7lbs
---
Thanks for letting me know. I will double check later. Cheers!
---
Submachine gun is normally 13, depends whats on it for the final weight.
---
Yes... but why tf would you want to?
---
I mean if you're a glutton for punishment, sure, run low health and addictions but you're just gimping yourself for no reason while doing less damage than a real bloodied toon and having less survivability than a real junkies toon.
---
Really? Weird, that doesn‚Äôt happen to me, if I don‚Äôt have ammo it just doesn‚Äôt do anything, but yeah a counter would be sweet
---
Thanks for the info, btw.
---
you know punji boards attack other players right?
---
Good point, but maybe just the persons loot that was taking can start the engagement. Once they engage it is an all out PVP
---
Nothing is on it 
---
Its complete standard
---
3 toon?
---
Would be great but they'd need to fix the bug that randomly wipes your photo library. I was trying to semi-rp as an photographer/archivist and so was taking lots of photos, then they were one day completely wiped. Sadface.
---
Yea right out of the purveyor
---
Checked to add a drum magazine and it loses weight lol
---
Your link doesn‚Äôt work like this, just so you know. Other than that; a SB or SBQ has some pretty thick skin, yeah (I.e. they can take a punch).
---
Edit; grammer is hard.
---
Because its such a good game, cant you tell
---
Yeah thats the one.
---
Nothin is on it
---
Lmaooo Ik like I want to finish recruitment blues and it just crashes I hate it :)
---
Track the score challenges? I've never done this. My challenges auto completed on Saturday. That's the only time I remember it happening, except maybe when they first rolled them out.
---
Dreading logging on later today. Third patch is a charm maybe?
---
I just ask as I‚Äôm lvl 500 and that wouldn‚Äôt even fill a 1/3 of the bar
---
You are definitely better off with the Furious. LMGs in Vats isn't going to be too useful and Stalker's is going to fall off pretty much immediately. Plus, the best effect is the 10% while aiming, but Furious is going to be even stronger than that.
---
I think the perkload out will be the solution to this problem.. while it won‚Äôt remove duplicate cards , it wouldn‚Äôt be much of a bother once we set the loadout and have the ability to swap them with 1 click
---
I like how there's really only two camps:  the serious players who min/max to the moon, and those who full-health/stat build.
---
But One Wasteland and damage nerfs are for "new money".  Not for us veterans.  Bethesda doesn't give a shit about veterans.
---
Amen. Same exact way. Shit other day I took lunch just to run home to do a trade quick. I‚Äôve had a Reddit profile for 4 years but I made it back when I bought rainbow six siege and needed one to comment on a server issue. But didn‚Äôt ever get on until recently with fallout 76. So now reddit is my new Twitter. Lol too much going on. I pretend I‚Äôm working but I‚Äôm really just scrolling through this one and market for 76. Lol
---
This guy shops.
---
If you sell water for 20 caps I kill your brahmin.  That‚Äôs the rule.

True in the hatchery of exploiters area but how I see it it‚Äôs easier to catch people who use these in a public teams format with multiple eyes on them. If I Q up for a pvp public team and see my teammate using these or the opposing team, I‚Äôm more inclined to report this person I‚Äôll more then likely see again then say some random guy in the sky at the end of my NW match due to me probably never seeing him again. I play 76 often and rarely pvp. If given the option to do so though without loading screens and what feels like endless waiting with no reward, I‚Äôd do it. And I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one like myself out there.
---
I miss my bank alt toon on wow :-(
---
I'd script both of them
---
There is a mod that almost does this. It adds more categories that items are placed under. You hit alt and it will change the category. (Water, aid, weapons, armor, chems, etc... ) Its called item sorting on the nexus.
---
I'm level 270 and still finding new plans.
---
Maybe it was the chupacabra.
---
Absolutely not
---
I'm a brahmin killer because people were being greedy shites with vendors.
---
Still coming out on PC tomorrow, and they're aiming for a release later in the week consoles.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt it cost 500 perk coin to max out a legendary perk? It take us 250 lvls per max out..
---
That still too much of a grind to each the max lvl
---
I'll have to try some of these tips, thank you
---
Please make sure you post about it tomorrow if it happens again. I‚Äôd hate to have a day when I don‚Äôt read this 12 times.
---
I'm on PS4
---
I just want some proper power creep, man. I don‚Äôt really care for any of that haha. My builds aren‚Äôt really that optimised compared to what they could be, but I‚Äôm happy where I am. 
---
Increase the power of enemies and increase our power. Give us a challenge.
---
All you can do really is keep trying or move on.
---
I wouldn't bother :/
---
Why the fuck. Isn't that what the pts is for?
---
Edit. And still delaying meat week I'm sure the dirty dogs
---
You gonna tell me how to handle my gun too ?
---
It's literally more expensive to hop to another vendor than to just buy 3 useless ammo.
---
Yes, they get them and it helps them but it doesn't really add anything to them catching/keeping up. They kinda slow the rate that weekend players fall behind.   
---
I don't have a problem with the current setup but I understand were op is coming from.
---
I personally would like it if the dailies went back to atoms and the weeklies where for score.
---
It is some dude's critique; critical information is among the top kinds of information I come to reddit for, so yes. If I wanted information about specifics of gameplay I consult a wiki or content guide. People asking questions before googling is the real eyesore.
---
Ah, k. The Legendary Ammo Perk will increase the harvest by a lot, so scrip is really not needed.
---
5% per mutation capped at 30% sounds like a great idea
---
Okay, let‚Äôs try this one more time:
---
Legendary weapon drops do not always come with the standard/base mods assigned. 
---
When you view the weapon in your Pip-Boy in Inspect mode, what are ALL the **listed mods** for the weapon, from top to bottom, over on the right side?
---
Saaaaame. Reddit says I created my profile a year ago though I had no memory of it. Probably was playing RDR or something and Google kept trying to redirect me to Reddit so I caved and made a profile. Now I'm on all the time. It's amazing I haven't gotten fired üò¨üòÇ
---
I don't even know how to enable the track option, but I have had the bug hit me once.
---
I kept editing that post so I don't blame you for missing it: I said that it would be "cool" to have *actually* challenging challenges.  So, I don't even need to respond to that accusation, it's already wrong before I even begin.
---
All I want is to have more flexibility.  No, I don't want 15 days off.  I want 15 days off *and* skip some weekdays every week too.  **But** I should have to make up for it by putting in the *same amount* of effort when I do actually play.  I thought this was clear enough by now.
---
Edit: I notice you didn't actually show the math.  Could it be because you *dont* know how to get 30 ranks in 3 days?
---
yeah, I used to have them at the bottom of each staircase to keep mobs somewhat at bay (they tend to go aggro on those first before your camp, and if your camp is off the ground, its the first place mobs go). I anticipate players will just jump over them, at least that's what i learned to do. once bitten, twice shy. i always look for them at camps and honestly the damage is minimal. when I was a new player I would hear character groan and be like oh what is that. now that you are asking, do they engage pvp when a player runs over them? i don't use them much anymore, but that would be bad if they do. they are an excellent mob deterrent.
---
Now I need a good way to ditch the Grounded mutation without losing all my other mutations first.  Murphy sez "screw you" :(
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad but I also don‚Äôt wear my head set or have volume up to loud being I have to play when wife and kids goto bed. But I hear it and you can also not give it power but I like it.
---
Very few servers are extremely bad. I had one a couple of months ago and no monsters would spawn in during events or the world. It was the same for everyone in that server.
---
Other than that 99% of my gameplay is fine. We only remember the bad stuff.
---
Didn‚Äôt even know this was a thing. Had some autocompleted ones though.
---
Isnt the explosive bait thing patched?
---
Exactly, and for some of us we play when servers are emptying/dying and server hopping to find a server that has for example a legendary in it can take several tries, I ran the golf club three times/servers to get one ledgendary. That's like 20 mins for one score challenge. It happens, not always but it does.
---
No man.. there's no such thing as catching them cause Bethesda does not ban these exploiters. It's best they lose interest in this game and go play something else. Please. I have no idea what platform you are playing on but just let us enjoy peace for once. We don't want to suffer for your amusement
---
I'd be fine with a 24 h cooldown. We can still run the silos normally or get out the football for those special occasions.
---
The PTS is a PC build of the game. Hopefully they get it sorted within a few days for the console folk.
---
don't think it will work. As all pictures are stored client side, there's no way for Bethesda to filter out any political, racist, anti-Bethesda, nudes, etc.  
---
It could work when the highlighted photos from photo contests would be selectable.
---
There is an in-game message warning you that the Scorchbeast Queen fight is recommended for at least 8 people yet we now have people killing her solo in well under 1 minute.
---
I'm just LOLing at the downvotes.
---
I have a workaround method on PC that so far has worked *every single time* i start getting the fast travel bug. Which is, admittedly, not very often.
---
*After the first failed fast travel:*
---
1. Open the map again
---
2. Select the place you want to travel to
---
3. At the "do you want to travel" popup, press TAB (closes the popup)
---
4. Select the place you want to travel to again
---
5. Select yes.
---
6. You should have traveled successfully.
---
I discovered this by accident, but like i said, so far this has worked every single time i have had to use it. Having never played the console versions, i dont know what the "tab" button is for them, but it might work.
---
Because you are at full health or this is the goal vanguard is usually the pick for junkies though anything but unyielding or bolstering would work.
---
Ive had it happen about 5 times lately and only lately since last patch/update
---
On Xbox unfortunately but great for the PC player thanks for mentioning it.
---
Serendipity as well is a must
---
This a million times over. The fact we need to use flux to craft a new jetpack to use a different skin is absolutely unacceptable.
---
That‚Äôs great to know
---
Are you on xbox?
---
Broadsiders are more or less for laughs. I keep one for reasons.
---
it's the HOTFIX that is being delayed, for consoles, and as a result, A Colossal Problem is being delayed. 
---
Let's not assume that ACP is the issue causing the delay.
---
Try outside of Morgantown kinda in between the creek and the trainyard
---
I sort out between my main and 2 alts all of the junk that the other ones will use, even out scrip amongst the toons, and keep the stash wt down on all of them.  I use the same container on a private world and keep switching alt till I get it all evened out.  Usually I forget something so I have to relog with someone.
---
I did it for you üòÅ
---
It's been delayed on consuls btw
---
Make pet killing in general a crime I‚Äôve lost two deathclaws to stupid people
---
There has been definitely some weird crap happening since last patch. Mainly the freaking rubberbanning health bars for enemies. It‚Äôs so annoying. I will head shot 1k damage and they should be dead but nope right back up and gotta waste more ammo
---
Honestly enemy specific could go to 75%, it could and should challenge bloodied at that point.
---
Again?! XD dammnnn
---
West tek i farm it during class lol
---
It should be 5% per mutation up to 5 mutations. Chems side effects aren‚Äôt bad either, you lose a few special and maybe 10-20 DR. Mutants is way underpowered compared to junkies
---
Lol that‚Äôs exactly how I finally bit the bullet in fully embracing reddit. No matter what I searched reddit was first up there. And welp now here I am a lumber yard lead reading Reddit. Lol
---
Thinking about it
---
still coming out for PC.
---
I mean people been complaining of having to be Bloodied as a mandatory for the endgame, IMHO being max INT is at least an alternative. And if you're BOS, while you can't exploit the mutation bonuses -- which are frankly sizable; +15% XP  and +4.5 INT from food and +11 INT from Egghead and Herd Mentality -- you should still be able to use food and chems anyway. That's still +10% XP from Tasty Squirrel Stew, +3 INT from Broiled SB Brains, +5 INT from Berry Mentats. Inspirational 3 should still give an extra 15%, Sleep should give another 5%, and lunchboxes give an extra 25% a pop. Fastest leveling is killing super mutants, which as BOS should be par for the course.
---
Also, if you're BOS, that means you use PA, which means you _should_ have higher INT since a lot of the PA-related perks are INT-based anyway (Power Smith, Power User, Portable Power, Stabilized). 
---
Or is your RP group relegating all the INT-based tasks to a scribe?
---
BS
---
I wanna know why you still have .38 in your vendor üòÇ I know the ammo converter sucks but it's worse to FT to a camp with 16383 ammo for sale to see it's all .38 and 10 mm
---
happend to me too for the first time, bethesda only cares about fallout 1st
---
You‚Äôre right.  Not that I‚Äôm techy but I have overwhelmingly great experiences with this game and I love it.
---
Today stood out and I figured it was due to a patch.
---
Or claim workshops and hop between them collecting what resources you need
---
I crafted one. Crafted a few actually. Not my thing. I‚Äôve wanted Furious and Anti-Armor ones. Out of 50+ or so attempts I have a Junkies FFR show up and Pipe has been life ever since. Still haven‚Äôt rolled a furious and finally got a AA 1* not too long ago. Pray more to RNGeezus.
---
would be nice
---
They're both shitty Fallout games. They're both "eh" games.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter much to me. I already completed this season. Gives me more time to play other games before jumping back in for ACP or meat week.
---
If it‚Äôs a delay they need then it‚Äôs a delay they get. I dont want to jump in and find out these things are completely unplayable.
---
Thats a fair point haha
---
oh i always like when people do things like this.
---
i wonder if you played with the logic gates of f4, I bet you could create some interesting things too
---
Then they would just have to double the weighting on nocturnal to keep the drop rarity on the good mods.
---
I obviously can't speak for everyone but I'm 200+ and don't give a crap if you kill my Brahmin for meat, my food/resources that aren't locked are for everyone. It's easy to repair and I forget to milk it 90% of the time anyways so have fun.

5 minutes is the rule and you cannt sign into a public lobby.  Also use a container reads0/0 so there in wt. limit.
---
Hello would you happen to know if the Mr. Fuzzy mining helmet is able to be modded? I have one. But, I'm not online right now.
---
Actually, FO:NV is better than both! Can we all just stop and reflect on how great my taste is and how relevant my comments are here on reddit? Granted most of my opinions are derived from popular opinion, but if the majority agree, it can‚Äôt be wrong! 
---
...Pffff, you‚Äôre subjective.
---
I‚Äôve noticed the Xbox servers have been a tad more unstable today than usual.
---
Maybe they wanted one of their buddies in Idk I never kick people from my teams
---
it wouldnt be so bad bad if MANY MANY jerks with super OP explosive weapons and nades blast the everyloving crap out of everything constantly. It literally drops my fps from 100+ to 9!
---
When decent people come together and we shoot 10-15 scorched with some normal auto weapons or shotguns so that everyone can gain mad amount of XP, that is awesome. remember getting like 4K XP each wave. Now with the jerks, even if i VATs lock on enemies, None of my shots registers because somehow they die before my bullet travels from my gun to them... IF, that is, FPS doesnt plummet.
---
How is hyperinflation (Duping in your example) part of capitalist economics?
---
In the real world we tend to see hyperinflation in countries that don't have free markets.
---
Also the  name of the phenomenon you refered to in your Communist example is Tragedy of the Commons.
---
They kicked you because they wanted one of their friends to join the group
---
What about ranked up perk cards? Are they x6 points for a rank 3 card?
---
That‚Äôs going to be my first investment to when it comes out. Im only level 279 but I‚Äôve apparently played for 836 hours lmao
---
DEMOCRACY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.
---
I don‚Äôt think they ever play. I‚Äôm on Xbox and haven‚Äôt experienced frequent crashes like this. 
---
Are you getting disconnected or is your game/console actually shutting down?
---
It probably does. Base sub machine gun weighs 7 lbs. that‚Äôs the weight that is reduced by the legendary effect. However, the standard receiver weighs 1.4 lbs; the stock no matter the mod weighs 2.1 lbs; the normal magazine weighs 1.05 lbs. None of these are effected by the legendary effect.
---
IMHO that would be ripe for setting up PVP griefer traps. Kill a dude's cow, he engages you, your friends in stealth armor start sniping him.
---
I know when I kick people it's because somebody that I regularly play with is looking for a spot on my team and there are no spots left.   That is the only time I will kick a random player
---
I kill them when ever I come across them wild or player owned. I love me some brahmin meat. ü§ò
---
76 is better than when it launched 
---
It is not better than 4
---
Just the way 76 is made makes it inferior and it's not really a fault of the game itself. The whole deal with 76 was to make it to where the only other humans you encountered were other players, obviously this changed with Wastelanders but in 4 you had characters to attach to and bond with. You could help them with their problems and make them a better person through your actions. The story isnt anything to write home about, but it's the characters that put that game above 76, cause well 76 doesnt have characters. Yes there are the allies, but they dont really leave an impression on you like Curie, Nick, Danse or hell even Hancock.
---
This isnt to say that 76 wont add characters that we grow to love, cause they already have. It's just a bit hard to bond with characters that either never go with you on your adventures and just stay at your base or never talk with you again after your quest with them.
---
76 has better qualities than 4 for sure, but not better characters and that's what makes Fallout to me atleast.
---
I do respect that you like the game for what it is though and you hold it among the other titles instead of just saying its beneath them all like most people do though.
---
Sorry for the long post, just thought I'd chime in.
---
I think the person that responded to you and got downvoted is right. Fo76 devs are openly anti-farming (god knows why) which is why if you run lucky hole mine/fort degiance or loot a green footlocker and hop servers, the stuff stays gone. They never intended for players to server hop like fiends to get what they wanted, it was just one of a hundred oversights they made during design and cant/wont fix.
---
My main account suffers from it every 5 days of so, since patch 21. Before that it was like every other day on avarage. It's at reward 70.
---
Yesterday my mule account had it for the first time, half of the daily challenges were finished. This one is at reward 94.
---
And yes, I log off 10 mins before reset, make dinner and return a hour and a hlaf later.
---
I'd think that too but there is still only 3 people on the team. Oh well.
---
Did it x2, haven't had any issues
---
my main is an explosives character, and being as everyone else in the game running bloodied, I dont feel bad taking some xp for myself, I literally use one grenade from my auto grenade launcher per wave, to let others get a hit or two in.  But I dont insta kill the wave with my non bloody build
---
Changed mine twice, no issues at all.
---
Can you pm me please?
---
Wait are you on rn?
---
Just go buy serums. Lots of people sell them dirt cheap. Marsupial, adrenal reaction, and speed demon are very common. Then if you are impatient to find the others, visit MODUS and server hop until you find him selling the ones you want, pop in hard bargain and some grape mentats, and buy.
---
Also, just pop radaway until you get cured of grounded. You won't necessarily lose all of the mutations. There is a decent chance you will only lose a few before you lose grounded and can stop.
---
Pc problems
---
I fully support this
---
They made it sound like it was a major addition to the game but wasn‚Äôt strictly pvp and that both sides should enjoy it a lot. My guess is something similar to the ESO faction wars where it‚Äôs a pve warzone where players can take a side and fight in pvp to protect.
---
no the photos from photomode
---
Magic weapons are still magic in the PTS.
---
I considered that but there's still only 3 people on the team. I though it might be more common since it happened in my last playthrough but maybe it was just an odd coincidence.
---
Some people kick you for not sharing a perk card.
---
Farm for ore and acid to prepare ammo for the real shit after the call
---
Yooo tell me why I, a level 204, joined a level 8 who started a casual (CASUAL!!!!) team only to be booted five seconds later üò§üòÇ I was fkn salty for sure. Anywho, back to your question, I'm assuming it's because maybe low levels can't/don't share perks (or they aren't sharing the "right" ones, whatever that may be to the leader) or they made a building team that they intend to swap to events team as needed and expect everyone on the team to go to the events to benefit from shared drops, and they assume a low level is not able to keep up? Or maybe they are saving that spot for a friend? Idk also people are jerks and their behavior can't be explained
---
The reason I imagine its leaking to here is because every iteration of the PTS perk coin system (3 so far before this) have been universally panned by everyone on the PTS. Its a garbage system and the devs are proceeding anyway.
---
Actually,  there is a way to get rid of the ghost budget
---
I've never even seen a 4/4 Hunter Hunted pop up, ever.
---
When does the season end? I thought colossal problem is at the same time as patch22
---
TDM is the only answer. This game is far too broken with too many exploits for pvp in open world to work.
---
I had that problem too. Then I turned on Pacifist mode. No more ‚ÄúFriendly Fire‚Äù accidents. üëçüèª
---
Not all do. I don't care who's on a team I start/join, the more the merrier.
---
Just remember to share a perk card.
---
I‚Äôm level 480 and get kicked more than a football.
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad, it‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs them.
---
for future reference, any game released after april 2018 should be fine as they were designed with psn name changes in mind
---
Cheaper on my soul
---
Well being as I'm not a fan of Fallout 1 or 2, and I enjoyed 3 and NV...4 and 76 ended up being the perfect blend that made me fall completely in love with Fallout.
---
It‚Äôs beckets location. Go do his quest
---
Do you share perk cards?
---
I may be overstating the degree of "error," but it pushes me back one screen and has a message in the terminal screen along the lines of, "not enough ammo of this type!"
---
colossal problem is only going to be released on pc? I couldn't find this update on Bethesda's website.
---
Changed mine a few months back, no issues.
---
That shack is infinitely more useful than this, believe me
---
Oh so we've all tried huh
---
Small thing though, you are talking about Orange Mentats there. Berry Mentats are for INT/leveling up. :)
---
Better late than buggy
---
Maybe console can get two extra days of meat week üëâüëàplease Mr Howard.
---
That is hilarious and makes me feel better lol.
---
They don't stack though, and I think having both of them on makes food degrade faster. Either use one or the other.
---
The backpack states 60%, but it's actually higher than that. Probably 90% like GWS 3, or even higher seeing as I can keep raw flux for over a week in my pack.
---
You‚Äôre correct my bad I use both.
---
I built it at a workshop unfortunately so it's not there anymore. The workshop allowed me to build something larger and didn't cost me as many materials so I chose to do it there.
---
Thats really annoying. How do they allow this kind of bug? I mean, silly question, I know. But still.
---
How do I share a perk card?
---
You do more damage with the broadsider if you shoot the ground at their feet, than shoot at them directly.
---
It's a joke.
---
I kick people when it‚Äôs full for friends or family members.
---
Its the same thing the other way around. Low lvls tend to kick out high levels. But really its all up to the team lead.
---
I priority kicking people who are not sharing perks.
---
Death to meat aggressors
---
Oh maybe that explains it but I don't know how lol
---
Pc here
---
Oh no! I do it far too often so I know the feeling ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Sim settlements in fo76. I like it.
---
A CASUAL team!!! I mean I'm obviously over it but damn üòÇ
---
Haha! They must be intimidated
---
Thanks all for the quick reply.
---
~~Just slightly off 'Fallout' topic, but what are the actual issues with the original Last of Us game... if anyone knows of course.~~
---
Found the answer in an older reddit thread, thanks again.
---
It happens sometimes, just try fast traveling away and back. If that doesn't work just swap servers
---
ah i see
---
I've done a few builds like this if you're interested! Building weird stuff with the camp is totally my jam:

Legendary modules are used to create end-game weapons and armour.   You get access to the plans for end-game weapons and armour by completing the Wastelanders storyline and becoming allies with the Raiders and/or Settlers.   You use one of two legendary modules every time you create one of these end-game items.  To craft them, you need access to a weapons workbench and an armour workbench.   It doesn't have to be your own, but I can't imagine your getting that far into the game and not getting the plans for them one way or another.
---
No, you can't add legendary effects to regular legendary weapons/armour to make them 4- or 5-star.   They're just for the end-game items mentioned above.    A one-star will always be a one-star unless they start something completely new and not in the game yet.   If you like an item that only has one star, keep it until or unless you get something better.   Keep items without legendary effects?   Is it something you're using?   For example, if you don't have any legendary sniper weapon or strong melee weapon, then you may want to keep that regular item until you get something better.   It's a process of always moving on to something better if/when you can buy it from someone or it gets dropped on you by the game.
---
There is no legendary power armor, AFAIK.   There are some excellent power armors once you can buy things with gold bullion (completed the Wastelanders questline).
---
Sharing the wrong card is far, far worse than not sharing one at all. Learn what cards will mess with someone elses rads and never *ever* equip or share them.
---
I'm just here to flex on y'all with my odd legacy item.
---
For a time you could equip the jetpack on raider PA limbs. 
---
So my best set of PA has the jetpack and the stealth field.
---
I'm still kicking myself for not making a bunch of them before the fix.
---
As for the foot parts, since there is no backpack compensation, it is essential to use the impact compensation function module as WT+50.
---
In addition, I think it is better to change the effect of meaningless modules such as "explosion vent" and switch to "jump power + 100%" as a substitute for marsupials.  
---
There is no module that can use arm parts properly.
---
Better yet, I would like to see more modules such as the "recoil reduction module" and "increasing attack speed of short-range weapons."
---
Unfortunately, it would not work well with PC for the following reasons:
---
The photos taken in game end up as PNG files under my documents folder. These files can then be swapped out for porn in order to give you pornographic loading screens.
---
Furthermore, there is a nude patch as well as other porn patches for FO76 on PC. So, even if they were to lock in photos taken in photo mode and not allow them to be altered, people will still be able to display porn by taking photos of characters using the nude patch. 
---
Of course... this was all told me by a 'friend'..... I am absolutely, positively not using any of these mods.
---
I played Fallout 4 but honestly I didn't get far enough to use or unlock those. I've heard about them but don't know what they do. I know they have an interval generator which would be incredibly useful here.
---
I was having SIGNIFICANT problems actually trying to place the damn pegboards a few days ago. Ever since the last patch, walls with wallpaper absolutely hate them. It was a bloody struggle getting my armory set up.
---
Y‚Äôall complain when shit‚Äôs broken, then complain when they take time to try to fix something.  
---
Yeah, there‚Äôs other shit they‚Äôve needed to fix for a long time, but if you‚Äôre dying of thirst, are you really gonna turn your nose at a thimble‚Äôs worth of water?
---
Hmm idk why the level matters - I've played w people from level up to the 400s. Doesn't matter to me who my teammates are but I can understand making a spot for an IRL friend.
---
I understand the frustration, really I do. There is not a single developer of multiplayer game that has not run into this very issue. (That I am aware of)
---
Hence daily quests being in virtually every online game. 
---
Until the industry develops a content generation system that responds to player input we will likely never see a solution that most will be happy with. The development costs for high quality content, that is continuous or regular enough are simply too high.
---
This is true for even monstrously successful MMO's such as WoW, and they charge a monthly fee.
---
I would much rather have new dynamic content all the time with little in the way of repeat, but that is simply wishful thinking.
---
I would love examples of the games that give as much freedom and functionality without a monthly fee (yes Fo1st is optional) and still have tons of regular high quality content in a multiplayer game. 
---
I would love to play them. Really.
---
Not sure about the other systems but go to your perk load out a hit Y on a card (for xbox). You can share 1* per 3 points in chr. So having 3 chr let's you share a 1* 6 let's you share a 2* and so on
---
So that people can buy 3 of them at 1 cap apiece for the challenge, of course
---
Mandating perk sharing is annoying tbh. Some people are just fine with 2 points in charisma and don't want to subtract from their build to share a 1 level perk card
---
Are you though? ü§£ just playin
---
So far it seems assault rifles, harpoons, and assaultron heads seem to be the main problems.
---
Platform?
---
You need 3 points in Charisma for every rank of the card you want to share.
---
When you are on perk card screen highlight the one you want to share and click whatever it says at the bottom of the screen to share it. On PC it's T, I think.
---
Is ricochet worth it?
---
My game has crashed so hard a few times my console literally just shuts off. I'm thinking it is more to do with my aging Xbox than the game though lol idk I think Microsoft wants me to buy a new console
---
No but I would if I knew how lol
---
We will see! Hoping you are right!
---
I just sell the ammo i dont need. I dont have a problem keeping over 1000 of the ammo i use. So I just sell it so in case other people need it or whatever. Doesnt slow me down any
---
The best example I can think of is No Man's Sky... that's it. Not much time gating there either, just a bit.
---
Cool thanks so much!
---
Well, you look like a decent guy and you learned your lesson the hard way. Wastelands are unforgiving and workshops doubly so. Next time go empty-handed while claiming, you'll lose nothing, while the attacker loses his time.
---
Most players don't sell them since the only way to get them is to buy them from bots for like 10k. So unless they duped them they'd be losing caps selling then cheap
---
I thought you were joking, not sure I‚Äôm understanding you, both of my characters are mid high level, neither is 500; one is 260, the other is 130 something.
---
Because the plan can only be bought. There's no resale value. It's like 9k. Sack up and buy it that's not expensive.
---
Try deleting your save data.   It doesn‚Äôt contain your characters, just photos and settings and such.   I had this issue a while back and that worked for me.
---
So if I share the perk, I don't benefit from it myself? I only have 3 points in charisma so idk if perk sharing will make sense for me in that case
---
This is a huge problem with a lot of events (Rad Rumble, One Violent Night, Free Range). If you are doing the event objective, you will miss out on a ton of XP and legendaries. There is zero benefit to doing the objective other than the event rewards.
---
Bethesda needs to fix this.
---
dang thats when school starts
---
Sleep (5%) + Canned Meat Stew (less farming time involved) (+5%) + Leadership Bobblehead (+5%) + 4 lunchboxes (100%) and inspirational 2 (for sharing with the team) is my usual buff running, I have a base 15 int, and usually run in a fully buffed building team.
---
This is not ideal, but it has been pretty sustainable.
---
Even with these things, it still takes a substantial amount (like 4 hours of concentrating on XP grind, daily) of time to level up, even with all the events you need to really capitalize on this buff, and the real catch is that it gets worse every day, and will never stop taking more and more time as level increases.
---
I appreciate the advice, some of the buffs on your list are off mine for RP reasons (not gonna eat the scorchbeast meats or pop drugs for XP) but I do appreciate the feedback.
---
There are ways to do it faster, but imo many of those ways are a bit to close to exploiting on a venn diagram (server hopping, unyielding and intentionally keeping health low) and kind of break the intended methods of play.
---
Thank you!!
---
Maybe but i didnt know i was. I just buy and sell what i want/need and dont pay attention to anything else. I'm not actively trying to finish the board game. Most of the rewards outside of the resource packs are worthless. Atomic onslaught paint? Am i supposed to want to grind for a crappy paint scheme?
---
Bloodied for PVE switch to full health Junkies for pvp is the best explanation I have heard
---
yes
---
Only among forum denizens &amp; reddit posters which is a very small but vocal minority. 
---
I analyze audiences &amp; brand reputation for a living. Been doing it for 20 years... so trust me when I say their reputation is quite strong among the main stream broader consumer base.
---
I hate to be the the one to break it to you, but only a niche gamer base that posts on reddit &amp; can recite every alleged scandal has issues with Bethesda. That audience represents less than a percentage of Beth's global audience.
---
You &amp; your ilk are decimals not totaling a single percentage. üòû  Sorry. Doesn't mean you don't have valid points, but you really not to put your grievances into perspective.
---
What
---
The drop chance of that particular plan is extremely low and the buying price for one is huge on vendor bots.
---
If you see one going 5k or less you should snatch it.
---
It‚Äôs rare to see it on sale in someone‚Äôs camp.
---
It‚Äôs well worth it because it‚Äôs one of the best camp items.
---
Combat and enemy ai is so bad in Fallout and Elder Scrolls games that 76 doesn't feel any different to me. Like since the combat and ai they normally have is already bottom of the barrel for the industry, a slightly more buggy version of that is basically the same for me. I get that 76 doesn't do enemy ai or combat even remotely well for the modern era, but comparing it against other BSW titles really doesn't help as they consistently develop some of the emptiest and clunkiest combat systems. So yeah 76 combat and enemies are dog shit, but what youre comparing them against is also dog shit so its really just a matter if preference at that point. I can enjoy 76 just because I've already tolerated the garbage combat and ai of the other bethesda games. Combat is just a meaningless distraction they put in so they can say you do something other than explore, loot containers, and build camps.
---
You need at least 3 points in Charisma to share a single point perk card. So 15 points in charisma would allow you to share a 5 point perk card.
---
Maybe yeah it is unlikely but possible, but I can't imagine this killing my brahmin every time.
---
Your Charisma has to be the right level to share a certain level of perk cards.
---
1* =lvl 3 charisma
---
2* =lvl 6 charisma
---
3* =lvl 9 charisma
---
In the special screen where you pick what perk cards you want to use, you have the option to share cards.
---
I usually share 3* Inspirational that gives a +15% to experience gains.
---
Just messing around
---
If we all get one free kill I'll take Russel.
---
Geez, stop at 50?   I had absolute crap cards at 50.  I think I was level 150 before I had most of what I considered essential.   The RNG can be pretty crap with what perk cards you draw.   Like 15 Solar Powered but not one Lifegiver or Adrenaline, as an example.
---
ZING! Facts hurt feelings.
---
I showed up at Tyler Race Track this week to grab it. Some low level was there at the same time, but he left, so I "claimed" the "unclaimed" workshop, but I noticed right away it was counting down the name of the low level player, and so I ran out of the area so that it would stop and go back to that player. I checked map and sure enough, now it was owned. The lag in between made it appear unowned.
---
I went back to FO4 on pc. Have 76 on PS4 and for me it isn‚Äôt even close. Building is better in 4. Gunplay is better in 4. AI is better in 4. Mods give replay ability. 76 has a better open world and that‚Äôs pretty much it. Dialog was pretty bad in 4, but at least you had consequences. 76 you can be everyone‚Äôs friend.
---
Its the score challenge
---
***PETA wants to know your location.***  
---
~~so they can put down the brahmin themselves~~
---
thats the worst handling of tesla i ever saw in my life
---
Thanks for the offer, but I'm on PS4.  They are not that difficult to get now I have a reasonably high character 100+.  
---
But again, thanks.
---
I tried it last night on the PTS. Toggled between Standard Gauss Minigun, Prime Gauss Minigun, and Plasma Gatling due to ammo availability. Failed the event.
---
The event started with 4 people. After LONG TIME AND A LOT OF AMMO we got it to 50% health. He ‚Äúmutated‚Äù and regained all his health at that point. Players started leaving. By the end of the event timer we had its health down only 5-10%. Wasn‚Äôt fun to be honest. I‚Äôll give it a go when it goes live, but won‚Äôt grind it if it keeps failing. Holding down the left mouse button into the face of an enemy for 20 minutes isn‚Äôt my idea of fun.
---
What drop chance?
---
I wouldn't be even remotely mad if they didn't lie about the fucking dates
---
edit: literally every mfka who downvoted this comment contributes to Bethesda being unreliable af
---
Yeah those photos are stored on **your** computer, in your documents folder. You can change the image, but keep the original name. So there will be players who will put all kinds of bad material in that folder.  
---
Once a week I select all the photos made for the robot daily quest plus daily challenges and delete them directly from the folder. That's way faster than going over them all ingame.
---
And yes, you and your teammates get the perk. It's just you need 3 points minimal in charisma to share. So not everyone has a spare point to throw in charisma.
---
i want more face paint
---
its all fun and giggles, but people should stop selling crap for mad caps. Especially plans, lemme tell you, if someone is almost exclusively selling just plans, at the plans face values are cap hungry mongrels who doesnt even wanna understand the game but just rip people off. Ive met people who had about 29K and still sell crap for 5-6K. LOL
---
Of course rare plans, or rare-ish good weapons and maybe great armors could be sold for alot of caps, like Fixer plan, or Circus cage, which i respectively paid 5 and 9K. Cuz Ive never even seen them even tho i looked for them on discord channels, in games etc. 
---
And of course, buyers, just pay the damn caps if you already have like 20-25K caps. I paid absurd amount of caps for some legendary armors, weapons, (even some quest related items that I wanted to get earlier or didnt know). Cuz I already reached near cap limit. So make it rain for someone else.
---
You're thinking wrong. These posts have been constant since release.
---
I have to disagree. Visually yes it looks better, it is a few years newer too so it kind of has too. 
---
I personally prefer urban post apocalyptic scenery and fallout 3 with dc and the pitt is still my favorite setting so boston is definitely much more up my alley but that is just my personal taste.
---
I too like the game but i really can't understand how someone can even think that the writing of fo76 is on the same level as new vegas or even fo4. Like come on! The whole dialog lines of wastelanders combined fits into one faction of fo4.
---
And the quality? Fo4 was not perfect but the writing was good enough so that people have still to discuss which faction is best for the wasteland and if synths are people etc.
---
Now we have fo76 where americas best and brightest spend 25 years together to finally emerge and rebuild. How do they do it? They just run in different directions and never speak again or kill each other! What even is the beginning? Was my character a kid of some "best and brightest" and is now in his 30? so where are my parents? Or are all of our characters somewhere in the 50s or 60s? 
---
Nothing makes sense and we just begun the game.
---
The game is fun but there are reasons why this sub is full of complaints every single day.
---
Edit: Don't get me wrong, i still really enjoyed fo76 and i think it has real potential but after all this time i lost any hope that Bethesda will use this potential. Instead they will probably keep picking low hanging fruits and milk the cow until it dies.
---
You could get them from taking over a workshop but the drop rate is way to low to even consider farming it.
---
Well the last time I checked which was like a year ago.
---
Your experience is unique if you don't crash often. I have a great gaming rig I built myself and also use that same rig to play VR via an index and also work in IT and I crash and disconnect several times a week in spite of drivers/upgrades/sacrifices to mothman. Consoles suffer from lag and crashing frequently as well. I also have an annoying crash on exit bug that requires me to kill the process via task manager. It comes and goes with every patch per the OP. 
---
So it is a problem unrelated to potatoes.
---
Don't apologize for the length of the post, I appreciate it.
---
The characters of Fallout 4 are certainly endearing. I still remember the first time hearing all of their stories. I admit the characters of 76 aren't quite as well written or fleshed out as 4 and I guess I'm just hoping that in time we'll have characters in 76 that can stand up with those from the previous games. I think that can definitely happen.
---
Speaking of having adventures with your companions from 4, I've been playing a new character in 76 and every step of the way I've been playing along with a friend of mine who's on his first ever Fallout adventure. So that's kinda bringing back those feelings I had from 4 traveling with a companion lol
---
Idk if its really a bug or just how fo76 updates data, kinda like how the loading screen after you swap characters shows the level of the last played account, until the new character fully loads.
---
My guess is that NPCs have default lines that are used until the player interacts with them and updates the NPCs dialog choices to follow the choices of the player.
---
Kinda like how in the past you needed to access your stash before all your junk was able to be pulled from the stash, for crafting purposes.
---
Ie on a fresh login, if you went straight to a work bench you would only be able to use the stash on your character, not your stash. Until you physcially interacted with the stash box.
---
Here, have another.
---
Just ran into this bug too.
---
I gotta disagree entirely with gunplay being better in 4. 4 had a good setup but 76 improved greatly on it and everything feels so much more fluid.
---
And you have the ability to literally roleplay in 76 while 4 railroads you into being good no matter what you do. Even with mods, it's almost impossible to be entirely evil in 4.
---
I'm level 240 and I got kicked last night for inviting a level 11 to a team. I saw him at leader of the pack getting the first 2 kills near the fairgrounds and then he starts running towards the 3rd at Aaronholdt farm which is a bit of a haul lol. Theres only 2 minutes left so I join a team with 2 open spots and invite him. I fast travel there and gun bash the legendary so he can fast travel to me and get the kill. He finally gets the message, fast travels to me and finishes it with 20 seconds left. Then he was kicked from the team and me immediately after. Guess they didn't want to help some newbies. Haha.
---
1. It kinda does; takes an extra second or two to spot a cloaked player, especially on smaller displays.
---
2. Correct.
---
3. Can't confirm; you should be only able to do dmg up to pvp threshold though.
---
4. Correct. VATS doesn't work in general atm, save for melee, grenades, railways and gammas (possibly).
---
Escape Artist is nice while sneaking, but after the fight errupts it's not really useful anymore. That's my experience at least, someone else might have different one.
---
are you a low level? Maybe i spend quite a lot of time in the game, Ive been drowning in caps, buying crap left and right, from vendors and players, have been bulking and selling junk and water and chems. Im literally over encumbered every day and drop chems, junk ammo to other or on the ground, or to low levels. I with daily cap for vendors was around 10K
---
Ahh good to know - thanks!
---
Only if the team leader cannot change the team goal, since currently all teams can be swapped freely by the team leader between any other goal. There are not enough PvPer's left on Adventure Mode to justify using up a slot for PvP, to my knowledge.
---
Yes but why? If you are already low health bloodied is extra damage for no additional negatives. Doing junkies would give you the additional addiction negatives for less increase in dmg.

They can always do pts for consoles ( a few games do it) BF, PUBG , DayZ

But they wont ,

I don't get that. Helping others enjoy the game is part of the fun!
---
Do you have mutations and the strange in numbers perk?
---
Damn.  I‚Äôm on PS4, sorry man.
---
Apparently there are different outcomes.  Last time I saw her I took the toy and she complained for a second and then said something along the lines of "I guess it doesn't matter anyways".
---
No crying, although I didn't try to talk to her again I just left.  Free Scrap is free scrap yo.
---
This is more an issue with Microsoft and Sony than with Bethesda, with more limits from them on what and when Bethesda can actually push a patch.
---
When they decide to. Once they are comfortable that weapons are more balanced they may start doing it.
---
In the live version 4 or 5 star would not make a difference.
---
My spot of choice is the Charleston Train Station. Blue Suitcase I think
---
I guess?  Been seeing a lot of posts lately though of people trying to do both at the same time and they end up not being so hot at either. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Edit: I keep forgetting people are still trying to pvp in adventure despite Beth being very blunt about it and there being dozens of other current games that are 1000% better for it.  My bad.
---
I join teams no matter what level, and just share a perk that I think would be helpful to any build. It could be that you weren't sharing a perk, though? Who even knows sometimes. If people can share, they do, &amp; if they can't, they can't. I just want the extra XP.
---
No worries.
---
Additionally, Plague Walker should be a legendary effect like Junkies, not a mutation.
---
I'm 270 and I like having low levels join me. They can use the caps and XP from me completing quests more than a high level and sharing perks is nice, but 100% not something you need to rely on. Plus my camp is about as far south as it gets, which would be expensive for a new player to reach. A free port there can net them a bunch of camp plans since I list all the basic stuff for 5 caps each. Had to bump it up from 1 since that just seemed to encourage level 500+ people to buy them all...
---
Can't be too mad about it as I get kicked from a team about every other day. I always go for building but occasionally joined one of those building teams that keeps switching to event right before they end. They notice I am just chilling at my camp not running events and they kick me. It's common enough that I don't even sweat it anymore.
---
I call the overseer
---
Damn, I swear IQs have dropped over the last decade. 
---
I never wrote anything about them struggling, I wrote it is a sound revenue driver that can assist with the numerous costs associated with running a game as a service including tech, licenses, manpower/talent, office space, health insurance for employees which isnt cheap in the US, etc. In other words, it is a profit driver pre &amp; post IBITDA. All businesses are for profit, it is foolish to operate at a loss &amp; head towards bankruptcy. Even most children with lemonade stands comprehend that.
---
Micro/macro transactions for the foreseeable future is the landscape of modern digital games as a service. Get over it. It isn't going away but will expand. I had to get over physical media vanishing. Times change.
---
Atoms can be earned in game with a time investment and are for cosmetic items, not required to enjoy the game. 
---
As to whether systems are designed well or not is open to debate &amp; warrants on-going critique, but you're conflating several different issues in a word salad.
---
Awesome! Thanks for your insight on it, it does put some thing's in perspective for me.
---
Like most other things in this game, it's bugged.
---
Holy fuck i made plans for this Tuesday off. Can yall get ANYTHING right?
---
Good lord I hate this stupid fucking victim blaming attitude gamers have. He's free to spend his money on what he wants and it's Bethesda's fault, not his, that stuff is being locked behind a paywall. 
---
And you sit here and try to blame other people for it while you're also playing the same fucking game he is.
---
I'm also using a Legacy Jetpack on my Ultrasight arm, but it's only genuine and I can't use Jetpack skins.
---
I totally understand. It really sad to see friends with busy lives miss out on a ton of stuff and feel under pressure rather than enjoy the game. I try to help out friends as much as i can.  
---
Dailies should give minuscule SCORE, where weekly or even month challanges should be the main SCORE points. Also repeatable challenge should have some sort of reverse multiplier meaning (just like old WoW days) if you return after a long period of not playing, repeatable challenge should have like 10x and every next day it should go down. Lets say you dont play 5 days, Bam you get 10X multiplier, play on the weekend or on your off day for a bit longer and catch up!
---
And Berserker's, since it has \*no\* perk synergies, no armor, and no perk/food/chem buffs, should do more damage than Bloodied.
---
Thank you for that awesome synopsis!
---
In other words, you want the game to adapt to your desires, but are unwilling to adapt to the current system. That‚Äôs a little entitled. 
---
You‚Äôre resistant to even doing the challenges that don‚Äôt fit your style. 
---
Tell me, why would it matter if the Daily Challenge to ‚ÄòKill 3 Deathclaws for 250 SCORE‚Äô changed to a Weekly of ‚ÄòKill 21 Deathclaws for 1750 SCORE‚Äô *if you‚Äôre not going to go find Deathclaws to kill either way?*
---
In fact, the dailies have the potential to provide more variety and greater likelihood of player engagement. A daily of ‚ÄòKill 15 feral ghouls for 250 SCORE‚Äô compared to a weekly of ‚ÄòKill 105 feral ghouls for 1750 SCORE‚Äô is much more attainable for the casual players. 
---
Assume that the feral ghoul challenge I cited is a standard daily. The player that only logs in twice a week can probably accomplish that one without too much effort. And they earn 500 SCORE for that. 
---
But that same player might feel overwhelmed looking at a task of killing **105 feral ghouls**. And they might not pursue that. So they don‚Äôt get any score for that challenge. 
---
Now multiply that by *nine* and add in the regular seven weeklies  
---
- NW: Survive for 2 hours
---
- Craft or Scrap 15 pieces of Power Armor
---
- Kill 150 creatures.
---
- Collect 175 Wood
---
- Kill 15 Deathclaws
---
- Complete 15 Events
---
- Kill 15 legendary creatures 
---
- Repair 45 weapons or armors
---
- Level Up **seven** times. 
---
And so on. Each of these seems like it would come across as *very* ponderous and time-consuming to the player that only wants to play for 3-4 hours on the weekend. 
---
What you‚Äôre proposing would definitely feel like a ‚ÄòCHORE‚Äô to many players.
---
Depends on the system you‚Äôre on, on Xbox in the perk card menu highlight the card you want to share and press Y to share. I guess on playstation it‚Äôs the triangle? You need have at least 3 points of charisma to share a level 1 card. Basically 3 points per star.
---
I wasn't mad just confused haha but now I know about the perk sharing which I didn't consider/understand before
---
Plant razorgrain.
---
Same, just want that XP. P.s. I also loved order of mysteries - favorite questline so far
---
They can't be completely anti farming, their brotherhood event we are in is proof
---
It‚Äôs cheaper to buy the fixer plan if your just farming that. 
---
Unless your farming the imposter outfit as well.
---
No I just forgot you lvl up so quickly when you‚Äôre a lower lvl
---
I mean, with Junkies you can just keep the low health so it could be worse
---
Good to know but he is gender neutral and singular.
---
The other issue might be that some low level are just fast travel leeches since that's what I do on my alt. He has only discovered a handful of places so I switch teams after about 30 seconds just to fast travel to teammates and fill in my map. Sorry for giving the real low levels a bad name here. Haha.
---
Dear PC players 
---
Thankyou for Alpha testing the game for us , your sacrifice will not go down in vain
---
Love..
---
The console peasants
---
And that‚Äôs one of the last rewards from the season right?
---
What a way to reward those who put all their free time into this game..
---
When Fallout 76 works its really fun and does look better than Fallout 4. However, Fallout 4 actually looks like there was an atomic war. Fallout 76 looks like they didn't pay for road repairs. F4 actually looks apocalyptic. Its like comparing a small well thought out camp to a mansion camp that exceeds the build limit with one Pebbles decoration.
---
(some items sold separately)
---
Fo3 always has and always will be the best fallout game. The dlc was fucking amazing too, something actually worth your money.
---
ACP is going to go live on PC with the hotfix coming tomorrow. The console hotfix later in the week.
---
*waving a rag at the pc players sailing away on the titanic*
---
That's correct.
---
och no, im playing mmo rpg and i was able to one shot every enemy in the game except bosses for the whole 2years, now I ll just kill them on 2shots. GG wp unlucky bethesda. Bye im leavin, fuck this game
---
Junkies and Vanguard is fun. Works well for me
---
Are you sure they truly completed? The one time this happened to me after the last patch it showed 5 auto-completes but when I performed the auto-completed activities I got rewarded the SCORE. Just saying some of these could be a graphical bug.
---
I run junkies full health most of the time with solar armor for PVE because it does plenty of damage and allows me to be tanky and there's very little in the game that I can't kill in a few hits. But a couple of my armor pieces are Unyielding and Bolstering so if I'm fighting the queen or doing something that requires more damage, I can drink some toxic goo, put on a stealth suit and do crazy damage with my bloodied gauntlet.
---
I'd like to be able to scrap an alt and transfer perk cards. My 1st ever character is high level but pretty useless as I  just picked perks willy nilly, but my new dude is a Vampires Heavy Gunner that rocks but could use some of the others crafting and luck perks.
---
Legendary run xp grind. You've beat the game, congrats
---
I only kick people who don‚Äôt mute their mics. I don‚Äôt wanna hear anyone singing along to Appalachia radio, munching chips, baby‚Äôs crying, etc. I‚Äôm sure random people don‚Äôt wanna hear my ass farting or my girlfriend on the phone with her friends. 
---
Otherwise anyone is welcome on my team. Sharing a card or not. Sometimes I have to tell me friends to start a new team because I‚Äôm already on a full team and I don‚Äôt wanna have to wait for the buff to max out again.
---
Well if you are PC you get a new quest tomorrow, there end game bosses and repeatable quest grinds like any MMO.
---
They look good on the outside, but on the inside and its bare
---
We are at the levels we wanna be at too
---
We are on xbox
---
Ha
---
does it matter? those rewards aka gillie shit skins everywhere arent even worth of your daily time for it
---
Dibs on Davenport and Ward.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôm scared they would break it bad though and ruin both characters
---
1) Stow all your weapons, armor, and aid except for a vanilla combat knife
---
2) Chug Nuka Shine
---
3) Fight your way back to camp
---
I call ward
---
My camp used to be close to a mongrel spawn. Even with a GD fence aaand a turret right in the pen, they'd routinely kill my cow.
---
That sounds pretty awesome
---
You can set sail on the titanic. I‚Äôll just sit here and watch what happens ;)
---
Lmao
---
Oh you beat all 100 ranks (250k ish score) of the Legendary Run, which is a new in game rewards mechanism despite having quit again after wastelanders?
---
This is post wastelanders "content" BTW.
---
In case somebody else was wondering no.  It didn‚Äôt work.
---
I only played on one of these waaaaay back at 400 stash. If you're xhox id love to launch a nuke for ya.
---
Yeah, I did the high intelligence thing for fun on my heavy gunner, but started mostly playing that character for the legendary run because I level up so quickly.  How many hours did it take to reach 500?
---
I'm somewhere in the 400s and I do not give one wet shit what your level is, I want you on the team for more INT. Doesn't matter to me if you're sharing a perk card, either. The only reason I might boot someone off a team is if I need to make room for one of my more regular teammates.
---
I call poppycock on the title/premise of this post. I play 5 days a week, varying from 2-5 hours depending on work, family and real life plans. I'm 85 on the board and will finish with time to spare. You do not have to log in every day. Christ all you have to do is sit in a building party and maybe pick up a herbivore serum. 
---
Yes it is unbalanced towards people with more free time. So are dailies, which are a staple of every mmo, but I don't see much gripe about those.
---
I've done it a few times. It's a hoot and a half. Especially with my Berserker commando since he's lacking the strength for a proper melee attack.
---
They have a special way of doing that, Gauss weapons are entirely broken in VATs. That's right - the guns locked behind months-long reputation, bullion, scrip and RNG grinds are broken. Max NW rank rewards the Hellfire PA paint, which also comes with a see-through ass plate. Strangler Heart PA may set you back ~6000 gold bullion but you won't be able to see anything in first person using certain weapons. Is this acceptable for any content from a AAA developer, yet alone with the end-game stuff mentioned above? No. Am I surprised? No. 
---
My takeaway is that I will not be spending any significant allocation of time in an online BGS game again. This is pathetic. This game has an unstable foundation comprised of bugs and broken content. But, instead of repouring the concrete, BGS said "fuck it" and went ahead and built on top of it.
---
no clue
---
What kind of meat?

Solar armor works really well for tanky full health builds because it's constantly healing you if you're over 60% health. Which legendary effects you use depends on play style. Vanguards is decent if you plan on staying high health, though the defense drop off is steep if you take damage and it has diminishing returns. I like to mix and match Bolstering and Vanguards because it covers you on both ends and gives some extra flexibility.
---
I know. amazing that with not being careful with how this is implemented it could potentially destroy the game.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs not subjective. It‚Äôs mathematics.
---
I've logged in every single day (apart from the first two days of the season since I forgot what day it started).  I have done every single challenge every day apart from the NW ones (I only ever do the place CAMP ones and a couple of the survive 10 minutes/rank up ones); as well as one single non-NW challenge (a few days ago I spent several hours trying to find a bobblehead and could not, so I gave up on that one).
---
I just got to rank 87 when I finished my challenges earlier.  If I had done all those challenges I missed I would only have about ~15000 more SCORE than I do now, which would only put me at rank ~91-92 (actually its more like ~11000 SCORE since that ~15000 assumes I never did any NW challenges, but as I said, I have done about a third of them, the easy ones).
---
So I don't know how your 'mathematics' figure someone could be at 100 already without any grinding... Hell I have even done a fair bit of 'grinding' so-to-speak myself since I have done everything on my one and only character (including the level up challenge every single day)... My character was level ~110 when the season started and is level 170 now... Which is an average of ~22000 XP per day; which is about a million XP or ~10000 SCORE worth of repeatable XP challenges I've gotten so far...
---
I play while I‚Äôm working almost every day, while I‚Äôm working I take over a power plant for fusion cores, I take over hemlock holes for acid, and I take over the red rocket truck stop for aluminum and steel.   I‚Äôll then multitask my work and going between these places to empty extractors/defending.   All low-attention stuff, and by the time I‚Äôm done with work, I‚Äôm pretty well set up for a night of goofing off and making vendor sales.

Dibs on Meg
---
In my experience combat is far worse in 76 than in 4, at least on console. 
---
Enemies hardly react to you shooting them because of server latency and 76 runs far worse most of the time. The ai is also a lot dumber in 76 probably to make it work in an online game, and there's no real combat arenas from what I've noticed.
---
We will send Preston garvey out to search for them in a few days as I've heard another settlement needs our help and its marked on our map , New location discovered Atlas Observatory
---
Bethesda missed their true calling ... programming slot machines.
---
This is my hope, but I want each power armor to have a set effect.  
---
 T-60 etc. have low defense power but invalid explosion damage, T-45 reduces AP consumption including the meaning of being used for many years, Raider power armor like "Pain Train" I think you can add the collision damage when you dash as a set effect.
---
They should keep the total amount of points you can gain in a week the same, but move most of them over to weekly challenges instead of dailies, that way the bulk of them can be knocked out in a day or two instead of demanding constant daily logins.  After that, they should add some sort of catch-up mechanic that allows you to complete old challenges when all the current ones are complete.  This way you still have to do the same amount of "work" but can do it at your leisure.
---
I changed my PS4 user name and came back to FO76 after a year of not playing.  Seems fine to me.
---
You can run broken armor with berserkers though
---
Fallout 76's only cons are being newer and multiplayer. Which makes it quite a different kind of game then other installments. But FO4 with high texture mods, and other QOL mods, It's just my opinion but Fallout 4 has a lot more density, uniqueness and also vertical-ity than 76. In 76 so many places look very similar, and its mostly typical regional environment in each section, as if they have been either copy pasted or procedural-ly generated. I really find it lacking that 76 is larger but almost like as if the map was just stretched on all sides.

Lgendary mirelurk queen, and you're there in a fishing outfit and armed with nothing but a pole.

How could he discover that place when he has to dig through a mountain of cork.

berzerkers to 150% at zero DR, nocturnal to 50% at night
---
For me the list goes:  
---
Fallout 3 &gt; Fallout 4 &gt; Fallout 76 &gt; New Vegas
---
In order of how much I enjoyed each game
---
Sure. I'm a bloodied build that also uses junkies stuff. I do slightly more damage than a full health junkie.
---
ES6 was Skyrim 2 all along
---
Took a long time to get the bug again - but this seems to work. I traveled back to vault 76 again and it let be re-spawn my character properly.
---
Chewy meat.
---
I agree, however 76 has it fair share of problems. I think my biggest gripe with FO4 is how awful the story was towards the late half of the campaign.
---
I‚Äôm level 160 and have never seen that wheelbarrow. Now imagine new players.
---
Finally got the bug again, and like another poster mentioned - I traveled far away from my point of death and then back again and it seemed to clear up.
---
I shouldn't have to, prevention is better than cure.
---
I agree. A part of me still gets excited if I get an assassin weapon but I realize there's no point. However I much rather they bring back a layer of PvP into adventure for the entire world. I believe if you don't want to do PvP you should never have harm from those who do (except at workshops). But there are players who liked the anxiety of passing another player and wondering if they'd take you on. I miss survival mode for this reason.
---
I agree. Mutants damage increases should be based on how many mutations you have. 
---
2 mutations = 5% dmg increase.
---
10 mutations = 25% 
---
Etc.
---
Please! Had some kid blow up my Brahmin 3 times after I invited him to a trade an hour ago. (He was paying a premium for holo games) I had to explain how fertilizer is created to finally get the point across that, no, that cart isn‚Äôt exploding for no reason. Even though I can‚Äôt imagine the rocket launcher helped. Also, I don‚Äôt have a ‚ÄúBrahmin Infestation.‚Äù Thanks for looking out for me though homie.
---
I just crafted a basic Submachine Gun. It weighs 11.2 lbs.  Exact same listed mods as what you have. 
---
Your quoted totals have been jumping around.  What is it showing right no with those mods?
---
Also, try unequipping any weight reduction perks/gear to make sure you‚Äôre seeing accurate values. It‚Äôs possible it‚Äôs a display glitch. You can test that out by storing the weapon and seeing how your stash weight changes, since nothing (except that legendary effect) changes the items real weight in the stash.  If the stash weight only increases by 1-2 lbs then it‚Äôs a visual glitch.
---
I track mine all the time. Never autocompleted until yesterday. And only half of them. Thank goodness. We shall see what tonight holds.
---
Yeah, my theory is for the bin.
---
Please, tell my wife that I loved her and I died as a noble A.L.P.H.A. tester.
---
From my understanding, photo mode pictures on PC can be directly edited in the file or replaced.
---
So his dick pic comment is still true (on PC).
---
I‚Äôm sure like many others here we‚Äôd enjoy the option to pvp rather then not have it at all it‚Äôs not just my amusement as you say. Throwing content away isn‚Äôt a fix it‚Äôs picking sides. God forbid I might want to pvp sometimes in a game that I play often and has these features. Since BGS doesn‚Äôt want to put extra effort into smashing bugs and hackers it‚Äôs better that players like myself just don‚Äôt have the choice? Sounds kinda like a ‚Äúyou think you want it, but you really don‚Äôt‚Äù mindset. The only way I‚Äôd say to cut it out is to bring survival back with some new rules, or let us Q up for NW while in adventure mode. So we can play for awhile and not wait screen, load screen, wait lobby, wait deploy, load screen. Then die, load, reinvite teammates, repeat.
---
What about having the option to drop a Trap bag on death, so if anyone goes to pick it up it destroys them and the loot, but warns them about it, and if it is left alone the owner can disarm it and retrieve said loot.
---
Stop calling them hackers, they don't deserve that title, that implies they smart, they nothing more than script kiddies
---
Totally agree and must add the quests are better in 4 (except defend the settlements sigh).  You change the world based on your decisions where 76 is a static world.
---
Seriously though. I‚Äôm 2 spaces ahead of Zorbo right now but going on vacation for 5 days this week so am I not going to complete it because of that? Challenges should absolutely be weekly.
---
Are you still on? Blinkkidx182
---
Nice idea.
---
That's the last step, you just have to keep one of the chiefs alive and you'll get there eventually. I'll see if I can get on and help out
---
I actually got the outfit already, and yeah it would be cheaper if I could find one that's not 10k + caps lol
---
What do you want? A Yu gi oh duel battle?
---
Survival chem and what rads are pretty strong in my book along with the stats.
---
It will never be regarded as such. The game is fun, but from an objective standpoint the game is not in anyway "good". OG Fallout games and New Vegas have good writing, characters, an interesting world and thought gets put into their story and overall gameplay. Fallout 76 JUST has an interesting world which still feels empty with the hollow shell "characters" that NPCs are supposed to be.
---
The game IS enjoyable, but comparing it to any other Fallout game is like comparing Bubsy 3D to Halo 3. One has passion and effort put into it, the other is a cash grab that has zero thought put into anything.
---
The community makes Fallout 76 playable and once they finally destroy the already low standards for content then the game will have nothing.
---
FO4 doesn't need live, 76 always did
---
Lol I mean... I‚Äôm not AGAINST the idea of archetypes lol
---
Agree. 
---
Give me something to do with the cards I don't want - but 
---
(a) Don't make it MANDATORY as the only way to get legendary perks 
---
(b) Don't screw people over who took the whole "you can respec things over time" to heart and have already done a bunch
---
I personally like 1 point / level ... and 1 for each card you turn in.
---
And yet none of us think mutant legendary weapons are worth anything but scrip. It‚Äôs pretty obvious that a 10% bump is not enough.
---
They should make it possible to kill players death claws and mirlark kings with 0 xp or loot given just so we can
---
Hyperinflation is the reason why a capitalist society cannot just print more money. And what made me write this whole thing.
---
This thing just keeps getting delayed and delayed.
---
OK, thanks... I'll just use the Cola Girls bubble head in the meantime.
---
I'd suggest going Inspirational 3 or have someone in your team with 9 CHA share it instead, then go Cranberry Relish which needs less intensive farming compared to Tasty Squirrel Stew (Sunrise field nets about 20 berries, Ohio River nets roughly the same in snaptail). 
---
That should give an extra 10% XP, then since we're going veg try Brain Fungus Soup or Brain Bombs, which should be kosher? That boosts your INT into the same territory as someone who has less INT but took on mutations (I have 9 INT but with +3 Herd Mentality, +8 egghead, and -1 Marsupial my INT on a team is 19 in PA, before the Building team bonus). 
---
At that rate, you should be getting 400 per super mutant kill, so even if you totally don't get the 250 SCORE from leveling up in a day, you should be able to compensate via the repeatable 100 SCORE per 10K XP, with a quick sweep through West Tek, Huntersville, General's Steakhouse, Crevasse Dam, and all the fissure sites in between. It's what I've been doing to compensate for the Nuclear Winter SCORE I could never get thanks to the mods I run with.
---
EDIT: I keep forgetting I have 9 INT now, sorry about that.
---
I think the all star baseball bat makes 4 the winner.
---
I had the bug at the 3rd day. I was online in Adventure mode at reset time. And no, I did not used the track function. I always log out now before the reset, and I did not get the bug since.
---
Nope, they get close then delay.
---
r/notopbutok
---
You aren‚Äôt interested in any of the side quests? What do you have against the mistress of mysteries, BIV, and Calvin?
---
They won't most idiots who play the game are just gonna tell you to build better defenses rather than holding Bethesda accountable.
---
Raiders gotta eat
---
I too am in a conference call. Will be for the next month. Fo76 is like right there but I‚Äôm holding off lol. I have been letting my vendors up if someone comes by to buy something though
---
So much yes, well said.
---
They did this before but I can‚Äôt remember when. Maybe some time with wild Appalachia?
---
I wouldn't sweat it. Unless you reached out to them to ask why, you really don't know why you got kicked off. Could be because of your level, because they were waiting for a friend, because they thought it was funny, because they didn't like your username, because you weren't (or were!) shaing a perk card...
---
I'm at 180-something right now, and I have never kicked someone off a team. I've been kicked once or twice, and didn't know why and didn't worry about it.
---
Guys...prepare for your saves to get corrupted or completely broken lol.  I just feel it coming.
---
What about a I/ss/s cultist blade is it worth keeping?
---
Just happens sometimes. Why did you join an event team btw? Building would‚Äôve made more sense.
---
limits exist for a reason
---
I mean the problem with the instakilling is that it doesn't just affect the person doing it. Even if it is only a small number of people using those builds, they still severely impact the gameplay of everyone else, and unfortunately the problem is common enough that most players have probably been affected by it.
---
Maytember IIRC
---
Is the colossal problem worth the headache? Hell no! Most of us will play it once or twice and forget about it anyways lol.
---
Legendaries should drop for everyone in public events. It's maybe not the best solution, but it's better than people losing out for one reason or another.
---
100% agree with your comments, I would rate FO4 as one of the best games I ever played. I loved FO76 just not in the same way.
---
Word same here takes me around 15 min
---
*We have rice, filthy capitalist has no rice
---
Complaining is a healthy release of emotions
---
Not really
---
Why would they have multiple copies? It costs 10K caps from vendors and doesn‚Äôt drop from events AFAIK
---
That one worked for me but I don‚Äôt remember when I did it I just finished the last three l needed to do a couple weeks ago. I‚Äôve been meaning to check if the kill big enemies is fixed because I got more atoms then I should‚Äôve. But just take a pic of it and send to Bethesda and they will give it to you I heard
---
maybe you're not selling anything interesting? a lot of times I join teams just to go to their vendors. maybe they're holding that space for a specific person? who knows? don't worry about it. if no one joins your team after 5 minutes, dissolve it and form another one. people seem to show up when they see that little message pop up
---
The "walking" pose for photomode
---
Are you sure it autocompleted? Mine were all checked as well, but upon closer examination, it was still displaying yesterday's Challenges. I sent a support ticket about Challenges not resetting, but... everyone knows how that works out. Nothing to compensate for the day's loss of points. :(
---
Got to have trash rolls to make the others better
---
People go through cycles of love/hate with Bethesda and it's kind of comical. Fallout 3 and NV were absolute piles of dog shit when released and were fixed later, but still have bugs. 4 wasn't as bad on launch but people HATED the new changes 4 brought in. 
---
All three titles are now looked at with rose tinted glasses and are pretty positively reviewed. 76 will get a similar treatment when all is said is done, and people will foam at the mouth at the next Fallout title that Bethesda prematurely releases.
---
sadly i'm on ps4, but yeah for some reason they aren't common despite being effective
---
IMO perks that only unlock every 50 levels and take hundreds of levels to reach max rank shouldn't be the most important, build-defining perks; you want to get to the meat of your build way sooner than that. They ought to be major boosts to more general archetypes, which is at least what the good legendary perks accomplish.
---
Because its a GaaS you can't really compare it to the older titles. It's trying to achieve something fundamentally different.
---
Yes the light bulb annoys me
---
Sutton train station blue cooler checking in......
---
Yeah I hear ps4 has a much more community feel. More trolls on xbox.
---
Thank you so much for making this part of the game make more sense! I‚Äôm at the point in wastelanders that I have to pick a faction but I‚Äôm not sure if I should increase my reputation with both first before picking one or if the decision doesn‚Äôt matter. 
---
I did the same thing with fo4... didn‚Äôt make any big decisions because I liked keeping everyone happy.
---
That mothman statue
---
No, not that in other words.  I'm doing the challenges, as should be abundantly clear by now.  I've done the vast majority of them so far.  I've also said I'm happy to change play style if it's for a genuine challenge rather than to cheese out levels or pop down multiple CAMPs immediately or some other lamebrained nonsense like that.  (I'm actually tentatively looking forward to daily ops for that reason).  It's not just about me: tell me how many people would, on an almost daily basis, create new characters, get them to level 2, then delete them?  It's a stupid system that encourages stupid pointless gameplay and you must be deliberately misunderstanding me not to get this.
---
I haven't suggested simply multiplying challenges by seven.  You've jumped to that conclusion on your own - all I've said is to *make it more flexible*.  You seem to be going out of your way to interpret that the worst possible way in order to make it look like flexibility isn't a good thing.
---
In short,  you are beginning to be disingenuous so it no longer matters what I say - you are going to go out of your way to argue with it for no good reason.  Clearly, then, we are done here.  Have your final say, make your final petty insults, I hope you have a nice night afterward.  Cheerio.
---
Eagle skin for the handmade
---
Charleston is really close to the mole vendor though
---
Currently you need 834 levels on top of your equipped and spare perks to rank up 6 legendary perk cards
---
I just use the f bomb üí£.
---
I would be fine if the limits were removed if of course there was not such a thing as dupes and hacked gear.
---
The gold bullion however idm much. I just wish they made it weekly then daily. So I don‚Äôt have to log daily for 200 each.
---
I'd probably play with you sometime but i am a bit of a cunt.
---
But what if I do
---
Excellent explanation. Not even a need to site to the reason for limits just a "because". Our future is safe and secure gentlemen. .....why, you ask?  ......"because". I love 2020.
---
Just highlight the challenge you want to track and use the ‚ÄúTrack‚Äù button, it‚Äôs triangle on PS4
---
Something overlooked is that BGS essentially gives away 9 free level ups along the way. If you take your 150 Atom reward and spend it to level up again it's a net zero cost and can make a surprising difference in the grind without actually putting paid Atoms into it.
---
I actually hate getting flanked or bamboozled by enemies like ghouls. Probably because of server-client delay or some crap, but i find it unrealistic and un-immersive. How could a ghoul sneak up on me, no footsteps etc, I keep turning 360 no one comes, i shoot, make noise, jump, no one comes, im still hidden or caution, and then i turn around and SLAP SLAP, couple beef jerky charred ghouls slapped me in PA to 50% HP... 900 hours in 76, I only died in forest region to lvl 62 charred ghouls. SBQ can scream or hit me and I take very little damage and maybe get knocked back a littl, but 2 or more ghouls entities run towards me ? oh no. And VATS being broken for a quite a while, I went PA and Heavy gunner...
---
Why
---
It seems to activate all the time, and being a bloodied build I‚Äôll take all the long range damage resistance I can get.
---
It's really simple actually there's just a difference between a "good" game and a game that's just fun. it's possible to be a horrible mismanaged dumpster fire with incredibly few redeeming qualities and still be fun.
---
The other day I had been playing for an hour and I kicked a level 17 to make room for my wife when she got home. I told her afterwards what I‚Äôd done and she acted like I killed the guy. 7/5 would do again.
---
My buddy just lost a pet deathclaw to somebody. There is no punishment or bounty high enough.
---
I think Bethesda is trying to send a message...that they really want this game to do well in china.
---
The white door with painted vines.  It would be perfect for my camp full of plants and flowers.
---
But it's said right in the game that Appalachia was spared from a direct nuclear strike...it's amazing to me that I've seen so many people asking for a Fallout game in that exact type of setting but when we have one it's a complaint lol
---
It's not about laziness or incompetence, it's about priorities. Some of us don't give a shit about the event rewards and just want to shoot a consistent horde of ghouls for the maximum amount of time to get our daily "Level Up" or just general XP farming. You showing up and dropping ore in the bucket runs counter to that plan and screws it up... but this is what happens on public servers, different people have different goals and you just deal with it. If you want to run an event your way with no interruption, do it in a private server. Radiation Rumble is the new One Violent Night.
---
Fallout 3 is a great game!
---
Then you are no comrade, but a greedy 1% capitalist swine *spits on ground
---
A non legendary pipe pistol with should take down unintelligent unarmored enemies like ghouls, and perhaps even scorched. in short, you dont need to min/max to immerse in a game.  
---
"bL√∂√ñdƒ∞ed sh√ñt tO ThE f√ÉcE tVvƒ∞cE"
---
I‚Äôll do the photomode in a group.  That should be a quick test.
---
UPDATE: Not a graphic glitch.  I ate 5 pre-war food and used photomode in a group.  My score did not increase.
---
Yep, can't wait for Cyberpunk. Don't know about Watchdogs though, I've poured so much time into Ubiverse games (and had a blast doing it), that I feel a bit burnt out. Hopefully, now that their editorial team is shaken up, maybe Ubiverse games will get more identity of their own.
---
I quit crafting it. I just started buying the t65 armor plans instead. I have better luck with purveyor that crafting my own.
---
The last time there were actually arenas was back in the isometric days.
---
And I personally only deal with the server latency enemy issue maybe once or twice in a sitting which isn't a big deal to me.
---
Ah ok makes sense. Thought you were saying hyperinflation is capitalist
---
Not sure if it was a special freebie or atom shop item but I‚Äôd love the mechanist outfit!!  It was gone by the time I started playing.
---
Well, Unyielding, but synonymous with Bloodied builds at this point, probably.
---
It needs to be looked at as well in terms of balance.
---
I don‚Äôt know about that. Being I have had it on Xbox since day one and yeah there can be some trolls but I bought for ps4 a month ago just so I could see how the community was. Well with in the first couple levels on different days I would have these high level players following me around shooting me trying to fight me.
---
Oh wow i used to have my camp here too, i spent ages investigating that graveyard thinking it must have something to it. I think its just one of the many areas that the devs just got a little carried away (in a good way).
---
The reason for limits is to add value to them and to keep people playing the game. Also to prevent some duping from happening.
---
What event did you do?  I keep hoping for that reward
---
That is actually a perfect example of the opposite and how poorly thought out donation event was in general (you cannot grab a world spawn item, hop servers, and grab more of it from the same spot without picking up 180 misc junk items from the world to "reset" it). Go to fort defiance and grab a dress spawn, and then hop a few more times and you will find you are unable to spawn any more dresses in that spot for you personally.
---
Another even better example is how they had to correct the numbers after the fact to reflect more realistic totals. They lowered both concrete and cork while the event was live. 
---
Having abysmally low drop rates for items like a red asylum dress or a tattered field jacket and a direct anti-farming mechanic that is relatively new (with wastelanders iirc), is a good indicator they are anti-farming. They never intended users to server hop constantly, it was just a side effect.
---
It‚Äôs true. End-game is by far the biggest problem.
---
You fallout first? If so, afk workshop farming is the way forward.
---
I work in a place where there are a LOT of meetings daily between teams, and my attention isn't needed all the time, although my presence is for some reason. 
---
I'll tend to log in before work, cap the the power stations for fusion cores (plus acid at monongah and lead at posiedon). Hemlock holes for acid and the munitions factory. Then I'll rubber band and start work.
---
 I'll check in every half an hour or so and hoover up, if I get a longish stretch I might also fit in a Westek or Charlton run, maybe run through lucky hole and then summer ville book house to reset the 180 for later.
---
Sugar Grove is also alright for a quick farm, especially for screw and springs. 
---
Oh, if you pull this for a whole work shit, remember to drop a collectron on every workshop. It builds up nicely :)
---
But side not I did one of these on Xbox and it was pretty fun. It wasn‚Äôt much other then a high platform to protect us from enemies and a higher point to kill the queen. It was fun and enjoyable.
---
can confirm this is the case.
---
I find it so odd that I don't see this at all. I see so much more vertical-ity in 76. I'm always looking for new perches to survey the area or the perfect cliff side for a CAMP spot. Fallout 4 is mainly flat except for the tall buildings and the fact that the map goes slightly downhill the farther south you travel.
---
I mean isn't it getting dropped on PC like, tomorrow? Kinda late for that.
---
Honestly I am getting to where I don't see the point.  The legendary run is grinding for camp items and armor skins. The next season will also be grinding for camp items and armor skins, looks like. Well they haven't increased the camp budget.  So if you want to use new camp items that likely means you have to scrap some of the existing camp items that you also spent time grinding for.  Which means the camp items you are grinding for now will be scrapped one day. You are basically grinding for stuff that will eventually be scrapped.  What exactly is the point?
---
Or give us more of a stash limit without having to buy fallout1st.
---
Ah i love xbox community. Ps4 just seems busier. More going on, always more trades too. See scorchbeast bases on ps4. Never xbox.
---
Try being level 420 and leveling up!
---
New Vegas last? I imagine you'll get quite the amount of flak for that lol
---
Oh yeah I feel ya on that. That‚Äôs why I even spent the extra money to buy it on a ps4 just to see what it‚Äôs all about. It‚Äôs fun to see both systems and how different it is.
---
Let me check my crystal ball /rollseyes
---
Agreed. I'll never deny 76 doesn't have it's problems (what Bethesda game doesn't?). 4's story started with a super interesting premise but I feel like it all fell apart at the end.
---
It gives a chance to auto heal when you have zero health . It procs often at max rank and will take your health up to the point where rads stops it
---
The face paints and hairstyles need to be cheaper or just got rid of from the Atomic Shop and rolled into the base game.    
---
    
---
More hairstyles and face paints are a definite want though. Tattoos need to affect body parts too imo, but that'd be a stretch.
---
I want the white picket fence. Don't know if it was a bundle thing or all by itself but I'd buy it either way.
---
I missed the nice looking fridge. I didn‚Äôt like the look of the nuka cola one.
---
Okay cool, so if I'm running bloodied, it works out pretty well?
---
They would just have to have u make a separate character that can‚Äôt leave that world to use mods
---
When you fight an angler they have that glowy bit on top, it‚Äôs the plant version of that that they disguise as
---
Master Infiltrator is underwhelming, considering that next on the menu after Legendary Perks are Perk Loadouts.
---
Why waste a Legendary Slot when you can just hit a button to swap out to the equivalent perks?
---
Because I hate the look of it and I want to waste my atoms on something I hate...
---
Todd talk
---
I like playing with lower levels a lot of the time, i only join high levels for the guaranteed 'Strange in Numbers' buff, low levels tend to actually want to wander the wastes like me whereas high levels tend to be self absorbed in the same old shit. Plus i like to have appreciative teammates to give all my junk to as i rarely carry anything but still like to pick it up if its not cloth or leather lol.
---
Maybe in your "objective opinion" it won't but in my opinion, it is. Nothing wrong with us disagreeing with each other.
---
*shrug*
---
Which is why I compared it to 4 but everyone likes to think I'm comparing it to the OG or NV because I mentioned them in my post.
---
Separate item was 500 atoms I believe, but yeah I love the look of these.
---
Some of us can't find things in vendors that we want/need, so this is an easy way to get the Score as fast as possible.
---
Which one was that ?
---
I don‚Äôt but that‚Äôs a great idea! Thank you.
---
There is a skin reward for handmade in second legendary run. Same model as eagle one but it's a camo paint.
---
Did it. No issue.
---
At least you have a lot of scrip
---
The great thing is they are aware of the bug but just dont bother fixing it in any rush so you either have to not progress any further until they sort it or as I am having to do alot lately just skip the optional quest even though you would like to do it üôÑ
---
Nice Ahsoka avatar
---
We are getting a similar skin later on I believe
---
I am waiting for the small water purifier green skin, the chrome and green one. They had the large ones recently which I though would cover all of them, but nope.
---
Yup. I wouldn‚Äôt have any problem if they did that. 
---
I like it when games make the offline character and online separate. It prevents a lot of things such as modded game files.
---
It‚Äôs a shame diablo 3 was ruined on PS4 with people running around with hacked gear and think their worth something. Online was truly a bad experience there.
---
That sounds like a...*colossal problem*...
---
Ok you can downvote me now
---
Turtle doesn't play full health though. He used full health for the purpose of testing, to showcase to the viewers that enemies are not "bullet sponges" as everyone has been saying.
---
I can assure you bloodied will still be meta, unless unyielding armor gets nerfed, +15 to all SPECIAL is optimal, and if you're going for the +15 you will be at 20% health, in which case bloodied still provides the highest damage (80% increase) vs the 50% from junkies or whatever, it's still 30% more base weapon damage plus the 20% from nerd rage, and extra adrenal reaction too.
---
Red Shift Power Armor
---
They probably didn‚Äôt want them to be anymore then just added bonus vs a whole build around them
---
With the double score and double XP events, that‚Äôs where the increases come from.  
---
25,500 SCORE per week without the double score and no repeatable 10k XP weeklies is what‚Äôs available. 22k per week for the first two weeks. That‚Äôs 171,500 SCORE. The double SCORE weekend adds in another 12,500. 
---
184k. 
---
The remaining 36,275?  That‚Äôs about 74k XP per day, or seven of the repeatables a day.  With the right XP bonuses, that‚Äôs about 150-200 high-level non-boss enemies. Less for those who focused on that during the Double XP weekend. 
---
Okay, so that might be a *little* grinding to some people. Fair enough. 
---
But it‚Äôs doable without Atoms or glitches.  Your grind experience may vary. 
---
That work better for you?
---
He should have had the view in first person whilst nodding his head. Would have made it nauseating but far more immersive.
---
Usually happens to me if I try entering when I've joined a group. Happens at west-tek too. I usually just server hop and it fixes itself.
---
Level 62 charred ferals are the bane of my Fallout 76 existence lol
---
How? Everytime I conduit that event I somehow gain full agro of the impostor so it's literally in my face.
---
I can‚Äôt get the ore because I‚Äôm ill equipped to deal with rads, so I shoot stuff as it comes out of the tunnel. The level 600+ legacy yielders tend to stay behind me and take them down after I do my 40 damage.
---
This. My rooms are never bigger than 2x2 unless there is a solid reason to do so, because you just end up with empty, cavernous space that is quite dull.
---
I love meat week , my favourite event. Got a camp set up right next to it this year . Can‚Äôt wait to have all the visitors coming by.
---
It's hard to compare them in a lot of ways since 4 is single player and 76 is online.
---
But as far as graphics? I just played 4 the other day was so surprised how much better it looked, even with stuff on high not ultra. Fallout 4 runs better on higher graphics than 76 does with stuff on low.
---
Strange that it's the same engine yet 76 is by far worse in graphics and mechanics quality.
---
I want the mr peebles backpack skin.
---
Good point lol though I always sell my pins so I never have any. 
---
Correction only 2 are interesting to me lol.
---
I feel ya. I'll repair my brahmin who I've named Trumo and Hillary, for funny reasons. And I'll always have some random or a friend of mine kill my brahmin, and then when I repair it they always kill it. But I agree with you. Can we get some brahmin meat at least when they die. I feel bad but...can we at least get some meat from our dead Brahmins?
---
i've probably explained in great detail 20 + times on here and there's just no point in repeating myself because people don't listen
---
Awesome I hope so!
---
Where's your source?
---
Still kicking, new content and updates released
---
Show me these ‚Äòpetty insults‚Äô in that last post. 
---
And tell me what *you* mean by ‚Äòmore flexible.  Give me an example beyond just ‚Äòchange it‚Äô. 
---
I never said flexibility was bad. You simply haven‚Äôt supported your point about what that really means beyond just that word. 
---
What changes would you make to make this more flexible yet still have some challenge involved?
---
Don‚Äôt just say ‚Äòmake it more flexible‚Äô. Give me some decent examples.
---
Yeah, YOUR opinion. Saying that everyone will "eventually" share that opinion is delusional at best.
---
Oh, no need to compromise, we‚Äôre almost certain to get both.
---
There‚Äôs not enough ore to fill at least one person doing it I got the reward bar to lvl 1 and that‚Äôs it no other ore to be found so seems kinda of fixed
---
Unless BoS will say "No Mutants Allowed"
---
those videos arnt bloodied or junkies builds
---
I don't care either way - I usually end up starting my own building team for the intelligence boost. If people join, great. If they don't, that's fine too.
---
Site that one post you made, please. I'm interested.
---
I call Rose. Hate that effing robot.
---
My lvl 2 yet to be used unarmed junky made it to sutton station before life got in the way.  But his 800 stash space is still there.
---
She‚Äôs dead should I make a shrine for her in a video game
---
I‚Äôve found it works to walk away and then fast travel
---
It's the opposite for me where 76 runs smoother on high settings than 4 does on low settings. I've always had issues running 4 no matter what bug fixes or improvement mods I've had installed.
---
The modern looking one. It‚Äôs the dark silver one. Idk what the exact name is.

The Vault Tech salesmen trench coat and hat. It‚Äôs called the Yellow Trench Coat. It has a 1940‚Äôs private eye look to it. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Yellow_trench_coat_(Fallout_76)

Seems this has happened to a few folks today. I‚Äôm afraid to log in later since mine auto completed yesterday
---
Here is a little preview:

[https://youtu.be/xnF-wmAliXM?t=725](https://youtu.be/xnF-wmAliXM?t=725)
---
You're welcome. :)
---
Me Fuzzy Ride
---
You need to do what?!? Fucking lol. Oh my, this game.
---
I'll reserve my judgement on that as to when the BOS arrive. If they're the level of douchebags from 4, then 4 is still better because of less bugs to deal with.  If they are more like F1-F3, then I'll love F76 more than ever.
---
You don't think it's worth anything but scrip because there is one massively OP build in the form of Bloodied.  Bloodied weapons should get a slight nerf and Unyielding should be cut significantly.  This will be the only way to make a viable meta with more than one or two choices for players.
---
Junk just shouldn't drop on death. It's a stupid and pointless feature only serving to inconvenience the player, and cause problems like this. Two times in two days I had the same thing after Scorched Earth, somehow died stupidly after the event was over and both times someone came and took my stable flux and left all the rest. 
---
If they want death to be punishable fine, make loot be lost, don't make it benefit other players by being able to steal it.
---
I can go on and on about FO4's plot. A plot that made me believe siding with dudes with laser muskets was the only real good option.
---
Also blowing up the institute makes no sense at all ESPECIALLY for the Brotherhood, who's primary objective is to secure technology, so they destroy thia facility that has a multitude of agricultural and scientific discoveries, simply because "synths".
---
For me about 600, but I mostly focus on levelling
---
Where did I say that "will" happen? I just said that I truly believe someday people will regard it on the same level as those other games. Never said it will definitely happen. And apparently I'm already delusional just by having fun with 76 so I guess I'm already heading down that road!
---
First of all my Great THX for this newbie‚Äôs Cola Manualüëçüèª
---
as far as I understand if before! pvp drink a 4-5-6-.. Coca Cola, you get the ‚Äúeffect of immortality‚Äù due to fast hp regeneration. Am i right?
---
Nothing against them just not interested in them ig
---
That's not too bad. 
---
I'm surprised they haven't returned to the shop recently considering the popularity of the contemporary bundle. I stopped playing just after launch and came back with wastelanders and have been watching for them. Got the contemporary bundle and the bundle with the trees and asbestos roofs, just need the fence to complete the look.
---
I agree, I find 76 a complete upgrade to Fallout 4 right now.
---
* Survival mechanics are superior in every way to all past Fallout games.
---
* The crafting systems are superior in pretty much every way to any past Fallout.
---
* The building system quickly surpassed any previous Fallout.
---
* Character customization is far superior to any past Fallout.
---
* The world is far better than any past Fallout including anything mod made.
---
* Game runs smoother and crashes less than Fallout 4.
---
* Resource collecting system surpasses any Fallout.
---
What Fallout 4 surpasses 76 in.
---
* Fallout 4 has tougher enemies.
---
* Fallout 4 currently has better faction stories.
---
* Fallout 4 has full mod support.
---
* Fallout 4 is generally more difficult.
---
* Fallout 4 runs offline.
---
Have you reported this bug through thief forums and bug report? Cause that‚Äôs were this belongs.
---
Thank you for giving an actual suggestion beyond ‚Äòchange it‚Äô. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs an interesting idea worth exploring.
---
No bullshit, I'm praaaaaaaying that the BoS is more like the ones from 1-3 and not like the F4 BoS. I can't agree with you more.
---
That‚Äôs close to impossible since you have to be in the server to check placement.
---
Build somewhere that‚Äôs nice looking and not much people use.
---
My camp area has never once been occupied just because a couple of rad toads spawn. I like the way the area looks as well and it has a junk pile.
---
It's the apocalypse... Get tough.
---
You sir are an absolute gentleman I love it!
---
Yes it is undoubtedly, but they've already started working on damage values which is a good change. Next thing they need to do is nerf aid spam (colas) and finish their nerf on the tesla and we'd be in a much better place. 
---
If you make your build optimized for pvp you should be able to have an advantage on other players because of time investment, acquiring good gear and good use of perk cards.
---
Problem with that is you will always have people who will never be able to kill anyone in pvp because they dont make their build for it. And IMO if you don't put the effort into making a good build you shouldn't be able to just walk into a fight and get kills with no effort.
---
But yes at this moment pvp is completely broken I agree with that. It IS fixable though. People just need to understand that if they have bad builds they're not gonna do good in pvp.
---

---
He's got quite the career, including being on Hunter x Hunter (as mentioned by Lumberjackalopes below) and Netflix's Evangelion dub. Lots of big names, covering a lot of the major hits since 2013.
---
In 76, he apparently not only voices Ward, but also several other things including Grahm and other super mutants.
---
1. You're limited to Chameleon, Auto Stim, Life Saving, Weightless...or the specific perks (Zealots, Troubleshooters, etc). You can't run Vanguard because it raises your DR, which makes your weapons useless.
---
2. If you ever get respawned into a nuke zone (as happens all the time during the SBQ), you either have to carry a set of power armor JUST for that, or use the Chinese stealth armor or a hazmat suit, both of which remove your armor, forcing you to RE-BREAK it every time you have to put it back on.
---
3. That said, you could the stealth armor all the time, broken, but then you're deprived of the carry weight bonuses, incoming damage reduction, rad/poison resistances, and SPECIAL buffs of actual armor.
---
4. And unless you find/buy/farm Level 1 or Level 5 3\* leather/wood, re-breaking the armor every time you have to put it back on is a gigantic pain in the ass.
---
So, no, you can't "just run broken armor". It's a giant, logistical nightmare for negligible benefit.
---
It can't even be compared to 4, though. 4 is a single player title trying to provide the player with an RPG story. 
---
76 is trying to sell you things.
---
I want Marion Copeland. I have to put up with minutes of that hateful woman blabbering one of her lines at me every twenty seconds (literally) whenever I‚Äôm looting the meat piles after Radiation Rumble.
---
Yep. Blowing up the Institute as the Brotherhood made no sense to me and made me regret siding with them in my initial playthrough. Nowadays I either side with the Minutemen or use mods that let me do whatever I want with each faction. Fallout 4's story had so much potential that got wasted.
---
It was a bundle exclusive connected to Gamescom, I believe.  None of the bundles like that, including Maxson's Battlecoat, have returned.  They might, one day, but they are conspicuously among the few Atomic Shop offerings that haven't.
---
Ah yeah, that is nice though.
---
76 I had to tweak to get it to run smooth. Mainly I had to manually disable shadows. Once I did that the game still looks fine but it runs SO much better.
---
I am looking forward to mod support for 76 that's for sure!
---
I think a much better option would be to change assassins to poison damage, that would be interesting.
---
(And I don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúacid‚Äù damage like the SH PA and other GB gear offers, I mean ‚Äúpoison‚Äù damage like the gangrenous feral ghouls do and the sacrificial blade mod does.)
---
This way the effect stays in the game and is still obtainable, but changed to be much more useful. That way you don‚Äôt get a bunch of knob heads over on the marking flooding it with posts of assassins gear that was taken out of circulation sayings ‚ÄúItS lEgAcY!‚Äù trying to get a fortune out of nothing...
---
(Like the double effect... Yeah it was removed from the game but quad is much more useful.)
---
Improve your stock and they might buy something else.
---
Maybe you don‚Äôt know but big max level legendary creatures only spawn after the ore reach certain level. Until then it‚Äôs all little level 40 ghouls and total four possible scrip legendaries, sometimes only one. Yes I farm them too but the reward is very limited if the only thing you get out of this event is some xp and a few caps.
---
It was neither. It was part of an Atom Bundle package. IIRC, 1500 Atoms for $10 and you got the outfit &amp; helmet along with six repair/scrap kits.
---
Do they drop it when you kill them?
---
How do you manage swapping out armor with a berserkers build? I‚Äôve thought about this but couldn‚Äôt get around the whole ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt equip broken armor, unbroken armor reduces my damage by a ton, and it‚Äôs actually kind of a pain to break your armor‚Äù, thing.
---
The other one is the daily quests.  If you have 5 characters then you can‚Äôt complete the Camden park intro quest.
---
You mean the one that‚Äôs in the shop right now?
---
Wasn't that up earlier this week... if it's not still up?
---
All over the Mire/wherever there‚Äôs swampy water.
---
Been around since FO4 Far Harbour.
---
It‚Äôs been around since launch! I don‚Äôt see them often but I wouldn‚Äôt call them ‚Äúrare‚Äù. It‚Äôs an ingredient for a few fancy recipes.
---
What is 76 trying to sell us? Don't even give me the Atom Shop bullshit excuse because you can play the entire game without one time ever even looking at the Atom Shop. It's completely up to you. So now we have people calling F4's story an RPG when for years all I've heard was complaining that the story had no RPG elements to it?
---
I personally enjoy the game and would consider good in terms of enjoyment, but from an entirely objective and emotionally detached perspective the game is a barely functional pile of barebones mechanics and artificial grinds.
---
It's bloodied unarmed
---
thats NOT verticality, just having a high ground to look down upon. Im talking about places like apartments, or high ground railways that are actual places or connect to some other parts.
---
You will realize this more if you get marsupial and a jetpack. Its cool to have jetpack in 76 ofc but its really a novelty.  Marsupial is all you need. you can go very few high places in 76. Watoga? There are only a one or two spots where something happens at rooftops, near the northwest end. Rest it empty, no enemies, no life, no action, everything is blocked.
---
Lewisville? only couple story building and terraces, its just a 4 small islands.
---
Morgantown? eh, kinda, some lived in rooftops, several connecting places. couple high buildings, some mid sized, But again nothing interior other than 1 place. (I dont mean interior cell, i mean inside of an apartment). and like 2 other inside cell apartment couple floors. that it.
---
Charleston is a maybe. So many rooftops, floors, majority of buildings and roofs are empty but some bridges,  some capsized buildings, some super high buildings with some post war wood structures etc. I wish there was 3 or 4 more skyscrapers like Hornwright Industrial headquarters.
---
Maybe Im the black sheep but I wish players could claim some apartments, rooftops etc as their CAMP. We supposed to rebuild america, we cant even build camp near buildings.
---
Yup, because jetpacks are a mod for torsos and not their own piece of armor they cannot have a paint job applied and changed at will like you can with normal armor.
---
üëç
---
Nah theres nothing you can do
---
im running the game on a i9-9900k@4.9ghz, 280ti, 32gb3200 and ssd, also on a fresh pre tweaked custom os (reviOS) and it crashed today no error no nothing, the game just closed
---
i can run the game most of the time at 144fps but in big cities it drops down to 60fps, also the performance in NW is very bad. Why would they release a BR mode where the performance is so bad, makes no fun to compete against others when the game is stuttering all the time
---
yes, it does.
---
There seems to be so much push back on making more weapons viable, yet no one likes the grind to get a good weapon to drop. Balance would be not giving bloodied unyielding synergy for a massive stat boost, and having addictions be much stronger than a -7 to your total stats for 50% more damage. Mutant's should definitely give a 50% boost so that the chance of a great weapon prefix is 3/23 and not 2/23, which is still terrible.
---
I have never seen it since almost a year ago. If I missed it then that‚Äôs annoying. I‚Äôve been checking every week for the past couple of months.
---
6 in one, half a dozen in the other. I would prefer that my legendary effects have a significant role in my play style and build that have them be incremental bumps in power.
---
Also you can reduce the damage from 170% (bloodied plus adrenal rxn) to 50% (junkies) and people will still choose junkies with additional negatives from addictions over a flat 10% boost. It‚Äôs not just one op build that makes mutants look bad, it‚Äôs all builds.
---
Wait it‚Äôs up? I‚Äôll have to check.
---
There‚Äôs ways to get a jetpack and other chest piece mods. I know you could do it with ultracite PA for a while, there was also a craftable camouflage T-65 set that came with a jetpack on each piece, not sure if that‚Äôs patched though
---
I've collected all of them multiple times, yet it still says I'm missing one; when I'm not.  I just chalked it up to another bug
---
PTS is all well and good but not the same as a full stress test
---
(cough) Fasnacht
---
Wow that‚Äôs fast!
---
WELCOME TO THE RICE FIELD MUTHA F\*\*CKERS
---
Yeah. That's great. I can't play my favorite toon for 2 weeks or more, just park them next to a legendary machine for the entire time because he's now several hundred units overencumbered. I'd have to wipe out half my stash box to make room for all the scrip armor to free him up enough so I could actually use him. Which means I have to either drop/destroy most of that scrip or basically take everything out of his vendors and drop it. That's *awesome*. *Totally* worth the scrip.
---
Have you captured the one that is now Foundation?
---
whenever I run into them in a camp I just assume the owner is an asshole and steal whatever I can
---
I get pvp can be somewhat enjoyable in consoles I really do believe you are a console user cause you actually seem to want pvp in this game for some reason.  But pvp literally makes me want to puke and I think a lot of pc users will feel the same. Don't bring that garbage content back to this game just because it's enjoyable on your platform. That's just being selfish
---
The limit exists to keep people logging everyday to maximize atom sales, to maintain player engagement. Any other explanation is convoluted and delusional. This is exactly how the entire mobile gaming market builds their profit models.
---
Explo legacies
---
Now this is what I'm talking about! You've hit the nail on the head, my friend.
---
This.  Berserkers is a far, far, far more fragile build than Bloodied, has trash synergies with existing items and perks, yet it does significantly less damage.  Berserkers needs a massive buff.
---
They dont listen probably because youre wrong
---
I track them every day but only had auto complete once since the legendary run, in the past it used to happen when I played NW.
---
Well they are pretty good..
---
It‚Äôs not fixable. A lot of these bugs and exploits have been in the game for over 18 months with no fix. Make a TDM server and that‚Äôs all that is needed for pvp. It can be balanced far easier and can be coded correctly from the start. That is the pvp. I‚Äôll play TDM non stop. I‚Äôll never touch pvp in adventure. Far too much broken shit.
---
Pretty sure... Did all that before Wastelanders hit.   It would great if they listed the items next to the challenge. Some challenged list specifics, others don't, sadly, this one does not.
---
they were comments to posts. as time went on my posts got smaller until they evolved into that there.
---
the gist of it was that limits exist to stop those with way more time than others being able to dominate everything (well.. dominate it more than they do now) They'd control the market (more than they do now). They'd have all the good shit. Cap limits stops prices getting silly (even though people trade for 30k+ etc blah)
---
Vegas slot machines \*literally\* have better RNG than this game. If slots had 76's RNG, they'd be investigated by the Nevada state gambling commission.
---
I'm definitely not gonna pretend like I get a buttery smooth 60fps constantly in 76. I want it to look as best it can so I have everything maxed and I get around 40fps on average with bumps to 60 quite often and sometimes drops into the teens if there are tons of meat piles around.
---
Mod support for 76 would be beautiful. I'm just staying patient on that one.
---
If they made assassins apply to human NPCs also, then it would at least have a wider scope of use.
---
AA would be good. Junkies and furious would be the same damage output once all 5 bullets hit.
---
Vamp and instigating would be good now.
---
I wonder if ghoul slayer and such will
---
Still Work multiplicative after the change.
---
I think it‚Äôs the one you mean. It‚Äôs the steel grey not the green bloody one.
---
That makes me feel like we aren't even playing the same game but I respect your opinion.
---
Can you link me where you found this information?
---
That was the only one I could think of, if they didn‚Äôt bother to change the challenge but the workshop was removed
---
I too have enjoyed F76 for the most part. I see a lot of potential in it. Honestly I feel a bit jaded because some of my hope has been worn down by the incompetency of Zenimax
---
Harpers Ferry is, again not bad, a lot of rooftops, some inner and middle floors but its all cramped up, not a whole a lot to experience. You can get in some of the middle rows. Now I bet this is done because perhaps to increase FPS, and rushed out development. But still, Boston is superior for me...
---
people who have vendors up for long periods use these for defenses. It's so I don't come home to a destroyed camp. I have vending up for several hours a day. all of my collectors are unlocked too (except the ammo machine, i need my 5.56) The more you know.....  you can always tell if the camp is gonna have good prices by how locked or unlocked everything is. I max caps about once a week then buy from Smiley and sometimes a serum recipe.
---
Seriously?
---
yea brah if you cant level up in a game you play every signle day sounds like its time to quit you yankee quiter
---
It‚Äôs in the Greatest Hits shop tab, been there since Tuesday.
---
You and 200 others have posted about this issue.
---
I have always been a high health build - I spec'ed out commando with Quad weapons. I may have to put a few more rounds downrange, but stuff I shoot at still dies.
---
We dont have to pit sides, we are both struggling and it shouldnt be ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yeap, very recently they release new update completely overhauling treasure hunting system
---
We can have brahmin? How do you get them
---
FEZ
---
I would swap to Instigating for general farming and furious for boss fights.
---
Dude....disappointing af at this point I would probably be better off not getting hype about anything in this game I'm just gonna operate under the assumption that everything is gonna be delayed into oblivion that way im never disappointed!
---
That's what ran me off from destiny 2 year 2+. The power growth needed keep up new events worked out to 20+ hours a week as a solo player.  Was barely able to do any of the season pass stuff I paid for.
---
Okay, that makes more sense. I was thinking more in terms of the landscape while you're talking buildings. Just the area around Vault 76 is more hilly than almost any area we see in 4 lol. But 4 definitely exceeds in having many more locations with high rise buildings for you to climb and explore. You have basically Watoga, Charleston and the estates in 76 if you want that type of vertical-ity.
---
If i played all day i could also level up 2-3 times no sweat. The problem is being required to level a day, its not everyday that i want to grind.
---
I'd argue that a lot of the complaints I've seen floating around the subreddit aren't substantiated and most of it's just low effort mudslinging.
---
The over-dramatization of finishing the Legendary Run requires you to not examine the investment you need in order to actually do it.  These are people who have personally obligated themselves into a mindset that runs contrary to reality.
---
Damage Nerf is another one.  Damage needs to be gutted.  100% of the content in this game is not challenging, at all, because of how ridiculous damage is right now.  You've grown accustomed to walking around one-shotting everything with every build you play because #Bloodied, but it ruins the content of the game.  Pretending that everything is suddenly a bullet sponge because you need to shoot it more than once is another complaint that I feel is about people wanting to be drama queens.
---
If you don't enjoy events, if you don't enjoy quests, if you don't enjoy running SBQ for hours on end, if you don't enjoy cruising through nuke zones looking for Wendigo Colossus, if you don't enjoy whatever event is available at the time, etc... That's on you.  Nobody's requiring you to stay on the game, bludgeoning your psyche by doing something you apparently hate.
---
Stripping away 'time gates' is another terrible idea.  We don't have the content in the game ( hopefully only as of yet ) to support stripping away time gates.  "I want it now!" will kill any pseudo-longevity the game has as a substitute for while Bethesda tries to cough up some semblance of a game after 76's terrible launch.
---
That's not to say you can't levy criticisms at the game but flat-out lying about something because you don't like it doesn't help anyone and demanding that things change for the worse because you've exhausted every avenue of fun or enjoyment the game has to offer doesn't help, either.
---
I don't have a lot of sympathy for people who invest thousands of hours into a game while calling it shit non-stop and doing nothing but complaining.
---
Game has bugs.  Game's had bugs.  Game's going to continue to have bugs.
---
You can't fix the shit overnight.  Some of it will never be fixed, because it can't, because the engine won't allow it.  Everyone needs to chill the fuck out, realize it's a game and they can just stop playing it if it's ruining their lives.
---
Oh and just because the community wants something doesn't make it a good idea.
---
Sounds like bloody is getting nerfed pretty hard so you might want to swap over to a different HG build.
---
Hmm didn‚Äôt even think of quad, but as a Heavy weapons guy I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an option.
---
Manage your inventory.
---
You're not alone in that feeling. We keep expecting something mind-blowingly amazing but they seem content with just giving us the bare minimum. My hopes are high for the future of 76 as well as the eventual Fallout 5 but man do I have to keep myself in check as to not become overly disappointed.
---
Can you campare **Power Armor Reboot** and **Mysterious Savior**? Which is better? Do cards stack? I'm asking because Mysterious Savior uses 3 luck points instead of legendary points.
---
\+Limb Damage appears to still work wonders as a secondary perk on Heavy Weapons.
---
I use a Zealot +Limb Damage +FR LMG &amp; at the Queen, it absolutely shreds her.
---
The drawbacks to bloodied might be heavy enough that it's no longer worth using, especially bloodied melee which is right in the thick of it. But Junkie's will still be fine, its drawbacks aren't so bad that you'd suddenly rather use Furious than deal with five addictions.
---
But I've been using Instigating and Furious on my main weapons this whole time (2h melee tank) and I'm still dropping things with ease in the PTS. Tankier builds have an advantage on Bloodied for the Daily Ops simply because all that bonus damage (even post-nerf) is overkill, so survivability makes a bigger difference in completing the Op quickly.
---
I love the game there is a diamond underneath. You can tell this studio was working on mobile games before 76 just based on most new things they have added since launch. The daily limits really kill the vibe of the game. You get 2 hours max before you are done with everything. The seasons need to reward score for more than dailies for sure add missions, events, the new daily ops. Impatient people will spend money to get things faster, but this daily stuff will burn anyone out. I think they really need some new management to have a solid vision and really dive into the parts of 76 that the players find fun. If they do that I feel like 76 will truly shine. This of course is all my opinion.
---
Everyone been saying that for 18 months.  I'm definitely staying Bloodied
---
Bloodied will still dish out the most dps. It would just be a 30% to 40% damage difference to junkie.
---
This would be interesting but I'm just hoping that the Cultists become a joinable faction at some point.
---
I use level 1 armor, not broken armor. With 2 addictions I get -20 DR so I can wear an underarmor and a full set of level 1 armor (mix of leather and wood) to come out to exactly 0 DR again. I will forewarn that it's a long grind to roll the right armor pieces from the purveyor on a level 2 toon though...
---
You're welcome.  :)    Yes, absolutely take both factions as far as they can go before you have to make a choice.   Then, when you get the gold, you can choose to split it between them so that you have a little headway on reputation status with both factions...and really, you'll want to max out both.   It won't alienate your "chosen" faction besides a snide comment or something.
---
I'm happy to help.   I literally don't know how I could have made it without the help of other players.  It would have been so much more difficult, and I learned so much that I otherwise probably would have never learned.
---
I am opposed to a buff for Mutant's as the mutations themselves are already an enormous advantage that far outweighs any downside, especially once class freak is fully leveled.
---
That's so nice of rifle to clean your wounds after he beats you down.
---
I saw the videos. He only does this if you "take your punishment". Yeah, what a mensch...
---
Yes?
---
I understand not having a ton of time to complete the Legendary run. I'm a full time student and working full time. Teleworking a couple days a week is beneficial but still not enough for all day play.
---
What I do is save up all my dailies - go INT group and make sure I have broiled scorched beast brains and cobbler or the stew from mama dolce's. Change my END perk to Chem fiend x3.
---
Pick a starting point (usually foundation or Crater if other dailies are nearby) Pop both food and a berry mentats for the most Intelligence bonus possible then turn in like a mad man for the next 10 minutes. I've had some give me 4k XP per turn in and im lvl350+. This can usually get me 3 or more of the x100 scores and a level up (500) per day and of course making sure to complete the other dailies which are usually kind of simple. I havent purchased anything and I'm legendary run lvl 96 as of this post. Will more than likely hit 100 on Tuesday with weekly rewards.
---
I REALLY have to maximize the INT bonus XP in the game with limited game time available. If i'm close to leveling but need some quick XP, I'll hit Burrows or glassed caverns with the said items above and get 250+ per mob kill. OR (don't hate me) Radiation rumble and only kill mobs not complete the event. Tons of XP in those. I'll also do Guided meditation and only defend one speaker box as the others will get broken and filter all the mobs to where i'm defending. Maybe this can help with limited game time score gains.

Welcome to the suck

God? Oh God! I.....

---
I‚Äôve always wanted vampires to be worthwhile. Any idea how that‚Äôs working out?
---
becouse the developers don't know what they are doing it
---
But 80% health difference.
---
A lot of those videos don‚Äôt show that they are using bobble head, mags, and or chems.
---
I can kill a SBQ In 3 to 5 minutes with Gatling plasma when I use my phycobuff.
---
You should post your perk card build so it‚Äôs easier to see where the problem is.
---
That could be why then! Some people get really worked up over perk sharing. 
---
Basically, for every 3 points of charisma you have allocated towards your base special stat, you can share 1 rank of any perk card. So someone with 8 charisma can share a rank 2 perks card while someone with 9 can share a rank 3. Pick the card you wish to share(must have it equipped to your current loadout) and you‚Äôll see at the bottom menu that you can Press Y(for me it‚Äôs Y since I play Xbox) to share perk card. Your system should tell you what button to press to share once you‚Äôre hovering over the cars you wish to use!
---
I Think that is exactly what is going on. 
---
You can‚Äôt continue to put new walls on a rotten house... it‚Äôs just that simple. 
---
The house is still rotten.
---
Ahh so people are crying about a minor drop in DPS. I got ya.
---
That‚Äôs min maxing all around stats. If someone just wants to dps and not care about hp then bloodied it is.
---
dude my brahmin just liked to fall over dead all the time. I had an irradiated pond nearby so i figured that was why, but he dies so damn often.
---
Some of those players have a hair of health and rarely show how many times they get killed during the queen fight.
---
It would not be offline just so u know
---
Okay beckett
---
Just ran them again twice (once on each character), both elder rank with finish times around 7:30. Tesla or something with splash damage (explosive or fire) are super useful for the camouflage mutation.
---
Gear for comparison:  
---
Character 1 (Full Health)  
---
Vanguard Secret Service Armor (buttressed, all slots)   
---
Quad/FFR Handmade   
---
Anti-Armor/Explosive Fixer   
---
Vampire's/FFR/Perception Tesla   
---
Quad/Explosive/LVC Laser Rifle
---
Character 2 (Low Health)   
---
Unyielding Thorns Armor (polymer, all slots)   
---
Bloodied/FFR/LVC Fixer   
---
Bloodied/Explosive/Move Speed Combat Rifle
---
The bloodied character still absolutely does more damage. Like even with demo expert 3 on the AAE fixer the per shot damage on the bloodied one is near double and the faster fire rate only adds to that. This feels like the right balance for the tradeoff in livability, IMO. I know a LOT of people are going to be upset about not doing big number but this change makes more builds more viable. 
---
That being said, I had an easier time doing this particular daily op (camouflaged enemies) on the full health build because of my loadout including that VFFR tesla. Not having to be as particular with aiming or wait for them to break stealth made it a lot easier to deal with enemies. I recognize that my gear is better than a lot of folks but I'm not a meta monster and both characters are perked out for QOL as well as damage. A group of 4 people with average gear should absolutely be able to knock out that sub 8 minute time on basically any version of the daily ops with a couple of rounds of practice
---
Yea, the Bug that Turrets / Defenses shooting at each other is In the Game since its initial release and with the Release of Wastelanders and the Introduction of NPCs to the Game, well they shoot them as well now and the Case above is a UseCase where they strike back.
---
To be fully honest I can't think of a Reason why Bethesda hasn't fixed this bug yet. Given that F76 and F4 use partially the same Logic (aka Creation Engine) in the Background, it should be no Issue to Introduce a "No Target" Parameter which cant be targeted by C.A.M.P Defenses. Yea sure someone could exploit the Game and give himself this Parameter to Grief, but that a small Risk compared to the absolute Frustration that this Bug is to many Players
---
I've had a few that were unowned on my map but taken on my wife's map (we play together) and when I went to take it was owned. By the way, I apologize to any for taking them from you on ps4, I did it for the experience.
---
At this point, killing each other‚Äôs cows is one of the few ways we have to express hostility towards one another.
---
The day after this was implemented we‚Äôd be complaining about how we were at a camp killing a random mole rat, nicked a cow, and got wanted.
---
You're going to be losing out on some damage by not using Stabilized... To maximize your DPS you'll want to have all the heavy gunner cards and stack up your adrenaline. Bobbleheads and magazines can also give you a nice boost. And of course, prime those weapons. Always aim for her face.
---
From what I understand mysterious Savior isn't worth a look.
---
Everyone unfortunately wants the apocalypse to be a big safe space, I miss the old fallout 76 where people actually PVP and had reason to put bounties on other pkayers
---
It's impossible with how it currently works but I am trying to suggest a way for it to be possible to be done ahead of time. I get what you mean tho. I just really like being close where most new players will end up so I can give them plans and such. üôÇ
---
anti armor does have a downside, it's a regular weapon against enemies that aren't armored. Worse even than Mutants.
---
So it sounds like something the devs should look into then.
---
Agreed. I even posted a thread on the PTS forums with a few legendary perk ideas.
---
Yep
---
I‚Äôve always had a super tanky bloodied build. I can run around indefinitely with a ton of supermutants shooting me. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll be ok, just looking at options and figuring out which alternative weapons I should be saving instead of trading away.
---
Why.dont.they.play.Nuclear.Winter????? It's literally the way to PvP...
---
Fo76 is broken, and unfair for pvp, let alone the game itself isnt  suitable for PvP at all.
---
wanna know why they dont do that? people who want PvP DONT actually want PvP.  
---
They want to PvWin. Tailor their char for months for perfect for single shot to kill damage to other players, with perfect rare legendary armors, and weapons, and mutations....and then brag about how "surprisingly" they win and superior and cool and better than others they are lol
---
I almost never see player wanna PvP me when they are lvl 10, 15 or 35, or even 50. They almost always high triple digits.
---
This is honestly fucking bullshit. I wait weeks after it was already delayed once and now us console players still can‚Äôt play it? I don‚Äôt give two flying fucks if it‚Äôs broken, first they give the PC players the PTS now this? And it‚Äôs not even the fact that they‚Äôre delaying it a few days, they announced the delay on the *fucking day before the update was planned to go live*
---
I wouldn't call it a minor drop Dumbo.
---
All NPCs
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox or I would help, this mod seems to be one of the most common that I see at player vendors so you‚Äôre bound to find it soon. Idk if that helps but good luck out there‚úä
---
I've got a half built vampire heavy that doesn't use PA that I'm pretty happy with so far.
---
They‚Äôd try that. And then anyone who killed their own Brahmin would become wanted, because they‚Äôd code it badly. And then everyone would become wanted just for logging on. And then the Brahmin would start floating and a server would crash every time it happened.
---
We can‚Äôt ask for little changes like these because this game has so little support that the duct tape holding together the servers catches fire every time they try to ‚Äúfix‚Äù anything.
---
Go ahead and cry about your video game numbers. It really ruins my day.
---
What even is the point of killing or destroying someone else‚Äôs things? Like idk if it‚Äôs just me, but the most damage I do is milk your Brahmin and maaaaaaaaaaybe take some scrap if your stuff isn‚Äôt locked, which I need to stop doing
---
Scrip limits I can understand because when there is a dupe exploit that will be the first thing people go to, duping any 3 star legendary for insane amounts of scrip that wasn't legitimately earned. However, the gold bullion is capped for almost no reason. You can't trade any of the gold bullion plans or things you buy with it. Unless I am missing something, I don't see why they can't increase the gold limit from 5k to something more. Maybe to keep new bullion releases limited so someone can't buy all the new content at once, don't know.
---
All the plushies
---
Here's hoping, will have to go scouting through player stores haha
---
Yeah I play PC and console (main on PS4) and I know of and have been on the receiving end of all these people using bugs and hacking. But calling me selfish for wanting BGS to find a way for this to work is just as selfish as wanting to take it away from people who might want to jump in every so often because pvp as you said, ‚Äúliterally makes you want to puke‚Äù.
---
I've been running vampire weapons on my bloodied build for a while now.  I have to run my hp a bit higher, like 30-40% instead of 20, but with that small tweak I am happy using vampire weapons.  Quad works fine too for me.
---
But with all the new content coming it's going to be a hard time running with 5-20% health.
---
I mean, Vampire's doesn't add bonus damage and the health gain doesn't scale with damage dealt, so it's not really affected by the new damage calculations on its own. The opportunity cost of choosing Vampire's instead of a legendary that gives more damage is lower, but that's it. Try Vampire's now and if you like it, it should still be roughly as good after patch 22. (remember that Vampire's procs based on the amount of hits, so shotguns and automatics will give the best healing - dunno if an explosive weapon gives more procs for Vampire's though)
---
Probably because they tested it and it was a laggy stuttering nightmare. I play on PS4 and the game is infuriatingly slow lately. I let food spoil because it takes too long to craft. I routinely enter scorched earth and die before any enemies appear on screen. Add to a vendor? Hope you have an hour. Wanna use the quick wheel to swap weapons? Yea good luck if your in combat because your frozen for 30 seconds. I love this game and still play it but lately it‚Äôs getting to the point where it‚Äôs just not worth it.
---
To busy counting the money from FO 1st still.
---
Do the sneak perks work well with heavies?
---
That‚Äôs the way it should be. Risk reward.
---
But I can see what your thinking since bloodied is harder to sustain its dps since they die more often.
---
PA bloodied though don‚Äôt have this problem due to EP but poison can ruin their day.
---
Don't work with all the nerfs coming out it will take a full fusion core to kill a brahmin
---
I‚Äôve seen angry turtle on the pts, the nerf is is to all builds and it‚Äôs really not too bad, people just love to complain even tho you can still melt super mutants in 1 second instead of half a second lol
---
I only kill the wild ones next to flatwoods but for the record grilled brahmin makes for a great HP potion.

Who is crying Dumbo, I'm welcoming the change.

\*Laughs in Power Armor\*

Why haven't they thought of this one yet I agree
---
Wastelanders was a waste .

It really could have been great .....but it isnt
---
Arent we all?
---
I'm so done with their bullshit lol like seriously? And AND they didn't say shit until THE DAY BEFORE! Fuuuuck you
---
I lol'ed.
---
Sounds like fun, I have myself and one or two others that regularly play.
---
Bethesda has been bait and switch from the beginning. They really are full of it. I have too many other games I like to really give a hoot about theirs. A scale of 1 to 3 they rate about 3rd.
---
I kept it and scraped it
---
It doesn't revive you, it auto heals you. Like that auto regen bug with speed demon back not to long ago, only it's better and regenerates all health upto point of rads (if any).
---
And to be specific: It should tell you, without any doubt, which is yours and which isn't, scream it into my face.
---
On one occasion i died at the same time as someone else at the SQB, and even pretty close together.
---
I got back and grabbed my loot, just to see some minutes later, that someone else grabbed my loot. Dude... tell me it isn't mine, please?
---
So technically you didn‚Äôt stop playing a few weeks ago?
---
The effects are already game, just not enabled
---
bad camps should pay some price.
---
Come up with your own community and pvp with folks that join you. Just don't implement pvp modes that will attract pvpers to this game. Do not ruin this game. I call you selfish cause you are demanding pvp when you obviously know Bethesda can't do anything to counter hacks and cheats. Nothing's worked so far and the only solution we got was pvpers leaving the game. And you are literally attracting them back to this game by demanding pvp modes. Not cool man. Not cool
---
There‚Äôs a couple I really like:
---
* What Rads, if you can max it out, looks like it might be able to go into Nuke Zones with no Power Armor/Rad Suit (if you combine it with other Rad Resist perks &amp; say Rad Sheild).  Obviously not great for a bloodied build, but I want to try to combine this with Ghoulish.   If you are taking massive rads (but enough that you can heal back with the +6 rads a second) it should make for an interesting regenerating build. 
---
* Taking One for the team looks like it can help someone make a ‚ÄùTank‚Äú character, so I do like that one as well.  Maybe the +40% damage when people max it out can compensate for the changes in damage (Since we never had a 40% like this before.  Combine with Retribution and I might try making a ‚ÄúKnight in shinning Armor‚Äù Melee/Power Armor build. 
---
* the Survival Shortcut looked good for a support character, it was max food, max drink, Even just rank of it basically negates any food or drink issues.
---
The only thing i can say is BRUH that is all.
---
PC MASTER RACE!!!!!!
---
I want to see the signs again. The ones that have all the things for sale and such. I missed it last time.
---
I haven't logged into the game for at least 3 weeks. Dont argue semantics.
---
Enjoy your 2 FPS.
---
Damn, now I gotta use 3 bullets instead of 2.
---
I, 2nd. this. They will eventually abandon this game.
---
Don't know what you mean, I had a great time, no lag and lots of flux and junk
---
Fallour 76  is better ? 
---
Fallout 4 has automatron and far harbor ,i dont really need to say more
---
Sounds good. Thanks for the insight
---
I have 3 agility just enough for hiker. I never use stealth on my main heavy.
---
But stealth can work as well for heavy but you‚Äôll sacrifice quite a bit of other perk cards for that.
---
Hey. I just did Seneca rocks a real blast event and got this plan. üòÇ
---
So that might be one to try.
---
Oof get shut down
---
Not really... You can get a few sneak criticals here and there but you can't sustain them without a silencer.
---
I‚Äôll end up giving this a try, thanks!
---
Yes please give deets for us new players
---
Also all the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù effects still work so if you have any of those prefixes than you won‚Äôt even notice
---
Nothing memorable or worth wasting your time on. Let's hope they added something new for this year's meat week(seems they did)
---
I have 2 Charisma, perk sharing isn't an option. So if they kick me, I didn't want to be on a stinky, sweaty team of Manginas anyway.
---
I have a vampire medic commando with solar armor. I don‚Äôt even know what death is anymore.
---
For me, LitS is already sub 15FPS, mix a nuke and 12 players all going crazy with legacies there too? I‚Äôll drop to maybe 2FPM. Or 2 Flames Per Second off my WiFi router.
---
I bet, it will come back eventually, just be patient and make sure you check every day, they sometimes will surprise use with a item we not expecting ..Most of my camps and I have quite a few, all have the fences and they look great.
---
Might be boring, but I can't wait for poison mitigation.  That's basically the only damage type that makes me sweat, can't wait to plug that leak.
---
bro it looks like it is, i‚Äôm literally so hyped
---
If you are in white springs and arent around I will kill it
---
You got to send nudes to Todd Howard, the winners get some exclusive rewards.
---
Automatron and Far Harbor were both solid DLC adventures!
---
Good idea!  Going to try this
---
I was about to say, isn't it in the atom shop right now. I saw it but I am not sure I like the broken bottom, but I might be worth grabbing now that you mention it.
---
For me I only NW for the daily and even that is tough. Not the daily objective itself it‚Äôs getting into a match to start. God forbid I need to do 2. The whole process is a time sink without actually playing the game. And to your people not wanting pvp point they don‚Äôt because it so screwed. I agree that people do that no challenge there. Not asking for BGS to brute force the issue and just shove pvp in our face, but a way to make it enjoyable. Hell I‚Äôd be pumped with a way to Q into NW while playing adventure mode.
---
Wait until they have arrived and I'll donate a nuke card to the cause.
---
Exactly the green one was ugly I thought, the Silver one is the one he likely wants, might grab it as well.
---
Wait, plans tied to non-repeatable quests? Like what? 
---
That's either the dumbest or most evil thing ever.
---
The nerf isn‚Äôt just to bloodied builds its to everything, I get it‚Äôs going to be a bit more for bloodied because of the additive stacking instead of multiplicative but watching the pts right now it‚Äôs nothing crazy. You can melt and level super mutants in 1 second instead of half a second and the behemoth in about 4 seconds instead of 2. It‚Äôs not as bad as everyone‚Äôs making it out to be
---
This isn't just a management problem (which I wholeheartedly agree) but also a player one.
---
If players didn't show up &amp; keep throw money at Bethesda, we still wouldn't be in this mess.
---
Some players are coming around slowly no longer making excuses for Bethesda, pointing the finger of blame at Bethesda rather than their fellow players for fundamental game issues, refusing to spend any further money until Bethesda fixes some specific issue etc.
---
It's such a shame that it has to take a lot of players having to experience the problem first hand before they realise that these problems are real.
---
Took me a month, but I finally got one.  Keep plugging away, and when you finally craft one and realize the second star is garbage sigh loudly and craft some more.
---
Well, I was the facilitator of plenty of positive interactions pre wipe. Now I just get dicks taking my Poseidon Energy plant with a dozen ammo factories off me. When they made it open on Game Pass it became a lot more toxic.
---
It‚Äôs two events that run every minutes for 1 and every hour for the other. The hourly one basically involves doing a bunch of little tasks for grahm to throw a raging bbq. The every 15 minute event involves killing swarms of enemies and a legendary boss. 
---
You will get a lot of legendaries if you keep running the event, including a piece of armor at the top of the hour. There are some rare plans as rewards and sounds like they added new ones. The tenderizer plan will surely be sought after, no idea how rare it will be. Presumably this means legendary tenderizers could be a thing which would be amazing.
---
(Tenderizer is that huge hammer thing grahm carries)
---
You should try wired ethernet, it works fine for me
---
Nice idea but happily it is in the green zone. So no nuking Duchess.
---
To be honest with you. I have not seen a player do it. But mine gets killed by the environment. I watched over my camp the other day and a wolf came up and killed my brahmin and destroyed my collection box for collectron. Maybe someone you pissed off is doing this to you? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'd stab Melody Larkin in the throat if I ever caught her in an alley.

And get 20FPS? Sure, 20 flames per second will do my house wonders!

Oh my lord... no surprise at all. I'd do another Hitler reacts video, but the mods just delete it so... here's the Fasnacht one :D

It should require turning pacifist off to kill it.  I've accidentally killed friend's brahmins.  Not cool.

The plans will be cool to get but I can't wait to put on that Chally the Moo Moo outfit.

Your armor is about to break

Armor is broken?

There is a recipe that you can only get during meat week, someone can tell you what it is, somewhat rare I think.

Too bad, maybe It works for me cause I have 1gb per sec download
---
Unlimited scrip turn in limited scrip rolls per day everyone is happy and frees up strain on the servers . Win ,win imo !
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm more or less just looking for good alternatives to bloodied and junkies. Honestly I‚Äôm a little bored with the game and just looking for other builds to try.
---
I love killing brahmins
---
Semi fun 2 part event featuring everyone's favorite traveling salesman and cow.  Several times an hour there are hunting events for special meat...top of hour give meat and do other things while other people afk on the drums.  Get a 20 paper  weight 2h club or other useless items(flag and chef outfits).  I only have done one but didn't see the appeal that some folk have.

Don't kill Davenport, I'd miss his rage when I sell the photos to Ward.  I'm already at max rep and I still do it to piss Davenport off.

It's so obvious I don't know how I missed it üòÑ
---
It keeps restarting my PC today so I gave up after the third time. Might be a coincidence but idk
---
there comes a point where complaints are warranted when set dates are often not met
---
Im on ps4 unfortunately. I always see you pc people have the coolest stuff.
---
No each character should be its own playthrough.
---
I might have been in your server 2 days ago. Or someone had the same exact idea in the same location. Had a seedy shed and a cabin on ground level.
---
I did line im the sand last night and couldn‚Äôt get them to spawn on the middle. I did it before so I thought I had the tent placed properly.
---
I'm on PC and I still feel for the console players.  Sucks.
---
I suspect the delays so far have been due to some snags in implementing the event on consoles.  Makes sense since the event seemed to be running smoothly on the PTS.
---
I sell bits of everything. Plans, junk, spare flux, ammo, water, chems, stims....weapons, armor
---
i primarily am ps4, and i find the ps4 community to be very helpful, serious, and roleplay-ey. but yeah all communities are different in many ways from what ive seen
---
Blue is yours. Red is another player's death. Normal is dropped. Simple. Nuclear Winter has color coded shit.
---
My camp is in the south central part of the map. Very rarely enemies spawn around my camp. After wastelanders I'm surprised when a couple liberators spawn.
---
This is literally what I've done. I have been a bloodied build for awhile, but recently got a JE shotgun that I love.
---
I just kept my health the same (I'm used to playing that way anyways,) and then just got myself addicted and I love it! Junkie bloodied hybrid lol.
---
Sure can!  I was so happy to see these in the shop today
---
Nuka cola waving capy guy . I missed that one and need it to complete my nuka cola room .
---
What this guy said. The true power of low health builds is in the armor. I run my low health build with Vampire's stuff for everything minus the Queen.
---
yeah its just cool, it made me feel good that everyone was using my thing and i was happy i was able to help the community with the scorchbeast queen in more ways than one

Mutants should not be as strong as junkies 30% tops
---
BLINKY!!!!

I have a full set of 3* vanguards SS armor that I can‚Äôt do anything with even though it would be perfect for my secondary character since they were rolled with my main who is a Bloodied build with full unyielding SS armor already. I got the vanguards while trying to get my unyielding and really never had any use for it. I feel your pain entirely.
---
I‚Äôm not knocking you or your post, at all, but I never personally cared that they killed my Brahmin. 
---
It was when they farmed/destroyed my razorgrain. Monsters.
---
Aren‚Äôt those in shop for today under the special tab
---
Now we get to see whether Bethesda's excuse for pushing meat week by 2 days to allow people a chance to play A Colossal Problem event (rather than just missing yet another deadline) is bs or not.
---
If meat week &amp; A Colossal Problem release on the same day on consoles, we know that there were full of shit.
---
The way I'm looking at it is similar to fasnacht, it's an hourly easy couple of treasury notes and the every 15 minutes one some easy legendary..
---
The game is trash, they need to hire real coders to fix everything and bring the performance to today's standards, everything about this game isn't up to today's standards it's all sub par and mismanaged and not well thought out
---
I disagree, Instead let me destroy your entire camp. Next time don‚Äôt lock your door and I won‚Äôt need to blow it down to get to your workbench scrape all my loot. Good times so many locked doors I would destroy and sleep in your bed!
---
Have fun!
---
The responders paramedic jumpsuit and sack hood no hoses looks very similar to Jason‚Äôs pre hockey mask look .
---
Still waiting on the warhawk to return
---
I‚Äôm a full health/tank build and I support this message.
---
I saw those posters that are in the NW lobby in a YouTube video once and somehow I really want those. But don‚Äôt know if those were exclusive to the NW release or something like that
---
While I agree with the sentiment, it begs the question of who‚Äôs the bigger moron: the company that can‚Äôt make a single deadline, or he who believes those deadlines will be met
---
Yay this thread again
---
It‚Äôs the same for me. I put on my stealth suit and become the conduit for the entire event, and get shit rewards (fedora) if I get anything at all.
---
Stash size should be increased only when you can guarantee it won't negatively effect server stability.
---
Awesome build.
---
Yes dear god account wide learned plans are needed!
---
Fallout 1st, the ability to scrip legendaries, and writing my Fallout 76 novel.
---
I like when people create titles like they are posting something with all sort of links and facts, and then proceed to say ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a bunch of things I don‚Äôt like‚Äù
---
&gt;Is this acceptable for any content from a AAA developer
---
I think your A key got stuck there.
---
My friend who's brand new to the game who is only level 21 also crashes often... I don't think it's something to do with "hoarding"
---
Aw, man, sorry :(
---
I would run a Junkies and Mutants build if this were the case. As would most people. Would give you much more versatility in your weapons.
---
Yeah I gotta up my game then...
---
wow so they r doing the same shit like eso?
---
Yeah there are a handful tied to main story quests that arent guaranteed drops
---
Effectively, there are some things that can still "one shot" you, but anything that doesn't deal enough strong hits to kill you in a very short time frame will be healed off very rapidly.
---
Pictures or it didn‚Äôt happen.
---
Legendary perks were supposed to be shared across characters. I don‚Äôt know what happened
---
It's simple why we don't. Not enough players per server.
---
You could funnel all pvp players onto the same servers to get around this issue but then it's a separate game mode like Survival mode &amp; we know that's not happening any time soon.
---
The only way I can see it work is either have pvp team max of 2 players per team or do similar to Hunter/Hunted but without that event's game mechanics.
---
Would be awesome.
---
Good point and worthy to consider for sure. Since this is a MMO (or whatever you want to label it as since its not a true MMO) I dont see how a "power creep" could be stopped while keeping current content relevant. Off the top of my head I cant think of a game that can pull it off. Take WoW for example: once a new expansion comes out the previous content is relatively worthless aside from achievements and collectables. 
---
One way to help not make past stuff useless would be events like the holiday gifts or mole miner pails. Of course, they cant reuse the same rewards over and over again. Thats just frustrating, lol.
---
Regardless, changes will come. Nerfs will be made and we will either have to live with it or move on. 76 has endless potential. I just want to see this game be something amazing. Not that it's bad now; I put ~700 hours into it so no complaints. However, they could make this game live on for decades. Adding new states, for instance, would tremendously impact the game and provide tons of exploration and content. Sadly, i get this gut feeling they only care mostly about the quick and easy revenue over anything else. Hopefully im wrong.
---
Both games have issues. I hate the main questline in fallout 4 and fallout 76's is good in theory. I like the variety of guns in fallout 76 compared to fallout 4 also. I also dislike how much grinding is required in fallout 76 and I think that is the main problem with it
---
No shade intended, but does anyone remember when people just stopped playing a game they were tired of and didnt feel the need to write a public statement declaring their reasonings. Feels unsolicited.
---
1) No one demanded anything. I never once said this needs to be a thing but rather gave a suggestion for a thing that myself and a lot of other pve players who want to maybe change it up a bit and get some TDM going for time to time might enjoy. 2) Saying there is nothing BGS can do is more of a generalization then a fact. If nothings worked so far then keep trying. And like I said before there are no demands here except for maybe a way to Q into NW from adventure mode with my group like I‚Äôve stated before. Trying to take me out at the knees on the internet?...Not cool bro, not cool.
---
with the acid node?  That's where my base is!
---
Berserker!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 50% ah yeah....
---
(broken stealth armour = invis, high rad resistance, and 50% damage to ALL shots... EZ)
---
It takes maybe an hour and a half to do dailys, and that's only if they are on the more difficult side, the easier sets can be done in about thirty mins, and the weekly challenges take maybe an hour and a half max(except kill legendary enemies cause that's luck.) 
---
So your argument of there's only so many you can do to me at least is invalid(for the record I'm on teir 38 right now, because I don't really give a fuck about 90% of the cosmetics and prefer to play other games most days) however it isn't difficult in the slightest to finish up the challenges if you really want the rewards, and like I said before most children are doing other things not playing games from the time they are done with school
---
Expectation and hope: Tips, tricks, and kindness
---
Reality: Dicks...so many poorly drawn dicks
---
I only kick players off my team if they keep sharing perks that are annoying or bad for my build. Are you sharing any perks?
---
ok
---
You have to be the one to score the final killing blow yo complete it. About the only way it's possible, is on a PTS   solo, or with a willing team
---
Wait. What the hell was the PTS for if they're just going to test it again live on PC first?
---
If there was a consistency to what causes the crashes it wouldn't be so bad.
---
Bloodied is still king of damage. I‚Äôm finding that I‚Äôm sticking with Bloodied for general farming and switching to Vampires (still at low health) for more dangerous situations like Daily Ops, Collosal Problem and likely SBQ (haven‚Äôt tried that yet on PTS). 
---
It‚Äôs not as big of a damage drop off now, so trading a bit of damage for survivability doesn‚Äôt feel so bad. 
---
For heavy weapons, Anti Armor might yield some good results as it‚Äôs not a damage buff, but I have no heavy characters so can‚Äôt test.
---
Honest question I felt like?
---
I'm sure, but that doesn't mean they didn't do a number on the faith people have in them lol
---
My thoughts exactly.....
---
Its been working this long.
---
I was more referring to you liking repair kits lol. Junk is everywhere in this game, why wouldn‚Äôt you just repair at a workbench?
---
Your endgame is so much different to mine..... (*looks around at piles of bad SS rolls littering the countryside*)
---
In was thinking that but I‚Äôm curious how much it actually will affect things
---
it seems fairly obivous to me that most have lost a lot of faith and good will towards Bethesda
---
maintenance are always on the long side
---
new content is always marred with bugs be it new ones, or old ones that come back
---
and with the detailed summer calendar they had out, now no one really expects them to deliver most of their promised stuff on time
---
people seem very well aware, as far as I'm concerned
---
no builds are being "opened up"...they are nerfing dmg across the board and heavily nerfing bloody melee, thats it. This does not make other builds viable, it just makes the game more of a bullet sponge
---
Chally's Feed?
---
i maxed that card out to test it  .  At max it is 40% to autoheal.    I let some mutants kill me several times to see what happend and also how much it would seem to proc in pratice.
---
When it proc it is really strong - you dont get down like life saving armor , you get the proc icon and just keeps going like nothing happend.
---
However i dont think i will getting it when it goes live.   Playing in a T65 with EP felt really tanky and i actually had to remove dodgy and ricochet so the mutants could kill me in a reasonable time:)
---
I fell like takeing the new posion card ( works in PA now ) and some extra special point in endurence , agility and luck has more potential for more tankiness
---
Thanks man. I thought I never would see it again. I just got it.
---
Wait, base of 50? I thought it was a base of 45. Also you said 30 additional special, but I thought the cards showed only 4 tiers in the video I saw. That aside, 80 perk points (albeit it would be a while to get all those legendary perk points) would make for a solid build. Might actually go for it. Could rock all those lighter weight perks for food, chems, ammo, and the extra space while also rocking my desired perks for my commando build with even the suppressor and tenderizer perks as well. I'm going for it!
---
Well thought out and well reasoned, someone working at Bethesda must know this - so why does it remain so ? I can only guess that the algorithm they base their decisions on points them in a different direction , kind of like those drivers you sometimes read about who follow their sat-navs into lakes.
---
It's very common knowledge that patching on PC is a  much simpler &amp; cheaper task than console.  I'm assuming bethesda doesn't want to go through the big hassel of updating the game twice in one week on console, whereas doing so on PC isn't as bad.No one is stopping you from educating yourself with a simple internet search to learn more on the subject.
---
You heard'um Todd. Random guy on the internet has blown holes all over your profit model. Why are you paying experts with experience when you can get it for free from anonymous forums?
---
So you're saying the game has a database failure bug?
---
Tato salad recipe
---
Thanks a lot. Good thing I decided to comment here or I would really would have missed it yet again.
---
Just bought it.
---
Well..... You're not wrong
---
Definitely not a poggers moment. Enjoy the award
---
76 in game economy is pure communist and not capitalist - all these limits and caps on everything, the lack of free markets cause some items can't be traded, etc.  Controlled by your Bethesda overlords and they make you slave away at the game.  The atom store on the other hand - pure capitalism and greed at its finest too.
---
You are very correct.. but my gumption to search for scrap was lower than my interest in continuing the story and this helped. By the time I ended the story I was more attuned to the scrapping game and have used repair kits scarcely since.
---
Well, double xp then bestesdwa!
---
I learned that she is immune to bullets.
---
Thanks man I appreciate reply. I actually thought that was a cool bug.
---
Seriously though a note system would be really cool. Like a combat knife sticking out of a tree with a piece of paper attached. Or an open journal or something
---
I know my friend stop playing because of all of the inventory management. If you are new to this game and your weapon and armor break you are dying don‚Äôt have scrap to do what you need because you don‚Äôt know you need to hoard scrap then you can be turned off quickly and never understand how easy it is at a high level
---
Are you on PC?  If so I wonder if you files are corrupted or modified in some weird way.  Could be a bug or a mod of some sort.
---
Oh trust me, I know how it can be. I am playing a "chaotic neutral" "raider" rocking the raider pathfinder mask, piper's goggles, treasurehunter suit, handmade, with a face looking like Kellogg's. Was hoping to have a camp rocking those firebarrels for light sources.
---
I'm holding out for the chain-linked fences and the Ranger Tower which were datamined for the atom shop. Setting up an ammo depot camp. If they give us a quonset hut (barracks/hanger building) all the better. I am hoping those instance interiors allow us to mess with "hammer space" in some instances so I can make a tunnel system into a mountain. Have the warehouse, the store, the workshop, barracks, mess hall, and rec center. But only time will tell how that interior system for camps will work.
---
BRAHMIN RIGHTS
---
Right next to it lol. I didn‚Äôt notice it until I finished my camp. Can‚Äôt really complain, as the campfire and free tables are pretty nice
---
4 tier SPECIAL cards are, +1, +2, +3 and +5
---
It's actually 56, I forgot that you get 49 levels and you have 7 all of which start with 1.
---
Considering that it takes 834 levels to get all perk cards on top of cards that you need, that'll take a while yeah.
---
Brave of you to assume they have teeth
---
Hasnt that been proven with the Fallout First unlimited Stash?
---
Xbox my friend hoping mods come to Xbox at some point.
---
ignoring critics
---
This is a subreddit for Fallout 76. By definition, any opinion on the game cannot be unsolicited. Putting that aside, OP‚Äôs post is too reasoned and considered to be lumped in with the more flouncy ‚ÄòI‚Äôm leaving!‚Äô posts we see fairly regularly. One says ‚Äòpay attention to me‚Äô the other says ‚Äòpay attention to the problems.‚Äô I have far more time for the latter.
---
Really would be. Small "Tales From Appalachia" or something along the same lines. So you could tell your perspective of the aftermath. With a few dicks drawn somewhere as well, ya know, to let people know were still humans.
---
For junk items, yes.
---
For weapons, armor and other none stackable items, no.
---
It‚Äôs so true. Everyone forgets (or wasn‚Äôt present) for last years shit show of updates. I‚Äôd forgotten about that version mismatch, what a total embarrassment. And remember the deluxe version fiasco, where they lied about the quality of the item, then asked everyone to submit support requests - then breached data protection by accidentally making all the support requests public, showing everyone‚Äôs username, email, billing address and billing method!
---
Bethesda is becoming more and more like government - everyone expects so little now, but we still keep believing in it and funding it. 
---
Your summary is totally accurate friend, I wish ANYONE at Bethesda cared half as much as you clearly do.
---
It‚Äôs a dick suit and I want it.
---
Managing three different PTSs is probably well beyond Beth Austin's ability. The fact that pubg &amp; dayz did it is probably more a sign that its a bad usage of resources than anything as both games squandered their inital popularity with terrible developmental decisions.
---
I want to know if it has effects on it like the gutter. It has a base damage increase along with a vampire effect. 
---
And you can craft it using legendary modules.
---
An armor piece is about to break
---
Only thing to disagree with is the last part. What‚Äôs wrong with capitalism? It makes sense that scarcity determines value.
---
Oh right so that would be 86 then right? Could have about 12 perk points per S.P.E.C.I.A.L. with 2 points left over. Honestly that is a solid thing for me right there.
---
A tale as endless as time, heck even [Hadrian‚Äôs Wall](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/28/roman-britain-phalluses-hadrians-wall) had em. And ooo that‚Äôs a good title, friend I dig it.
---
Not to mention the system where everyone has to damage the same creature by a specific amount for everyone to get XP, even if are all in the same squad. Like c'mon, that's co-op multiplayer 101 to have shared XP distributed to all nearby teammates.
---
This was one of the primary reasons most of my friends stopped playing the game within the first month (along with the many, many team based bugs at launch).
---
Oh ok. I just figured stash size was stash size. Didnt know the difference in junks vs other things mattered.
---
"try" to solo all the events? Have all serum recipes? All alts above 50? All locations discovered? Tadpole and possum badges complete? All backpack mods? All the gold bullion items? And then of course the real endgame...run around naked helping new players. There's more to do in this game than I think I could ever do.
---
I hate that gold bullion plans is not account wide. But I can see why since you could bypass the gold limit doing so.
---
I have been pleasantly surprised joining FO76 when Wastelanders arrived. I would say mechanically FO76 is the best in the series if you discount two major flaws. That being the stash limit which is antithetical to the idea of Fallout and the grind for rewards that comes from it being an online game.
---
However, I would entirely have to disagree with you from a lore/story perspective. While it's nice that Wastelanders gave FO76 a story, even this is relatively minor in comparison to prior Fallout games with no characters that are really particularly memorable and not much ability to alter the overall shape of the story due, I presume, to the limitations of it being an online game.
---
There are some weird lore matters in 76 as well, although they can all be explained away. To me it is weird that there is a Brotherhood chapter here at all. I know they were contacted by Maxon via radio but I'm surprised connections for this were even able to reach that far. Don't even get me started on Brotherhood vertibirds given that one of the major plot points of Fallout 2 (I believe 100-150 years after 76?) is the Brotherhood trying to find schematics to make vertibirds.
---
One of the other points being Bethesda's weird need to make even better Power Armour in each game, looking at you Ultracite and Secret Service PA. These gripes are largely personal however.
---
Also why is everything so green? Place has been nuked so many times by the people supposed to be rebuilding it that it should be as barren as the Mojave.
---
Overall the game is much better than I thought it would be and I do enjoy it from a game mechanics perspective (besides the above issues) but from a story stand point is in my opinion still the worst of any Fallout game that is still considered canon.
---
Thanks for the overview.
---
Kinda, but also nah. Bethesda having a monopoly is communist, but otoh people being able to produce and compete in a free market (producing rifles, selling goods, etc) is also capitalist.
---
Hey you‚Äôre not wrong at all.  I‚Äôve recently hit the camp building ‚Äúwall‚Äù as it were.  I have 5 camps that I really like, all max budget minus 1 FU (don‚Äôt ask....).  Any new cosmetics I have to take things away, so it makes me less likely to buy more camp atom shop items.  I‚Äôm not a PA player, so those are out, and I already have plenty of great outfits to where I force myself to change outfits, per character I am playing at the time, every Tuesday.  In essence, the game has locked me out of the desire to buy cosmetics because i can‚Äôt use them.  
---
Am I hopeful for the ‚Äúbunker‚Äù they‚Äôve talked about adding?  Well in my imagination it would be a kick ass thing!  A bit of a mini game for your camp as you clear things out (think vault 88 in FO4), cap sinks for expanding, etc etc.  we‚Äôll likely get a 8x8x8 box to build in and promised more in the years to come.
---
That's what I did too. Addictions are easy to acquire and get rid off so it's quite fun
---
That'd be cool, I'm just excited for a new 2handed melee to use with my new build.
---
So I'm guessing if it's craftable with modules then you can buy the plans for it with gold?
---

---
When it bugs out like that if you try with a different character it might complete it
---
That‚Äôs not to say that Bethesda is in the wrong or anything, we don‚Äôt have to play FO76 if we don‚Äôt want to, I‚Äôm just trying to make an analogy. Of course Bethesda has the right to determine what is sold.
---
If we're using metaphorical examples: if a restaurant takes 1 hour to serve you after you order &amp; your food is burned than yes i think a complaint is in order.
---
Can't get colosser.
---
I have enjoyed building up 5 characters. It is hard to imagine playing with just one for all the reasons you mention. But now I have hit that limit I can totally see what you mean. There's only so many outfits, guns, skins, and even with 5 characters all with a niche (of sorts: bloodied heavy PA, Junkies heavy PA or non PA VAN, bloodied shotgunner non PA UNY, berserker commando non PA CSS, bloodied commando non PA UNY) I've hit the limit. Plus I feel punished my 500+ levels are all separate so I'm going to be hurt by the legendary perk system. Boo.
---
Yep. Try cancelling the fishing animation when a fuckin Yao Gaui gets the drop on you. Get staggered and belted into oblivion.
---
Why OP jumping into a Pulowski Preservation Shelter?  Those things never worked.
---
It‚Äôs an daily ops drop I believe.
---
should be patched with this week's hotfix.
---
That‚Äôs a whole separate issue though. Limits should not be ever reached by the average player
---
F76 novel -- is it available??
---
Sorry for your loss, but showing your true colors that you'd use your own mother's death to make a swipe at OP.
---
Classy as always David.
---
Given that some of the bugs that keep reoccurring, I think its going to take a rewrite from the engine up to fix the game.
---
Oh okay, well that's still cool. I kinda enjoy being able to craft legendary versions of weapons, though it is just another grind haha but it's better IMO than just rolling randomly at the Purveyor
---
It's only been repeated ad nauseum, but the FO1st scrap box isn't a major load on the servers because it's only tracking approximately 30 or so basic junk components and their quantities rather than multitudes of individual unique weapons and armor pieces. It takes much less effort for the game to check "player x has 30k wood, 25k steel, 10k lead, 10k glass, ect" than the game to track the same players collection of legendaries with various mods, condition levels, ect. In reality the scrap box vs stash box argument is like comparing apples to oranges.
---
Damn pretty cool story but didnt ask
---
If it‚Äôs not engaging why do you keep logging in?
---
They pretty tough, I was cornered by 5 invisible Colonel Gutsys that were just tearing me a new one, killing one just spawns another right there, I died...lots,  certainly designed for teams:-)
---
FFS. Thanks beefytrout. I would've woken up tomorrow rushing to nuke.
---
This is also relevant to my interests!  Here's a link to pictures:
---
That's why I carry a shovel.
---
Would be great if they took a long look at Warframes system yeah. I completed it and got what I wanted ages ago and can now just play the game when I feel like it. If I want everything in 76 it's going to be a chore. There are plenty of things I want but I have already given up on it pretty much.
---
Shit I'm a mutated Bloodied PA Heavy guns build, what does that make me?!?
---
damn i didn‚Äôt ask for you to be an asshole
---
So i can just gun down player brahmins consequence free? Say less lol
---
They probably wanted to make the squad for their friends, but there isn't a system in place to lock it so only friends join. Do only public squads get team bond bonuses or do regular groups get that, too? Haven't formed a regular group since launch, so wouldn't know.
---
Why are people downvoting this? Do they not believe it?
---
I leave my collectron/water purifier unlocked so folks can freely pull from them. I‚Äôve always just operated on the principle that if it‚Äôs unlocked, it‚Äôs free game.
---
Except it‚Äôs not a free market in game - it‚Äôs a controlled economy with set limits and the overlords tell you what you can and can‚Äôt sell and takes anything you get over 30k caps.   So pure communist in game, pure capitalist out of game.
---
school's out bro.
---
Exactly! Have to keep the tradition going. It defines us. I wish i could say it was original, i believe i got it from someone posting pictures with the title Postcards From Appalachia or something similar. But thank you anyway! (:
---
Oh no! How else will I get 20000 steel?
---
Bethesda, are you absolutely kidding me with **another** last minute delay and it ONLY effects console!? No wonder your reputation is in the dumpster. What an absolute joke of a company.
---
BuT iT's OnLy A sMaLl DeLay! Shut up.
---
Im sorry oh reddit lord. Please forgive my question that others have made to the same post that others have made.
---
As someone else has said, it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúbug‚Äù - it‚Äôs just very unlikely. 
---
You have to be the player who physically kills the queen, so it has to be the last hit. It‚Äôs hard to get, but not impossible. Some players have it
---
I hunt for RibEye Steak...  Thank you!
---
My pleasure! Keep living your best life my dude!
---
HOLY SHIT!  That's great!
---
Stable flux despawns for some reason man, no one touched your loot bag
---
Split into two parts - prime cuts, and cook off.
---
Prime cuts happens every 15 mins, is an event held in 3 locations (easy, medium, hard) where waves of enemies come followed by a legendary. Rewards "prime cuts". Good for farming XP, getting legendary weapons, and farming resources (one was yao gui which are great for springs/adhesive).
---
Cook off happens every hour on the hour. Grahm has a big BBQ. You can turn in your primal cuts for scrip. To make the event a "success" you have to do various stuff - feed chally, turn meat spits, play drums etc etc. Theres no enemies so its a big chill out event while Grahm rambles on about stuff. Its quite nice to have a break from fighting things to play some drums while a super mutant tells you about his favourite types of meat. 
---
At the end of it theres some unique rewards.
---
Sbq has verry high armor, you want armor pen from stabilized
---
It may be fixed this week, but who knows with Bethesda.  Make a friend and you can complete it on a private server or server hop on public until you can complete it.  It may a few or 20 mins.
---
I'd say furious. But that's getting the same nerf, so... I don't know why you would switch.
---
Clearly must be the game and can‚Äôt be anything on your side, look at the pages of posts of people having the same problem...
---
Why don't you build an enclosure that's not easily accessible to store your brahmin in? I don't intentionally kill them, but I've killed them before when I was a new player because I didn't realize that tame brahmin were even a thing. No one tells new players that.
---
Is the War Glaive a craftable legendary?  I've heard the plan drops from Ops.
---
You as well! Stay safe my friend!
---
i mean i run a junkies handmade with unyielding lol
---
This works on every terminal, not just the ammo converter. Honestly we dont have a lot of menus normally in terminals, but when trying to exit any terminal quick, just hold the back button.
---
"Cryo Glave" o__O)? Suddenly very interested
---
IMO they should have released a DLC that was just Fallout 4 CO-OP to tide people over while they kept working on 76. Then see how the reaction was to that and maybe have released 76 at the end of this year or maybe even some point in 2021.
---
The reason they may not have done that could be that it's rumoured that the netcode of 76 is based to have future CO-OP in Bethesda singleplayer games and not the other way round like I suggested they should have done.
---
It's a shame as while I personally do find a decent amount of enjoyment in 76 there isn't much doubt in my mind that it has been harmful to Fallout, Todd and Bethesda's brand. You really only have to think how Bethesda and CDPR used to be considered on similar levels and God Howard was not meant ironically. Now with 76 people tend to look at Bethesda closer to the likes of EA and Activision.
---
&gt; If players didn't show up &amp; keep throw money at Bethesda, we still wouldn't be in this mess.
---
Right... there'd be no game at all then?
---
For real dude, theres not much downside either when your wearing unyeilding and have a bunch of mutations with class freak.
---
Supposed to be patched tomorrow
---
&gt; I am now lost in the DMV which, is funny and fitting. JUST CALL MY FUCKING NUMBER.
---
I pulled up a guide to do that one because it never seemed to work the way I expected.
---
How many atoms?

They probably wanted just their group of three to be in the party and no strangers. As far as I know, public groups are the only groups that get that team bond bonus and there's no way to lock the group or make it private (without losing the bonuses). It probably has very little to do with you or your level.
---
Should really be this. Is what it was in FO4 and now that we have human NPC's it should just include them and players.
---
So it's more like insta heal, isn't it? Good to know.
---
Another question. Does **Power Armor Reboot** stack with **Revenant** perk?
---
Stable flux is removed by the game if you die too close to the end of SE.
---
Just fyi mothman isn't an event as far as I know, I'm new too started at the beginning of the month, mothman appears sporadically at night and there's a cult following in game so I'm sure there's a quest line or something.
---
Managing one pts is beyond their ability.
---
Funny thing: yesterday I also finally decided to try my hand at nuking and also ended up at site Bravo!
---
I‚Äôm level 126 and managed to do it solo. My only damage perks were Tenderizer and Bloody Mess (and Mysterious Stranger, but that ended up being not as useful as I hoped for), though I did have a Troubleshooter Minigun with explosive bullets. Still, for some enemies (namely Assaultrons) I did use a Flamer and Plasma Gun also modified into a flame thrower.
---
For armor I had the Iron Clad perk rank 5 and a full set of Scout armor with polymer mod. I used it most of the silo, except during the reactor section, where I switched to my X-01 armor (tried with a Hazmat suit first, but died quickly), which unfortunately rendered me with overweight, but thankfully I still managed to repair the pipes (markers appear on one at time, which may not necessarily be the closest one) despite my reduced mobility.
---
Overall, Assaultrons gave me the hardest time, even the SPOILER.... Sentry Bot boss went down quickly in comparison.... END SPOILER. Unfortunately, even if you die in the last sections of the silo, you still respawn at the entrance, but at least most enemies in previous sections remain dead (with the exception of a lone Mr Gutsy I ran into at one point). And speaking of respawning, Assaultrons also respawn, so definitely prioritize their destruction, but beware that a replacement will soon appear.
---
Midway through the silo you will find crafting stations to fix your weapons &amp; armor, as well as scrap junk.
---
The last section was actually the easiest for some reason. The previous section was the one that I initially didn‚Äôt know what to do since you have to find mainframe cores or fix broken ones. The former are scatted around, but the broken ones are in the console next to the large locked door and you can just removed them all, take them to nearby tinker station and repair them there, then just put them back in place. Definitely much easier than mindlessly looking around the large room for new ones while more robots keep spawning.
---
And in the section before that, you need to destroy consoles around the room. Hit them until they stop taking damage. There are are more than you need to destroy around the rooms involved, so don‚Äôt waste too much time if you can‚Äôt fully destroy one due to the enemies attacks.
---
Ultimately, I managed to finish all tasks, put the nuclear keycard, inserted the code... and nuked the Atlas Observatory, as any good Enclave soldier should do. Well, that and the silo run took longer than I imagined, so I had to log out soon after finishing, so decided that if I would be unable to make use of the nuked area, I would at least hit something I wanted to nuke for fun.
---
Anyway, I play on PS4 so I can‚Äôt help you directly, but if you have any questions I can try to answer them!
---
Yeah.
---
They all seem pretty lame.
---
I let my brahmin free so players who need to can milk it. As I said in my post I created a sign specific to newbies which explains that there's no benefit in killing my brahmin and that they get no loot nor any xp from doing so.
---
I agree with all of these points and while I can understand them not wanting to make changes that affect the core gameplay loop without data driven input, to some degree, to validate stash sizes and currency cap, there has to be some form of experimentation going on so that the live service can scale and grow to where...or however the user base drives it. Whether that‚Äôs the playable test server or incremental adjustments with major patches to gather enough significant data and make a decision on what helps scale the game appropriately, there needs to be some evidence out there that Beth is iterating...I‚Äôve only been playing four months but I haven‚Äôt seen any.
---
And the inability to (at cost if necessary via caps, bullion, etc.) respec your build when you receive a significant new weapon or piece of armor that‚Äôs build defining, discourages engagement by not letting players experiment and / or immediately enjoy the gun / armor. If you‚Äôre a melee PA build that you really enjoy and a great Fixer or Lever Action drops...You‚Äôre certainly gonna think twice about redefining your entire build to fit a play style you may not ending up liking and then where do you go from there? Grind out 20 more levels at level 250 to revert back?
---
I can‚Äôt imagine any downside to on the fly respec‚Äôing...again, at cost if necessary to maintain some level of commitment. It‚Äôs good for more fluctuating meta definition via build experimentation and significantly prolongs player engagement by opening up more gameplay opportunities to the individual players. Also, keeps player to player sales transactions stimulated and valuable by being able to potentially buy all the other build necessities in a relatively short amount of time versus hoping for purveyor rolls.
---
There‚Äôs so much upside, I just simply can‚Äôt understand how they‚Äôve gone two years making sure it‚Äôs as hard to engage with all of the weapons, armor, builds as possible.
---
I agree.   How do you know they have any intention of coming back for it?   Sometimes when I die, I just leave the stuff there.   I've accomplished whatever it was I wanted to do and don't feel like another loading screen to pick up the dropped loot.   Just on to the next thing.
---
This is good news if so. Thanks!
---
Thanks for that. I was definitely going for the latter. With so many developers moving towards live service (and most botching it), I can only play so many titles. I WANTED 76 to be in the rotation. Somewhere deep down, I still do.
---
No need to be a dick because you're ignorant. I'm just pointing out that your misinformation has been corrected on nearly every post discussing the scrap box "proving that stash doesn't negatively affect servers" and explaining why that isn't the case. I could have just acted like a prick like you and just called you out for being wrong, but i figured I'd do you a favor and correct you. There was no need to get defensive over it.
---
No mate I've done a solo queen &amp; it still didn't work, unless it's been fixed recently I might have to try again &amp; supposedly in over 3000 hours I've also never been to abandoned bogtown.
---
Why are you carrying any loot into a pvp area?
---
That‚Äôs black and red on my game.
---
If you are on Xbox you are free to use my private world if you like, GT: creepyzuzet, drop me a dm
---
There is no scrap box in there so the ghouls that die in there and I loot end up in my inventory
---
Because it is wrong.
---
Looks like somebody is on their period
---
I don't mind delays as hopefully it means it will be nice when it's released but the last minute-ness of all their delays is the annoying part.
---
Do they not test things until the day before like "oh yeah we should probably check on that"
---
At this point legitimately stop releasing dates because they can't stick to them.
---
Assuming management don't change to keep players happy, yeah.
---
My dailies autocompleted once on me when I was logged on during reset. After that I made sure to be logged out. I reached rank 100 a few days ago, and so ever since I don‚Äôt bother logging out for reset. And they have not auto completed a single time since I‚Äôve been staying in game for reset. Who knows what causes it... but being logged out or being logged into the game seems not to matter.
---
Im hoping the "Fallout shelters" update will do something like FO4. The concept of having instanced CAMPs with possible settlement like buiding things like a mini nuclear reactor found in the fallout shelter app. Makes me real excited üòÅ
---
Pretty sure this challenge does tell you which ones are completed. I used the list to complete mine a few weeks ago.
---
Sounds a lot like Born Survivor.
---
I wish killing a players Brahmin activated PvP with the player and gave me a bounty. Killing someone's Brahmin is so unfulfilling
---
We also should be able to purchase legendary modules to able to have more choice in the items we can craft too tbh.
---
I CANNOT LIVE
---
I CANNOT DIE
---
i didn‚Äôt want to do this but, poopyhead
---
Even as a joke, it's the only hope we have left.. We actually have a *slight* chance at extinguishing the dumpster fire now that they are looking at mod support. If they finally just offload the heavy lifting to people who know what they are doing so the paid staff can concentrate on what is *really* important (pumping out the funny hats etc for the Atom Store) maybe we can finally get some bugs fixed and have a fun and stable game that doesn't feel like we are paying Bethesda for the privilege of beta testing their game for them. ACP hotfix being **tested** on the PC live server is the latest example of this.
---
I'm not talking about the programmers, this letter was written to deflate my own frustrations but through the lense of an investor or corporate chap in Zeni-Max.   
---
I'm not going to pretend they visit the site, but I figured I'd say my piece. I'm not sure you expected anything more on a reddit forum. Unfortunately I'm speaking from the consumer end, where "my opinion" 90% of anything anyone says here. You'll be hard pressed for a pie chart.
---
~~It's on the PTS, which isn't the "live" game. It'll be released on the regular PC servers the exact same time it releases on consoles.~~
---
Was wrong. See below
---
You mean private world &amp; not pts right? Its harder now on the pts due to the damage rebalance.
---
It's not bad - if you know what ammo you are holding, and what type it is (Is arrow a high powered or low powered?). If you don't know either, or both, it's kind of a pain. I've gotten to where I pop up my pip boy, take pictures of my ammo, and then go into the converter, go through each category, and use my pictures to see if I have ammo to convert.
---
If it would A)work like the first version did and only show you sell options for what you have or B)showed you current totals of what you had, it would be a lot better.
---
I don't think I have seen this one ever return. We might need someone to recreate it with lightboxes in FO4...
---
huh? Well look at that.. it wasn't there last time checked (long time ago)... so it looks like Dabney Homestead is what I'm missing..... Weird (Because I've taken that one multiple times, just not in the past year).
---
I'm actually not sure on the state of melee. I know that stacking buffs were absolutely ludicrous, to the point of people 4-5 shotting the SBQ on private servers, but I remember melee used to be known as the ez mode early last year. Then it sort of shifted to guns. Not sure if something particularly happened or people just shifted taste. But the past few months guns have definitely been the outliers because of multiple damage overflow bugs that have yet to be fixed. I'm happy they are toning down the most overpowered builds, but they could at least make sure that things do the damage they're supposed to before changing the damage they're supposed to do
---
Which makes sense, what I‚Äôm thinking is they release it on Pc first so they can see if any bugs are on it.
---
I do agree, though the intention of my letter was that resources should be put into finding this solution before other additions. Had people not spoken up about it, we'd likely have the same size stash as before!
---
Nope. PC tomorrow, consoles later this week.
---
That's fair. I retract my complaint.
---
Confused here.it was delayed again?
---
How much scrip ?
---
I dunno, I'm kind of split, because 76 has the better engine nowadays. Although the Same as fo4 and not very much optimized for multiplayer when it launched, it is good nowadays. It's gotten to the point where my modded fo4 crashes more than 76 (yes, there are some mods on ps4, and it's kinda my fault, but I don't have  any mods which alter game play too much).
---
76s map is fantastic. I love crater and the toxic valley, because it reminds me of the Californian desert from fallout 1 and 2, but more - like the name implies - toxic.
---
The forest is  everything you'd expect from a forest. Ash heap is kind of scary with its darkness, but I like it.
---
The savage divide is beautiful for taking pictures of the environment, but sometimes it's a bit annoying to traverse, but only because it can be very steep. The Mire is beautiful and foggy, like in a horror game.
---
The cranberry bog is wonderful. Superb colors and atmosphere. Only thing annoying are those trenches you often fall into, they genuinely suck.
---
The gunplay is good, creatures are challenging, but not too hard, Pvp is.... a whole topic for another day. The camp is a great idea, but still has a lot of issues, like why can't we just place it in the middle of watoga for example? Would it be really overpowered or gamebreaking? I don't think so. 
---
But on the other hand you got the lackluster story before wastelanders.
---
Many players didn't experience it before the update, but the whole map was empty and dead. Only people you'd find were other players and corpses. Without NPCs, you take the role out of role play.
---
There was no moral compass. Nothing good or bad just... you, walking through the wasteland til you left the game. 
---
There was no character development for your character. Just you. You don't now what happened in the vault, what happened to you before the great War.
---
And even when wastelanders came, it didn't fix everything. Most of it, yes. But not everything. The speech system is excellent, because they copied it from 3 and NV and it's much better than fo4. But the story is kind of confusing, well, to me at least. 
---
There's no real ending to it. You open vault 79 and get the gold. There is no consequence for doing it with either faction. There's nothing. You don't get kicked out of the raider gang, get banned from foundation... 
---
You just need to grind the reputation til you get everything. 
---
The enclave bunker is still empty. The brotherhood is coming, which is nice, but I still swore an oath to the enclave. There are also a few things that bug me with wastelanders. Like, how in God's name didn't the enclave find the communists right on the doorstep of their bunker?
---
Is there a rest of the responders. If so, where?
---
Why are there so many mutated creatures? It's been only 26 years!
---
Bethesda did so many retcons that make no sense. 
---
You don't even know what is Canon in this game and what's not, although whats not mostly comes from the atx like some of the power armor skins. 
---
TL;DR :In terms of game play, 76 is superior.
---
In terms of story, the OGs and NV still hold up.
---
What‚Äôs crazy is they know this because they did just that on the way wards quest line lol
---
The event that appears at the light house spawns a wise mothman after completion. It gives a exp boost if your commune with it.
---
Taken from the Dev Tracker online:
---
*Kill different kinds of tough enemies= This one has a problem where you have to be the one getting the last hit on these enemies for it to count. So if your doing it in a group you might not get lucky enough to complete these. These should be made so that it should count for anyone that gets a hit on it. I believe that the challenge to kill scorchbeasts also suffers from this problem*
---
If you have anything more than hearsay that it‚Äôs wrong, please can you substantiate it because it‚Äôs been on the tracker for months now with that write-up.
---
For consoles it was delayed until later in the week.
---
yes - but without the need for stimpaks.  .Anyway - with the current system it is around 250 lvls to max out ( not counting for extra perks card packs)  - not really  worth it imo
---
From what I‚Äôve been seeing on the bethesda net thing it says for console but Pc is fine it‚Äôs getting released there
---
What, like a typical reddit post?   
---
You understand that as a consumer my dollars flow to "things I like" and away from "things I don't". I'm not sure what I stated here was not factual either. I would even go as far to say that much of what I said has been said before, I decided to throw my own "corporate" spin on it out of frustration.
---
PS4? I want to make sure and stop by!
---
Yes sorry that is what I meant.
---
Contrary to the popular belief on this sub having a interest in pvp doesn't make you a griefer. There are plenty of PVE griefers, you know those guys one shotting legendaries.I see plenty of PVE complaints about all the hacked weapons and exploits on PC. If you don't wish to participate in pvp well you have pacifist mode for that. 
---
Mabey Bethesda could show the pvp community a little love n let us have a mode. Hell they could at least give us the tools to have PVP mode in our own private servers I mean we are paying for them.
---
Only public teams get the bonuses. I typically run with a group of 4 and we have to boot people all the time to make room for everybody.
---
That and when you run into the one dude who never shuts off his damn mic.  
---
Before you know it you are listening to Friends reruns in the background and then he starts talking to his kid about how he moved his base and it looks cool now, see it??  You want to go swimming now, okay!!  
---
He ended up kicking himself to take his kid to the pool but sweet Jesus, mute your mic please if you join a public team LMAO
---
It's like we're walking on clouds here huh?but no that sucks.
---
The thing that prevents SBQ from landing is people constantly asking for new features instead of bugfixes.  
---
FIN.
---
Do you even know what a game engine is and how it works? This does not require an engine rewrite. This is purely just bad coding of the game itself
---
Edit: this person does in fact know what they're talking about, a rare sight on reddit
---
Cool thanks I had no idea at all!üòÅ
---
I'd honestly be happier with it getting removed. Assassin's holds no purpose in this game. They removed the main pvp mode because they realized pvp with vats/legendaries is trash, and in nuclear winter it doesn't matter. pvp in adventure mode is about as common as a live owlet, and even if you wanted to use it on humans...why? Level 66 raiders/settlers are as flimsy as scorched, only the cultists and .50 cal/gatling laser blood eagles deal any real damage. And there are multiple effects in the game that will outdamage assassin's, but against everything instead of just one group, at essentially no cost. If they aren't going to take the time to properly balance things that have been an issue for 2 years, just get rid of it to not waste people's time. They took that route with the vault raids and it was still better than the alternative
---
Actually there's a marked public event in that very same lighthouse that allows you to meet Mothman. Keep an eye to Path to Enlightment event
---
right after I posted this comment I thought...I should go see what todays special discount is. And lo and behold...there they were. I bought them up right away.
---
That‚Äôs nice and all but that would require making 2 separate drop tables per each animal type. One being flagged when hit with fire while the other not.
---
It‚Äôs good enough as is. It would be a miracle if they implement this bug free.
---
If Minecraft has done it since 2009, I see no reason Fallout couldn't.
---
Where are you seeing this
---
I see this suggested a lot, but with the current engine, I don't think a key ring would actually fix anything. It would still have to load that entire list to see if you are eligible to open certain doors or whatever. Just like how your stash is loaded even when you're not in your camp/train station/workbench. I don't think they have a way of having it only load in when you are looking at a locked door. You would have to scroll through less keys, sure, but you would still have all the same lag. It's a band-aid to the more obvious solution, delete or let us drop duplicate keys or ones we don't need anymore
---
He can spawn as a random encounter (had him in all 4 regions). He is a pain in the ass if you arent ready for it. And the event youre talking about (upon successful completion) does in fact spawn the moth man at the bottom near the entrance of the lighthouse. Not as an enemy, but as a friend. Interacting with him after the event (again, successful completion) gives you an xp buff.
---
Because its Bethesda. They can't even make quick travel work right.
---
" There needs to be a shared inventory system akin to Borderlands or Destiny where you can place stuff in and all your characters have access to it."
---
God no, I have stuff stored on other characters and one way Bethesda would most likely make this happen is the stash box would be shared. I already have a hard enough time keeping my MAIN character underweight because I don't have first and they lied before the game came out and said junk would not have weight. Also, the other likely way they may do this is First. Why wouldn't they do this? It would make them money. IMO they are doing crap like this so people complain and then they can add it to First and be like 'Hey we fixed it for you'. 
---
Heck, everything you said, if they ever do it, would more than likely be First only.
---
Wow your 9 then
---
I know right? Sometimes people just don't bother. I once waited a few minutes for a person to come back and get their loot only to see someone else pick it up and leave. So I always take if there's something I want in there. Ofc if the person ever comes back and says they want it back I will give it, but if not it's mine, I found laying on the ground, so I have every right to this loot. it's not like I griefed anyone for it.
---
PITA.
---
Im calling bullshit on Beth as how the fuck did the SS procure a child sized black suit whilst locked underground?? Really the character we didn't need. 
---
Anyways. The attitude. She needs a quick trip off one of the ledges in the gold storage area.
---
Oh damn. My bad
---
You and the other 15 people that still PVP might actually have to learn how to play a PVP game.
---
Could you post some pics or other details? Everything I used to do with camps are now broken, or ‚Äúfixed‚Äù depending on your perspective. I‚Äôm trying to set something up just like you‚Äôre talking about but having trouble with mobs in the ground still making their way up to the other levels of the base.
---
Please don't touch assassin's armor though. People that don't pvp shouldn't be telling developers what needs to be done to balance it either. Instead of removing it, change it to all humans and buff the damage to +30-50%
---
wow ok
---
A tough draft is in progress. I have about 400 pages done, and I haven‚Äôt made it through Wastelanders yet.
---
76 is has a boring and inconsequential story that gives high levels players a grind when they complete it. The graphics are better but at night the game is horrible and there are areas where the amount of pixels and detail is worse then ps2 games. I enjoy 76 but it is never be as good as any of Beth's previous fallout games
---
I kill her solo on a daily basis that's my proof. Now it's your time,provide me a proof that anyone,even a single guy by accident ,unlocked it.
---
2.5% per.  10 to max potential.
---
Having 5 mutations isn't much of a downside.
---
i start online school thursday
---
Vault raids, first week was PC only then they opened up to the consoles. I am guessing they want a larger testing group.
---
Oh, I will definitely do all this, I just know Murphy will remove Grounded dead last.
---
Sorry kiddo, but pvp was a massive selling point for this game, so much so that half of the commercial on release showed only pvp. Cant handle that? I heard fallout 4 is really good.
---
Yeah, honestly after thinking about it. I‚Äôm just looking for a play style change. Really thinking a vampire tank looks fun. I tend to play tank in other games like diablo 3 or World of Warcraft years ago.
---
He's takin a leak.
---
A radiation leak, that is.
---
kinda like this idea, you get minced meat if you had minigun, you get soup if use plasma weapon, you get  nothing if you used Fatman xD
---
Isn't that way for any of the other ones
---
Minecraft can get base building right Bethesda can't
---
Dude I‚Äôm not trying to argue, I‚Äôm just saying that my understanding is also quite well documented as being the explanation, so if it‚Äôs wrong we should try and get it at least reported correctly first
---
This. My Junkies explosive handmade matches a 1 star bloodied handmade in damage output at 19% health with nerd rage, adrenal reaction, and full unyielding gear. If I get a bloodied explosive or bloodied FFR, I'll switch to that, but its not really that big of a difference and at least if I raise my health for something like Encryptid, I don't completely gimp myself.
---
Because Minecraft is, at its core, a building game. Fallout isn't.
---
For shittles and giggles?
---
You get all glowing meat if you use a Fatman.
---
Like 50....
---
But I have roughly 10+ weapons at all times
---
True. My hopes went up a bit higher after Juicehead's review of the Daily Ops feature. That was one feature that perked my interest a lot along with the mention of expeditions. Now if Bethesda balances builds and adds new ballistic weapons and calibers....then I'll be super-hyped
---
I cringe at every comment recommending that people carry around a .38 pipe pistol that does almost no damage to tag legendaries with, without 1-shotting them.
---
No. Nope, I shouldn't have to carry around an extraneous weapon and its useless ammo just to get around bad game design. I shouldn't have to neuter my own damage output because of the stupid restrictions on the way legendary loot is dropped. No other online game that I know of *forces you to deliberately play badly* in order to be courteous to other players.
---
It's ridiculous that the legendary loot system has been as bad as it is, for as long as this. And it's baffling that more people don't get on Bethesda's case about it, to force them to change it.
---
This! I‚Äôm a lvl 406 and I don‚Äôt mind what the level of the player is who joins me. :) But if one of my friends signs on and needs a space and I‚Äôm team lead, I unfortunately will need to boot someone. I hate doing it, but my friends come first!
---
Yes but they've been fixing the exploits ie; god mode and psychobuff health stacking. I dont know about you but I pvp every day and there has been a significant change in the last couple patches.
---
The only actual exploit left is maybe the ammo glitch and then colas (which technically isn't a exploit, its the amount people have them in is what IS an exploit) 
---
And then legacys of course are unbalanced between new pvpers and veterans, for a new player its insta death, for a veteran sometimes its very hard to die to them. If you've never owned a legacy then you haven't actually pvp'd at an end game level. They used to be much harder to get but now due to the dupe they are all over the place. I dont recommend actually spending real money but for reference; JE laser rifles used to cost about $200. They are now going for $12. 
---
Also im talking about console here, things are way way worse on PC due to hacked weapons and armor. Thats a huge hurdle.
---
Once again I'm not saying that its not broken, because it is. Its just not as broken as you're making it out to seem. Its just something you have to put alot of time into if you want to accel.
---
I will never understand how people can turn their blind side to malpractice this severe, were it an EA title it would have been dragged underground and into oblivion as one of the worst atrocities ever committed in the gaming scene.
---
Yet the Fallout title carries it's own weight without requiring the work.
---
This game is abhorrent.
---
A 60$ game released broken, unfinished, unoptimized.
---
I'm not critizising the people who enjoy the game, like I play a game that to this day bugsplats after every third or fourth online match but what bothers me is how gullible these people are towards allowing Bethesda to continue on this path of destruction.
---
This kind of consumer treatment should not be encouraged under any circumstance. 
---
And aside from the butchered lore they can't even hold homage to the revitalized changes they made starting with fallout 3.
---
It doesn't have the luxury of an early access title, this is a AAA GAME.
---
Man I live and breath the fallout world, the ogs who created the vision and drove it into the ground only to be revived by Bethesda and driven into the ground once more.
---
Fallout is a perfect curse.
---
I am glad that obsidian has gotten a Jumpstart recently, even though the outer worlds was mediocre af I'd love to see what they do with awoved.
---
They are keeping a steady pace and Bethesda should learn from them instead of continuing to do their own thing. 
---
Ghost of tsushima and the witcher 3 showed us what the next step in open world games rpg games should be, how consumers who put money under their products should be treated(free dlc for both games and a solid thank you note from the devs). 
---
This is the right path. 
---
Bethesda needs to reorganize and get their shit together, milking people out of money over a broken and downright outdated game is absolutely Ludicrous.
---
I think quantum farms will work best as they should spawn in the same place
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm so excited for, I happen to find one unyielding armor piece with the +25 poison resist and it makes a huge difference with the scorch beast fog stuff and with sting wings that always murder my main character
---
+warframe is free to play
---
What is this free space you speak of?
---
Serious answer,  I max at 390, and I usually have about 140 on me. So 250? But I'm a loot hog soo that's goes fast
---
I don't think there will be any meat left lol. glowing meat suits plasma weapons tho.
---
WhaaAAAaaAAhhAAT?
---
Guess I'll answer my own question. It's on the PTS so I guess whenever patch 22 drops.
---
God help the player who kills my chickens!!!
---
I don‚Äôt know about that, sometimes it‚Äôs the little things that you notice the most, for example, I was playing 4 a few weeks ago and I was fighting an Assaultron, I had just gotten a bead on that bitch, and then BAM! She fucking juked to the left to get out of my sights!
---
Awesome!  Being a chef irl I am excited for this event
---
Yeah, that makes more sense.
---
In the video that this post is referencing he‚Äôs playing a PA heavy guns build. I know that sometimes he plays a bloody although he‚Äôs not as good at it as TYR and captain noob.
---
my loadout weights 105 pounds and I have a total carry weight of 235
---
50 lbs
---
Yeah the best part about bloodied is uny
---
*Why is this event having so much trouble getting launched?!*
---
The community. You knuckleheads are the best part of the Wasteland.
---
I get stuck in cracks and crevasses between walls at camps all the time, I'll make sure to give this a try next time. Wiggling in place and hoping to pop out sucks
---
They have removed it from the pictures on the game board...
---
I have every single heavy weapon on me along with a couple different melee weapons. Add in a rad gun as well for getting my rads up.
---
I usally only have 40 to 50 carry weight left over. Out of the 360 I can carry.
---
Why do I carry that many guns? Why not I love shooting things with em.
---
You can contact support and they will reset part of the quest for you. Happened on 2 characters for me and they reset the quest in 24 hours. Only time support was ever helpful was that quest.
---
I wonder what would happen to society if we put capacity limits on how much money you can earn. Imagine only ever having, at most, $30,000 max in your one and only bank account. If you made any extra it would disappear into the nether. We wouldn't have entrepreneurs, new businesses or even new ideas. Everything would be bland, almost as bland as the wasteland we choose to spend our time in. We would be extremely limited in what we could do. Whew, I'm glad capacity limits only exist in games.
---
Okay man im sorry for lashing out
---
That's why i'm not even on the main fallout sub. That whole thing is just a massive new vegas circlejerk. At some point they talked more about outer worlds than fallout, the mods had to stop that from happening.
---
Huh.  That seems low.
---
Oh yeah, every time I'm in vault 79 she just can't shut up. Why can't she just take a .50BMG right between the eyes?
---
Around 200
---
When I logged off last night I was at 539/540 with 5 pieces of Unyielding WWR armor and chewing on a Grilled Radstag. Once vendor caps refresh I might be able to get all the way down to 30 or 40 pounds of open carry weight. May need to farm some more pepperoni rolls or rad ant lager to survive meat week.
---
Well it has been reported almost once a week here ,and i'm sure many other times through their support page. It's not important apparently.
---
Maybe two shots to the head, the Courier thus restarted his SPECIAL points
---
Several months back in an interview i remember them saying they aren't planning to in the near future. I am guessing that they understand that with how current damage works (multiplicatively) they would be too strong, so the damage nerf might be prep for that. It could also be something they are waiting to release until hacking and duping has reasonably been dealt with.
---
damn   i am headed in that direction.  Im a heavy user too.  I feel weird if I dont have 1 of each.
---
I always try to keep at least 100lbs or free space but really struggle. When you have a lot of free time because of furlough, it is very easy to play all day and gain a shit tonne of legendary weapons and armour that you can‚Äôt get rid of straight away lol
---
This isn't a very good question to ask because of all of the weight reduction perks, but mine is around 250, but only because I carry a lot of stuff I can't get rid of because of stash limits.
---
Not a huge ammount IIRC
---
305 and I usually carry 150ish depending on weapons I have with me.  I am a loot whore so the more space the better.
---
Wastelanders. And Steam. And a sale...
---
So, what should I do with my six copies of Science Expert? I have animated versions for 1* and 2*.
---
That‚Äôs what it was! Thanks
---
My max is 340 and I carry about 200-210 so between 130 and 140 usually free until I horde. That is with the chem backpack I could easily drop weight if I didn't carry so many stims and chems but better then storing them in stash. Most of my weapons have a reduced weight in some manner. And with bandolier I carry a boatload of ammo too.
---
Only problem with that is now that they're demanding nuclear winter level ups as daily challenges, it's be next to impossible to do it in time on a higher level overseer rank!
---
Your max weight is 540?  Thats nutz
---
It just makes you seem Naive. You know nothing of what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes, so to make statements like it‚Äôs ‚ÄúUnsustaniable‚Äù when you have no clue.  You don‚Äôt know how they are doing.  
---
I understand your dollars flow to things you like, but to make such a statement when the game has survived almost two years, did you maybe stop and think that they don‚Äôt care if your dollar stop flowing because you‚Äôre in the minority.
---
Need to pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers.
---
Make you own team, with blackjack...and hookers!
---
Red rocket mega stop has quite a few machines.  Lately I've been using inert flux instead of water.
---
Another tier of animation, holographic versions, would be a neat chaser type thing that you could trade duplicates towards.
---
Heavy is roughly the same as commando for me. I mainly use a 50 cal in power armor and a LMG if I‚Äôm running around without power armor. They play more or less like high ammo Handmades.
---
I think I‚Äôll just get a v25 50 cal and go from there
---
A lot of things aren‚Äôt unfortunately. Making money is number one and fixing free atoms actually goes against that, so it‚Äôll probably never get fixed. 
---
Did you see they changed the ‚Äúplay for 7600 hours‚Äù to now reward like 760 atoms? I worked out that you‚Äôd need to play three hours every day for 6.94 years..
---
Bear heands perk is a necessity for heavy guns. I carry ten or so on me all the time. It just doesnt work on the stash which sucks.
---
damn. I have a hard time staying under 300 lbs of my ususal stuff.  So i wear excavator all the time!
---
0...I have to eat a Pepperoni Roll, take Psychobuff, and drink Whiskey all while wielding a +1 Str Bowie Knife while wearing 5 pieces of WWR armor with maxed Traveling Pharmacy, Bandolier, Thru Hiker, and Party Boy just to fast travel...I have a hoarding problem.
---
&gt; Bethesda needs to fix this.
---
I couldn't agree more. Unfortunately, the next season still has the "Earn XP" repeatable, and they've made no changes to any of the events you mentioned. So the problem will still persist.
---
Apparently Bethesda just doesn't give a shit.
---
send a flock of killer chickens after them if a player kills another player's brahmin
---
Agreed.  Bloodied makes all other builds look bad.  If you're only looking at the +%DMG modifier, sure, Junkies can't be beat if Bloodied is fixed.  But if Mutants (as it currently stands) is +50%DMG, there is zero downside.  
---
Most mid level players use something other than Junkies or Bloodied if for no other reason than they're not common drops.  End game probably 70% of players are OP Bloodied....and it took plenty of grinding or twinking to achieve it.  The rest are Junkies.  Magic weapons are just a joke and have an overall negative impact on the playerbase.
---
If Mutants were to be scaled slightly to be on par with Junkies...it would need more downsides to be balanced.  +10% for mutation and then +6.5% for additional mutations with +50-75% of the negative Mutant traits or something.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Quite frankly the whole system was **not** well thought out and needs a full rebalance pass to create a decent meta.  Engaging endgame should not be limited to one build and doing the same activity over and over.
---
nice.  A little jelly
---
Fallout at it's core is a shooter game and it can't even get that right
---
The engine itself is absolute shit, as it always has been, and the 'refinements' they did to make it go multiplayer only changed it for the way worse.
---
50-100, after most carry weight perks, and without weight reduction armor or a backpack because I use power armor.
---
Go outside once in a while then? Or just continue to sit on redit and complain about people who are just trying to vent, that works too
---
Ward wanted it removed as its *his* deal.
---
yeah lol  my stash has like 25  3 star weapons in it.   waiting for the damn scrip to reset everynight   I just cant drop drop them.
---
So much for console players getting ACP before Meat Week to avoid having to pick and choose between the two. Wasn't the whole point of delaying Meat Week so players on all platforms wouldn't be in that situation for the first few days?
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd rather they be 100% certain their patches work and fix what's intended. I'm just disappointed that I may not get the opportunity to run ACP for a bit past launch now, because I'm absolutely choosing the limited-time event with limited-time rewards over the new featured boss event.
---
And knowing how events work in this game, one of two things will happen. It'll either be so popular that everyone runs it, running the risk of getting completely imbalanced teams who aren't prepared for the fight. OR it'll die off because all the nuke-runners got the new items and went back to farming the Queen for the rare Ultracite plans.
---
Just gonna keep my fingers crossed this all goes smoothly.
---
Wtf
---
Thats about average
---
Trying to be a ‚Äúserious player‚Äù in this game has been frustrating, in my experience. End game isn‚Äôt as robust as the game you‚Äôre coming from, and I don‚Äôt even have to know the game you‚Äôre coming from to bet this is true. Plus bugs. Plus hacked items....
---
To me this game REALLY shines when you make your own goals. For instance, I role play as a ghost hunter and curator of a haunted museum. God roll items for me are spooky treasures and the loot people drop me when they see my sweet museum. 
---
Make your own fun and the Fallout world will open for you.
---
AA isn't a damage buff, so it's not getting nerfed. Neither are quad or vampires.
---
They already duped legendary modules.  That ship fucking sailed months ago
---
Actually I was totally wrong, apparently to they are releasing at PC first. They actually used to do this long ago for the first few updates of the game.
---
My opinion is that mutants should be about 30-40% max dmg boost. It could be more but would have to require a lot of mutations so that the mutations began to actually interfere with the benefits.
---
Yeah I wonder who will still play this in 7 years. Aren't they gonna make a new game? 
---
Will the first guy be awarded with  a bronze statue at bethesda hq?
---
I was on my toon that has a lot of caps, so I do shopping mainly on that character. I came to someone's camp, I noticed they were pretty low lvl (below 30 or so) and my toon is just 16. So I decided to help out and see what they have in stock. Saw some junk and chems I might use that were pretty cheap, so I bought them all. I then walked to my camp because we were neighbors and I checked for a random encounter that spawns there. That person chased me down all the way to the next location to drop something for me. They looked so cute, green player in dirty fatigues and army helmet, dirty face with beard and glasses. And they still offered me something, but I couldn't take it, my main character has it all and I just felt bad. I didn't have anything with me I could give, sadly. It just made my day that some people don't have much and they still are willing to share.
---
Try server hoping?
---
this
---
the boring way, killing mutants rebooting, etc etc
---
150
---
Fallout shelter really shouldn‚Äôt have any limitation when it comes to space based on what the developers have said.
---
Fingers crossed!
---
See but apparently this fanbase is filled with people who're racists and love shit sandwiches.
---
both. the apparel is bloody chef outfit, bloody chef hat, grillmaster hat, and new this year a cow outfit. exclusive weapons are meat cleaver, red firework, and the tenderizer. plans are tenderizer salty, peppered, and spicy mods, meat cleaver, meat flag, those two recipies, and new this year plans for tenderizer and a cow grill camp item. maybe theres some other stuff i forgot.
---
Yeah i understand noticing whats missing from 76 because its small things like you describe when compared to fo4 that make combat feel better in the latter, I was just arguing that Bethesda sets a pretty low bar with combat in their 2 largest franchises and for that reason fo76 combat feels "par for the course" in that it meets the very very low expectations i have of combat in this franchise. I picked this game up on a drunken impulse and yet I'm thoroughly enjoying getting lost in the Bethesda exploration formula. However only 40 hours in I can tell that the devs struggle to successfully implement anything that isnt the traditional explore, shoot, loot, repeat of the series past and even then i think its safe to say of those elements, both the shoot and the loot are sloppy and clunky in execution.
---
Free carry space? Around 250, thanks to f1st. I just plant my tent where I need it, either to get an additional gun/ammo or to stash junk.
---
Meat week best week.
---
True.   Could/would it help to use a scrap kit asap?   Alternatively, just don't look at it as a place to get loot?   Be there for the XP, legendaries, and candy.  FWIW, I don't think it's funny when people act like this.
---
I think he resets at 8pm EST on Mondays.  I've also heard it's best not to even enter Wayward that day until after the reset.
---
I don't have problems going the day after reset, but I've heard if you wait too long it doesn't work.....
---
This is the possibility that surprises me the most today. I seem to see the complicated circuit design behind it. I study literature and I don‚Äôt know anything about it.
---
lol, same as me 390&gt;140.  I could get it lower if I get rid of everything in Aid, but no need.  It's why I always carry pepperoni rolls &amp; Ant Lager (grilled stag will do as well).
---
Hopefully with the nerf to damage, surviving will actually be a challenge
---
I run with about a 100. Carry around 440, max around 560.
---
Unfortunately, no.
---
This is a terminal entry in Vault 76 explaining that everyone needed to be out within 24h...or else:
---
"Mandatory Shut Down
---
Our studies have shown even after a relatively short duration of living with the amenities of Vault-Tec that test subjects can grow to depend on them. That will not do for Vault 76.
---
After the All-Clear Message is received, Vault 76 will shutdown all functions inside of 24 hours. Air circulation will cease last, and you should warn the Vault Residents that staying inside the Vault can be lethal after this period.
---
Everyone must leave the nest. It's imperative that all residents are focused on the important job of rebuilding America."
---
Now I could just pretend I never saw this...but then we're back to the mental gymnastics.
---
And of course we all have Pip-Boys on our arms that tell us the date.  They used to read 2102 and now show 2103.  Course they also show the same date, unchanging, despite the sun visibly rising and setting...
---
So there's that...
---
\-25lbs
---
About 100 after I've sorted out my inventory a bit (it steadily gets lower until I remember to check how much purified water/ore/gunpowder/canned meat stew I'm carrying and stash or sell some of it).
---
How so high max?
---
ha
---
That challenge, as well as the one where you have to kill 8 creatures in the pure PVP mode, were poorly designed considering the circumstances surrounding them and should be either removed or at least modified.
---
Even things like forcing people to hack terminals and lock picks means that some people have to change their perk loadouts just for a chance to find a computer/lock that hasn‚Äôt been unlocked yet, in a mode where PVP is at the core.
---
I think the forest area might just be bugged? my first few camps where there when I started off and I had to change servers a lot for my camp to be placed. sometimes when I stayed I just saw that area empty. I stopped having this issue ever since I moved my camp to other regions. Now I have one in toxic valley on a lead deposit not far from Crater and I almost never have to change a server because my camp can't be placed even tho it's sorta a popular spot. so many questions so few answers.
---
nice  thats probably the highest free space ive seen
---
Bear arms is both a blessing and a curse. I carry about 35 heavy guns.
---
50 freshly after cleaning out my inventory, typically 10 to 20. I have a hoarding problem. Having a weapon for every ammo type and a literal ton of chems and stimpacks may be the problem. It's funny because I don't use many chems, and I'm too lazy to sell them. My carry weight itself goes up to almost 400.
---
yes i realized gunpower can sneak up on you
---
Somewhat related, but give us giant killer river fish as well. 
---
And deeper lakes.
---
I have to use food / alcohol / excavator's PA to fast travel
---
5lbs maybe? I pick up a ton of junk.
---
OMG yes, I have so many extra cards
---
it aint that deep fam
---
lol i think you have a problem letting go
---
i heard the new meta is berserkers Sadhu where you just drop all other loot you aquire other than a berserkers shepherd's crook and tattered rags
---
really? 3k hours? rookie? with a vampire 10ads 90rw fixer? a junkie 10ads 90rw handmade? 50k 556 and 50k 45? a fss90rw shiskebab for healing others? really rookie? 
---
m8, my numbers are good :)
---
Upvotes for you!
---
no fallout 1st huh?
---
I carry my handy pocket tent and make sure there's atleast 250 available in there. Once I dump junk, worst case is a temp fill my stash till I can sell or scrap the stuff.
---
Hacking/lock picking just one thing I was fine with, but asking for 3 or more is a little unreasonable as it took so many attempts to get that many.
---
Additionally I couldn't get the revive 3 players done as I couldn't get a single player to talk to me in that mode to coordinate it!
---
Still have that issue. Same with fog crawlers. Same with Beckley, same with Abandoned big town. Nothing is fixed for me, they claimed they gave everyone missing atoms, never got them. they said if you don't submit a ticket, so I did and never got a response. so I just gave up, can stick their fucking atoms up their ass, I bet there's a lot of room.
---
Nice. I haven‚Äôt had this for a while. But it still rears it‚Äôs head every so often.
---
Agree.  Communuty is fantastic.
---
Idk - there have been cases of people being shot 20+ times and they survived in real life. Hell, a guy in Toronto was shot 30 times with 30 exit wounds and survived. Humans are no joke.
---
The game is designed to get vulnerable people to pay more money. It's a GaaS model. That's just how they are.
---
You need to build specific items.  5 stash boxes, 20 lights, stairs, etc.  it‚Äôs not max out a workshop 5 times.  There are sub objectives (on PS4 at least) that you see if you have the challenge highlighted
---
nah it‚Äôs my bad i called you an asshole
---
Glad to help!
---
You do realize there is a specific list attached to that challenge, right? Like 5 doors or stairs, 20 lights or power connectors? You have to look at the challenge to see what items you need to do.
---
Saying the game has survived thus far is missing the point about being "sustainable" why why I called it such.   
---
The entire point of my post was about what I perceive about MY spending habits and how they are running against the limitations of the game, e.g., I can't spend more on camp items because my camp budget is running low.  
---
I make no claim that I'm the FIRST one to list most of these items, and, in fact, I'd like to freely point out they have been made before. My points stand on the shoulders of others that have made similar complaints. I am not being naive, in fact, if you read closer you'll see that I'm pointing out where the game is starting to bottleneck in regard to the status quo.  
---
While I'll also admit I don't know if these are being addressed, I'm merely pointing out that there does not seem to be any action to addressing these previously criticized problems. I'm merely voicing my personal frustration, and, as an English Major and former retail worker (lol), decided to make my points from a different angle. No, not the devs, the desk jockeys and bean counters. If the point of view didn't suit you, I'm sorry I didn't make it engaging enough.   
---
I'm usually at around 165 out of 400+ with food buffs running, but I'm also running weight reduction perks that work with my build.
---
Boo. I have to work on Thursday all day.
---
the solution here, is nuclear revenge, always is
---
My armor is under work (unmodded atm), but my carrying is usually 20, with a 240 limit. So I have about 220 room most of the time.
---
The fucking train because you have to glitch if you want the power to go through the ceiling w/o it looking like 5 yo did the contruction.
---
Oof. Gotta read the sub-objectives.
---
Oh god, not math again.  I‚Äôm pretty sure we learned that this subreddit does not handle math well after SCORE was introduced
---
he wasn't calling you a rookie, just saying 235 is a low/rookie number.  It is, it means you aren't using large backpacks + Carry mods.
---
About right for a vending machine purchase.
---
poops &amp; chicken coops
---
400 because of Unyielding and no other carry increase perks.
---
I'm just saying it's a system that works. Obviously there's a ton of other changes that could help the replayability of 76.
---
I got mine earlier today just after 12:00 est so I don't think 8pm is correct.
---
I have used track maybe once or twice and have only had a couple daily autocompletes ever.
---
Maybe marsupial plus stranger in numbers
---
I recently solo'd the queen, (recently like 2 weeks ago) to test a new build. Did not finish the challenge for killing the SBQ. Still bugged as of sometime in patch 21 for me.
---
Seems like today was a bad day for everyone because it‚Äôs the first day I experienced it. Kinda annoyed because I‚Äôve been grinding hard to make sure I reach the end and missing a day and all the points really sucks
---
How's nuclear winter treating you?
---
This game is a steaming pile of shit. They've been riding on us being stans and it worked.
---
Possibly, though it's not entirely clear exactly when they began this practice and how strong of a hold it had on them in 2103.  We know they weren't thrilled about atomic weapons but that might not extend to a weather control device, especially if they thought it could be used selectively/nondestructively.
---
Bought it off guy personally he had in inventory lol i was buying a vamp explode galin gun but sold it on me
---
Sounds fantastic on paper.  But I feel then I can't make the Prepared Foods with the key meats tbh.
---
[Fed 76](https://fed76.info/pricing/) 
---
[Rogue Trader](https://roguetrader.com/#/market/estimate)
---
That's wonderful to hear.
---
Did you try turning it off and on again
---
Clever
---
Pretty sure that challenge is just a way for people to track how many hours they've played?
---
Max strength, full unyielding, every piece has some weight reduction effect mainly weapon/food, drink and chems. Also run strong back, cant remember what level. Main weapon is knuckles that include +1 strength, oh and radicool perk card. Also stop by Flatwoods a lot to keep a stock of brahmin meat. I think this is all of it.
---
Bruv, relax. Its a meme. And yes your CARRY numbers are low. With no armor I have a carry of 310.
---
Bloodied will still be the best and majority of players don't care much about the damage that comes with it, they use bloodied because of Unyielding Armor. Those extra stat boosts are way to good to give up.
---
\*3 years later Bethesda announces text chat\*
---
The nerf effects high damage builds more than lower damage.  It's not equal.
---
I am usually max carry weight of 335 and I am usually trying to empty out to get down to 160-170 before going out, so about 160-170 free.
---
Hold on...  a War Glaive?!
---
//Melee Build drooling
---
Why are we like this? We need to get help. Im putting together a support group. BAA, bear arms anonymous.
---
Ahhh first time I‚Äôve looked into this perk, would make a lot of sense if that is it! Thanks!
---
More than what i would pay but 6k is easy enough to replace. 
---
If you are a heavy junky build with nothing better it's a perfectly acceptable starter gun till you get something better.
---
I just have a soft spot for noobies and he looked so cute, like a tired soldier and still ready to give something to a stranger lady.
---
Does it shoot green blobs of death at a rapid rate doing 50% extra damage when addicted to 5 things and make you move faster while aiming and hit 33% more in vats? if so you did not get ripped off, over pay maybe
---
RIght, it‚Äôs YOUR perception based on YOUR spending habits, but you posted it like you knew about EVERYONES spending habits.  Like you had insight into the suitability of the game based solely on YOUR spending habits.  
---
Your attempt at being witty by trying to use corporate speak just came across as being self centered like YOUR issues are the core issues with the game.  And yes, other people have made complaints, we still have people bitching about PVP in PVP zones, Just because people have complaints or gripes about some things make them so.
---
The real question is why can't they fix these particular minor bugs?  Is there a programmer who might know why something like tagging a kill on a specific monster or visiting a part of the map won't trigge like the other parts of the quest?  And why they can't copy\paste the correct coding from one part to the other?  It seems simple.  Edumacate me?
---
Get out of your power armor
---
Pressing 'Esc' can get you out. And don't use the converter with power armor, because it's bugged.
---
&gt;!It worse in the PTS.!&lt;
---
Hmmmm - anything tender?
---
Not absolute values, by any means...but at least an indication of price ballpark.
---
As far as the overcumbrance problem, don't forget that you can 'scap' your junk at any workstation. This will break the junk down only to the useful components and reduce the weight of it.
---
Also, once you get a camp going, build yourself a stash box. This will allow you to store up to 800 pounds of weight. It is usually a good idea to always stash your junk when you can since you drop the junk that you are carrying when you die. Someone else could easily pick them up. The junk that you stash is protected from this.
---
The only other supermutant I've seen not to hurt anyone is a LVL 1 wounded supermutant close to the Giant Kettle, who was only there to warn you about the Sheepsquatch, you then find his kin all dead with mysterious quills and he keeps yelling about deathly sheep.  I think it was a random encounter. I didn't kill him, It was interesting, he talking about the attack he survived.
---
Just still use your same weapon.
---
Maybe that's why
---
Well just because it already happened doesn't justify opening the floodgates to allow it to happen on a much grander scale if that makes sense.
---
ANY rug.
---
Thank u for site i will use from now on.
---
I hear the responder firebreather outfit and the Nuka Girl outfit cover up the jetpack.
---
I recently returned to game and I wanted to start all fresh so I removed character with 25k caps and 3 scout masks
---
Right on lol
---
I didn't get the game till like...  mid-July last year.  It has its flaws but I find it really fun.
---
I can read you if you like ?
---
If you're on console, select which challenge (weekly/daily/etc.),  Then highlight the specific challenge.  Some of them, as others have noted, have specific goals. Those are listed to the right of the challenge if you highlight it.  
---
If you're on pc, just click the challenge in question.
---
It will show you your completion.
---
Neat but, Death to the Brotherhood.
---
Same happened to me. I was about to be frustrated completely and ctrl+alt+del because I couldn't even open the menu.. but miraculously in 2 mins I just respawned after even was over. maybe theres like a separate countdown or something. I'd advise next time to wait a few minutes, maybe you'll be lucky. But that indeed needs to be fixed, along with many other game breaking things..
---
It's been said before, but it's worth upvoting every time.
---
what does that mean?
---
I never bought it at launch, i heard how awful it was so i didn't give it a shot. Jump ahead 6ish months; my gf's dad was playing the game everytime i went to their house. He'd been playing since launch and swore by the game. So i easily found a copy dirt cheap at gamestop, and started playing. I loved how it was. Eventually i grew tired around lvl 40. Then ultimately with the reveal of wastelanders, i started to grind my life away. I love this game and its community
---
Edit: I've learned that whenever everyone hates something, i tend to enjoy it.
---
I love this one and deeply regret not getting it when it came out. I've not ever seen it since.
---
"Well that's like, YOUR opinion, man."  
---
Groundbreaking, truly. Are you done yet?

Man I hope this blows up, very well put and thought out. I feel the exact same way about the game, I always wanted it to be good so damn bad (I was even suckered into prepredreing tricentennial edition) and I keep making my self play it every once in a while but even then I log on and I feel like I have a list of chores to do instead of actually playing the game. It sucks because fallout is hands down my favorite game franchise, I love the world and the lore so much it breaks my heart to see it in it's current form.
---
You know, my characters are wearing the red dress and all I see is the backpack (no jet pack). I thought that this was just a visual glitch on my end but maybe it makes the jetpack invisible like the other two outfits do. I don't know.
---
So...an in-game version of Tequila shots?
---
When I see posts like this I just autoscroll down to the top comments to see whether or not the post is a pile of crap or not.  If it is, I just move on and don't bother reading.  Just like i'll be doing with this one!
---
fair enough :)
---
it‚Äôs just that I dont need carry weight. Only risk of death for me is during encrypted. (and a have a full set of troubleshooters solar armor in my stash; just in case). and I only use a light chest piece. no other armor. I do scorched earth naked, no armor, no undermor. nada. and I dont die. why would I worry about carry weight? there is no such thing as rookie numbers. my DR is 200 and my ER is 300. are those rookie numbers, right? but I dont die. I have all mods for backpacks but I carry only an armored one, and most of the time it‚Äôs not even equipped.
---
It's OK, you can love shit.
---
Ah I only lasted a minute before exiting
---
Real talk- hacker and lockpick.
---
These are what make runs take no time at all. The turrets can be made to cut down the trash packs haunting the hallways and the entire cool down can be bypassed.
---
Incidentally I made 15x SS rolls last night and landed the ultimate silo set- troubleshooters with stealth pieces, lockpicking aid, perception and a couple AP refreshes. I'll barely take a scratch in there now.
---
Nah, probably just wanted someone else like a friend. I am lvl 170 and I joined a public team of relatively the same levels range that was doing the same event that I started.. and got kicked immediately. I understand there probably someone else to join but it's just annoying, like why you make a public team then..
---
The Contemporary Bundle tbh.  I had the Atoms and I wasn't aware it eas leaving the Shop.  Those Wallpapers/Flooring were pretty.
---
Ah, another person who wants nothing to but a circle jerk of everyone agreeing with them, and heaven forbid people point out flaws in their logic, it‚Äôs a circle jerk god damnit.
---
You also cant sprint. Super fun.
---
now THIS is worth donating copper too, not those lazy ass BoS
---
I waited a couple, well I was raging for a couple of minutes actually xD but right before my fingers stretched to the magic buttons I respawned lol
---
It is not even the developers - it is the management.  That being said, the build process doesn't even use modern source control or other modern practices.  The game engine is outdated.  All of this is due to management that stopped developing in early to mid 2000s and thinks the ways things were done back then is still acceptable in the year 2000.  It is complete negligence at the top regarding the dev practices.
---
That's what I was doing to get around to complete the ID stuff
---
Perk loadouts are already coming, and so is instanced Camps... so 2 of the things your complaining about have been in the works for a while and coming out this year.  and the 3rd can be rectified with 1st... so it seems like you are venting just to vent  with no real substance.. that's ok to do, but be prepared for the blowback.
---
The number can get crazy high with low health, high rads, Radicool, 5 pieces of Uny +1 STR armor, marsupial, high capacity backpack, pepperoni roll + carnivore.
---
Can‚Äôt fond the locked door to bypass
---
Vault 79 wall breach glitch. If you don‚Äôt mind using glitches. Its always a 3 star legendary sentry bot. Just look it up on YouTube. And everyone against glitches go ahead and downvote me. If people can dupe weapons and carry around inventories full of duped weapons then i can use a wall breach glitch to farm legendaries. This game has no rules.
---
The discover locations challenge is **still** broken - my characters have found all the locations in the Ash Heap but Beckley stills remains undiscovered for the challenge.
---
Same for my wife, and she also has the Bog challenge bugged with Abandoned Bog Town refusing to count
---
But totally agree with you on the tough enemies challenge - how hard can it be to fix that
---
Lol yeah I was pretty raged too, the fact nobody joined had me fired up as it is and that was just the icing on the cake
---
I finally got it to work. I had to server hop like three times to get it to work. I was about ready to give up. lol
---
His just trolling you!
---
I dont think you want that, considering how broken the game is, it would fuck up  e v e r y t h i n g
---
I hit rank 93 a week ago and that was from logging in everyday and grinding to the point of reaching insanity. No levels bought. I actually had the last week off because... just buggered from the grind, except for Saturday just gone where I logged on for another grind sesh and reached 98. Getting on today to smash it out but it's been hell. It'll be nice to kick back and just play for fun doing what I want after this is finished. Until the next run....
---
Do you have any idea what you're talking about? I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but changing the engine won't magically fix all the issues. The problem isn't the tools, but the people using them
---
Definitely explains the weight limit. I couldnt do it if I tried. Im a hoarder with a scrap box. I walk away from uranium fever near 800 pounds to the bench and near 310 out the door. I need all i get. You like it, thats fine, but the numbers are low for anyone trying to get steel, plastic, and random junk during walk abouts.
---
We know more about this game than you or your trash build would know of
---
It is crazy we have to go to such extremes to get things to work in this game.
---
Don't feel bad, all the hours of gameplay added to your personal knowledge and experience.
---
I'd be mad as a console player too.  Maybe they just need to keep their mouths shut about what their future plans are for the game (in regards to exact dates) and just playtest them in PTS until they're SURE they're good to go.  But I mean, that requires logic, something their team doesn't seem to have too much of.
---
All you guys seem to know is beam splitter 50 cal goes brrr.
---
Very cool man. Great work.
---
I start fresh quite a bit! There‚Äôs something about that first step out of the vault that has always caught my attention in Fallout games. Not stupid at all.
---
Im not gonna discuss how consistent is realism in game full of super mutants and locked up ghouls in the fridges.
---
That‚Äôs a good weapon to have anyway for your build, and you‚Äôll definitely want it for the Daily Ops. Don‚Äôt stress too much or dump your good stuff. I‚Äôve been playing the PTS a lot the last few days, the nerf is noticeable for high damage builds, but it‚Äôs far from the apocalyptic event people are saying it is.
---
Update, went through the whole thing last night up to missile prep. Left went back to my camp thinking since I left the silo the game would remember my progress. Nope had to start all over to today. Got to missile prep,first robot I have to defend get stuck at the door. won‚Äôt move, stands there for like 5 mins then the server crashes. Oh Bethesda how you hate making your games seem like not a chore. Here I go again

I read somewhere that it is recommended to get the perk cards 'good with salt' under luck. That way it slows down the spoilage rate of meat in your inventory.
---
I use, Marsupial, BirdBones, Strange in numbers (means you need Team), + rapid AP regen perks.   I can essentially fly over a city. Also, Cola-Girl outfit really hides the big jetpack, which is why I used it for so long. Now, I wear the Capt Cosmos over my SS Jetpack:)
---
I had forgotten Scribe Takano so did some research on her.  She was a formidable lady:
---
"Before the War, Hailey Takano was a prominent scientist and a prolific writer publishing for the Tesla Science Magazine, focusing on cutting edge research and theories. She survived the Great War in California, and apparently through pure luck, found Roger Maxson and his deserters heading towards Lost Hills. Her scientific background proved invaluable to the fledgling order."
---
Unfortunately, her plan, such as it was, was somewhat speculative.
---
"...she helped develop a sonic generator that would attract the scorchbeasts and allow the Brotherhood to cull their numbers, though everyone was aware that this solution was unsustainable in the long run. Takano and her team focused on finding a long-term solution and provided Grant with an automated research program to use at Vault-Tec University locally, so that Appalachia could continue research on finding a weakness in the scorchbeasts, even if the West Coast went dark."
---
We know the sonic generator worked, sort of, but there were just too many of the things.  The plan to analyze their DNA was a good idea but a) VTU was in Responder territory and the BOS teams had to be small to get in undetected and as such were promptly eaten by ghouls , b) even when we get there we find the device has some power issues and c) there is no guarantee that they HAVE an exploitable weakness for the program to find.
---
But I suppose it doesn't matter as the problem was presumably resolved by nuking the prime fissure site and killing the Queen, along with a viable vaccine for the plaque.
---
Wonder how the BOS will react to discovering that Elder Maxim's decision to NOT use nukes resulted in the deaths of the entire human population of West Virginia?
---
I was sad to see that we won't be meeting Scribe Takano though:
---
"After the Lost Hills Brotherhood lost contact with Appalachia, Takano took on the responsibility of tutoring Odessa Valdez. By 2103, while initially due to join in the Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force, declining health and other concerns made her ineligible, and Scribe Odessa Valdez volunteered in her place."
---
I always had history of doing this with online games  but with this one its really different, since you litt√©rale start over with everything except challenges.
---
This sub seems to want a lot of participation trophies
---
You have contributed nothing of substance thus far. Your contention has been: "You don't know what you're talking about, and stink of pomp." Look, I can't take that seriously. My opinion is obviously going to be that mine is correct.  
---
Secondly, my post is ratioed into the ground. At this point you could take solace in the fact that the community, at this point, seems to have taken your side regardless. But if you want to specifically address points in my post feel free, at least we can have a discussion.
---
r/impoor
---
If you got stuck repairing pipes then you definitely weren't doing it. That whole reactor sequence is avoided by a lockpick check then a hacker check.
---
I wish i was Xbox as I'd teach you it and you'd be running these in no time at all.
---
I don't know if this is helpful in your case, but I also had a problem with triggering the location challenges. Now, I have completed them.
---
I solved it by creating new characters, and having them go to the locations. Sometimes, locations that haven't been cleared will be cleared if you go there with a new character.
---
Some of the locations will not trigger on the first try, so I had to continously create new characters and visit the locations until they finally triggered and were checked off in the challenge list.
---
I don't know if it would work in your game, but it was how it was in my case.
---
Yeah but it should be an option on any weapon, it would still be a grind to get the legendary you want but at least the weapon is guaranteed.
---
It's available only through Bethesda launcher (search for fallout 76 PTS or smth like this, it's like separate game)
---
Not sure if you will have access if game wasn't purchased through bethesda
---
It's especially useless when they removed many places with super mutants like logging camp where free radicals reside and many other places.
---
Yea im used to do this with online game a lot, but its really punitive int fo76
---
Yeah tried that with all my mules - no luck
---
But thanks for the suggestion any way
---
O you're on PC that explains your low intelligence
---
You need to download it from the Bethesda launcher, I believe it's under game options. Not 100% on this though.
---
Only 2 and 3.
---
What I've just read is such bullshit, I'm just gonna say I disagree.

Colossal Problem is PC only tomorrow?!

I carry 2 super sledges (instigating and furious). My instigating combat shotgun. And a two shot gatling gun.

Not to mention how annoying her voice is. every time I approach that damn church near Charleston an she starts speaking I just remove my headset until she's done.. not to mention that's the shittiest event/daily.
---
yeap. I get it... I have 30k steel, 5k plastic, 3k screws, and so on... and 400 improved repair kits. my base is ready since last year, there is no modding or building, I just roam. and gather drugs for sale. ~30 pounds of drugs gets me the 1400 daily with ease. I only carry to scrip 3* weapons under 10 pounds and I still have several 3* weapons under 1 pound on my stash to scrip later. and in my vending machine I only sell ballistic ammo, uncommon and rare plans and uncommon outfits. all this is lightweight and very profitable
---
almost zero maintenance, with high profits :)
---
It's only live in the PTS but if you type nerf into the search bar and sort by newest I'm sure you'll find a lot of posts about it. There have been several in-depth posts on it over the past few days I think!
---
Respec'ing is not the same as perk loadouts. Also, I'll grant you that instanced camps will alleviate the issue but neither of us know any of the specifics about them beyond existing. So we'll put a pin in that.
---
You're welcome. But I would like to make the theory that you would have to try repeatedly with fully newly created characters, and that pre-established characters might not work; when I tried the first time, only a part of the locations I tried to trigger would trigger when I visited them with my new character. After that, I created a 2nd new character, which triggered some of the ones left, but not all of them. Then a 3rd character, etc. until it was done.
---
Feel that. Maybe they‚Äôll put one up in the Atom Shop.
---
Bethesda: "New Fallout 1st feature: mailboxes. Mail items between your characters to easily and safely* share items, materials, and money. Speaking of money, give us more money! We put some fancy mailbox skins on the atom shop!

---
Meanest bastard in the entire game and for absolutely no reason. hate that prick.
---
one of the best Hiter react videos i have ever seen- really well made
---
76 has a real sense of danger and unpredictability in its early stages.
---
They have alluded to respecing to be part of loadouts. But they have not disclosed how all of it will work. So NOBODY knows 100%.
---
It's almost as if, and bear with me here, they have to pay their developers cranking out new content as well as covering server fees.
---
Huh. Alright! My fault on that one, I've never seen the score challenges have sub-objectives like the regular challenges. I'm not on PS4, I'm on PC, but I've seen the sub-objectives before so, shouldn't be impossible to find again. 
---
I also hadn't thought that it was just "max out a camp or workshop", I thought it was "build x value of workshop budget", which was why I tried maxing out workshops, since it let me track how much budget I used. I also tried varying what I built, generators, conduits, turrets, decorations, floors and walls, defenses. Somehow I must not've hit the right combo. Oh well, I know now. 
---
Again, thank you, I'm glad to know I won't miss a thousand score for not realizing "build up a camp" meant "build these specific things that you aren't told about on the outset".
---
This game needs dedicated servers.
---
Sounds about right
---
Or make it effect human characters including NPCs and players.
---
We're probably in the minority here, but I'm an old school MMO PvP person, and not being able to kill people makes me sad inside. I might have problems.
---
To be fair to OP, it took me far too long trying to complete the atom challenge "Take Pictures in the forest region" back in the day.
---
...didn't even think about sub-objectives until I was about to send in a ticket and wanted to double-check the wording of the challenge before I submitted...LOL
---
Xbo1 sorry - I converted to Xbox for this game , which my friends don‚Äôt play. Should have stayed with Sony
---
Formulas for dmg buff calculations are changing (still there is no confirmation how it will be after official release)
---
It affects all perks/mutations/all dmg buffs.
---
AFAIK melees are most 'nerfed', might be a bug.
---
No time for panic until final release.
---
Still playable, still killable, just will take some more time and or ammo.
---
Bloodied/junkies still meta.
---
Gotta get that ribeye. Just rebuild- whats needed? razergrain  and fertilizer? Takes up a lot of your camp budget  ya know....  But yeah there should be a bounty just like picking locks or destroying anything else in camp.
---
Source?
---
Don‚Äôt ever feel bad for wasting hours, Im level 366 (heavy) on my main, have a level 115 (bloodied) &amp; a level 33 (archer) and I have over 1000+ hours, I love exploring and just taking my time never have I just purely gone out and levelled for a day!
---
The scaver paint for the handmade.
---
Also really want the Battle Coat, but I've come to terms with the fact that that one probably won't come back.
---
To be fair they've had a lot of the same issues since oblivion I think there are u derlying issues that a new engine could help with, a more streamlined experience for a start
---
No, you‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs not super intuitive at all. I feel bad that OP wasted all those resources. I wish he had asked us way sooner!!
---
Lol any content in this game gets delayed. It‚Äôs gonna still release broken and buggy like fashnacht did
---
That is at least somewhat explainable. But how the hell do mike rats literally teleport? The Institute hasn‚Äôt made its molecular relay system yet, and as a result they can‚Äôt have eaten Courser chips.
---
Damn i was hoping we would get 2 free days before meat week now im gonna have to decide whether to do meat week or colossal problem hopefully they decide next week because i was planning on doing meat week

Beth Austin doesn‚Äôt work on 76 alone. Bethesda Maryland had to step in to clean up the shitshow that was this games launch

---
[Don't Kill My Cow video](https://youtu.be/9ZcpqYDf8WY)
---
I have sympathy for you. 
---
Let me share this: that objective requires you to build certain things. 
---
I made a blueprint that completes 4/5 and it uses nothing but the workshop‚Äôs scrap materials (in green). Then I just have to plant crops or build water sources. 
---
1x1 shack with doors in each wall and a short stairwell at one of them. One decoration on each interior corner and one on an outside wall. A small generator on top with three Construction Lights (along with four turrets; not needed for the challenge but useful for the defense event) and two lightbulbs inside.  Stack five footlockers in a corner.  
---
All that‚Äôs left for that Weekly is the x10 Crops or Water Sources. I‚Äôm still working on a way to get Water Pumps as part of the blueprint, but planting 10 crops is easy enough so I probably won‚Äôt worry about it.
---
No need to use thousands of your personal scrap, friend. This is a free option that lets me finish that weekly in about 30 seconds, after I‚Äôve claimed a workshop.
---
Live and learn fellow Wastelander. We are here for ya!
---
I've tried doing that a couple of times. Sadly, no hookers joined :(
---
Ah yes everybody knows the real FPS gamers are on console. Keep waiting for us to deliver your datamines peasant.
---
I choked on my drink laughing, you swarthy bastard! But I can think of a couple better ways to go that they probably didn't model in the game.
---
Oh I love that. Been doing that since beta. Lock it up I‚Äôll just craft something and sneak in hahahahahahahaha
---
I'm not going to dig through all the months of news &amp; dev conferences.  You will have to go find them yourself.  I read and follow daily, so impossible.
---
That being said, Right now as it stands Respec'ing and Perks are already really integrated and part of the same interface. So it makes complete sense to have both in the new version.
---
Lol half the stuff you turds "datamined" doesn't even see the light of day keep thinking you mean something because you never will

Were you trying to equate the government printing more money with capitalism?

Ahem. Get off the high horse and comprehend. You said the engine doesn't need a rewrite. About which I said that its shit. Never said it'd fix any issues on FO76 (as the code is shit aswell), but objectively if you have a trash engine you should rewrite it, no? And the problem you see is that the tool itself is very much a big issue. Every recent Bethesda game has been a huge mess (with extremely ridiculous signs of devs having to circumvent the handicapped engine) even despite senior devs. And of course in this case you have junior devs on board to do the coding, this is what you get. 76 is shit on both sides but for some reason you seem to deny the simple fact as long as they've got a useless engine, they're trying to build a castle from manure. They'll never succeed, that is why you get 3 new game issues for every bug fixed. So revamping their engine first and foremost would be the best decision on their side.
---
Ok cheers, nil point doing it again
---
I feel stupid at level 450 having opened up so many unneeded perk packs just because I got tired of getting the alert about them every time I opened the perk menu.  I didn't get wise until about 100 levels ago.  Thank goodness Angry Turtle said "Hey guys.. stop opening those perk packs, you'll need them for legendary perks."  So thankfully it could be worse.
---
I know because it has multiple factors that make it the most op build which aren‚Äôt going to stack the same way. I‚Äôm just saying that it‚Äôs not as bad as everyone is making it out to be, we‚Äôll still be able to kill everything just fine even if it takes a couple more rounds
---
I found him 2 times in days, weeks even, of trying and he never had the outfit we all are hunting him for. I'm pretty disappointed and just gave up. But if you ever wanna try again my IGN is Dark_Wolfy.
---
Why are you entitled to see inside someone else's CAMP?  There's plenty of unlocked CAMPs around the Wasteland, why waste any energy complaining about the ones you can't see inside?
---
For as  long as Bethesda makes it not a crime, I will kill every single Brahmin in a camp I see.
---
I got tired of it happening to me, so it's my only way of protesting. A random post on reddit won't get their attention, but if everyone gets sick of it and complains there's a -small- chance they will notice.
---
Until then, I am not the hero Fallout 76 wants, but the one it needs.
---
I am coming for your Brahmin, you can't save them. They will not escape.
---
How does everyone has so much space? Is everyone paying for the cash grab Fallout 1st?
---
Ikr so stupid
---
That's a pretty good idea, but mutation should have more downside like the more mutation you have the more the negative effects of mutations are strong, because right now we're almost all mutated freaks with class freak perk cards, some mutation should make you unable to equip some armor or pa like marsupial (since it supposevely give you marsupial legs), mutation should be more of a playstyle rater than a bonus effect.
---
With all my stats if I unload at the scrip machine and the vendor I can get 250-300lbs to work with on my best toon. He has a carry weight of about 450-500. Others average -20 to 150lbs, With carry weights about 350.
---
The ultimate pose for the ultimate piss shiver?
---
I routinely slaughter my brahmin.  That extra carry weight is basically a perk card for me anymore.
---
heh, I don't even have doors on my base, and it's really nice :)   I agree, I used to use doors, even the keypad ones, then I realized they really don't serve a purpose and I like showing off my base, so I dont' even install doors, and I make holes in the roof, so us flying muties can just fly away from the inside.  
---
Also, many people put their machines in closed space and only way to access them is through a window.
---
Bethesda Austin does the day to day running of the game which would include something like a console PTS, Maryland pitches in for stuff like Wastelanders ect.
---
How else are you supposed to level up your lock picking skill though?
---
Yes but i deleted those characters, that's why i feel like a dumb dumb.
---
Or heal. But thank god they are focused on nerfing damage and letting the bugs go.
---
I have about the same as you.  I carry lots of food and chems, ammo, too many guns.
---
I just dont want anybody going through my stash and stealing my valuables!!lol but yeah I see locked camps and it's fine if everything is accessible
---
Colossal problem is apparently a permanent addition to the game
---
So meat week, then colossal after?
---
exactly
---
some of the legendaries in WoW were ridiculously hard to get. Hell. Even some normal gear was hard to get.
---
Assassins should fall into the same category as the Z T H and ext.

Bet u got skeletons under ur base huh
---
On Xbox when this happens to me I just hop servers and sell something to dutchess before talking to smiley. He will then sell me the weekly gold. Idk y it works. Was told to do this by another player and it‚Äôs worked every time he‚Äôs tried holding out on me.
---
Yes, I agree that many parts should be overhauled, but rewriting an engine from scratch never happens in the games industry. If people say that F76 is running on the Morrowind engine, that's like saying Half-Life Alyx runs on the Quake II engine. Game engines evolve over time, and are never remade from scratch; there is always parts of an older iteration used
---
What are you putting in your vendor? And how do you price things?
---
Which outfit? Hunter‚Äôs long coat? There‚Äôs a trick to that... I have like 4 üòÅ

People are more than welcome to jump through, or interact with windows to look around my house. However I lock my doors because you‚Äôre all born in barn and leave my doors open and my shower running!

Edit: spelling
---
My CAMPS are so terrible that I have to lock them to save people from the suffering of having to view them....
---
people tend to lose faith in humanity when they see them...
---
You know they dont even have to leave anything near the windows right?
---
If you carry power armor you can get in.  If you know how to pause and use photomode you can get in.....locks are pointless.  Incidentally you can run a silo in about 5 minutes because of it.
---
Probably a stupid question, but how does one take a moo or a death claw? Or any bring tamable for that matter. I‚Äôm relatively new to the game and wanna know how to explore all my options for this game so I can always find something to do.
---
I heard you get the plan from daily ops, but you have to get the mods from the secret service for gold.
---
Hell yea bro bet ur base got some kool stuff
---
Apparently legendary means you get all 6 at maximum level after you leave the vault!
---
I like this idea, if you pick tier three class freak the drawbacks to mutations are minimal, there‚Äôs no reason not to run multiple mutations. Maybe start at 45% boost for no mutations and a -2% dmg per mutation. You could run every mutation and still get a 7% dmg boost, but I‚Äôve never seen anyone run all 19. This would greatly benefit low lvls or new players that are to poor or don‚Äôt know about serums.
---
Well, I was only locking doors because I wanted to keep out the illiterate douchenozzles who couldn't grammatically structure a complete sentence.  But if you're just going to get in anyway, I guess I'll leave things unlocked from now on.

Yeah I did considering that they are gonna keep doing these battle pass esque things after the summer is over ü§î First off, kids are still in school during the slightly worse than a Flu virus 'pandemic' even if it's online(however several school around me are still open and that's what I'm using my info from, several of the guys I play with are seniors and they get taught remotely by joining a class on their computer, and guess what, it's still a 6-8 hour class schedule. Oh and if your going to be going off kids being off during the summer, a lot of the adults I hang out with got mandatory paid vacations rather than being laid off so they've had all the time in the world this summer.

Frog church or kitten shrine ?

Sorry but I don't wanna hear a "AARHMOOOOOOOOOO" everytime i hop to a player camp to check out their vendors. I killed Trashcan Carla's Brahmin, I'll kill yours too if it AAARHMOOOOOOO's at me.
---
Get a grip idiot. It's my camp and I can lock what I want without your permission. 
---
Everyone knows you can glitch through walls but it's your time your wasting not mine.
---
I havent seen legendary since I played halo 3 for that damn spartan helmet...total grind but in the end worth it...play a level with 4 people and nobody is allowed to die with rockets only or something crazy like that...gaming has changed
---
Crafting 25 alcohols took 10-15mins at max too, if you followed a pre-planned route and knew what you were doing. I used to post guides for that here.
---
You right i learned from those characters but it still bothers me
---
Answer: Bethesda
---
If you open packs and you already have all levels of a card, it discards that card.
---
From what I understand, they have patched this behavior on the PTS.
---
Sounds like you run a berserkers build.
---
I know right
---
My Brahmin occasionally gets killed by wild mongrels but that‚Äôs about it.
---
(I have a nice little commune near the whitesprings golf club.  The mutts spawn out behind it on the other side of the fence).
---
The only door I lock is to my Fusion generator room, with a shotgun turret inside to take care of the tunneling mole rats.  But I won't hold a grudge against someone who wants to keep their shit private, I just keep moving.
---
sorry! üòÇüòÇ
---
I'm highly sure I checked guides for them. Downside were you needed the recipes which created another grind for them. It's just that one was annoying as shit.
---
yeah, for sure.  Like, I'm doing 1000+ damage with a minigun.  I don't care if that's nerfed.  Against the queen, we'll see.  Plus the funny thing is that there are still magic weapons in PTS.  If you're \*that\* concerned with damage, just go bloodied magic.  I have a magic bloodied gauss minigun, either way, I'm fine.
---
Exactly!
---
I play on PC, but I've been reading about performance lag caused by all of the meat piles since the last patch. Are you getting framerate hits before the crash happens? And has it happened during other events like Line in the Sand?
---
What's you current health and max health.
---
I owned game since beta, I only took prob six month break. And around last October is when I got back into the game and really started grinding. I have almost 800 hours in and only really play on one character. It wasn‚Äôt until about 3 months ago I started truly working on my perks and collecting the outfits and guns that are amazing. If I would‚Äôve known back then what I know now. I would prob have plenty of legacies and rare outfits. But I didn‚Äôt know what they all where back then. Live and we learn
---
Those issues aren't engine issues. To put it simply, usually if a bug can be fixed by a mod, it's not an engine problem. I also think they like sticking with Creation, became their main team is familiar with the tools and that allows them to make lots of stuff really quickly. Rewriting an engine would have massive financial costs, both to pay the people who will code the thing, and also writing documentation and teaching the devs a whole new thing.
---
Survival mechanics? The ones that are being removed from 76? Lmao Fallout 4 is more of a survival game than 76 is. 76 is a looter shooter which you have to occasionally eat and drink
---
Current health is 87/320
---
Ya I hate math too. But I want them to get this perk system right and I think this can work!
---
No other event specifically crashes but if i play long enough its crashing at random times, just that event is consistent
---
You can get a brahmin without taming by finding the brahmin pen plan then crafting it under resources. 
---
To tame a creature or animal you need the respective perks (wasteland whisperer and animal friend) you have to aim (with a weapon which doesn't have a scope) at a randomly encountered creature which has spawned on its own and press the button marked tame, from there it'll either tame it or not.
---
Oh okay that's cool. Really curious to see how it performs alongside the current 2handed melees.
---
If it has comparable damage to the super sledge, I'm sold and I'm stoked to try to grind it out
---
I'm a few steps away from completing the legendary run and for the most part I've completely ignored the daily challenges as I run a high intelligence build.
---
Could it be overheating due to all the meat piles? I've heard those cause issues for some folks.
---
What does that have to do with my post? I didn't complain about the game being monetized. I complained about them constantly changing monetization strategies and then fumbling the most basic tenets of those strategies.
---
Sure but y make a camp if ur not gonna let any one in 
---
In the words of sir Paul McCartny  "open the door and let'em in"
---
Probably just a good player if you think it was a sniper. If after you died and you can see them flying around then it was a hacker.  
---
Ghille suit doesn't necessarily give any advantage at all. It's better than a blue vault suit if your goal is to hide, but many other skins work for this. You should have had some kind of armor. I also recommend the perk card Dodgy "avoid 30% of incoming damage at the cost of 30 AP".
---
Thanks for sharing that üòä
---
That's why people cry about nobody being the conduit, cuz they want to shoot the ISS and gutsies for loot and XP, duh
---
In terms of raw-play time, i would say this was the quickest battle pass i have ever leveled in any video game.
---
Oh wait...the ultimate pose for a TERMINAL piss shiver! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ He gets bonus points for holding the pose.
---
AA closing the gap though
---
Again, I never stated otherwise. I said 'rewrite', 'revamp', which naturally implies what you're talking about. Although I think we can both agree that when they touch the engine next time, the bigger part they decide to touch on, the better.
---
Most people dont know that you can just jump through most windows, for example theres nothing preventing you from going through the windows in the brick building set
---
O god don‚Äôt bring up the 25 alcohol one. I don‚Äôt want to remember it.
---
Could be something to do with it as there was a lot of them. The xbox didn't actually turn off it just went to dashboard. Never had many issues until a few weeks/months ago
---
I'm a grinder and finished board. I dont' feel any of the daily's really take time or effort.  I have a loop that I do every day when I log in.  Just doing my loop I will have several dailies done in the first 30 minutes, without even meaning to.  Yup,  just playing the game and doing dailies will most likely complete most if not all weeklies by end of week, without targeting them.
---
Even if you only do the daily's, you will complete the season by the end, even with missing several days.   It doesn't take much to make up for lost days. Dont' forget, there are multiple Double Daily events.  So more casual people can complete, but not total casuals.
---
I have a little more complex structure but I do the same thing as you.
---
The kool-aid man 
---
Except its a crab with killer claws
---
Or get rid of it, and have a perk for not having mutations, a much higher buff, that drops massively with one mutation, and negative with two.
---
Actually furious is going to be the new meta but *shhhhhhhhhhooooshhhhutupaboutit*
---
Try air blowing it through the holes. And make sure there is enough ventilation for the xbox.
---
Its the fact it isn't based off gameplay. I do wish the 10kxp was worth more, like 250 or something. 100 feels too low and dailies and weeklies were honestly enough for me.
---
A little bit of forethought helps get through the dailies quick too... collecting bubblegum and canned foods for the next "Chew some bubblegum" daily helps knock them out quick.
---
When I see new people or level 1s at the vault and I have a sec I usually stop by and drop ammo guns armor and some stims to help them get started, but yes. The community is nice but it varies depending on the console. Pc seems like it is the best but I haven‚Äôt seen much of PS4. There are some oddballs on pc where it‚Äôs a low level that got wanted, which is not kinda hard to get, and some high level shows up and they go all salt mode on the high level. But I‚Äôm reality if I see someone under level 60 wanted, I pop over and kill them then leave so they don‚Äôt have a player hunter pop after them and they can be more aware of people in their area
---
Bloodied effect is nerfed
---
This has been suggested a number of times and dont understand why it isnt a thing. Agreed that it shouldnt be as strong as Junkies, but close to that would be good. 
---
Most mutations have a downside and you need to dedicate at least 1 perkcard to keep them.
---
I know it's permanent just hoping that colossal problem doesn't happen during meat week because i know people will nuke monogah mine like crazy at the start it will be a bummer that i have to decide  to go to the mine or go to a limited event with well knowing that most of the lobby will run to the event because of hype instead of meat week
---
So I can carry 580 with the ribeye steak during day without power armor and 580 with my excavator most time I am maxed out. But last night I started to use batteries included so I dropped my carry weight down 140 pounds so I could make it today to scrip stuff or transfer to new character. I have 800 max stash box and always almost full on weight. I started to transfer to characters a month ago and all 3 have almost 1k weight. I hoard just like I hoard in all fallout games just this one is harder to do
---
Yes, I do know what a game engine is and how it works.  I also know how to write code and do things like black box/white box testing.  I happen to have a bachelor's degree in computer science.
---
By my statement I am saying that quite a few bugs in this game is not due to the game itself.  Sure, FO76 has a few bugs in the game layer, but those are likely to not be the cause of most of the bugs. Instead, a lot of these bugs are likely deep in Creation Engine.  Creation Engine, I might add, was not originally designed to handle many of the tasks that FO76 needs it to do.  Hell, FO76 started as a mod to shoehorn old Quake netcode into Fallout 4.  So, we have an old engine used since TES 3 and code that was used since Quake 1 as the most likely culprit of the issues that players experience.  Neither code base was designed to handle number of client/server interactions that a player can generate in a MMO.
---
In case you thought I was joking about the Fallout 4 bit.
---
 https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-76-making-of
---
Oof, they did that already?  I didn‚Äôt think it was live yet.
---
I have 30 improved repair kits on one character and I cant move them to another character because you cant trade/put in suitcases/drop and it's so fucked
---
If it makes you feel less stupid, I left behind a lvl 250 character.  I kept my main lvl 450 and an alt lvl 150, basically completed the main story 3 times and each one was different, because of the build, the previous experiences, different choices...
---
I cannot say that lvl 250 character was a waste of time, because I learnt so much.  
---
All that effort sure will fall into oblivion and no one will ever know I invested that time into the character, but playing should not be about showing off lvls to others, it's about your own experience and how it makes you feel. All that time was well invested in my opinion.
---
It's late, my reading comprehension isn't great right now.
---
I believe they said they're overhauling the animation framework for Starfield, which is good, and I bet there are some other things they're working on
---
The weeklies weren't even hard and they boost you up so quickly through the board. We're expecting another double score weekend as well, thats practically a free qeekly right there.
---
We're not all natsu ya know lol
---
Stepped out of the shower cause the stove was on 
---
Then the sirens went off had to vacate with the water running and doors open. My bad
---
What is this ?
---
That it has! Or we have! 
---
Both are true but certainly the gamer‚Äôs voice has gotten louder. Like there was no dev twitter when I couldn‚Äôt find a ZOD rune in 2002.

I rather have it buggy so I can dupe legacies again

We found the sex offender.

Nobody can access your stash or scrapbox apart from you.

Thx bud

Why cant they just give a delayed death sequence that makes them have zero health but stay targetable for 5 seconds... same thing with queen or other mega mobs
---
I stock up at the highschool near Morgantown. There are like 3 at the entrance and pre wr food I stock up on Halloween candy from the Watoga highschool event.
---
As i started and all the way during the main questline I moved a lot.
---
With Wild Appalachia i finally settled on a spot close to the Whitespring cause of the challenges as most ingredients were close by. Was my first real ‚Äöhome‚Äò in Appalachia for months.
---
It was a great spot - for vending, nukezones directly at my porch, train station and the mall nearby not to mention a good place for legendaries back then.
---
Only got tired of the repair costs as I had constant SB attacks.
---
That was the reason I kept looking for a more quiet but central spot in the forest region. Took a while to find a place but now I‚Äôm happy having my own little homestead in the green. Not planning to ever move again.
---
Shit
---
No. But don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôll only use one extra bullet on certain mobs if you min maxed it.
---
So much this.  I understand it has always been this way and I understand that part of this is to keep people from duping but you really should be able to account bind items so they can be used.  The game is already a total grind fest.  I find I just can't bring myself to do things over and over, once should be enough.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs the ‚Äòquick build‚Äô just for the challenge. I‚Äôve got another blueprint that‚Äôs 2x2 with a few more amenities that also fulfills the challenge but uses more materials. That one sometimes uses a little bit of my personal scrap.
---
What is this magic ?
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4, I have a couple extra plans for it that you‚Äôre welcome to for free.
---
Just a troll but I'm sure some think they can get robbed if they dont lock up
---
Idk if they did it already but otherwise it will be nerfed in the next patch I think.
---
Another update, another server crash. This time I was about to repair the mainframe. Gonna take a break. I swear to mothman I will get this nuke launched today.
---
Should be 10am central time Monday every week.
---
Get to 63 and report back.
---
I've been having this with about half the legendaries I've encountered in the last couple weeks, and as far as I can tell none of the regular mobs. 
---
Not that it matters much with scrip cap being hit so easily and them never dropping anything nice
---
Okay, glad you're not one of those armchair developers, just spouting nonsense. But I think we can agree that rewriting something like this while retaining full functionality is a monumental task.
---
Perk card in intelligence, improves accuracy and adds armor penetration for heavy guns while wearing power armor
---
No hotfix on consoles also means no deep pocketed SS limbs smh.
---
Nothing is changed on the live servers. Only the pts has any damage changes.
---
Also the Quake 2 bit is really funny
---
Any thing for armor pen with shotgun I want a shotgun build but not bloodied
---
I don't know anything about console, but isn't it possible to have keyboard/mouse on console via some aftermarket peripheral?
---
So just quit your job, sort your priorities üò§
---
That would be awesome but I‚Äôm on Xbox unfortunately.
---
If everyone jumps ship to Monogah and leaves meat week, then i'll be server hoping
---
Im betting there will be a lot of failed colossal problems at first, until people work out how to do the event, so i wont be wasting my time for now with it
---
Maybe it‚Äôs to leave the people outside that run through your camp and manually turn everything off. 
---
That happened to me sometimes but I still have doors unlocked.

Bugged weapons that cause them to do way more damage than junkies or bloodied or pretty much any other effect.
---
Ya got me ;)
---
It is, but I think it might be necessary.

How do you know if you have one ?

The first is the worst. Might help if I say - it won‚Äôt be the last and one day you will accept it as getting contracted with rad worms.

No go, I think my camps in the protected zone

FEAR OF MISSING OUT.

It's just cosmetics dude. Time will pass, it might resurface again.

Crash Course: Magic

https://youtu.be/vno3BICsakI

After last time they announced the delay as the patch was going live at least this time they've given done warning but bloody hell they delay it multiple times, then they delay meat week when they announced colossal problem coming out and now being on xbox they delay it again. I've been so eager for this after grinding like hell to complete the legendary Run and getting burnt out with lack of new things to do because donating junk is not an event. Is it so much to ask for more advanced warning to temper expectations?

Fallout 76 in a nutshell
---
You aren't getting paid. If you don't play, they won't try to come take your house away.. There are so many other great games out there. I only play this for Nuclear Winter.
---
Give all your loot to me ?
---
I just got to 63 and my damage went to 173 üòí
---
Little update.  I didn't have all the available information.  This is from encrypted BOS broadcasts:
---
"First Expeditionary Force, this is L-H. Elder Maxson recording.
---
Paladin Rahmani, your unit has now been out of contact with Brotherhood headquarters for over three months. Our Scribes estimate that your unit should be entering Appalachia and closing in on the ATLAS Observatory shortly."
---
There is more information in the broadcasts but it is open to interpretation.  What is apparently factual is that the trip took "over three months, " that it passed through or near Lincoln Nebraska, and crossed the Mississippi River at some point.
---
So let's set the trip duration at 100 days because it's a nice round number.  Lost Hills " is the codename of a security bunker located in the southeastern end of the Central Valley in" California, which puts it somewhere near Bakersfield California.
---
According to Google Maps a trip from Bakersfield CA to Charleston WV is 2344.9 miles.  Unfortunately...this path goes nowhere near Lincoln Nebraska.  There IS a Lincoln AR that is along the route...and one in Oklahoma, Arkansas, TN, KY and in WV itself, all more or less along the route.
---
Fortunately, the mention of Lincoln was in the first message, indicating that it was a) fairly early in the trip and b) that they had "No contact since crossing the Rockies. "  The Rockies, according to Wikipedia anyway, are much farther north than the route suggested by Google Maps, which brings Lincoln CO and Lincoln KS into the picture as well.
---
Assuming they took this more northern route, it adds a few hundred miles to the trip so I'm rounding it to 2600 miles.
---
So, they covered 2600 miles in 100 days, averaging 26 miles per day.  Far, FAR too fast to have been on foot.  On the other hand it's too slow to be flying, unless they have had a LOT of down time...which is of course entirely possible.
---
That's about all I can drag out of the available data.  You can read the message transcripts here if interested:
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Encrypted\_broadcasts](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Encrypted_broadcasts)
---
Thanks bro
---
No, they dont' ruin your sneak bonus towards yourself. BUT,  if playing with team (not just being on a team), Sneaking is too slow and doesnt' really flow. Usually with multiple people, there isn't an event that sneaking adds any value. You would need a team of sneakers.   
---
 I used to be a sneaker, but that is when I solo'd everything, public teams changed everything, now most are always in teams.
---
Ive done countless events in public teams and never broken stealth unless ive been careless
---
Can easily stay stealthed for an entire SBQ run
---
Black and white = about to break. Black and red = broken
---
I typically travel light and and carry what's needed for my focus at the time.  I max at 350ish with my unyielding and buffs, always have at least 200 lbs or more free.
---
80lbs when I‚Äôm all done clearing out unwanted aid items and crap leggos.
---
If it's just a lag issue, you can join a team if not already on one, close the app, and rejoin the team in the same world and you will no longer have the lag issue. You will also still be able to loot the meat piles you haven't looted yet.
---
Meat Week is ending on the same day it was originally going to, so we're getting less days of meat week than we otherwise would!
---
Ignoring all the negativity here (Late dec ‚Äò18, early Jan ‚Äò19) and playing my way.
---
Tasks auto completing are still happening!
---
Legendary perks require 200 coins to level.up a single level, scrapping unused normal cards gives you 2 coin per its level.
---
Do you actually get bonus damage on the SBQ, though?  I never see it pop up.
---
Talk to one of the people at the bar to start a dialog then go back to smily. That worked for me.
---
I am tbh...
---
Upvote on Metallica reference alone but wouldn't Jamiroquai be more appropriate in this situation?

*I know I'm better off standing in the shadows*

---
*From what they have done,*  
---
*C'mon*
---
*I'm going deeper underground*  
---
*There's too much panic in this town*
---
Each card is currently giving 2 coins.  Subject to change, etc.
---
Lol, I actually like Rose. She was a loyal side chick- their like almost impossible to find anymore
---
This happens to me all the time, I‚Äôm decently leveled at 200 alt and 250 main, different consoles but alt and main to simplify. Happens mostly on my alt but I just rejoin 2 seconds later, if I get booted again I rejoin. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle of kicked and rejoining but they eventually give up. And it always that one team since well I usually am trying to do things with another person who is on that team. But it‚Äôs always on building teams, and nobody ever rejoins. And it‚Äôs not like the leader is doing events, they are just roaming Appalachia. I don‚Äôt know why people boot others from teams and honestly when I‚Äôm a public team leader I don‚Äôt care if people share cards, it honestly bugs me when people share cards, cause for some cards it is super detrimental to share specific cards. There‚Äôs at least three cards that remove rads from players that I find at least one person sharing it in a day, which ruins bloodied builds.
---
Ive been playing on the pts. My xp:
---
* 2 handed full health junky melee feels 100% the same.  Ohk or at most 2 shot lvl 100 super mutants with no worries. 
---
* junky commando feels slightly less powerful.  2-4 more bullets to kill while free aiming,  head shot is maybe 1 more shot to kill depending on the enemy.
---
* bloody stealth sniper feels like a more substantial nerf.  2 headshots vs lvl 100 super mutants though can 1 shot with adrenaline stack and/or more damage optimized. Same build can 1 shot body shot 68 mutants on live servers.
---
There's speculation bloody has 1 or more bugs on pts as paper damage doesn't seem to add up according to the new data mined formulas. So id reserve judgement on bloody until we find out if it's working as intended.
---
Often around 70/80 lbs
---
note this is only on Test server at this time.
---
Once I saw a level 10 kill someone's Brahmin and then tried to loot it.
---
Yeah its instantly noticeable
---
Im usually hitting 67 on the body and 100 on the head (rookie numbers probably üòÇ)
---
Out of stealth i'll be hitting for low 20s on the body
---
Its not the only one.
---
I‚Äôve been to bog town IDK how many times, captured the workshop several times...and the challenge still says I need to discover Bog Town.
---
bloodied stealth
---
Adrenal reaction mutation, check for missing dps related perks (commando bloodied mess nerd rage, adrenaline) also at the time u checked was adrenaline active, if so how many stacks? Did u have a bobble head/chems active at the time u last checked ur dps? These types of questions u should be looking at for random dps drops. 
---
On live game bloodied has not been nerfed
---
Lol! I love how when he said 'staff working on atom store - leave', 80% of the room left!
---
They already do if your on PC....Ill see myself out.
---
Its only unarmed that seems bugged.
---
I have intervened, it is 1918, I live in Tennessee, I climbed hill 223.
---
yeahp, I was a stealth rifle build for my first 150 lvls.  Then I changed to Commando.
---
Omg this made lol so hard!
---
Thats super passive aggressive.. i love it
---
I hope they also add a Shield as well into the game, considering how I block often.
---
What the fuck did the post say?
---
Yea, I‚Äôm missing a few of those, too
---
Sir, please take a seat over here..
---
The mole rats know how to open doors
---
My Brahmin seem to just die. 
---
I'll be in my shack crafting, and just hear them die. Not sure what that's about.
---
They just patched that I think
---
Good luck in Daily Ops
---
Have you tried hot wheeling polly's head?
---
Or have you been opening the pip boy and equipping it?
---
now what the fuck are legendary perks?
---
I operate that way and somehow am still disappointed every time
---
What the fuck is the point of the PTS then?
---
I dunno try unequip then re equip all perks and the gun.  Check mutations to insure you didn't accidentally cure adrenal reaction.
---
But there's 100% no nerfs on live servers.
---
Well my answer would have been ‚ÄúThanksgiving display case and stainless steel fridge‚Äù but Bethesda brought both of those back this week so I‚Äôm pretty happy, as for what I was looking for I would have said the Quack Doctor outfit but it‚Äôs already been released too. 
---
So not sure... What all cool stuff was released between meat weak and New Years? I was absent from the game at the time. 
---
(Ah but if I had to pick something simple then I‚Äôd say clean red cooking stove. Always wanted it, never had the atoms to get it.)
---
Got my outfit and legendary rolling pin ready!!!
---
For me at least, I dont want to be able to finish the dailies in 30 minutes or under.
---
They are named challenges to id like to see a challenge to them. Currently they are just mind numbingly boring. 
---
Id also like to see new dailies rotated in consistently rather than the same nonsense over and over.
---
I think the challenges are a missed opportunity to engage the playerbase in some of the games activities and have a little fun along the way.
---
For example, utilise biv. Have a challenge to simply complete a biv daily, but, on days where this challenge is activated, bivs daily could be a modified version. There could be several variations that rotate each time the biv challenge is active to keep it fresh.
---
Some ideas off the top of my head:
---
Take a photo with 5 different players while under the influence of (insert beverage here)
---
Punch 3 different deathclaws while under the influence of (inset beverage here)
---
Steal 3 deathclaw eggs while under the influence of (insert beverage here) - An egg will not count if you kill the deathclaw.
---
These are pure basic and im sure the comminity could come up with much better given time to think about it.
---
And thats just biv. There are lots of aspects of FO76 that should be taken advantage of to keep things interesting and somewhat entertaining while keeping the difficulty low enough.
---
I am also all for doing away with dailies conpletly and piling them all into weeklys. It ensures more opportunity for the developers to be creative with the challenges when the aspect of ensuring the dailies must be easy enough to be done in a single play session.
---
Could also add season challenges that are available from the start of the season and expire at the end of the season and make them as grindy as hell üòÄ
---
Just a thought.
---
Mutation downsides are more severe than addiction downsides so yes!
---
I only have 2. I dont want to buy a 1200 atom bundle just for a plushie. I would however pay 1200 for a plushy bundle
---
They're fucking coins that you fucking get by fucking scrapping your fucking shitty perk cards so you can fucking get some fucking legendary perks.
---
I‚Äôve got full commando perks on like usual.  I even just sucked down a bunch of rad away and cleared out my mutations and reset marsupial only.  Still the same
---
I wish players would chat while in the public groups, somethings it seems like a waste of time to be in a group that no one speaks in. May as well play solo
---
Sad but true.
---
Quicker if you Google it :-)
---
To be honest, at this point, looks, just to make the game good, I support and play the game, but the PTS is for looks.
---
Have a Troubleshooters or AA weapon?
---
I just stand on the top platform with a troublshooters gatling.  Simplifies protecting the workers.
---
It‚Äôs more than a bunch of other games have big updates tomorrow as well. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs more of a managers decision to launch at the same time to avoid a chunk of the player base going off to play other games.
---
Weird/disturbing flex.
---
Both do not work
---
Definetly the poodle skirt. I've been waiting since the start of the game.
---
Class freak is too expensive a perk Investment for my build!
---
fucking ok fucking Jesus fucking Christ fucking thanks fucking for fucking the fucking information.
---
Tried dropping every weapon except polly's head?
---
If not then you'll need to try server hopping
---
And turrets go pew pew  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Also if your max health dropped you need to lower current health to 19% or less.

LOL! I had done a fair bit of reading about others experiences with Berserker's before taking the plunge. I also spent a good amount of time at the purveyor rolling level 1 armor on a mule until I built up enough to make a go at it. 
---
At the time the weapons were easy to get because no one was interested in Berserker's, so handmades, fixers, etc were pretty cheap. That has somewhat changed now, but they can still be had for less than other legendaries.
---
Once you get used to the play style it's a lot of fun to run around at 0 DR. It's easily been one of my favorite builds so far.
---
A) not yet
---
B) it's not really nerfed, damage is just calculated differently, which will lower damage more for some people than others.
---
Unlikely they would allow anything for NW since you could use mods to make it unfair. If we get anything, it‚Äôs going to be private servers only
---
I suspect that the 60% is wrong and it's actually the same as 3 cards of good with salt (90%).  I can't tell the difference anyway, with either the backpack equipped or good with salt food basically lasts forever.
---
I‚Äôll be down to help you level up, I‚Äôm mostly doing grindy things myself and don‚Äôt mind having people tag along. My schedule is super whacked up so I can‚Äôt get on everyday. I know I have tomorrow and Wednesday free to help. If you wanna party up just shoot me a pm on here and i can even set you up with some gear
---
Well if ur a bloodied build u should consider using adrenal reaction and resetting the mutations üòÖ 
---
But the sheet dps u mentioned is telling me something is missing cuz 170 dmg is what I deal with a vampires handmade. Hit 370ish with my be handmade. 330ish w a b25 handmade (no chems/adrenaline) Check weapon mods mutations perks double check everything
---
Rather than be annoyed that some people lock everything up, try being appreciative of the many people who don't?  :)
---
330/445 or so
---
I have some structures in my CAMP that are just there to act as props that add to the design theme, they are empty inside. So I lock the doors because there is nothing to see. 
---
But if you *really REALLY* want to come to my camp and run around inside an empty structure like a complete fucking moron, then by all means go for it.
---
Sorry dude, Im not very active on reddit. Anyway, I understand the passion and hurt feelings, and I have nothing against bloodied players. But this is a business, and as a developer myself, I completely understand them. I'll go ahead and give you an example. I got my friend playing a month ago, he started off strong, really got into it. After passing level 50 he started strugling because of a chaotic order of perks and random traits he had on him instead of a build. He started googling, like most people do in multiplayer games, you know to get a good build. Of course he got into bloodied, started working on that. 2 weeks later, hes level 110 with a bloodied build maybe 50% done. He already started one shotting most of the enemies the game throws at him. He pretty much stopped dying and even when he did die, the game just doesnt punish deaths. He got bored and stopped playing. There was no challenge grinding and grinding is the only loop we have in fo76.
---
Wall of text later, I'm willing to bet lots of people find the absolute godlike power of live state bloodied dull, thats why I said the minority. Because the people that did find it broken and boring just moved on. Theyre probably trying to fix that with the formula changes. You can always vote with your wallet sure, but it seems bethesda is willing to bet on the new players it hopes to attract rather than the vets actually enjoying overpowered numbers.
---
If they made auto-closing doors available in the ATOM shop, they'd make a fortune.
---
What weapon and build? That sounds like a godly unarmed build.
---
I‚Äôm happy with my two uny, two bolstering and chamelion chest, cant believe how many rolls it took though. The burning out was real. Now for the minigun :|
---
Neither is having 5 addictions. Yet junkies still gets 50%
---
Much stronger replayability factor than 4? How so?
---
Have you tried the backpack?
---
I agree good with salt is great but the backpack as far as I can tell is exactly the same.  And then you have 3 spare perk points in luck, plenty of other good stuff in there
---
Every time he (emerson) sits in one of my chairs in my mountian top C.A.M.P. , while hes looking out over the beautiful landscape of WV after successfully charging Sofia for stimpaks, i walk up behind him and put a few silenced shotgun rounds through his head hoping that one day the game will glitch and ill get to see his head explode all over my sweater. 
---
One can dream
---
I do it with solar and SS torso, depending if I want to fly or heal :-)
---
The perk card scrapping should stay, but it should not he the focus. We need a way to get rid of duplicates and unused cards.
---
I think we should get coins for scrapping cards ontop of getting one per level. Even get one from certain events, or the new daily ops.
---
*BoS ite domum.
---
(Couldn't leave the reference unfinished and uncorrected.)
---
Also assuming your a new player, you can holster/draw weapons by holding down the reload button (X on xbox)
---
One of the rare times I am happy i dodnt get this on pc.  And the worst part is its like they don't even care.  Shitty code is one thing not caring about open cheating ruining others game play is unforgivable
---
Junkies gets 5 negatives with addictions PLUS the negatives that already come with mutations because everyone runs mutations.  Buffing mutations too close to junkies ruins the benefit of junkies as everyone would lose their addictions and just go mutants.
---
If youre gonna sit there and say bethesda shouldn't do something because duping could happen then its valid to suggest that we shouldn't shape the game around its potential exploits.
---
They stuck with creation engine because they like their editor but they can still upgrade other components of i
---
The RNG granted me a full 3* Unyielding set in a little under 100 rolls. One was even fall damage reduced. I saved another fall damage one (auto stim) that I had gotten along the way and stuck it on my favorite wheel so I can quickly equip it when need be.  I feel like a god when I fly up to the SBQ and blast her with my Gauss shotgun a few times and fall a kilometre back to the ground.
---
Burn out, try full sets of Vanguard and unyielding solar, and full sets of  vanguard, Unyielding and Bolstering SS, plus Gauss minigins, pistols and shotguns :-)
---
The game auto kicks people from teams A LOT. I've started many public teams and seen teammates suddenly get "removed" when I absolutely did not remove them.
---
It does just as much as junkies, it won't be at all
---
This might be the answer here, I think I cured adrenal reaction üòÇ
---
&gt; nocturnal ... easily phased out of the game ...
---
Wash your mouth out with soap and water. Nocturnal weapons are ridiculously good at night.
---
They're useless for PvP as the damage cap for PvP can be reached without a legendary effect!
---
No.  
---
It fits perfectly for me and for the BoS.  
---
It reminds me on Old World Blues.
---
I pvp at workshops just to steal junk and even I agree we should get bounties for stealing it. In my case it just adds to the thrill, but in others it prevents people from simply stealing the junk alwithiut any repercussions.
---
I think it should simply give a 5 cap bounty per bag looted, you get a bounty for lock picking in a camp it just makes sense
---
Absolutely not surprised, Bethesda couldn't hit a release date if their mothers lives depended on it. At this point, I'm more annoyed at myself for expecting anything from this shit-show they call a development team. I want to praise them, and laud their good ideas, but it's delays, bugs, and shitty choices on progression instead. 
---
Release it for EVERYONE, at the same time, or don't release it at all. Stop repeatedly shitting on your console players. You're in a content drought, and are bleeding player numbers every day. Your poor decisions are going to destroy this game, so either build a better development team, or just stop promising things.
---
I think something more complex like a buff for mutants if there‚Äôs synergy with having a full mutants armour set. I don‚Äôt get why they don‚Äôt work together in any way currently.
---
Yes, please fix this. It's such an awesome combination.
---
Purified or boiled water?
---
Honestly I'm just bothered by the need to log in every day until it's done. I just don't like daily-bound anything. I don't mind it as much if it can pool up over a couple days (say; three days). However, just this regulated need to log in every single day until I'm done drives me nuts. It's exhausting. It's a chore. 
---
I didn't like it in WoW. I didn't like it in Destiny. I especially don't like it in Fallout 76, which has all of its "group content" as a "You don't actually need a group".
---
If I wanted daily quests in a single player game, I would play a mobile game. Bring me actual group content or piss off with this daily nonsense. At least when it was atoms-only I could just not care at all if I missed some and just buy some atoms if I was short on something I just had to have from the store. When it's a battle pass, if I don't log in I'm tangibly behind. The daily gating on scrip AND caps AND bullion AND battle pass and then it's just... Once I'm complete with meeting my daily quota I'm drained and don't want to spend my time exploring or building anymore.
---
With a larger, multi-day shared pool, at least I could choose to grind it out on one of the multiple days, and then spend the other days puttering around, building, exploring, questing, playing NW, finding new players to help, etc. All these daily chores are doing is inflating the average-daily-login numbers. They're actually driving me AWAY from the community, especially new players. They want help or for me to play with them and I feel like I can't until I'm done with my chores, and by the time I'm done I'm just spent because I've had to do nearly the same shit every day for WEEKS and it becomes increasingly less enjoyable to repeat the same pattern over and over.
---
As it is, the way this battle pass is set up I'm leaning towards abandoning the game entirely. AGAIN. I really enjoy the game, or I did. I was 50 before the beta even ended. I played like mad and was frequently the only one I saw on the map within 50 levels of me at the beginning.  I left, and came back recently and enjoyed it immensely again. However, with the new content touted in the latest patch still not here weeks later, even the items they claimed to add to a vendor STILL missing - I'm not holding out a lot of faith that the Brotherhood will ACTUALLY arrive at all. I'm becoming increasingly convinced that July 2021 will roll around and neither the Brotherhood nor the Monongah Wendigo Colossus event will have arrived. Nevermind anything else promised. I mean I'm still seeing bugs that were here in beta.
---
Please bring back the comic book rack skin. I didn't pick it up last time cause I have the IQ of a squirrel BUT I won't miss it next time
---
I oWe mY soUl To tHE COmPANy    sToRE
---
but yes you have a point!
---
Gunsmith and White Knight are fucked for many players, others say there is no issue, so nobody takes it seriously...
---
Couldn't agree more. It's absolutely astounding that the trade bug in particular in still there. It's a huge inconvenience and has been completely ignored.
---
It's clear they don't play the game, don't test the game and haven't staffed it with sufficient dev resources to keep up.
---
Agree.  Thats why I‚Äôm missing at least one - didnt want the bundle it was in.  missed another b/c I didn‚Äôt have enough atoms at the time, and a 3rd because I wasn‚Äòt collecting plushies at the time it came out....
---
I just want rank 4 Ammo Factory since I eat a ton.
---
I was thinking mostly about armor but sure.
---
Must be my computer fucking up again lol.  Keep taking this damn thing to the shop too.  FML.
---
Hmmm I have a two shot 33 percent hit chance in vats plasma gattling that sounds like it has a chance possibly .
---
50, if I buy the deep pocked ss mods probably 100. But if I do that I know its gonna turn me back to a food build and I wanna keep staying up on my Vanguard weight management diet lol. 
---
2 weeks ago I was a "Bloodied" mess. Was carrying 1200 pounds of aid (reduced by perks/armor) 36 weapons and a ton of plans. I was completely lagging my pip boy and stash.
---
There ya go my dude. Be safe out there in the wasteland.
---
When you go into a locked camp through the window I hope you're leaving raw fertilizer on their bed. That's what I do, along with a "Notice of expulsion" note from the front of Fort Defiance.
---
People just don't like battle passes. They're pretty bad systems.
---
200% repair perk helps a lot.
---
.I repair the legs more often than anything else.  Freaking mole rats....
---
I doubt patch 22 comes out before the ps5 drops
---
because the only guy at bethesda who actually looks and listens to PTS feedback, is the same one getting defenestrated from the top floor when team meetings come around
---
Bethesda doesn't care and this sub protects cheaters because we're not allowed to call them out, even with indisputable video proof. They really do have free reign.
---
Just rolled an amazing Bloodied SS armor today, that I had to scrip because I am not playing Bloodied, nor plan to with this character.
---
The challenges were better as atom reward points but the point of this new thing is to stop us from getting so much free "money" and instead make us pay for anything extra we want. We get 1500 free per run which sucks. These challenges should be separate from another challenge base but so far it's overtly difficult to find a balance. This was just to balance out Zenimax wanting more money from the player base.
---
These challaneges are easier as everything else was a chore and forced coop. Now coop is more openly available which is nice so I only join to take a photo. If they are overly grindy then peple won't do thm. The photography ones were terrible as well snce some people dont have mics nor want to talk so it was a gamble during those things.
---
The second I see a lock I NEED to know what's in there!
---
......If you are running a vendor and your prices are outrageous.  Otherwise I don't really care at all and I will leave it alone.
---
No.
---
That worked thanks
---
If you are PS4, I believe I have several between my vendors and what I‚Äôm carrying.
---
Hell yea, I'd be up for something like that. Like roving bands of raiders going up against each other, even faction themed teams
---
oh right bethesda hates people liking the lore
---
I just hope i don't die and ol Earle Williams runs around with my bloodied explosive Gatling gun that he stole from my corpse. Looking at you, radiation rumble
---
Just so you're aware, stealth builds are going to struggle with the new Daily Ops raids. They've made it so that crouching does nothing, and you're always in \[Danger\] no matter what.
---
Does it have 200+ fire rate?
---
Fuck, I just got a Bloodied today on my Junkie's character 
---
&lt;facepalm&gt;
---
Nuclear winter, at least its balenced and dedicated.
---
It's to get you to play the game daily, hence the reasoning. They want you away from other games and onto theirs. A lot of other games do this too.
---
We LiVe In A SoCiEtY
---
I‚Äôm on PC and Xbox and people buy different things on each platform- rare items tend to sell better on Xbox - probably because less duping?
---
Ammo at 1 cap a piece (no 38, rarely 44, no explosives) big movers are plasma cores at 50 a piece sometimes 60 a piece, 5.56 .308 .45 .50 will all sell out. 5mm, Shotgun, and fusion cell moves slower but when it does they buy all of them. 10mm rarely sells
---
Notes - I have a few tiers of plans 26 - for stuff like metal shelves, 36 for deep pocketed or ultra light armors (as an example) 46 for something like flamingoes, 76 for something like jet pack 
---
Bobble heads 76
---
Maps are 36
---
Book are 46
---
Rare plans are 176-276 like I sold a few fasnacht plans for 176
---
Rare outfits that I can craft are 76
---
Rare outfits I find are closer to 176
---
Three star legendary armor ranges from 299-499
---
Three star weapons range from 399-599
---
I don‚Äôt really sell two star or one star unless it makes sense. Bloodied and junkies three stars sell much higher.
---
Serums are 349 (even though with hard bargain you can sell them for 449) - I prefer to sell them to players. 
---
Gunpowder will sell, surprisingly fast, and for 1cap. I think it‚Äôs because FO1st players can‚Äôt put it in scrap box.
---
I don‚Äôt sell much aid (no drugs really, sometimes stims - diluted for 4 and regular for 7) or junk (maybe a frog jar and frog or two) and no non legendary weapons (unless it‚Äôs a dragon or a drill for cheap)
---
For flux based items I‚Äôll sell masses, HRF if I‚Äôm
---
flush and for varying prices.
---
Keeping note/plan total over 50 and ammo total over 10,000 keeps people coming when they see you on the map.
---
If items don‚Äôt move after 4-5 days, I‚Äôll reprice lower until they sell. At these prices I could re stock every few days but I typically only stock once a week. If you price higher things will move but slower, except ammo - ever since someone posted ‚Äúnobody will buy your ammo for 2 caps a piece‚Äù that‚Äôs exactly what happened (no one wants to be seen as a chump lol)
---
Let me check a lot of his didn‚Äôt say they had over 200 and still did the damage though
---
Given that I had a) not asked for a multiplayer Fallout game and b) the release was a never ending shit-show, I had sworn not to pay one single penny for the game.
---
Of course, I kept looking for some way to play for free (that didn't involve anything unethical) but never managed it until one day it appeared on Game Pass.
---
Loaded it up and haven't looked back.  I've easily enjoyed it as much as the single player titles, though allowances have to be made for the lack of modding and bugs/instability.
---
So Game Pass got me in and...player camps kept me from dying ;)  The free food and water as well as the vendors, decontamination arches, etc. saved my life many times in the first few days.
---
People are still soloing those events on pts so.....
---
I think bloodied melee is messed up atm but other bloodied builds still work and are still strong.  Also pts is where they can work out these things.
---
Not just moving, removing 2 days from it as it's still ending on the same day!
---
two words: Piercing Gaze :(
---
I havent noticed Gunsmith being broken but White Knight is absolutely useless for me. im at 200% and its broken after a westtek or burrows run with Rank 3 when before SCORE it rarely ever got below 100%
---
I completely disagree as this would still disincentivize any and all build rerolling.
---
Unless we can convince Beth to give us another method of respec, like caps or something. Then I‚Äôd be fine with your suggestion.
---
I‚Äôve got my bloodied pistol and shotgun, minigun is last, thankfully I only play with my brother who runs solar, and since we refuse to use same gear I‚Äôm in the clear lol
---
You guys are all nuts, 80% is very significant
---
Don't be so sure. I camp at the lake that spawns three brahmin and one dies naturally ever time. He is literally just standing in water and you can watch his health bar creep down until he dies. There is no logical explanation for it but it is a regular occurrence. The other two out of three are just fine, going through the same routine, but there is always the one that will perpetually die.
---
Also, why do you assume its a player kill? Could be random monster...
---
Same with armour, but my Gauss shotguns need repairing daily, no exaggeration and they used to last weeks....
---
I have all the perks set and I'm definitely repairing so so much more often
---
Patch 21 really fucked up server stability!
---
No there's talks of them coming out with a PvP update next year, ment just for PvP players. I've heard more than one person mention it, but I didn't want to watch all the quakecon stuff. What I think it is, is the TDM they scrapped a long time ago, and the author of the post mentioned the PvP content update for next year so I was hoping for something about that.
---
Standard gutter is even better when you put the assaultron blade electric charge mod on it :)
---
I‚Äôll run the ideas up the flag pole (not really) those are great ideas though
---
What battle passes in other games take 100+ hours? Can you list a few? Just in case those here are trying to say the battle-pass takes less time, look no further than the official [seasons FAQ](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons) (near the bottom):
---
&gt; A: Each rank-up should take between one and two hours of play time, with earlier ranks taking closer to one hour, and later ranks nearing two.
---
It kinda just depends.  Explosive effects help too
---
I use lucky break and the other one? So i dont have to reapir as often. High luck and strength.
---
Abraxo and purified for the best results :D
---
I've also accidentally grabbed someone's death loot (without realizing it was there) due to spam looting corpses at the end of radiation rumble
---
Actually faster to gather  a bunch of food, let it spoil and scrap it into fertilizer.
---
Wait what‚Äôs this update? So Colossal Problem isn‚Äôt even launching for consoles tomorrow? How much longer do we gotta wait...
---
Whitesprings usually has some in the wheelbarrow begind the gokdclub and the parking lot on the other end and my camp is near there already. Heading up to my garden is less tedious than that
---
Also both daily and weekly challenges STILL auto complete!
---
I have over +2500 hrs gameplay and still haven‚Äôt contracted whoopsies disease. I read somewhere it has to do with mirelurk hatchlings and rare chances or something.
---
I usually only have around 30~ free space. I always keep around 40 stimpacks on me with 30~ rad away, and 3 weapons. The biggest killer is armor weight for me
---
25% is too close to junkies? It‚Äôs literally half. Plus, mutations are much worse. To negate just some of the negatives you have to use up 3 perk slots, 5 if you count the 2 perk slots used just to have the mutations
---
Oh, the perks are screwed, have been since score launch, just not enough notice or experience it for it to get any traction
---
It‚Äôs so true. I love this game and play it a lot, but they need to get their act together. Features in Fallout 1st should‚Äôve been in the game since day 1. Private servers? Of course - most of us like Fallout - *a series of single player games.* This is not Fortnite, we don‚Äôt want BR. Sorry Nuclear Winter, but it‚Äôs true. And like you said, EVERY. SINGLE. ‚ÄúPATCH.‚Äù Breaks so much stuff. Even though new content is supposedly coming, I couldn‚Äôt care less. If they promised work on all the bugs and patched them out *for good* - not their typical band-aid solutions, that would be a different story. Until they do those things, they aren‚Äôt getting a dime from me in atoms or Fallout 1st.
---
How many Earle William's are there? He doesnt stop. Earle William's is e t e r n a l
---
No I'm saying the 5 mutations isn't enough to garner 25% imo.  You should need more.  I do like 3% for a cap of 30% with 10 mutations.
---
What if they mess up something and it will be vice-versa?
---
my carry weight is about 400-460 depending on if im on a team, pep rolls and weight reduction pieces...try to keep 100-150 pounds free
---
but when i die im usually 7-800 pounds
---
i carry ALOT of chems
---
My armor is consistently broken because I've given up on repairing it. I use my repair kids for weapons only. If I do have the materials to fix my armor, it's usually just enough for one piece of armor. I don't feel like scavenging all time and trying to remember what I need and how much of it I need. So I don't  but sometimes I do have one or two armor protecting me but for the most part, I'm usually gallavanting around with all broken armor. I'm a full health build though so I take some damage but that's alright I don't sweat it too much and I don't seem to die more when my armor is broken as opposed to when it's all fixed (super rare occurrence)
---
It's like 10 metres to the mianland, wouldn't take long lol
---
My max is 350-ish and I like to start out at about 75/350. That's 3 guns, ammo and some necessary aid plus whatever's stuck in misc like key cards etc.
---
Lmao glad I play on PC, but seriously this stuff is getting ridiculous.
---
That makes a lot of sense, you could say it....all ads up.
---
This question has a lot of moving parts to it.
---
What weapons?
---
What armor?
---
What perks?
---
I only have real problems with the weapons and armor I‚Äôd expect to. Namely my Ultracite Railroad Gun and my terrible left wooden left leg that I haven‚Äôt found a good replacement for in forever.
---
Woww
---
I have to fix the ss armor so often as well, is that normal or just a perk issue?
---
I will bring the White Russians
---
But if it were fixed they‚Äôd get less money. ToddGreedy.
---
I think you are new to the game and sooner or later you will see that the things you find fun in the game now will be taken away or lose purpose.
---
I love building, but it's all based on how much you can pay, and it's nothing compared to 4th game.
---
I love storys, but there is nothing captivating to make me ever wanna replay. No consequences no development or accomplishments.
---
I have at this point stopped caring about the game. I have been exploited for my money with aggressive marketing. I see bleak future when it comes to bug fixes and I feel no joy playing the game anymore. I did the season grind with my friend group who played since the game came out and they all got so burned out. I don't know if they will ever come back to play it.
---
Those and the mangy dogs/wolves.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought, and my boyfriend lives by the same principle since locks are free. Like all of mine are closed right now because I want to save up until I have a surplus of everything since I like to have more than I need. When I hit that point, I‚Äôll open my things for sure.
---
If its multiplicative, those two multipliers are game changers. Lets say bloodied allows for an average of 80%, nerd rage gives another 20%. Thats +116% to the entire sum of everything before. I mean again, I really dont mind people playing bloodied nor am I on a crusade against it, but more than doubling your damage isnt just two extra modifiers. Thats why they want to switch to an additive formula.
---
25. Str/int hvy weps build, got some WEP weight reduction armour so I lose space when I enter my excavator
---
If I'm remembering this correctly, does the body have multiples of the same card on it? If it does you have to specifically get the one that has the diamond quest marker. You might have to scroll down for a while but it will eventually show up.
---
Lol true but if there were like 50 of them that'd be challenging. But there's probably a better idea for the ol' island, I'd just be happy to see them do more with it.
---
I would love the postmaster because I would use it to store legendaries until I needed scrip.  If you gonna hold it for me why pick it up?  Ain't no point in putting it against my 390 or my stashes 800 until I need to visit mumbles.
---
Kind of thing would have sold for at least 10000 caps
---
No. No no no no. I don‚Äôt want us to go back to the ridiculous setting up we had to do in order to get challenges accomplished. The amount of SCORE you need increases every level already, why on earth would we want to make it even harder?
---
I'm just waiting for Hal to become self aware.
---
Yea I've gotten it three times
---
If I‚Äôm out of power armor, I have about 30-45 pounds of space left. I think I carry too many stimpaks and I probably don‚Äôt need 100 fusion cores lol
---
Well I'm usually at 275/295 sometimes though I go on buffout benders bc I insist on carrying 42 plasma cores with me and my queen gun at all times ... just in case
---
Questname checks out
---
You think I can‚Äôt break in your shack and kill it without getting a bounty? Lol
---
I know a few popular ideas have made it into the game. Idk if these will but there's no harm in making the suggestion!
---
They aren't there for people, they are there to make free money off people who want stuff from the pass but don't want to do every challenge to get them. Same as loot boxes; there to make money.
---
But that‚Äôs your lap.
---
Being on a team doesn‚Äôt affect your sneak bonuses, enemies being aggroed to your teammates‚Äîor any other player or NPC does. The game will still show you your increased damage numbers in that case, but they won‚Äôt actually count on the enemy health bar.
---
Yeah I understand the complaints right now, but I do wonder how many people realize that the colossal problem event is a permanent addition meant to go up alongside the scorched earth one. It‚Äôs not like you only have a week or two to do it
---
I don't really support segregating content. Let people achieve whatever they want to achieve. I don't care if someone else has a gun I have.
---
I'm ALWAYS looking in this tab just praying for something new.. I hope they do this soon!
---
Just get a chicken coop. More fertilizer and no brahmin to deal with.
---
Dibs on your stuff
---
Why not just make player-owned pets invincible? That would solve a ton of issues.
---
yes and yes
---
This is something I‚Äôve never thought about but makes perfect sense now that it‚Äôs been pointed out
---
Radioactive dust maybe? Craftable into nuclear material perhaps? Dreams are nice
---
I had that happen the other day, it's not one I do every day.
---
What I hate is that I can't drop the vox syringer , 2lbs i can't drop even if I complete the event
---
Not a single time it took me 2-3 hours. Legendaries can be found at certain events, too. You can also hop fissure sites for legendary SBs.
---
Buff nocturnal, but have a diurnal set as well. Half weight, or slightly above.
---
the bonus damage basically makes it melee-equivalent to a "VE" assaultron blade. If you could get a VSS, JSS, or BSS Gutter? OH HELL YESSSSSS
---
You know you can mute them right? Just go to social tab, teams click on name and 3rd option down is Mute.
---
Whats harder about it?
---
I'm talking a variation of challenges as opposed to logging in daily to "buy three items from a vending machine", "chew some bubble gum" and "take a photo while in a group"
---
I would like the challenges to be fun and somewhat engaging. 
---
Moving the dailies score rewards to the weekly ones helps players time management while ensuring a player doesn't lose out on score because they couldn't find the time to log in to do these mundane tasks.
---
The additional seasonal challenges I purpose should in my opinion not be calculated into the calculation and simply doing the weeklies would be more than enough to complete the season.
---
Instead, they would serve as an actual challenge for players that want more and an option to grind out the season faster in new ajd interesting ways other than just grinding for xp daily as it currently is.
---
These seasonal challenges would also be a nice life line for a player that might have missed out on a few challenges to make up for what was lost.
---
New is good.
---
Fun is good.
---
Embrace fun üòÄ
---
I have only ever kicked people for sharing gun fu. Otherwise I don't care what level someone is or even if they don't share a card. I just fucking hate gun fu.
---
It‚Äôs tempting. Not sure yet. I want something to refresh gameplay any way possible.
---
Hey, whatever works. I tend to make so much food on the regular that I can easily rack up 40-50 fertilizer at a go.. I run carnivore and speed demon so I'm always eating meat and with super duper I'm always making more than I can eat. Prolific hunting and cooking is easy xp too.
---
Oh yes this post x1000 I personally holster my weapon to reset it to reload but either way it‚Äôs absolutely awful.  If it weren‚Äôt for the vats accuracy and damage output I wouldn‚Äôt put up with it
---
whats your queen gun? gat plasma?
---
This right here. Make them also be available from events or something, I don‚Äôt know, but only having them available from scrapping is not a good system at all.
---
lol yea
---
Bet. Give me your weapons and outfits or this is fake.
---
The game needs a lot of things beyond these, so its much less horrific in a l9t of regards
---
Yea it‚Äôs really not that bad, the worst challenges are things like find a bobblehead since that relies on a world spawn and nobody beating you to it. Last time it happened I spent more time server hopping trying to get one to spawn than any other daily
---
This is why I don't bother doing it anymore. It only takes one person to keep everyone safe. But instead of getting ore, people just kill. And since loot isn't shared, you get fucked.
---
Where is this even from? This seems like more datamined spoilers. 
---
"But I suppose it doesn't matter as the problem was presumably resolved by nuking the prime fissure site and killing the Queen, along with a viable vaccine for the plaque."
---
This is pure speculation at this point, the scorched have no actually been dealt with, and we have no idea what the intended canon ending is. 
---
"Wonder how the BOS will react to discovering that Elder Maxim's decision to NOT use nukes resulted in the deaths of the entire human population of West Virginia?"
---
Again, pure speculation. We have zero information that informs us that nuking the prime fissure results in the end of the scorched, just a queen, and we are not even sure if there are other queens, if another scorchbeast steps up into the role, or if Bethesda even intends to acknowledge it canonically. 
---
The fact that we are still collecting DNA for the machines at VTU as a daily quest shouldn't be overlooked.
