I've been on a little over  a half hour and not had a problem on PS4 at all.

---
why don't u try buying all recipes for mutations and tell me if it cost a lot of caps then.
---
Ppl intentionally remove all caps to trash camps, just server hop and don't deal with the idiots
---
Do you still have the extra plans?
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; extremely watered down piss poor story
---
The best story in any fallout game.
---
Fool.
---
Not sure why you referenced your level when any level past 50 means nothing stat wise.
---
Automatics are the absolute weakest weapon in the game. Have you looked into how the damage reduction works?
---
With the datamining of the vaults, I don't think that counts as a joke
---
you can buy fusion generator plans from vendor..though i forget which vendor
---
I know, and it shouldn't be a high priority.  I could list 20 other things that I'd rather see first, but maybe it'll make it onto a to-do list for soon(tm).
---
Thank you all for the replies. 
---
I have been attacked by mole rats with mines strapped to them, they were with mole men.
---
But I've only seen it once, I dunno if it's super rare or if I just didn't catch it before.
---
&gt; It's not written or presented well you have to fill in a lot of the gaps yourself
---
How could someone using "Order of Mysteries" flair write that?
---
This sort of behavior makes me nuts, as do the gangs of folks who get enjoyment out of destroying your camp or following you around killing you after each spawn (because they are such a high level, what‚Äôs a little bounty). BUT there is this voice in my head that says... that‚Äôs what they wanted this game to be. They wanted the other humans you run into to be an accurate depiction of the other humans you‚Äôd run into if this was a real situation. You‚Äôd have those with tons of experience that want nothing more than to help, you‚Äôd have those that just want to be left alone, and you‚Äôd have those that are the biggest assholes you could imagine and make you want to just give up. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, that doesn‚Äôt make me want to play and be ok with the behaviors... but I try to see it as ‚Äúworking as designed.‚Äù
---
You can only activate 2 PlayStations. I cannot play on PC.
---
But it is well written, and I, personally, find it engaging.

---
I'm not sure but I think all the other fallout games are single player. So you could just play those. 
---
You guys are my favorite game developer but fix this heap of garbage. I cannot play on Xbox One without it FREEZING COMPLETELY! I am SO not happy with your performance and you best untuck yourselves. 
---
Side note, what's the name of the company that makes power armour?
---
&gt; I had so much hope in Bethesda.
---
why? 
---
can you name any other of their games that are not riddled with bugs?
---
Let us know your pen name so we know what to avoid.
---
[removed]
---
Except it‚Äôs not possible because you‚Äôre barred from pvp until level 5.
---
Nope happily married for a long time.
---
I however watched a couple friends go the route stated above. One was just pure greed on her part, green bag wedding and invited 350 Doctors and other professional she hardly knew would pay well.  
---
The other was so scared of her dad she knew the wedding would be hell, but it was her only way to get away from daddy.
---
sad
---
not really, glitching into a unreachable area is something that has happened in tons of games over the years.
---
Hahaha üòÄ
---
&gt; Also, you figure what happened with the scorchbeasts like 2 hours into the game, so there goes the mistery
---
So you completely missed the point of the story.  Well done.
---
Had this happen to me , I learned the lesson but fortunately the only way to put me down now it‚Äôs with melee and if you could get close to me ;) lol 
---
I have my assasin weapons ready at all times 
---
A little black powder rifle with 10% added damage to players and explosive bullet lol
---
Borderlands and Destiny are much more alike than Anthem and Borderlands/Destiny in my opinion but yeah... alright dude.
---
&gt; long-term, the micro-transaction model is the only viable means of making a profit off developing and supporting a game
---
it is for multiplayer. 
---
single player games only need to generate revenue once.   multiplayer, however has ongoing costs to deliver and that means it needs some form of ongoing income.  either a subscription like warcraft, or microtransactions like other games.
---
without ongoing revenue, there is little monetary incentive to keep servers up after the point of sale.
---
That's true, but I also thought the current FO76 storyline and setting isn't bad if you were to make it a single player game set during the time when everyone was still around.
---
I remember when games were a "one and done" with no continued development on that iteration. Bugs never got fixed. There was no such thing as a post launch patch. My first "console" was a Pong machine from Sears. My first computer was a Commodore 64. You don't know true frustration until you have spent HOURS typing in game code from a magazine only to have it not work because you missed a ; somewhere. 
---
I remember the ultimate "pay to win" microtransaction: dropping another quarter into the machine. 
---
I remember when developers gave away the first couple of levels for "free" via shareware. 
---
I remember the outrage when expansion packs became a "thing". 
---
I remember the outrage when microtransactions started.
---
I remember the outrage when pay to win became a thing.
---
I remember the loot box outrage.
---
I have forgotten more gaming history than most players these days have even known. 
---
I also know that gaming, like everything in life, has evolved. The development process has evolved. The release and maintenance process has evolved. You can either evolve with it, or you can be left behind. 
---
You didn't answer my question: If not for the Atom shop, how do you propose Bethesda keep the doors open and work continuing on future content?
---
Nobody has a gun to your head saying "buy these things". I've purchased everything I want from the Atom Shop with atoms earned in game. 
---
This is why you never trade with randoms
---
Killer work, as always. Super good edit, as well!
---
Who the fuck is going to trust them in the future with anything?  They TOTALLY fucked this up because let's just say that Starfield is great, works nice, super awesome game minimal bugs.......they WHY THE FUCK was Fallout 76 in such a shitty state?  They painted themselves into a corner.......
---
Because it doesn't change anything for people who are afraid of being murdered. Pacifist means that you won't hurt someone else. It does not save you from other players. 
---
Offline multiplayer???
---
I lost my decontamination shower from my learned recipes and after two ticket returns from bots I just gave up
---
To nuke the scorchbeast queen eternally? Damn, silly me
---
The army
---
That suuuuucks
---
Lol I really enjoy seeing how many bases I can level with less than 100c in my wallet before someone claims my ‚Äú1000c‚Äù bounty 
---
Except you find them lying around
---
Maybe
---
Still don‚Äôt understand bro
---
&gt; you have pored a lot of your own money into it. 
---
Poured.  Does money come out of your pores?
---
Not a problem. Just find it funny. ;)
---
IRK? I need a trade condom.
---
Yeah they'll try to 'splain it away but ffs multiplayer was around for a long long long time and everyfuckingbody can make it work, they even own an IP Quake which has awesome multiplayer.....so no excuses, flat out money grab and they are counting on game players being bored with short memories.....
---
Thank you.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one.

---
They've said little of value, usually just "ill pass it along, keep the feedback coming" copypasta.
---
OP is talking about official communication with *answers* directly from Bethesda.  There has been precious little of that.
---
I kill scorchbeast regularly with deathclaw gauntlets non-PA.  About 5 secs once on the ground.  Heard you can them on the ground with explosive bait.  Going to try that
---
Saw a YouTube video where I he conspiracy is they did this on purpose so they could justify it in front of the board of directors as a reason for a bigger budget so they could hire more staff 
---
I have noticed for gums that break quicker like energy...Guass for me....that it activates way less than longer life weapons for sure. Great logic.
---
&gt; New Vegas was patched up by Obsidian and modders
---
Some quests broken by Obsidian's patches still don't work today on PS4. 
---
Sorry, they haven‚Äôt gone full P2W yet. 
---
crippled limbs?
---
Because at level 250 he's seen some shit, but this lowbie was still able to surprise him.
---
Context matters.
---
I would love a single player story set on this map, the map is really cool, but there is no much to do
---
Don't forget about the guy last week who got 5K+ Karma for an I quit post that literally told the developers to shut the game down.
---
Possible addiction that you're unaware of?
---
This makes me so happy. Its how id wanna go.
---
Well, let's say it's like GTA that made what, $800M first few days or something?  Can they not put some of that in the bank to make interest to buy more salaries development or does everyone over there make $10M a year in salary and $800M just buys them 2 yrs of time?  Maybe I just don't get it but jeeezus give me $800M and I will ensure "it just works"!
---
Couldn‚Äôt be. I have Rank 3 Adamantium Skelton 
---
Google "share PS4 account". My console is set as a secondary device. You can only stream from primary location.
---
Ooo hmmm maybe alcohol. Wouldn‚Äôt it say?
---
Have you been hitting scrap all with bulk in your inventory? It scraps bulk now. Much worse than not automatically unbulking junk for crafting
---
afaik, after 50 you get the choice of a perk card, or moving one of the special points
---
so if a mod needs a perk, take that perk card, then i'd imagine its all card juggling to get the effect you want
---
I agree that it's slightly annoying, but it's not the end of the world.  Fusion cores are common enough (even for a lowbie that's equipping their first chassis and raider parts), last a long time even without any perk investment and it's not terribly hard to see that your current core is about to burn out, step out at your earliest convenience and swap out your lowest core.  You're still going to clear out an area at 3x the speed of a sniper while being in no real danger with a power armor build.
---
I'm much more bothered that Portable Power perk doesn't reduce the weight of fusion cores.  When I'm wearing my suit all the pieces are weightless, so the perk provides no real benefit unless you're carrying dozens of frames around.  My other character, a stealth sniper, has 40 lbs between his two rifles, not to mention whatever his armor and underarmor weighs even with the two ranks of Sturdy Frame.  With three ranks of Martial Artist, I could carry 5 different super sledges for the same weight, plus I get the benefit of faster swing speed.  I think my base carry weight as a power armor melee is barely over 100 lbs, with close to 350 carry weight.  I have three ranks of Thru-Hiker for weight reduction.  My sniper has a base max carry of 175 and walks around at about 110 with the bare necessities, including maxed rank Sturdy Frame and Traveling Pharmacy.
---
Yes both these bugs are driving me crazy.....esp go to jump and nothing.
---
SP or MP, the game would‚Äôve been much better as V76 residents that never made it inside. A great story happened while our toon were locked away; now it‚Äôs just a shitty post mortem.

I was worried you were going to think me an asshole for laughing, but never mind. +1 upvote and some poor people gold üåüüèÖü•á
---
That's why it would be set in the past just a year after the bombs fell, when everyone was still around. Factions to do things for, NPC's to interact with.
---
What a unique and original idea.
---
They didn‚Äôt when I did. That was one underwhelming ‚Äúfirst nuke‚Äù experience. 
---
No they don't fill the same role, they could but they don't. Codsworth in fallout 4 has more life and dialogue than every npc in fallout 76 combined. The npcs in 76 are lifeless statues that repeat the same single line over and over. It just shows how incredibly lazy they were with 76, if they could have at least made the robots interactive like they were in fallout 4 it would have made a big difference.
---
It might not. I found this one reddit post where someone was suffering from something for no reason, or some shit, one guy told him to take an addictol, and that apparently solved it. Take one just in case. Who knows at this point.
---
You mean if they had done what they did with New Vegas and actually give us a stand alone game?  
---
God I would have loved that. I really like Appalachia, and I love the whole concept. This is right after the bombs fell. We've got crazy monsters that mutated and won't survive for longer than a generation, but that's long enough for you to have to deal with them. And you still would have to deal with the remnants of the old world. Nut job military groups not associated with the BoS who decide to take over a region using some repaired Power Armor suits, ghouls starting to get organized and realizing what they've become.   
---
It'd be awesome.   
---
But we got a mostly empty zombie game with a Fallout skin over it. 
---
That's some bullshit
---
Point 1 - Yeah. PvP is just kind of there. Its someones pet project (probably Todds, watch the NoClip and notice who the only one who talks about it is).
---
Point 3 - Also true. Though its not silence per say. No Mans Sky did the silent thing and vanished for several months. But eventually turned out to have been busting their asses and earned something of a redemption story. Bethesda hasn't been silent in the same way, they've dropped patches, and what they do or don't fix has spoken for them (and of course, the omnipresent and uninterrupted slew of Atom shop goods vs ... any actual content speaks volumes).
---
Point 2 is a bit murky. Its a survival game, and employs a different style of story, and storytelling then an RPG. Its much more based in environmental storytelling and a sense of mystery/horror then the interactions and politics of the other Fallouts. Its not spectacular, but its probably slightly above average when you start comparing it in its genre with Subanutica, Ark, Conan, the Forest, Minecraft, et al (other then possibly Conan, it also murders most of those as "NPC count" goes).
---
The particular downfall of the story is a generally poor end resolution. Well, it also does the Bethesda gimmick of sending you on a faction tour where you join everyone regardless of personal choice, logic or reason. But that was also in Fallout 4, and to a lesser extent Skyrim. Anyhow, the ending is just kind of flat. Nuke's are just throwaway minor inconveniences as portrayed ingame, which makes the final Overseer message look pointlessly silly. The final boss fight is pretty lackluster, with a far better boss encounter being the Scorchbeast King at the end of the Brotherhood chapter (complete with its own proper dungeon full of lore and endgame crafting materials, go figure)
---
200 caps per mutation is a great deal!
---
he might be somewhere near but still outside your camp zone, I live on a cliffside and whenever I tame anything they go to my camp for a second than teleport themselves down to the base of the cliff outside my green circle and just stand there. it's pretty depressing as I got super excited when I learned about taming and spent a lot of time trying to find a cool pet, only for them to never even set foot in my base for more than half a second :(
---
I had that happen to me three different times this week. My rad meter didn't move at all
---
Im gonna start a new character!!!
---
Twice today on XB1
---
This is part of why I have 20 cores on me right now, and 20 in the stash. 
---
I didn't wanna "waste" the atoms. I feel dumb down. 
---
As much as I would love for them to re-release a version of the game where they turn the game clock back to just after the bombs fell and let us live that story through our character, I think it is too much effort, and it feels like the current game is tottering along waiting to die.
---
I used to believe that but Ive come across one that I haven't looted yet that had 6 different crafting plans. But fair point. Should default down to flatwoods instead of the oversears first camp
---
Thundercats! Ho!
---
Raiders in this game are something, for sure. Some are absolute pussies, while others are tactical geniuses. 
---
Read this one reddit post where a low-level wanted to trade with someone, and after that, tried to PVP, and while that happened, some lvl 200 guy came over and killed the OP. Turns out, the low-level was scouting the guys inventory for any good junk, and whenever OP attacked back, PVP was engaged between him and the low-levels squad, allowing the lvl 200 to kill him, and get the junk.
---
That or set in the future like in lone wanderer or even the chosen one era
---
I had 2 level 2's keep coming and engaging me in combat the other day. I'm level 80+. Again and again they came. Not sure what they were doing. Eventually I stripped off my armor and used my fists but it still wasnt fair. 
---
The turrets are just broken in the game, along with spotlights, I feel like keeping them up is more a roleplay thing at this point then anything else. 
---
I had some minimal luck with the ‚Äúring of plants‚Äù system, where you plant crops all around your base right along the buildable edge.  The idea is enemy‚Äôs will attack those, at some point it‚Äôll count as damage and the turret will wake up and help.  
---
Agreed, the ‚Äúplease bring back the broken weapons‚Äù shit has been non stop. 
---
That‚Äôs just being old. 
---
Looking at different vendors for an addictol now..
---
Yup, like I said -- missed the point.
---
You are absolutely 100% spot on about this.   
---
It's sadly why I uninstalled the game. I told myself I'd wait until they either fixed it or released the private server/mod functionality. That way I could mod it and just play with a few friends on our own.   
---
But now it turns out they're reneging on both of those promises. 
---
"But we got a mostly empty zombie game with a Fallout skin over it."
---
Haha, harsh but kinda true.
---
Nothing wrong with that. 
---
Is your base located in either of these spots? Charlestown station or whitespring grounds
---
K then enlighten me
---
I‚Äôve had a lot of people try PVP on me, and even got chased by a group of seven with power armor on fresh out of the vault(this was before I knew about the minimal level to pvp) 
---
So I get why they run. I don‚Äôt run anymore because I leave every scrap of junk at my place and bulk it ASAP. But I totally get why they run.
---
That being said, I love when newbies wanna team up with me because I love helping little baby characters. Like aww, they‚Äôre so cute in their little vault suit.  Let me give you some food and purified water. Mama‚Äôs here.
---
Hmm, interesting, can you give some directions? Guess it's an unmarked location?
---
Sure, but this map is a thing of glory. I‚Äôd pay $60 all over again for a real game set in it. Though I‚Äôd probably only buy it from a studio that hasn‚Äôt consistently blown syphilitic goats...BGS would have to license the assets to someone worth taking a chance on.
---
Suck less bro
---
Ya, it is.  It's right under a huge 4 post electric tower. It's northeast of harpers fairy.
---
You mean level A hazmat suit, real world suits are designated by letters.
---
Yeah...I did this a few days ago. Making my rounds, selling down my inventory to get some weight space back, I bulked a bunch of junk to sell. Headed in to the enclave bunker, out of habit grabbed the junk on the way in to the vendor. Hit the stupid vendor is busy screen even though I was the only one in there, so ran around the room collecting the rest of the junk, hit the weapons bench and hit scrap all. Went back to modus to sell my bulk, and had none. Final straw for me. I've just been killing time in game waiting for something new to do, but that was it. Haven't logged back on since. 
---
ok got me....spelling guru!
---
Proof super mutants were human once :) 
---
Well it seems people who still find this game fun probably are the types who wear helmets indoors.
---
I've had people asking me for trade and it took me 'till yesterday to work out how to start it.  Sorry guys,
---
Yeah I usually just reload until my CAMP appears. It‚Äôs been appearing less and less though ever since the update. There will be nothing in the way and no one nearby and it won‚Äôt show up.
---
It is, way at the south end of Whitespring. But it started when I helped him defend his workshop. No idea why he spent all game attacking me, especially since pacifist was on lol
---
That would be too far I feel when things would have deteriorated further and everything feels like a myth. They already have the lore for the years after the bombs fell. Now flesh it out by giving us the NPC's in the notes and logs, but alive in the world.
---
I don't care about immersion. Only whether it's a cumbersome system or not. I believe this person's post is on point. How Bethesda gets it done, I don't care. 
---
That really sucks, is it possible to complete though?
---
Woah woah woah... is that how fast fast travel is on PC?
---
lmao
---
Aaah, gotcha. Thought you meant some other place maybe.
---
False actually - because of level scaling, he‚Äôs actually weaker versus a lvl 12.
---
* Build your camp somewhere close to the center of the map. Drastically cuts down on fast travel costs.  
---
* While pursuing the main quest you will run into areas that you are hopelessly underleveled for. Grinding events, capturing workshops, and doing sire quests is a good way to level past those gaps while still playing the game normally.  
---
* Plan your build. Google fallout 76 build planners; it makes a world of difference to have a solid roadmap.
---
Good point
---
Man! What I look like? A charity case?
---
Have you tried logging out and then logging in of your psn account?
---
How is radworms not hotfixed yet? Did the 1 remaining intern who is still working on this game slip and fall?!
---
Do you have a Bethesda account? I played F4 on PS4 and F76 immediately recognised my account without needing to input a password. I have no idea what a player without an account would experience when launching the game.
---
It's equally infuriating that people with no experience are also claiming it's a lot harder than it actually is. Testing definitely is the hardest part though, there's no denying that, anyone that's worked in programming knows that no software is 'bug-free' and that when your software gets into a client's hands they'll do stuff with it you never could have accounted for. In the same vein it also has to be said that by this point in the life-cycle of the game, testing things like balance should be down to a science. We're not talking about adding new content, which would be a totally different story. Austin have had the whole development of the game and a few months/updates thereafter to get their head around the tools at their disposal in terms of testing, and if those aren't fit for purpose, then I'd probably be content to see them take a few weeks off and get that all together. A few weeks with no updates but faster update production in the future. 
---
I think they did at one point mention that it is a quality of life item that is on their radar. Ive been dropping cores on the ground when its down to 10% or less to free up some weight
---
yeah, because it's a video game and his stats haven't changed past level 50. Someone better at FPS games than you could beat you.
---
There‚Äôs some good junk out there
---
Shitty game development that makes comments like this one true is cancer.
---
a random chem is a spawn beside a chair in the Tyler County Fairgrounds, I've got maybe 25-30 addictol I've never used from that spawn alone. seems to be Addictol/Rad-X mostly 
---
In my opinion they should've made the perk and level up menu only accessible when in a bed.
---
It would add an immersive way to level up like TESIV Oblivion. It would've prevented swapping perk cards out as you describe. You would have to plan your trips ahead of time. It would push players to use their camps properly and maybe seek out other players' camps.
---
Even now there's a mod to press a button to switch your perk card loadout which arguably can give an unfair advantage as perk-swapping can be so important.
---
You're right that being able to swap them only takes away from the game. Skill requirements are meaningless when you can just so easily hot swap them. You can wail on a flying scorchbeast with heavy weapons then quickly switch to melee when a scorchbeast lands. Was that supposed to be part of the game?
---
I like being able to swap perks but there should've been restrictions on it. Limiting it to when you're sleeping is in my opinion the best way. It's good that we don't need sleep but it'd be immersive to make us do it every once in a while.
---
GFY
---
Its my favorite location but it is out of the way. Maybe you would like it!
---
I love talking to people I meet! I never know if they can hear me, but I usually tell them their armor is neat, or their camp looks great, and ask if they want any stimpacks or purified water. No one has ever answered, but they take the supplies anyways. 
---
Now their game is $11.99 a few months after release.
---
sounds like an Australian saying he's going to revive someone in-game 
---
Pretty much. They had the code in there to implement loot box "lunchboxes" in the game and cut it. We've seen the remnants of that code.  
---
They probably cut it after EA got them literally made ILLEGAL in Europe after Star Wars Battlefront 2 crapped the bed. The perk cards also look like they would have been a DLC money-sink but got that aspect of them pulled back. There's really no way to monetize the game on the DLC side at this point aside from either selling crap on the Atom Store, or going back on that promise that future DLC would be free.  
---
From what people have been able to piece together, Fallout 76 sales were abysmal. Probably due to word of mouth after the BETA showed people what it was going to be. 
---
Hi there! I found that after Level 50 it was time to start really working on my build. I bought the serums for the Mutations I wanted, Farmed for Armor, built up my selection of Underarmor, found a more centrally located CAMP, crafted X-01, Ultracite, Excavator, and T-51 with Nuka Cola, ( a girl's gotta have fashion choices) and Cap Collecting. 
---
Level 50 was my starting point to tighten things up and my Character is currently using Unyielding Armor to help me farm for 3* weapons.
---
I went to about level 80 in the Mistress Garb, then to Weightless Armor.
---
I realised that my toons progression is fluid and to not get to hung up on things because I could always min-max by crafting different level versions of my Perk Cards - for example during the 'day' I slot in Adrenaline R5 but at night I slot in Adrenaline R2 with Mr. Sandman.
---
Honestly their storyline is the only good one there, extremely good in fact but it's hard to see a diamond under a sea of shite. Hell most people don't even know the Enclave made the scorched plague, super mutants, and liberators (released I mean) because it's all so secondary and only covered briefly by holotape recordings. I'm not saying that spoon feeding plot to people is good because it's not but previous titles would have at least used that knowledge to do something interesting. Either turning against the Enclave or confronting MODUS or something but nope, all we get is very vague incomplete info insinuating they did it and then our character is perfectly fine with that and keeps on working for every faction at once.
---
No sniping with a gauss rifle? Batteries included reduces core weight since its considered ammo
---
Not exclusively but it does certainly affect high levelled more than the rest. 
---
Stop running! Why won‚Äôt you let me love you!!
---
-screams the half naked man with the chainsaw
---
It's kind of like they have the map, the assets, the lore, they are just missing the NPC's from the factions and all the quests and dialogue etc from such NPC's. I'm not a modder so I have no idea what the level of effort and time is to realise such a thing across the whole map. I would have probably paid up again for that game too.
---
&gt; I, personally, find it engaging.
---
Fine, good for you. Most people don't.
---
&gt;But it is well written
---
Objectively speaking it isn't. There's next to no direct player engagement or visual/cinematic elements, suspense or emotional strongpoints. The literal writing itself is also piss-poor, mainly composed of poorly written and passably voice acted logs written from the first person perspective.
---
Most objectionably it relies on the player *removing* themselves from the gameplay to focus on terminal entries, notes or audiologs. Ever heard of the phrase "show, don't tell"? All fo76 does is tell, and it gets old real fast.
---
Nah. They are going microtransaction crazy and don't understand what it is they're selling. That's why they're selling blue armor skins for $20. They think this is Fortnight instead of a failing survival game.   
---
This garbage made the F4 creation club content look sanely priced in comparison. At least with CC you knew the creators were getting some credit for their work. 
---
Heading there now. And it does appear to be alcohol.. had some whiskey ;)

better then the current state i guess. i will try that.
---
Just do the power up posieden quest. You get generator plans every time. 
---
&gt;stop acting like the people who dislike the game are an oppressed minority.
---
Relatively speaking on this sub they are.
---
my highest bounty was over 9000
---
Last patch added so many bugs including bugs we never had before
---
\-luigi?
---
I HATE the charge on the Gauss.  I'd rather just pull a trigger.
---
Thanks for the tip on Batteries Included!!!!
---
enclave vendor is always busy...sometime i have to wait 2 minutes....wtf
---
BULL SHIT
---
Not really bro. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called junk 
---
Iv been wondering about this I had a level 4 but only had 2 skills on
---
They‚Äôre missing excellent (for 76, any) development and implantation of story/RPG elements. Maybe they could sell the whole mess to CD Projekt Red
---
I was sitting on a bench outside the Charleston station while I was eating dinner and watched some level 12 in power armor crouch sneak up to me, kind of do the check to see if I was AFK or not (turning character head, etc) and then pull out his hunting rifle and proceed to pick me off. after he killed me I watched him circle around my body for maybe 3-4 mins looking for a loot bag (dropped junk in the stash just before) then go into the station to do his business. so I made use of sneak and shadowed armor and laid a bunch of landmines at both exits of the station. he walked over them but survived because I was in pacifist, but he followed me down to hunt the grafton monster under the bridge and decided to initiate pvp so I switched to my lowest tier weapon and 1v1 level 12 vs level 78 (at the time) 
---
i live near a fissure site... I hope he didn't go for a swim in scortch beast's pool. I will look around the area, see if he could be stuck in something nearby.
---
One man‚Äôs trash is another man‚Äôs treasure. 
---
I noticed this recently... not sure if it‚Äôs a bug introduced in the last patch or if there‚Äôs a hidden perk somewhere. I do have some leather with lockpicking skill, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I wasn‚Äôt wearing it at the time.
---
I have a Dog Helmet in my Stash awaiting the Day my Dogmeat comes home!

they haven't made a peep on almost ANY change that is the most direclty obvious + needed + indicated by existing design, with the exception just now by asking what objects we want to dispaly (ALL OF THEM, WE WANT TO STOP EATING EVERYTHING AND MAKE EVERYTHING WE USE AN ITEM THAT IS ADDED TO CAMP BUILD AND PERK OPTIONS except if it is overtly FOOD/DRINK, for everything else we want containers that will serve organizational and display functionalities, IE a snack vending machine, bobblehead case, chem fridge, armor pedestal.
---
I've had a ton of fun meeting friends who no longer are logged on any time I try to hop on for a few hours of wasteland wandering. I think if things like the perk card and action bars UI customization, fixes for bloat / usability hitches had even been MENTIONED or partially implemented already maybe they'd still be around. These are really obvious small finishes to the game that are needed with these UIs, trading streamlining, a finishing touch to the placeholder feeling drop/death bags and trading screen, and a system for teams to level up and gain levels, perks, and co operative builds, a more permanent impact on each other and the world and other players, containers to help do this and streamline item giveaway/treasure hiding.   
---
Instead all that;s being done is an array of changes that seem to have nothing to do with the game's most central and frustrating aspects that are unfinished and awkward. I had faith they would hear the community and get directly on the items that are most vital and fitting with the state of the game it launched to us in. I have yet to see them step up to that plate. Anxiously waiting, I will wait because there is no other fallout, this is the dimension of gaming that made me. I'll participate, it's just not finished right now and I want to see them be influenced by the reality of the game's needs right now. It would thrive so hard once opened to basic modding to the UI in the current live game and with a Steam workshop type of more comprehensive modding/custom game experience driven forward by the most passionate creative fans of the fallout universe.
---
My theory is they're going to throw Bethesda Austin under the bus HARD on this one. It was their baby and they screwed up. If they don't find a scapegoat fast, then the Starfield pre-orders are going to plummet.   
---
Hell, they made Todd look like Peter Molyneux. He's going to want a head on a platter after this. 
---
People don't judge a failing game because they can't get refunds (unless its a massive failure like 76 is turning into). Instead, they punish the NEXT game out by that studio. Because the bad game killed their trust in the studio.  
---
Borderlands cannot be cloned.
---
This is awesome, wish I could have witnessed in person XD
---
yeah this is happening all over but especially when there are a lot of bodies to loot. I‚Äôve tested with events and lone kills. the wait is definitely a drag‚Äî  it has only happened since last patch. i submitted bug report.
---
I don‚Äôt think so because they are a pretty common drop from the sbq. They are expensive yo build and repair though. 
---
Oh yeah, same with jetpacks and other mods that t51b x01 and t60 have, they all need a lot more skins asap a lot of people are already leaving the game and theyve had maybe 5 or 6 in the as plus the other two or 3 in game it's a joke they should've had the ones standard in 4 in by default
---
Scorchbeast stole that move from the dragons of Skyrim. Amazing.
---
I would say 500 to 1000 caps. I paid 1000 a while back. Definitely,  worth a post, but do not go crazy...lol
---
yup..that happened to me..all my stats were in the minus..took 3 addictol and a couple of disease cure and i was smiling again..sux that it doesnt list these debuffs in the effects menu...
---
Why three? 
---
The top posts of all time beg to differ
---
&gt; multiplayer, however has ongoing costs to deliver and that means it needs some form of ongoing income. either a subscription like warcraft ...
---
Precisely. 
---
People will pay for what delivers value to them; this is the beauty of capitalism, in that after every voluntary transaction, each party ends up with something he values more highly than that which he gave away, and thus is wealth, in the aggregate, created.
---
But there are many ways to skin that cat. Subscriptions ‚Äî for all kinds of things that are valuable because they continue delivering interesting content over time, including not just WoW but much more traditional business models, like periodicals ‚Äî are a time-proven method. Micro-transactions are a relatively new but extremely faddish model.
---
Many people, including me, find micro-transaction funding to be off-putting, for a variety of reasons, and we prefer instead the economic clarity of "another $10/month" (or whatever): Is this game worth that? WoW is *still* making good subscription money off people for whom the answer again this month is "Yes!"
---
Many people, including marketers, also believe that micro-transactions are inherently exploitative of the easily confused and duped, the economically immature; they are, like public lotteries, essentially a tax on stupid people. And from one point of (pompous) view, that's a feature, not a bug, because it spreads the cost disproportionately upon those people. If you're willing to pay Bethesda $250 for icons and costumes and floor tiles, I'm delighted for you to do so; I shan't, but if your doing so makes the continued development and ongoing support of the game financially feasible, to my indirect benefit, then I really hope you like your Santa Tuxedo or whatever.
---
The Atom Store model, though, is the worst of all worlds. On the one hand, it tries to maximize the sizzle and razzle-dazzle to drive up demand and, thus, prices and sales. On the other, it's supposedly only for eye-candy, bling that doesn't give an in-game advantage or, more specifically, generate a negative reaction along the lines of "I just got my butt kicked, or was otherwise totally outclassed, by a moron with a credit card."
---
I'd rather Bethesda concentrate on actually trying to make this game achieve its potential, instead of killing the franchise with an unfinished product poorly supported.
---
Anyway, thanks for the thoughtful interaction.
---
I scream into my mic "PLEASE DON'T KILL ME" 
---
Related to that, suddenly I can't find a fusion core, even with the scrounger perk enabled. 
---
Some of us are too fat to move without it...
---
I had to log in and out of psn 
---
What I don't get is how a game like Conan Exiles can give you pretty much unlimited storage, build pretty much anywhere with no base size limit, and better pvp than f76.
---
Wrong. There are NPCs. They're all dead.   
---
And they're not dead from the war or radiation. No, they're all dead because zombies killed them 4 days before you show up. This isn't a wasteland. This is a thriving region that has NO POPULATION. We're not rebuilding the region after the war. IT'S BEEN REBUILT SINCE THE WAR!   
---
It's almost like they built the map and intended for their to be all these NPCs and factions, but rushed the game to market and came up with a BS excuse involving zombies.
---
if you have radworms it buffs stats like this. cure the radworms and try again 
---
I think it's a "new bug" noticed it every time I picked a lock today, in or out of power armor, 1 perk card or 3, it always showed +1 level more then equipped (and no bobble head).  
---
  
---
I did have radworms, wonder if this is another related bug
---
Ive noticed this as well. Another thing Ive noticed is a month ago, I would only be on servers with people from the eastern half of US. Recently talked to a guy from Nova Scotia and another from UK. Not sure if this is new due to limited players, or has always been like this.
---
Good to know at least this is an option
---
Yeah, it's a pity... The southern part of the Mire is not that far from Watoga and Whitespring though.    
---
Good enough for now.
---
I do, but I have a feeling it's a highly popular spot. 
---
Oh I hate cazadors! That would be bad ass if they did that. And some centaurs and geckos too.
---
If you wanna PvP troll use pumpkin grenades with demo expert and grenadier
---
Don't worry in another 3 months this will be the headline of the next in the vault and month after that they will attempt to actually change it.
---
It happened to me yesterday after I chose master picklock for a perk.  I swapped out Glow Sight for lockpicking, and got a lvl 4 skill with only one card equipped.  No other lockpicking bonuses, unless I happened to eat a lockpicking bobblehead to get rid of the 1lb weight and forgot that it was active.
---
I have a sealed full set, codes and all...  
---
If your serious of course..
---
BINGO.  
---
It's like they built a beautiful world map, then ran out of time/money before they started to implement quest, npcs, and voice acting. 
---
I agree that the MG2 specifically is a weaker member of that family. 
---
*however*, try a 1* bloodied specimen with a prime receiver for size and it‚Äôll punch out at about 90 DPH. This will particularly be a problem with extreme DR enemies like SBQ‚Äôs or mirelurk queens, though the armor penetration perk will help make it a bit better. 
---
That said, if a (decked and perked out) LMG is all you‚Äôve got, and you can pierce your opponents armor (let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre mowing down glowing bloated ghouls), it‚Äôs fire rate and large mag will do good work for you, even if you need a few hits on each enemy. 
---
Check your stats. Probably diseased 
---
yes, you need to leave the server and rejoin
---
never used one myself OP. dilute your meds and they go forever when combined with Chemist and Super Duper 
---
Looks a bit like the Prometheus from Stargate SG1. I like it.
---
Yeah. The zombie survival genre is kinda dead these days.
---
Sad cringe
---
Hahah I cant even
---
I play on ps4
---
same here. on first play through i just rushed through.  then i was bored. when i started the second char i took my time, actually listened to the tapes, read the notes etc. And it is fun. 
---
Wow anything possible i guess lol
---
Yeah I'll **totally** share this with the team
---
Got any screws? :)
---
if you're talking about turrets, both of mine would be powered when I'd relog (they'd be moving back and forth, but no light). I'd have to rewire them attached to a different part of the building and move them back for them to work 
---
sugar pine, a few assaultrons
---
TSE, so OP. Needs to be nerfed, will fix the game. Oh wait hehe
---
it doesn't fit with the design. what would fit would be the option to store cards we aren't gonna equip, so we can bring it back when we find a gun or change our mind on how we are playing.
---
perhaps with the option to tag perk cards to be part of different groups stored / recalled at once, to switch between different sets of the cards that we've chosen could also work well.
---
I feel that equipping cards as it works now is a great system and does not need to be changed to have more complexity like passive only choices, equipping a card is what it is and should stay that way.
---
I do however feel that there is one lack in the perks as they are now- there are no special super powerful abilities. These exist in magazines and bobble head, but eating these is highly underwhelming. As it is special powerful abilities they should be added to the perk build as cards or a 2nd screen to manage which ones out of what we've found are equipped. A limited number are equippable at once and are all governed by long recharge times and limited time effects gained, whether that is an extra boost for an hour to two (perks affect this) or a heroic moment style 30-60 second boost
---
Have you tried picking up an item amongst a group on a table &amp; see the other items move/fall? That bug has been around since Morrowind.
---
Not the least bit surprised that your bug is still around. 
---
They didn't lie outright exactly.  
---
Bethesda Austin SCREWED UP this game after they failed with Battlecry.  
---
They had to cut out lootbox Lunchboxes after EA screwed up so hard those became ILLEGAL in Europe.   
---
Big Bethesda had to bring in 6 studios to cobble something functional together so they at least could sell this mess and get SOME money back.   
---
Though they did lie about like 50% of the functionality of this game before it came out. Anyone start a store where you sell the best steaks on your sever yet? 
---
Amen, I‚Äôve tried to give low levels care packages before and they run for the hills lol 
---
Nothing‚Äôs broken. It just becomes a weapon that switches better enemies faster and guns them down faster as automatics are intended. 
---
Using the mechanics an rpg offers you isn‚Äôt breaking the game, and rocking up into an rpg, refusing to engage with the proverbial ‚Äúputting armor in the armor slot before you got to battle‚Äù mechanic and then complaining about how weak you are because you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt min-max‚Äù isn‚Äôt how rpg‚Äôs are played. 
---
**First suggestion:**
---
Don't rush either to level or bypass content.  
---
There is a bug in the main quest if you get the holotapes out of order it can bug out and not advance further.  
---
Also the core of the game, story and all is in terminals, notes and Holotape, and the immersion is solid if you take your time and enjoy it.  
---
**Second suggestion:**  
---
Be patient, the servers have not been "restarted" in over a week and they have been a little laggy.   
---
Yes yes they are cloud based, but I think there is a 3rd layer controlling the cloud instances, because after a week things get a little wonky.  
---
    
---
**Last suggestion:**  
---
Make some friends,'going solo is fun, but especially some of the daily / event quests are allot more fun with a few people to help.
---
BTW what level are you / making a new character?   
---
I usually try to do a new player starter pack, nothing OP but having armor and weapons you can't accidently scrap keeps you from going insane when you scrap a badass non-legendary by accident.
---
Xbox or PS4?
---
Haha right!
---
What kind of story would Obsidian have come up with?
---
I like the banter, particularly of the raider vendors. 
---
Pretty garbage game design tbh. 
---
Just set the price at 25000 caps each
---
Powerfist, deathclaw gauntlet and moleminer gauntlet are all considered unarmed. 
---
Hmmm....that might also explain why glowing meat steaks and cranberry juice will sometimes restore way more hunger/thirst than they should.  I get radworms all the time, so I barely pay attention anymore.  Making new disease cures are way more effort than allowing a relatively benign disease to run it's course, so I tend to just roll with them unless I'm near the sulfur fountain or get something nasty like parasites, dysentery, blood worms or the blight.
---
This just happened to me for the first time today. At first I thought somehow there was a super mutant following me and then I saw the mole rat. I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing for a minute or so because it was so unexpected. 
---
Defenses, architecture, decoration: pick 2 (feels like pick 1.5).
---
There are a couple workarounds for no defense. 1. Locate your camp relatively close to fixed landmarks that need to instance a lot of enemy AI. You won‚Äôt get as many random encounters and the ones that come will be small.
---
2. Foundations and floors are indestructible. Another vid came out this week for stacking foundations. A 2-high foundation wall (or single height that is higher up than default snap) will keep non-player baddies at bay without repair expenses.
---
Hell yea. 
---
Some people claim workshops only to start pvp
---
Bloodied melee builds can do that
---
Right? Seems more than a little shady.
---
‚Äú...Don‚Äôt get any ideas... chump.‚Äù
---
He walked away 200+ caps richer that day I assume.
---
because i was told that 1 might cure only 1 disease..sometimes need more than 1..disease cure i mean not addictol
---
Yes!
---
Ive seen it in the whitesprings shopping area with the row of vendors but i dont remember which one. They all tend tp have the same individually appointed inventories and the extra claw seems to be random. Could be wrong but that was my experience when i looked for it. 
---
lol..i think they may have used a 50.cal
---
That was fast travel to where I already was on xbox. 
---
I love getting a bounty and fighting it off.
---
My handmade has 85 rounds in the drum mag and 82 damage with perks, not even maxed, while being full auto. Thing is a beast and does some real damage to the scorchbeast queen, pop an overdrive and things really start to pickup. Pretty funny that people have this same gun plus two shot and explosive and are complaining about the damage haha.
---
Watoga train station usually.
---
My guess is addiction, as the same thing has happened to me. Frowny face but no listed cause.   I used addictol and it fixed it.
---
i think she was killed before even landing
---
Did drinking the serums give them you proper?
---
Because the designer had two left hands like the song.
---
I‚Äôll always help low levels if they‚Äôre near me. Especially if they have a headset and are willing to talk to me. I‚Äôll give you ammo, food, purified water, magazines, bobbleheads etc. I‚Äôll help you with your challenges and/or achievements/trophies. I‚Äôll help you start and finish faction missions, launch nukes, run the queen and blast zones or help you if you‚Äôre stuck in a mission. 
---
However, if I‚Äôm farming in Whitesprings and you think I‚Äôm going to protect you by training everything over to me then just standing there hitting everything once from a distance, I will hunt you down and kill you. I‚Äôll take your stuff, follow you to your camp, then nuke it and then I‚Äôll watch it drop. Don‚Äôt test me. 
---
It happened because I hot this game and Christmas, my husband set up our characters and ran them BOTH around a bit. The first time I sat down and played... It DID happen. 
---
Oh fuck.....ive been scrapping down my bulked stuff hahhaahahh
---
If the effort and design that went into the world also went into the ‚Äúgame‚Äù , this would be a goty contender. 
---
I spawned in, died, and could only respawn at the whitesprings service entrance, which the game wouldn't allow since it was in a nuke zone. I couldn't even bring up the quit menu, so I had to alt+F4 and restart the game.
---
how was it already updated if you just bought it?
---
thanks for the info
---
It was the first time I played... My husband set up our characters. Geeze.. Like the 76 police out hereüòÇüö®üëÆ
---
Xbox
---
this game is for autistic socially awkward losers to make new friends at
---
Strangely when the game first came out I had it on Xbox and didn‚Äôt crash once, played for a week or so, I wanted to stay the same level as the people
---
I was playing with so I also bought it in PS4 and the crashes to blue screen I had on there was ridiculous, 3-4 times an hour sometimes more. I heard that the targeting hud for power armour could be the problem but I haven‚Äôt played since then but in my experience the PS4 was much worse for me and it always crashed at the worst possible time!
---
I will have to say the element I don‚Äôt like is joining a random group where a numbnut doesn‚Äôt have passive on and it pulls me into pvp where I get straight up killed without warning. Post scorchbeast queen takedown and losing the stable flux from that hurts my soul
---
the ‚Äúhey wanna be friends and not kill me?‚Äù doesnt seem too far off haha. i just try to talk to everyone i see and usually anyone who bothers to respond is no longer a threat
---
p.s. nice username haha ;)
---
No problem.  Hope it helps.  Cheers
---
So many plans and recipes could be yours if y'all stop being so fucking skiddish. I pack around so many R&amp;P waiting to bestow upon a noob but alas I had to toss them. Inventory space is a fickle bitch. 
---
I'd extend that protection to camps too, if your bounty exceeds your ability to pay.
---
I'd also add a small cap loss to the bounty system, like 20%, maybe only on large or repeated bounties, so that teammates can't clear each other's bounties for free after griefing a cap.
---
On the other hand, I think small bounties should expire after a while. Like a 10 cap bounty could expire after 10 minutes.
---
Or just discard the system entirely on PVE servers. You can't get a bounty if you can't grief in the first place.
---
I am curious why some mutations will work on that way (with dying) and some won‚Äôt. 
---
$60 for the last two months of having a blast playing. Yeah it was a good run. 
---
Find someone who looks at you like how author looks at Grahm
---
This game is a certified dumpster fire that should be put out of its misery asap. Sad times.
---
Yes. Same issues with 76 remains from fallout 4 sadly. Its the same game with added shit and other shit taken away. At its core, its Fo4... So thats why all the bugs are there still. 
---
I know this may be hard for your walnut-sized brain to comprehend, but a lot of people can do basic math without a calculator. :)
---
They need to watch the greatest showman to open their minds!
---
In a way it‚Äôs also like a very poorly made video game.
---
Well IMO they couldn't be different. In Athem guns are just filler basic damage, most DPS comes from spamming abilities. The opposite of Desitny.
---
Exactly why you should attempt to BE one of those people.
---
The flaw in your statements lies in the assumption that the 'post-release' content remains to be developed, and it's not - it's all complete and exists in the game files. It's common practice in the industry for post-release content to be completed for the actual game release to eliminate or reduce future development overhead and costs, and it's not uncommon for it to actually ship with the game and require activation later which is the case with Fallout 76. Even all the future Atom Shop content exists in your installation (a total of 1.9GB of it which is a *lot* more than is currently in the Atom Shop). 
---
There are even ways to activate some of this 'future' content - to prove my point, I did the upcoming 'Race For The Presidency' event a month ago and got myself the Presidential Power Armor, Presidential 'power' Suit and Presidential Gauss Rifle as well as gaining legit access to the Executive Suite in the Enclave Bunker - [https://postimg.cc/gallery/q7z7q0q0/](https://postimg.cc/gallery/q7z7q0q0/) (link will expire in 24 hours from this post to alleviate concerns).
---
The term 'post release' or 'new' content in the context of Fallout 76 refers only to content existing in the game that has not yet been activated server-side as it will be drip-fed over time - you already paid for it all with the $60 price tag, the monetization business model they use means all additional revenue beyond the game purchase goes straight to their bottom line - all content, current and future, was locked down in advance to eliminate future development costs and thus define the ceiling of total development budget. Your belief is inverted - this illusion of 'new' or 'post-release' content is to keep players coming back and spending, *not* the other way round as you state.
---
Rad Cat?
---
Kinda obvious that it's been referred to by that exact name from FO1 across all the games. It was FO4 that introduced that changeable model letter thing (and a honestly more represents rusted over).
---
"I'm not butthurt you're butthurt! I'm not ranting you're ranting! Unsubbing is really hard, I didn't even realize I'm subbed but I'm commenting on 76 anyway! I don't even care about this bad game but here I am!"
---
lol the only thing difficult to understand here is how upset you are yet you keep replying and talking about 76. You sound like a bad ex boyfriend that keeps online tabs after getting dumped. 
---
Just to make sure you're still full of it I checked on my phone and unsubbing is also still one button press. Not surprising you can't figure it out no matter the platform chief lolololol
---
3 explosive vents.
---
That is absolutely the correct term. Some should, but not all. I'd say that these cards should:
---
Lockpick
---
Hacker
---
Scrapper
---
Among others I'm forgetting.
---
Thank you üôèüèΩ 
---
i mean i'm not trying to upset the fan boys over broken game,but since you want to be a jerk  my  challenges hours are at 239   lv 143, we cant just keep kissing up to them. or they won't do anything
---
if you romanticize it like that, bethesda will take it that way and think it's okay to act this way  
---
k thanks
---
Legendary Wood is the new meta, apparently Bethesda is paying everyone back for farming White Springs for months 
---
[you mean this?](https://i.imgur.com/A7hhdjG.jpg)
---
good tips, i don't know why others have to be mean about it
---
The most hardcore of the trolling. Well played, Bethesda. 
---
I had an issue with a specific weapon that caused the weapons nerfing.  In my inventory, everything needed, put it back in my stash and restart, back to normal.
---
ya
---
The other big flaw... the grind
---
you want some of my junk? i have a lot, and i dont' care if i lose it all since i can just get them again in like 2 hours
---
15/3/8/4/5/10/11 - full on melee with a rifle as a backup. 4xUnyeilding armor, 4xSentinel, 1xChameleon. I only carry 2 weapons - bloodied/as/agi combat knife and bloodied/exp/50dr handmade.
---
I feel like you deserved it for trolling at the starting location.  Why not do it at Watoga or Whitesprings where you might actually have a challenge?  I don't bother with bounties on the map, because it's the 76 equivalent of clickbait.  99.9% of the time it's some jerk asking for aggro by attacking others or destroying a base with an invisible chameleon or power armor stealth boy mod teammate in the bushes waiting with a TSE Dragon or double barrel shotgun to instakill the defender.  Super lame, and totally exploiting the PvP system.
---
Resident. :) it was the Vault 76 security team‚Äôs nickname for us, per their terminal entries.
---
I'll trade you a box of 45 ammo!
---
Nah. Seen it several times now. It's before it lands. Heavy gun. How many queens land in the first 30 seconds for you ?
---
You do realize none of this is going to happen, right?
---
Man i haven't even seen that perk activate once.ever. I use shotgun and handmade on semi auto, it never procced.
---
&gt; **Finally, the biggest flaw is Bethesda's silence.** 
---
Amen.  When you see a game like Apex launch and they have years planned out and a damn near flawlessly launch you have to wonder what the hell is going on at Bethesda.
---
Personally some tips I have is with the current meta:
---
Anti-Armor hardened handmade for shotspamming sneak attacks/crits
---
Also a Gauss Rifle could be used but it would need the anti armor effect and explosive to really be viable (slow time to fire)
---
Sentinel or Chameleon armor depending on your survivabilty
---
The rifleman perks only need to be taken to rank 1 each, however using tank killer rank 3 is very advised
---
Max out vats crits related perks
---
Use sneak attacks however there is no need to take those perks that increase the multiplier
---
 Only time I can imagine a quad mirv fat man coming in handy. 
---
I use X-01 with Torso/Leg mods for the carry weight, I like to carry multiple weapons/ammo and a lot of aid so I can stay out of my camp for longer periods of time....the radiation protection is the only other real reason 
---
I have more of a problem with my reload speed returning to normal randomly.
---
Zealot‚Äôs exploding Primed 50cal heavies, And/or some VATS crit+automatic builds, maybe?
---
Clearly TSEs need more nerfing. Make them do 50% less damage than standard variants! 
---
You need to hoard about 80% less.
---
rofl, this requires video.
---
I like it!
---
With the game's current track record, it could be in the next fix while other shit is woefully broken, or three years down the line.
---
They were pretty rare early on but given they are a semi-common drop from the queen, supply is pretty high these days, probably not a lot of value. 
---
I'm on Xbox too
---
there is some weird state that scorched beast are in while climbing out of a fissure.
---
i can routinely one shot level 80s
---
I ignore Wanted players, since they usually get the tag accidentally in group events.
---
I've only read about others, thankfully, but I believe it can remove your pipboy and make your character completely unplayable.
---
Here's an example: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3o9el/psa_dont_use_more_than_15_treasure_maps_at_a_time/
---
 Haven‚Äôt even been one shotting monsters with my 3* TSE since the nerf....
---
I thought the same thing. Same shit, different game. 
---
That or a really badass mini gun. I've seen 3 different players that do it in less than a minute. 
---
Have they fixed the explosive bobble head stack exploit? I guess it could be possible with that bit still I don‚Äôt know 
---
This. Happened to me back in BETA, and I tried an Addictol on a hunch and problem solved!
---
I enjoy the world a lot. I enjoy the exploration. And as a straight male (not that it matters) I'm not even ashamed to admit that i like playing dress-up with my character, and decorating my camp. I think those aspects are really fun and relaxing. 
---
I find reading through terminals and listening to holotapes engaging (albeit depressing).
---
Then when I want some violence I can find something mutated and blow its freakin head off. The game's got something for everyone!
---
Unfortunately, I think most people expected more. They expected the full fallout RPG experience with NPC's and tangible effects on the world.... and didn't get it. And I honestly don't blame them. It is after all a fallout title!
---
But I knew what this game was going in, and I expected it. Do I want NPC's? Yeah it'd be cool if they could make it work. But honestly if I want the character driven story (as opposed to FOUND story in the world, notes/holos/corpses/etc), well there are other titles I can replay.
---
I think once the bugs are ironed out, it'll be a good game. Not everyone's cup of tea, but a good game... that appeals to very few people compared to the majority of the gaming population. Unfortunately I think this is the last multiplayer title BGS will attempt for a while. That or the last one they outsource... no offense devs. I just don't think BGS Austin was ready for this at all. (I'm sure they were given impossible deadlines and a lower than normal budget.)
---
‚ÄúI REGRET NOTHING‚Äù!
---
Good point. Idk the game just seemed like it had potential at first. Oh well.
---
Well...*someone* has to kill them. 
---
When they kill it this fast, I get nothing. No loot or event rewards. It sucks. 
---
They run as soon as they hear my power armor. I basically just go to the train station near the Poseidon plant and put stuff in suitcases üß≥. I guess they heard too many horror stories about getting whacked by high level players.
---
I've been in Wallace's trade menu while invisible for 15-20 minutes and he's continued talking to me the whole time. on xbone
---
Do the Minecraft thing and hide a lever that disarms your lava pit trap.
---
Wait for the modding scene to get off the ground :) 
---
I mean look you're the one that got mad and thought he had to argue with me. Dont feel good just because you projected some insecurities on me.
---
First you should put your platform on there. Second be more specific on what your looking for to go with the sentinel stat
---
What weapon do you use for destroying camps?
---
If you don't hear from anyone, drop it off in Flatwoods. I'm sure someone will appreciate it :) 
---
Its a free fast travel attracts attention its not to bother or exploit
---
If you're on PC - forget about it, no one will ever sell it for caps, let alone 5k. Dunno what's the economy like on the consoles.
---
I believe you missed my point; something HAD to be enjoyable about the game if you spent that many hours playing it. 
---
Is this game great? Fuck no. Is it beyond redemption? I don‚Äôt think anywhere near. 
---
this was today while I was eating breakfast. I've been [invisible all day btw](https://i.redd.it/yfgzd1o09tf21.png)
---
My advice? Run. Run as far and as fast as you can, and don't look back.
---
Nah, the server will dc and it will be lost into limbo 
---
A new Diablo announcement is going to come out before a new fo76 content announcement at this point.
---
Wait what?!?! That's crazy!! It isn't part of a workshop or camp.. üòñüòñüòñüòñ 
---
Do Pulse mines do extra damage to robot/PA in this game? I know it used to, but I that doesn't seem to be a thing in FO4, and I just assumed that carried over into 76.
---
lol thanks! cool, may i ask if there are unique weapons and armors like in previous fallout games? i love the atomic shop as well :)
---
How would you like to write my autobiography? üíÄüñ§
---
I don't mean drop on the ground. In like the overseer's stash or similar. 
---
doesnt matter but most people want sentinel+assasin for pvp. also desirable is sentinel/unyielding.
---
I've seen it plenty of times recently too. Probably either a Bloodied TSE/build or stacked Bobbleheads. 
---
I nabbed a couple hundred plastic after making a few rounds of the highschools and amusement parks. The highschools are especially nice because I can also get a lot of screws and a few springs while there 
---
&gt; is absolutely the correct term. Some should, but not all. I'd say that these cards should:
---
also, any perk you only have equipped while at a crafting bench (200% durability, science, home defense, etc)
---
300 hrs and still haven‚Äôt met the guy.....
---
In all seriousness, junk isn‚Äôt spawning for me in places I‚Äôve already visited and go back to(my camp was near Point Pleasant, and nothing spawned the next several times I went there, several days apart. I changed my camp to the other side of the map and went back and nothing.) I only get to play every few days, so I‚Äôm not a super high level or anything. So I genuinely need junk. 
---
Your trash is my treasure. 
---
Yes! There are unique weapons and armor given as rewards for quests. Then the legendary weapon/armor loot system from Fallout 4 returns as well. 
---
I'm hopeful and I really do love this franchise. What's stupid to me is that community managers don't respond to posts like mine. I'd love to hear your opinion
---
Works with all fist, can confirm as I just got Talons myself and the DMG spiked a good deal.  Go for Twisted Muscles if you can, my Deathclaw gauntlet can almost break 300 and I'm not even lvl 50 yet
---
cliff notes please OP
---
Harper's fairy and watoga train/phoenix, I think
---
Woah lol looks like someone's scrolling deep through posts
---
As a low level player people like you do 2 things. Scare the daylights out of me and warm my heart because it's hard to trust people in an online game when most of the high level players I run in to try to kill me. 
---
*Woah!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** paper_killa! ^(hug)
---
Hunter's won't work on SBQ - she's not an "animal". Furious is ok, but you lose damage switching targets.  Haven't played with AA. In general, my favourite was Gatling Gun. Cheap to maintain, cheap to craft ammo (ultracite too), good damage, low ammo consumption. All around a great weapon. 
---
Rude? No, just saying might wanna read the comment. Never said you were stupid. Or dumb, or should leave like most people would. So... Lol
---
Damn I thought stuff wasn‚Äôt random anymore 
---
What‚Äôs even more frustrating, there ARE unrequested supply drops that do not make you as wanted when you ‚Äústeal‚Äù from them, but I don‚Äôt know how to tell the difference.  
---
Yea thats why. Damage scaling is broken at higher lvls
---
On a barren highway, glitches in my hair...
---
I meant the mod. Don't think I ever seen a plan for it.
---

Twice in the span of an hour. (I'm on PS4) Trying to beat "I am become Death" quest and disconnected RIGHT before launching a nuke from Bravo after fighting my way to the control station solo.
---
Relogged, had to do the whole thing over but this time I was able to launch the nuke at the Whitesprings golf course.  Put on my hazmat and hoped to grind my way to 50 but game froze and crashed (the PSN blue screen came up to suggest report) again.  So no new nuke zone for me :(
---
I dunno...seems pretty normal to me.  Some of the nicest people I know wear strait jackets. 
---
Lack of communication, nerfs and changes that arent announced. Simple things. 
---
yep agreed!
---
Beth: Should we focus on Coop or PvP? MMMMMmmmmm
---

---
Metro exodus comes out soon!
---
Vats bloodied could do it i bet.
---
Overdrive+food+perks can push crits over 100% dmg.
---
I've actually traveled to several and asked if them if they'd like me to remove the bounty and will even stand by and guard their junk til they get back. I'm not a fan of pvp at all, but that's just me. 
---
what specific junk are you looking for?
---
lol define box
---
76 will get the Andromeda treatment 
---
1. Melee: Bloodied/Anti-armor + Faster Attack Speed Legendary. Range: Bloodied/Anti-armor + Explosive
---
2. Unyielding + Sentinel (Full Set)
---
3. You need more luck for mutations (starched genes + class freak), mutations like speed demon and marsupial, those are game changers. You might want to take bloody mess for extra damage, grim reaper's sprint for VATS. Also for Agility, if you are using guns that one-shot kill almost anything, GunFu is a must!
---
Lol I love this game 
---
Yepp. I'll just be more careful next time I guess... if you find a locked supply drop, pick it at your own risk friend!!
---
I need plastic so I can bulk everything up and make room in my stash box.
---
L2Paragraph.
---
Fam wanted game. Thought game might be shit. Game was shit. Fam disappointed. Stopped playing. Feel betrayed.  
---
Good enough?
---
Asks not to get banned, floods reddit with screenshots.

/golfclap
---
I often fast travel to v76 or the first overseer camp if I see a new player emerging, leave a paperbag full of goodies, ammo food and if I have lower level armour or weapons. I got a gift coming out first time so I decided to do it as well. The only thing I'm doing now is trying to get all mutations 2 left, after that maybe take a break. 
---
Hey bro are you selling assultron helmet plan? 
---
On Xbox embo14
---
Just moved from there lol. Not bad üëçüèª
---
Agreed. Thats where i see most bounties go to bait pvp. 
---
But shitty, shitty, dead games are fine. Gotcha.
---
After 50 is game on tho
---
No changes.
---
Maybe take notice more often. 
---
You carry 3x what my character has total. 
---
no 
---
yawn
---
tell your dad The Outer Worlds comes out soon. must be a good laugh for Obsidian because they are well known for producing the best story-driven fallout, them coming out with a new massive game this year and Bethesda flopping with this story-lacking experiment 
---
I'm more annoyed with spending 15 minutes or more being in perma-caution/danger with absolutely nothing around me and losing my healing factor effect.  That's why I started a melee alt last week, because my rifleman sniper took a nut shot with the TSE nerf and now has the gods cranking on those bruised eggs by randomly eliminating stealth and putting me into perma-\[danger\] for no apparent reason.
---
It's just vaguely annoying with a power armor/sledge build that might actually have to use a stimpak because my health doesn't regen to full after one-shotting through the entire golf club mob with a one star instigating super sledge that someone threw away, and moving on to the next mob without total impunity.  I guess it makes me want to hold on to more than 15 stimpaks at a time, if nothing else.  Really not great at all for a sniper.  My main character is basically useless at this point with gear he farmed for months, while my lvl 67 alt is crushing everything with a bottom tier legendary throwaway weapon and a T-51b suit with three lvl 50 pieces, two lvl 30 pieces and no mods.
---
HAHA lol! 
---
it does still have potential, i just don't know if Bethesda can utilize it well. 
---
the idea of a online-multiplayer Fallout is very old. there were plans for Interplay to make a Fallout MMO, after they sold the rights to Bethesda. but Interplay didn't put the work into it they were contractually obligated to do, and Bethesda took them to court over it. 
---
there's a reason ~~Black Isle~~, i'm sorry, Obsidian decided to make a new Fallout game. you're talking about a group of guys who wanted to make a Wasteland game, but couldn't so they created a new game just like Wasteland called Fallout. after they lost Fallout to Bethesda, they did New Vegas. now since they're not getting to do a follow up, they decided to make their own not-Fallout-but-still-just-like-Fallout game. 
---
the truth is, it'll be great. 
---
the other night farming legendaries i got a stalkers rolling pin, a hunters rolling pin AND a nocturnal rolling pin. i was not impressed. 
---
Fake
---
True story. I was there. 
---
They shouldn't until they fix duping
---
I think Bethesda is trying to convince you you have what it takes to open the first post-war bakery. 
---
He's aware of it. We're also both aware that it isn't multiplayer, which was the core selling point of FO76.
---
Agree.  I am trying to find/get as drop a Zealots Gatling gun. I plan to put a prime receiver on it. 
---
PVP is completely broken right now, I hope when they add PVP specific servers they just remove it for the PVE servers.   I think Friendly fire should have consequences so allow damage to the player, but the offender takes double damage or something to discourage griefing.
---
You going to be on tonight, need a silencer for lever action.
---
Its the ancestor of Rico Rodriguz (f*** you missile) 
---
I see you've been playing Fallout 76 recently.
---
The Army doesn't make anything themselves. They don't have the massive infrastructure needed to produce arms, armor, rations, ect. 
---
This is all contracted out to civilian corporations. 
---
West Tek
---
I appreciate the hell out of it, but think I‚Äôm just going to do the quest. Didn‚Äôt know the Powet Up Poseidon one gives them apparently, and I‚Äôve never tried it before and want to give it a go.
---
OP put about as much effort into this as BGS has put into fixing their shit as of late.
---
Upvote for you for matching their energy
---
why would that be your dad's core selling feature if he was a Fallout fan?  I have played all titles on release dates but this one, I didn't pay for my copy - it was gifted to me otherwise I had no intention of giving it any time. I'm glad someone gave it to me, for what I've experienced so far but I'd never pay for it on sale or not 
---
yes
---
Everyone needs some patience. Do you wa t a new main quest every 2 weeks? The game is 4 months old. DLC will come. Calm down
---
I just tested a pistol with anti armor modifications and it did not show any difference. A few months ago I tested an antiarmor handmade on a buddy of mine and it showed the effects of anti armor then. I dont know what to think now. Maybe it only shows against other players? Maybe mods dont show up? 
---
Also, I use an anti armor handmade and I love. Keep anti armor over vampire unless you have a tank build.
---
Are you in PA?  Under armor doesn‚Äôt work in PA.
---
Your other fellow high level bois have scarred me. I‚Äôm sorry for running
---
Gotcha so mods are still random
---
If they trigger before you die its fine.
---
Those little ticks after are the issue.
---
This post made my day. I wish I was there.
---
Always 3*.    Not always named ‚Äúsentinel.‚Äù
---
Honestly I think it should be a setting.  Allow you to set (in the settings) whether your armor will always pick the most, or the least, depleted core.
---
Can you please add Morolinith as a friend so I can see when your on?
---
Ironically the only one I care about is 25% less damage diseases, rest I just suffer through, but then again I use plague walker 
---
True story, I had heard some traders say it's still happening. 
---
awesome, having a ton of fun why is everyone bashing it?
---
You playing ps4? I got some stuff to unload, maybe you could use it.
---
To me the radio silence from the huckster Todd is amazing. Is he hiding under his desk sucking his thumb?  Nah, he‚Äôs laughing all the way to the bank with the dough he made on this pile is steaming crap. 
---
sure
---
Thanks. Very helpful. 
---
warm smell of grape mentats
---
Bethesda knew before E3 that 76 was in trouble, both in game and in pre orders. The confirmation that 76 was a bust came through in the BETA and shortly after the release sales numbers ( 2.4 million copies)  Fast forward to today and half if not more of those players have quit playing the game altogether. So it‚Äôs no surprise to me that Bethesda is being really quite on future support for 76. The reason is because there really won‚Äôt be any kind of major support for 76 due to it being a lost cause. Bethesda I‚Äôm sure is looking at 76 as a complete bust, a failed experiment that they are going to quietly sweep under the rug. After all all this game has done is divide the Fallout fanbase and send the franchise to an all time low for Bethesda. 
---
Shrug. Has worked fine for me. I like to help other players and hang onto stuff with which to help them. 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Fine, good for you. Most people don't.
---
when did we vote?
---
Was Googling regarding weight issues. 
---
Would've loved to see that replay.
---
How can one mine kill you? 
---
Ah right lol
---
don't think so. sorry
---
Yeah I've had one good and bad experience with higher players, one dropped some loot for my friend who was just starting out (I think I was like near lvl 10?) And the other time we came across an in world camp and I make gestures to show the player that's fine upon my friend and I that we're not gonna mess with them, and then they go on the attack. 
---
Of course, they kills both of us, but like congrats you got ten caps and my crap? Like what was your point? 
---
I just made a waiting room outside my door lol looks neat
---
Fucking raiders man, amirite?
---
You can‚Äôt stack bobble heads any longer. They fixed that in the last patch. 
---
Nope. Just in my usual apparel.
---
Yes. It‚Äôs fixed. 
---
The second someone touches my camp, I peace out on the server....douchebag trolls 
---
Many thanks
---
Lol people are even on this game with apex out? 
---
Nice...
---
Good
---
I‚Äôm at Level 49 now and only have had one good experience with a higher level,  a level 50 gave me at the time I was a level 25 a full raider power Armor. Very cool that kid. But I‚Äôve had  a ton of times just following a quest line and been kill at first sight of a higher level no warning,  or once cause I didn‚Äôt have a mic connected at the time. 
---
Now I carry the Daisy Chainer (low weight Fat man)and a few mini nukes just in case. Only had one time someone didn‚Äôt walk away and i blew us both up firing it point blank with a critical in Vats Lol.  While PvP can be fun it should be a choice no damage till both player shoot each other. 
---
What console ?
---
Considering you got the game for free, you're being extremely lenient in regards to what an absolutely shit show just about every aspect of the game has been,  
---
Considering you got the game for free, I am completely unsurprised.  
---
I can give some more cliff notes of the interaction that lead to the two of us buying the game, but again, as someone who got it for free, I'd be completely unsurprised since you didn't pay for this peace of shit. I mean, combined by family sunk about $200 into this piece of shit.  
---
Anyway, here's the summary.  
---
"Hey son, I really liked that Fallout 4! It was real good!"
---
"Yeh Dad I actually recommended New Vegas bu-"
---
"Hey I heard there's a new **multiplayer** Fallout comin' out! we could play it together!"
---
\[You consider the fact that you're able to see your Dad once a year if lucky\]  
---
\[Your brother happened to mention he was interested in it too\]
---
"Y-yeh, sounds good!"  
---
\[You purchased Fallout 76\]  
---
\[You feel buyer's remorse crawling up your spine\]
---
Nothing like bug-esda and they're "balanced" fighting
---
Pulse mines and grenades do MASSIVE damage to power armor been like that in all fallout  games I think.
---
I have a prime Zealots Minigun that shreds her, but not in 30 seconds. 
---
Damn that‚Äôs one catchy battlecry !!!!
---
Pumpkin grenades? Those are a thing?
---
They wouldn't have 5 stars in the UI if they didn't plan on having 4-5 star items in the future.
---
Was it Leroy Jenkins?
---
Master Race
---
at least you can see your dad and brother, free or not
---
how is this fake
---
I agree totally bankruptcy to s not enough
---
Does the fireproof perk mitigate damage from the pulse mines and grenades? 
---
Yep. 
---
You can have 2 shot or accuracy, pick one.
---
Huh.  Is it modded?  Mine is working.  +1 STR and +1 END, but I‚Äôm in and out of PA all day.  I guess I‚Äôll recheck it to make sure I‚Äôm not crazy.
---
I actually want a 3* drill...   
---
Vampires SwingSpeed drill would be awesome..  
---
People use TSE weapons. Brutally effective 
---
Always have protection my man. Lol
---
Been saying this about the first two since day one. Ridiculous that it isn‚Äôt. 
---
Its happening real bad haha 
---
Radiation and energy buffs on standard armor are broken due to an error on the armor records, so that won't add in
---
It already did. They at least tried on Andromeda for a little while. They gave up instantly for 76

I‚Äôm heavy weapons and it rarely procs for me. 
---
We just learned the plan and made the armor and noticed the stats weren't changing. Hopefully yours is working.
---
you can get around 60-100 plastic easy at morgantown high school each time you go there
---
That's what I'm trying to accomplish here.  ... I'm one of them. 
---
Just wish they would have shipped to us weirdos up in Canada
---
WHAT'S THAT SONNY? SPEAK UP!
---
Shut up.  Stupidest idea ever.
---
I'd be all over a bloodied or furious. Like a bloodied Mr handy buzz blade...people are sleeping on that weapon. 
---
I probably should have, but I was thinking of rebuilding my camp anyway. Plus I got to see someone get their Wanted bounty up to 315.
---
He absolutely deserved it, if it even happened. 
---
But this isn't the "ErroniusWrex and his dad and his brother" subreddit. This is the subreddit for the piece of shit we all wasted our money on.
---
They are! Check out the mission at the Pumpkin House for the recipe.
---
So for example Bolstering effect isn't working either?
---
Help me understand.  If I lower my luck, I get better legendary drops?
---
Imagine if it was single player with the exact same story BUT - you got to see them all as NPCs and watch them all die as you‚Äôre left being the last Appalachian 
---
Shiny!
---
Thanks fellow wasteland wanderer. 
---
Totally have had this since patch every log on had to travel a min before I could travel lol
---
you're right, but you took the amount of money I spent on the game and weighed it against its metapersonal toll on you personally, while using your family as peons. I'm telling you I'd give my copy and console and everything else up to tell my dad his fly's down once more, regardless if I got it for free or paid everything I owned (as some have to play the B.E.T.A.) 
---
Totally
---
I don't trade because if someone sees my inventory and assumes my stuff is stolen (it isn't) they might attack me. Also, trading is clunky.
---
Other players have a REALLY hard time killing you if you dont shoot back
---
Token ring? Wow. Those vampire taps probably explain the disconnects ... ;)
---
Most likely your client connects to the instance which just manages coordinating clients (put the scorched in the same place, etc) where some other more global controller manages updates such as trades, etc. The heavy lifting is client coordination with updates/checkpoints/snapshots getting proxied elsewhere. A lot of things seem to make this much further round trip. As a couple of examples, when you repair armor with Fix It Good there's a pretty big lag while it seems to validate and update. Disarming traps seems to trigger it, as well. Super Duper is massively delayed. Finally, it used to be somewhat normal to try to view your inventory on login to see you have 0 of everything, but once you touched a stashbox everything was restored - client delay/dropped request/misfire receiving the inventory.
---
I think the spinning loot is just caused by a "misfire" where the client failed to receive a corpse inventory and is waiting to timeout or receive an update. It happens more when lots of players are around, so managing that inventory and sending a new update whenever something is viewed or taken sends it into hourglass land. This is pervasive at Whitespring and SBQ, but not so much running events in solo or pairs.
---
Lots of servers have one or two spots open. You'll more likely hit a new server if you're matchmaking to an instance with 4 players.
---
That should be working, how are you testing / verifying it's not adding the stats?
---
Way to blow your opportunity, dude.
---
I may have too. I'm like lvl 73 and went full ballistic rifles. Strength is like 9 lol
---
Offset by how bad whitesprings bot is
---
you need a stimpak, a stimpack wonts do shit
---
Deep man, real deep *bumps fist against chest*. Respect.
---
Who hurt you?
---
ur mom when she used her teeth while sucking me off
---
I‚Äôm loling at the ‚Äúmetal man‚Äù comment. Great post and I wish I was there.
---
Lol no, I don't think so.   
---
The luck bit reported was just about the ironic lack of influence luck did have..   (Aka 5 or less loots better than a 15 luck).  
---
The only thing I could think of being a root cause was an inverse effect, as some games in the past have had a stack overflow where a number breaks past the "roof" and ends up back at the floor (aka a 102 turns into a 02,'because it's not configured to handle a 3 digit number)
---
The special prefixes from Secondary &amp; Tertiary legendary effects only override certain Primary Legendary Prefix. From my experience, primarily they will only override Assassin, Bolstering &amp; Vanguard. 
---
And this is why I never engage in combat unless I'm bounty hunting. 
---
Waaaay too long bro. But i agree. I quit already too. 
---
What do you mean with the level scaling?
---
No. And I sell daily
---
This.  Sorry OP.  Not that we don‚Äôt love ya, but there is a place in Hell reserved for ya if you bring it up again.  
---
We have cockroaches that can bite through 1 inch steel.  Let it go.
---
What a wall of text.  
---
Can you pls add a tl;dr?
---
Skillz lol
---
This was sad and pathetic. 
---
dont be that guy.  tag it, and give the 'come here' emote. 
---
With a perk that gives 25 rads, it‚Äôs annoying
---
They said this is something they are working on.
---
This is officially my favourite fo76 story to date.
---
Lolnope, i mean if u really want, you can do it, noone stopping you, but don't force it on all of us for "realism".
---
or maybe even simpler...to justify that players aren't "interested" enough in multiplayer/coop Skyrim/Fallout games because for them it must look like that when they ignore what they messed up
---
I run a zealots explosive gatling for SBQ battles. It can take out the scorched conquerors in one or two hits . Grinds the queens health pretty good. Can kill a landed lvl80 scorchbeast in about a dozen shots to the face. It's all around great except when you are beset by sting wings, ants, crickets, bloat flies, pests.
---
Who put you in charge of how other people choose to enjoy their games? A bethesda game should have significantly more content than this one does, I can count the number of actual quests on two hands ffs
---
Nah. Power armour isn‚Äôt in a state where it offers enough of an advantage for that. 
---
If you‚Äôve maxed your str for the weight reduction buffs (and who hasn‚Äôt) Without shocks PA (except excavator) gives you equivalent carry weight (or less if you‚Äôve pocketed or deep pocketed your armour) 
---
With the correct perks taken, you can get your normal armour up to PA levels of protection (armour clad, amongst others) and normal armour comes in legendary varieties offering far greater advantages over PA.
---
Infact the few areas PA excels In are rad protection compared to normal armour, actual head armour,  and immunity to airborne and water borne disease. 
---
Yes, some mods can make pa BETTER (like the jump pack) but even then it‚Äôs not like you need it (marsupial, bird bones)
---
I live out of a suit of t-60 purely for the BOS skin and unless I‚Äôm in a rad zone I‚Äôm about as vulnerable in it as I am in heavy bos combat armour out of it.
---
Lol same happens to me.
---
What I am noticing is the loot tables seem to get stuck on a prefix or type. I have had the same legendary prefix drop over and over on weapons and armor (like troubleshooter). This has happened to the point I have had the same weapon/armor drop twice (different level or stars). I also have long runs of Tesla rifles or Marine armor. It‚Äôs like the random loop they use doesn‚Äôt reset all the variables. 
---
Too long, didn‚Äôt read 
---
I like my anti-armor gatling gun, prime receiver.  You can notice the difference pretty easily
---
id say pc. was running an i5 and an rx460 on high quality and getting decent frames. i would imagine your system would do just fine. 
---
Do your Mom and Dad know you're on the internet?
---
We‚Äôve been saying this since last Tuesday. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt gaf. But whoopie they fixed Bobbie pin, plans known issue, and bulk scrap auto scrap while crafting but somehow allow bulk scrap during auto scrap? Duh! Bethesda!
---
They‚Äôre not worth much, your first SBQ kill guarantees the plan. Might get 500c.
---
They do major rad damage.
---
Less people the better.
---
I stopped playing about a week ago, and watched Juicy's video on youtube today about whether or not Bethesda had cut their losses on this game. It sucks because I literally only play fallout, but Im pretty convinced that stuff like this will be years out. The "quality of life" improvements in this game prob wont be up to par for a long time unfortunately.
---
Don't call my family peons.   
---
I bought the game to play with them, but I played it plenty without them too.  
---
All three of us came to the same conclusion, but the with the additional time I've spent with it I'm far more confident in my conclusion that it is an utter piece of shit.  
---
I've also played plenty other games with my Dad and brother which weren't utter pieces of shit, that didn't spend 3 months of patches to accomplish fuck-all.
---
Something something, meta meta, Fallout 76 is a piece of shit-a.
---
As a Fallout newbie, for about the first week into my first PA set, I was doing this not knowing any better lol it sucked! Sorry OP, that‚Äôs a gigantic nope from me.
---
Your response is just... I don't know. You sound like an anti-vaxxer in your denial of facts.
---
I don't have room for what I need because of the terrible damage from almost all weapons. I need ammo or the materials to create that ammo at an alarming rate and this has still not been addressed nearly 3 months in. I need more materials to repair my weapons and armour at an equally alarming rate because I'm armed with the equivalent of Faberge eggs. I can only store so much after which I'm off spending time just getting materials together. If you play for any length of time you will do it at least once a day.
---
Prove duping was reintroduced? Go away. I have no reason to make this up. Believe it or don't, I don't care.
---
Congratulations on your use of a future tense. You must work for Bethesda because that's the only tense they speak in when it comes to new content and fixes that have been needed and obvious from the start. Nothing has a date, everything is just "THE FUTURE". Don't even start with "every game they've ever released" has bugs. It's one thing to have bugs it's another thing entirely to fix them.
---
There is no excuse for having bugs that have been known about for literally years regardless of their ability to break the game or not. A bug is a bug. You aren't everyone else, what affects others might not matter to you but you don't speak for anyone but yourself. The reaction has changed? No. The reaction was always there but the community were able to do what Bethesda refused in the past. Now without community fixes and mods of the calibre previously available we see just how bad they are at fixing up their own mess. Reply if you want. I'm not going to waste more time. You won't change your mind, your mind is made up. Mine is too. Good day.
---
At least incels can pretend they have a girlfriend to break up with...
---
Mess with the noot noot you get the shoot shoot
---
1: this is kinda up in the air, rumour has it that starfield is a bit slow in development and es6 is apparently in it‚Äôs pre production stages.
---
2: This may or may not be happening already, I‚Äôd image at least some work has been diverted to austin.
---
3: NPCs in the future, we don‚Äôt really know if this‚Äôll happen or not, could depend on how Bethesda plans to create expansions. For the megaton bit, I can see an existing area being partially repurposed like the whitespring or top of the world.
---
4+5: interesting concept, radio stations have potential to be used in a new system of gameplay.
---
6: her ambiguous fate does leave the door open for her to appear in a post main story expansion, if we get NPCs she‚Äôll make a good candidate.
---
7: probably the main priority, regardless of their hiccups in the process.
---
8: we do have attentive CMs over here and while it could improve more for inside the vault posts, it‚Äôs better than it was in regards to the patch notes, hopefully the right adjustments are made in this area.
---
That's a really good question actually
---
I was checking this out some time ago and found that another element that we see repeating is the caulk drawings in theses locations. We noticed that these repercussions in the creation of the cult. Another element is the group of three bone moths. 
---
Is  
---
Over-rated
---
I‚Äôve also just built at the bottom of the tower but it‚Äôs nothing compared to this. What a beautiful camp!
---
Stealth boys exist for pa if I'm not mistaken
---
Just did at the bottom! I'll answer here too though, Just a dear John mock to Bethesda to have fun despite dropping the game. Me and my partner love fallout, but not this much to stick around! 
---
I literally just raged quit because of this fucking workshop 
---
 Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞ 
---
My mom read that. Shes standing over my shoulder at my 3 year old birthday party her reply is, dont lie about her skills because your dicks so small.
---
Doubtful, it's energy damage not fire.
---
I only noticed under armor not applying to stats. It was tested by equipping it and unequipping while viewing stats. 
---
Addiction.
---
It doesn't show under effects
---
There already is a stealth Mod for Power Armors.
---
U can buy the plans at Watoga BoS Tradebot and X01 Mod in Whitesprings Bunker (rare) 
---
&gt; Token ring? Wow. Those vampire taps probably explain the disconnects ... ;)
---
Yes I know it's a bad analogy, lol but had trouble thinking of a better one for what we have, where everything breakdowns down because a of a hiccup.  
---
&gt;Most likely your client connects to the instance which just manages coordinating clients..  
---
You could be correct, but Bethesda described it as individual cloud instance servers, which they don't appear to be "completely", otherwise a new instance should perform flawlessly for a while.
---
&gt; I think the spinning loot is just caused by a "misfire" where the client failed to receive a corpse inventory..
---
Not completely disagreeing, but we don't seem to have this issue occur as frequently 3 days after a downtime cycle, and a new server instance, up for less than an hour should not have gotten so out of sync...
---
&gt; Lots of servers have one or two spots open. You'll more likely hit a new server if you're matchmaking to an instance with 4 players.
---
Understand that, which is why I did the test using a new server instance and why I did a group of 4 in the menu, in off peak time most servers would have close to max population and fewer disconnects / multiple available openings.  
---
you are addicted to something use an adictol it's glitched and just isnt showing it
---
Incredibly stupid idea. PA isn't even that amazing outside of nuke zones. 
---
I checked all of my armor to make sure I didn't have any altering effects on anything I was wearing.
---
Do you have any mutations, diseases, addictions?  
---
And what stats are you saying are not adding specifically?
---
maybe that's even the entire point,back in 2016 when they were still called "Battlecry Studios" Bethesda had them halt development of their first game "Battlecry" because it didn't meet Bethesda's "quality standards" and work on a new title (which turned out to be 76).....
---
So maybe this is even an attempt to get rid of their Austin studios by simply overburdening them with a huge IP while they're still too unexperinced and competent to complete it and then blame it on them and close that studio...

At least salt lords can pretend everyone else is as  undateable as they are üëçlearn to have some fun, friend. 
---
What weapon, level and platform are you on? I might can help you out.
---
as an epic store exclusive which practically everyone is boycotting
---
Just have the game keep her alive for at least 5 minutes. It'd be great to have a countdown before she could be hurt.
---
Seen that frequently as well, the day before "Black Tuesday" (my nickname for the last "patch") on my finally real WhiteSprings run I managed to pull 9 weightless armor pieces, which was insane.  
---
Those clusters are what started making me look at the patterns 
---
If you buy the digital copy, doesn't it download the latest version?
---
This might be why 13% of players have never left the vault.
---
This! I came to say this also!
---
Or, they could just... Not?
---
Seriously, why? You can already beat power armour DR in normal armour with the right legendary effects, and power armour can't have legendary effects
---
Seems unlikely... But maybe a glitched spawn?
---
if I focus myself I can level in 3-4 hours, so using 4 hours:
---
if you paid full (normal) price [it cost you 9c per level](https://i.imgur.com/qEVPb99.png) assuming it took you 4 hours per level, how many of those levels did you spend with your brother, your dad?
---
Herd mutation?
---
I don't understand who has the time to sit and bitch so much about a game they don't like. Life is too short. Find something you like and do that. Let the people that like this thing enjoy it.
---
Would a pumpkin grenade do major rad damage to someone AFK at a vendor bot?.....even if I'm in pacifist mode?
---
Haven't experienced this at all. Every scorch beast I've fought recently (last two weeks) have all been landing a bit more, including the queen. We've killed her in 10 minutes in the last few days cause she just kept landing and stayed on the ground for long periods of time
---
If that is all then why not just make it 5 a month then make a real game
---
YEAH!!!!!   Thanks Esham and Tanaas ,, that's exactly what it was. Whew! Mystery solved! :-D
---
They could have copied fortnite better. Needed to have a more rewarding item selection. Atoms are good but there's not enough that I would like to buy. Emotes could have been mixed with dances, more power armor paints and such.
---
The message stated I now have the marsupial mutation but I cannot jump as high as I should be able too
---
Make sure you have the game audio setting to auto or you can change it to team or area. ;-)
---
There are more good people in the game than bad... 
---
SON. OF. A. BITCH. 
---
I saw your message, but discounted it cause ‚ÄúI saw what I saw‚Äù. Grabbed sturdy combat leg plans earlier from Wallace to see if my ‚Äúonly unlocks per slot‚Äù theory was correct. Still couldn‚Äôt make it. 
---
I had happened across a combat helmet in Harpers Ferry on one of my runs, so I picked it up. Just to check, and to prove you wrong, I looked to see what mods I had for the helmet. 
---
BoS Paint.
---
Well fuck lol. Looks like I still gotta grind for the BoS leg plans that haven‚Äôt shown up since the patch. My apologies. You were right about the paint, and I was totally wrong.
---
A few game quits and reloads into the world fixed it for me. 
---
Yea not like players have been blowing up over nothings.
---
The amount of people that don't know onside the vault exists and complains about lack of transparency.  Or agree false bans were happening without proof are way higher then it should be.
---
They can't be isolated cloud instances. There's some backing store or you'd lose your progress each time you logged into a new server. ;) That's the "global" instance I mentioned.
---
Systems similar might be something a bit dated like a big fat Microsoft SQL cluster with a lightweight proxy in front of it. Newer examples might be something like Kafka. For all we know it's TurboGears and Celery (RIP).
---
Since that coordinating system would be global if it somehow had a memory leak, regional outage, or just didn't perform well..... We would see an improvement on downtime refresh that had nothing to do with the individual instances.
---
I assume it's a combination of wonky servers talking to whatever the other instance(s) are that coordinate between instance servers (which the client never "sees" directly).
---
OMG how do you get things to go to your CAMP?! I pacify things often with my perk but it never gives me an option to send them to my camp or anything. Usually they just chill there for a minute but then to red again. I try pacifying them again and it'll work sometimes but never got one to be mine. üò≠üòî
---
I've seen 4* machetes on sale before, no 5* weapons though
---
Unarmed, talon, twisted muscles, and radical can push a death claw to almost 500 damage.
---
But you die in basically one hit.
---
What you thinking cowboy?
---
Probably just a player afk. 
---
&gt; the inability to monetize it long term.
---
Atom Shop is a joke, true, and with the low sales of the base game, I don't think they are going to invest in producing DLCs (in seven voiced languages!) with very limited potential sales.
---
Just happened for me. 2 - 3 scorthched beasts destroyed my home and not more than 10 mins later, another. I normally see maybe 1 scortched beast a day or so. Definately not getting my house destroyed 3 times in a night :(
---
For me as well, but for this to be a reoccurring procedure, it really pulls me out of the mood to play. It is along the lines of a major corporation's tec support saying, "Well, did you try unplugging it and plugging it back in?"
---
Yeah I figured out it was a lag thing with the display 
---
Don't think so
---
Damage per shot vs damage per second are two very different measurements. Damage per shot are high but slow in comparison to crazy true dps. High damage per second melt enemies in comparison. It‚Äôs why shitty 10mm sub machine guns feel ‚Äúdecent‚Äù when they seem weak in stats. The speed at which they hit in damage per shot is crazy. 
---
with their patch record they would probably break it so every of your cores changes to the charge value of your lowest core.... "You had 5 100% cores and one 2% before? Congrats! Now you have 6 2% cores!"
---
some weeks ago I would've meant that as a joke...with their latest attempts at patching I'm not sure anymore
---
Yes...I‚Äôm a dumb ass. I have a maxed out carry weight card, and had no idea that it did not effect the Stash also. which means junk weighs three times more in my stash than in my inventory.  Kind of a double edged sword. 
---
Glitched Dragons.
---
I have heard you can glitch the rifle The Dragon and the ammo count goes weird. This leads it to have almost no reload time. you can literally fire it almost as fast as you can pull the trigger.
---
I am no expert on this and I dont know how the glitch is done, but I have seen a few videos where people where showing off the guns ROF. Musket Machinegun!
---
No reload time and 2 shots/sec @700-900 dam. now get a group of 5 people with this and yes the SBQ will go down fast.
---
If this is not the reason, i have no idea why she is dying so fast.
---
M2 SSD's are expensive :(
---
Can also confirm the scrapable BoS mod is H let paint. Just checked it a couple minutes ago. 
---
Glad they‚Äôre just impossible to find, not glitches
---
try hooking your spotlights up to a switch so you can reset them by switching them off and on again.....clichee fix but works most of the time
---
It may also be coincidence, but the prefix at times matches what you have a majority of in your inventory. I had a number of vampire weapons and trapper armor in my inventory and had a majority of items that dropped match those designations. Seemed more than mere coincidence. 
---
I have a reverse switch for my garage door so I can close it when I leave but I will try that, thank you!
---
250 levels and get killed by lvl 12 huh.
---
Also, using the "back in time" argument doesn't work. We are talking about today's market, not reminiscing about what ever 40 years ago
---
Haven‚Äôt been able to find them either, but I‚Äôve only been checking Grafton Station, not Greg. Will try a few times tonight.
---
Also can now confirm that the mod gained from scrapping is Combat helmet paint in BoS 
---
Exactly. I wouldn‚Äôt have minded paying for a typical Bethesda expansion, new area, new equipment, new quests. Now we have these disrespectful micro transactions that spit in the face of customers that paid $60.
---
"This is why TES 6 can't have multiplayer."
---
(Not that they were ever even thinking about it.)
---
Same plus my quest suddenly disappeared completely!! I'm starting to hate this game now. 
---
nailed it.
---
Had level 31 watching me take on a 2* super mutant. I left it's health low so he could get in a shot but instead he ran away. I even tried to flag him to come back. 
---
Get your loot bro.....I came to help you.
---
1. Plan you're build before hand.
---
2. Play the game, keeping the items you want for levelling. Not junk.
---
3. Sell everything, including junk.
---
4. Once you are close to completing you're build hoard you're junk.
---
5. Completely build your base, finish you're build, complete any quests. Save the most important junk items.
---
6. Farm the game, explore the game, wait for more content.
---
Reason for selling everything including junk is because it's a pain in the butt to manage early on. Once you're build is almost complete you'll have the perk cards needed plus other cards to worry about hoarding junk.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt want them to at this point, I was saying more of a ‚Äúthey should‚Äôv‚Äù type scenario. I wouldn‚Äôt buy shit from them at this point.
---
I have pulled this similar trick in pvp with people who have 1 shot builds. Have my mate bait them, and then I put a clip into them after they kill my pal. 
---
I don't steal items, unless they start it (I also don't attack camps or low lvl people cuz that's evil). I feel like the caps are reward enough.
---
I only run if i have alot of the junk i need, dont wanna risk it
---
I. Pretty sure sentinel refers to the perk which is either 8% damage reduction from players or 15%.
---
There is also the one that does take 15% Less damage while standing still. 
---
Flatwoods would be a good candidate for a spot like this in a way.
---
Well until we have more data, or a response from the Dev's it's as good a theory as any.
---
Am on PS4 have 1 price of sentinel armour for a price if someone wants it today hit me up I'll give u my own 
---
The world said it was shit 3 months ago but a few didn't listen.
---
Lol retail, because S&amp;H is going to be brutal for me, a friend in TX wanted it and the quotes were around
---
$70 due to the dimensions.
---
Today I got a bounty for no reason. Was making my third trip to the unowned junkyard to mine the black titanium ore. Then I just had a bounty. Didn‚Äôt do anything I hadn‚Äôt done a dozen times before. 
---
I stashed my junk and just waited for death.
---
Yup. It‚Äôs a bit of a maze. Go to the end and look around. To the left if I recall.
---
It would be great if they could fix it.  Its such a letdown considering all the ammo you expend and weapons you have to repair.
---
My experience on a PC is a nuked Whitesprings is definitely better than SBQ fight.  Its not only the SBQ but all the other critters I help kill during Scorched Earth, I would say its 50-50 that I ultimately get anything before a body disappears.  Whitesprings also has this problem but not quite as bad.  Yes, definitely frustrating.
---
Just drop a bag and fast travel away after announcing the drop.
---
Ugh that‚Äôs very cool
---
Do you happen to still know the location?
---
This was added in patch 4 im pretty sure.
---
Used to be 1 player is wanted and that's all you worry about 1v1 even in a team.
---
Now they put it so if you agro one person the whole team initiates PvP against you. 
---
Sucks balls I don't know why bgs is pushing pvpso hard it's just barely arverage. It's only good to farm caps when you need them.
---
What was retail in the states
---
Out of curiosity, were you still around to see that lunchbox code get utilized for event rewards the way the apologists were saying it would be? 
---
I'm pretty confident it was remnants of abandoned lootbox monetization code that got scrapped after reaction to Battlefront 2's fuckup, but there were a lot of folks around here insisting that the code was there for more innocent reasons, such as delivering seasonal rewards.
---
Level 130 and only experienced one griefer. He wasn't even able to kill me, just harassed a few minutes until I blocked him and switched servers.
---
This still isn't fucking fixed?
---
 I haven't played because of this broken shit in near a month, I've given up on the game as Beth' obviously has no fucking idea on how to fix their game, maybe you should to? unless you really like it that much you're willing to put up with things like this.
---
That‚Äôs another player. Sometimes when you fast travel, your player model stays where it was last. And naked.
---
Sucks when you are in a group because no one else in the group can see you when you are standing right next to them at the fast traveled location.
---
For starters deathclaw gauntlets benefit from Iron Fists not gladiator. Secondly demolition Expert is pretty useless now. Take those out and put them into more rifleman. When using a rifle stay hidden and get sneak attack multiplier. Talons mutation also helps for deathclaw gauntlet. 
---
interesting...
---
Can you click the "inspect" button?
---
hahahaha im on the same boat with u. But apparently, they are supposed to go back to ur camp. It has to be a random spawn though, if it is a fixed spawn monster. It wouldn't spawn after relog. Best way to find some would be running around the mire. Loads of random spawns.
---
F*** you metal man!!!
---
Level 105 here and never seen x01 shocks from any vendor. Gave in and bought a pair off fo76market today. I have t60 shock plans tho and can mod for anyone on PS4 for free. Just dm me on here before you add me
---
So this rarely happens, but a nekked clone of a player will be where they fast traveled from. If on a team the team mates will see two map markers for their team mate. It's weird.
---
Well I'm that guy who keeps one eye on you and one eye on my escape route. 
---
The point is, it's pointless to copy Fortnite because you can't compete with free (and polished).
---
LOL
---
I guess if you really wanna pretend the game's story (or lack thereof) wasn't one of its biggest criticisms, go ahead...
---
Is there one? Clicking the right stick (Xbox) which is what I do in inventory doesn‚Äôt work, that‚Äôs for Offers Only view. The answer to the question may be very obvious but I can‚Äôt find it, need help. 
---
Which plan was it only certain ones increase your stats the bos plan itself doesn‚Äôt add stats it‚Äôs the protective,shielded plans that add stats.
---
Well deathclaws migrate, that‚Äôs how they spread out all over America, with how big and fast they are it makes sense they‚Äôre on the east coast only 25 years after the war (they were being cloned pre war anyhow, should be plenty of them in cages ready to go).
---
They wrote themselves into a corner I mean , only way out story/ lore wise I can see is if they move the time forward every few months (by a decade at a time or so) 
---
It won‚Äôt make sense for all the factions to be back in full power, remember BOS went from west to east coast by foot, if they had a working faction in Appalachia they would‚Äôve stopped by 
---
you can make 4 star, not sure how to make 5
---
There's a thing called bankruptcy in game debuffs your dmg by 50% to other players for a couple hours
---
Not a mistake and seen as a feature. Bethesda has even confirmed scrapping bulk with scrap all is a feature working as intended. 
---
Ok, I don't trade much, so just a shot in the dark.
---
&gt; They can't be isolated cloud instances. There's some backing store or you'd lose your progress each time you logged into a new server....
---
Agree/Disagree in part, the roughly 10 minute autosaves are capturing our location etc, just like FO4, and auto saves occur when exiting, controlled server disconnects, etc.  
---
So that data, our progress is tracked wherever our saves are stored, and an uncontrolled crash (server instance) results in lost data / rollbacks.  
---
I think, in theory, the character saves are held separately then the theoretical "controller" 
---
&gt; Systems similar might be something a bit dated like a big fat Microsoft SQL cluster with a lightweight proxy in front of it....
---
Makes sense, and fits with the observations.  
---
&gt; Since that coordinating system would be global if it somehow had a memory leak, regional outage, or just didn't perform well..... We would see an improvement on downtime refresh that had nothing to do with the individual instances... 
---
So before things get really sluggish 6 days in, what explains a fresh "world instance" being rock solid and responsive in this framework?
---
Forgot to mention the treated and resistant ones
---
They eat dead vault dwellers.  
---
Guess I better load up on Sentinel and Anti-Armor and see if it is more than mere coincidence. 
---

My thought was to have presets. So we can just click on a preset and it auto swaps all of the cards for us for whatever out situation is.
---
Lol let me know, even if it's in PM, love data 
---
5c, 10c bounty = 50% to the claimer.  I do low cap bounties when I play PVP and avoid paying out 250c+ each death lol.
---
Well they're also supposed to be in the vendors inventories (at least the Grafton vendors). So... there is a glitch, it seems.
---
Is the transponder not working something others have seen? The walkthroughs I've found act like it works.
---
If this is paint you buy from the atom shop you can't put it on other peoples stuff I don't believe. I don't think its tradeable or droppable.
---
agreed, best example here is the gunsmith perk, which allows u to craft weapons and at the same time, it retains the durability of your weapons. I never take it off. I honestly think all the perk cards should have several benefits, esp. the ones like ammosmith and home defence.
---
 OMG my new Lamp is not worth it???
---
It just... Worked
---
&gt;Anyone start a store where you sell the best steaks on your sever yet? 
---
Oh god, do you remember all the posts up on this sub in the early days before anyone had got their hands on it? All the player factions people were planning on setting up, all the themed bars/hospitals/trading hubs players were planning on cobbling together? Interesting, sometimes trap-filled little pieces of player-made content and flair for each other to discover across a sprawling, persistent world?  "We, the so-and-sos, will be known across the wastes for X, Y, and Z..."  "Won't it be cool if we can set up our own little radio shacks across the waste to broadcast our own playlists and commentary?"
---
Fuck it's sad to think back on those posts. 
---
Issue was I did in fact read the comment... the word super wasn't there originally...
---
You could also do a discord server, thought the Xbox had good support for it.
---
Nuka paint is a plan found ingame
---
&gt; Relatively speaking on this sub they are.
---
People on a game subforum who don't like the game in question are a minority? Holy shit, man - let's get your oppressed ass some restitution and a warm cup of cocoa.
---
I'm not sure if you're looking for a serious answer, but the truth is, you run into other players as frequently as you want to.  Everyone is on the map.  All you have to do is travel near them.
---
what does that have to do with the story being engaging or not? and criticized by whom? people playing the game or people watching others play?
---
again, when did we vote?
---
Had this happen to men on Xbox, but I would lose AP when walking, and running.  I had to stand still to regen AP at all.  When it happened to me it was not a lag with the UI, I had to logout/in to fix.  
---
Including shipping ?
---
 I have this magic .45 supply and no matter how many rounds I pump through my Lever Action it never gets much below 2000. ;)
---
It's a glitch in how they set the code up, Inspect is "X" on trades with NPCs and in your Pipboy, but it's the filter for showing "offers only" in player vs player trades
---
Just give them 100% raw damage reduction to players when they don't have the caps to pay the bounty, the  mechanic as it currently works is is extremely abusable I've seen melee players with 1.2 k bounties and they can still one shot me (even with the player damage reduction they get after not paying a bounty) because they have so much damage. Also make is so the bounty stays on them, until its paid, so if they get killed and lose 50 caps they still have the other 1150 caps to pay off the bounty. So therefore they can't fight back and have to die over and over again until they pay off the bounty.

Hey at least we all know now to to pre order Baghdad‚Äôs games, I spent 80$ Canadian on this game (conversion rate plus higher taxes here) just to see it plummet to 40$ CAD a couple of weeks later, thank god I didn‚Äôt get the tricentennial version since it literally got you nothing useful (except for salut emote) , whatever starfields pre order price is , wait until a week or two and boom half priced lol
---
When you buy something they get a % of that money added. Maybe you bought something and didn't realize you added to their pool.
---
lmao poor people gold
---
Gotcha I haven't played in ages, the game got boring personally and there is no real end game. I am keeping an eye and hoping for the best though, I want this game to be good. Also good luck makin some caps OP.
---
I‚Äôm a big scary power armor main, I usually stalk the low level guys crouched so they don‚Äôt see me easily and I‚Äôll snipe stuff when they aren‚Äôt looking and if they get in a pinch I‚Äôll slam down from the sky in front of them (I‚Äôve got a jetpack) and kill everything in front of them and normally that signals my good will. If they are super new and have no other characters I‚Äôll usually just walk around and follow them to make sure they stay out of trouble and don‚Äôt get slaughtered early on by bots and scorched and super mutants and the like. I‚Äôve got like 70 stimpacks on me I really don‚Äôt need them all so I don‚Äôt feel bad about reviving random low levels 
---
I think it's an obvious guess. When you load in you'll see geometry which is most likely nearly all "on the disk" for the client. A short amount of time  after load you'll  see weather  and eventd. A significant amount of time (even worse after the last patch) and you'll have an inventory.
---
The player status and inventory is being loaded somewhere different than the client. The weather loads before your inventory. This is all observable by you. It really can't work any other way.
---
6 days in or 6 minutes after downtime I've had good old hourglass loads in high traffic areas like SBQ. It definitely gets worse over time but I can never say it's been Rock solid during those events. YMMV.
---
This is my build, I'm a rifleman but not spec'd so heavily into it that I cant use melee. Plus I like to have weight so I can carry stuff to sell to vendors without power armor. Also, yes I could get more out of vats but I use AP refresh on about 3 of 5 pieces are armor so it works. Those super mutants you were saying take forever, I kill in 2-3 shots when hidden or caution and 4-5 when in danger. 
---
S 10 - 4 strong back, 3 traveling pharmacy, 1 sturdy frame, 2 bandolier (I also have melee cards I can swap out IF I feel necessary)
---
P 13 - 3 rifleman, 3 expert rifleman, 3 master rifleman, 3 tank killer, 1 concentrated fire
---
E 1 - 1 good doggy
---
C 5 - 1 rad sponge, 1 travel agent, and the other 3 depends on if a group or solo or selling
---
I 8 - 3 first aid, 5 gunsmith
---
A 8 - 3 action boy, 1 marathoner, 1 escape artist, 3 white night
---
L 11 - 3 bloody mess, 3 better criticals,  3 class freak, 2 starched genes
---
I used to run 5 demolition expert but since the nerf you get more from moving 2 rifleman cards to 3 than you do 5 in demolition expert. So just makes sense not to run it now. 
---
So X will show me the full details?
---
Depends on where to, not agreeing to that price for shipping overseas, not my first rodeo! ;)
---
Glow sight is situational.  I just use it on glowing ghouls in whitesprings. Start stacking perks in tank killer and incisor. Find a good one handed for gladiator. Swing speed and instigating is a good combo. Bloody mess is a 15 pct damage boost too.
---
Try to sneak a get the double damage too.
---
Anything that gives bonus damage all the time is good. Two shot, explosive, mutants (if you have mutations). Anti armor is solid, furious, and instigating. 
---
Oh it‚Äôs working. Nothing says it has to be a straight line though right?  It‚Äôs a long way but pretty linear.
---
that cute when u think ur "home" is secure becuase u close the door... a single swing of hammer barke ur walls, doors...
---
I fucking hate the perk card system. 
---
&gt; what does that have to do with the story being engaging or not?
---
If the story was engaging people wouldn't have complained about it, would they?
---
&gt; and criticized by whom? people playing the game or people watching others play?
---
Oh I see, you're one of those people that thinks the game wasn't received negatively, people are just pretending they played and hated it. Keep living in your fantasy world bud. 
---
Brand new players shouldn't have to be bothered by that crap. 
---
My trick for bringing down Scorchbeasts was to cripple their wings.  In the past, that used to reliably bring them down.  These days, it's very hit-and-miss.  I feel part of it is actually based on where you fight them.  It seems like if they don't have a clear, flat area to land, they won't.  It might help to lure them over to such a place as you fight them.
---
The Queen does her own thing though.  I'm not convinced limb damage means anything to her.
---
My turrent's shoot me, it's so stupid, had to scrap them; like how is it possible to mess that up by doing a simple check to make sure target is not the owner of the turrent?
---
After the last patch  involution (sneak and more broken), I took a break in the game, and I dedicated to just trade‚Ä¶ 
---
 Wow, The real world I guess. A level 68 SM Overlord dies in about 2 - 3 hits of the almost completely armor piercing Sword I wield and my Lever Action which hits at 116 takes them down much quicker than that.
---
 
---
You badly need armor piercing for Muties, they have ton.
---
For sure was just wondering when you said "retail as shipping will kill you" I'm in Canada
---
I included my gf in this and I've asked her to remind me to check on this, I'm going to message you tomorrow and I want to spend some time to compare, personally if you're okay with that. amount of time played, our inventories, what we've finished, what we've done etc. if you're okay with that, if not that's cool too. I just want to see how much more you've seen than I have or vice-versa, if that's kosher, copacetic, whatever you want to say
---
This. When it happens I swing my all-rise around in the empty air like a crazy person until the game gives the cha-ching so for killing the invisible enemy. It happens at least once every few days. On time it did this for on a whole squad of ghouls which finally all appeared (bodies) by the time I killed the last. I was able to finally loot them and walk back down the road and kill the other one I had killed earlier.  Video sync nonsense
---
No, Xbox. Thanks anyway. I'll be fine, I'm sitting on a ridiculous amount of scrap. Just going to need to farm some gears.
---
What‚Äôs your console?
---
you get real defensive when you get called out i see :). keep downvoting each comment i make, another argument won brave warrior! :)
---
Thank you for the info about the gauntlet!
---
I also have in my melee arsenal a ghoul slayers meathook with an extra blade which is amazing in a nuked white springs, a ghoul slayers tambo and an anti armor machete. I also have a combat knife stashed but I forget its modifiers. 
---
Which melee weapon do you believe is  the best to really invest in. Or even one I dont have yet. 
---
I've been comfortable with their damage though I posted the deathclaw gauntlet because it feels weakest to me of the others, but I only use the others situationally. 
---
Agree with the breakdown on the load order, clearly observable.  
---
But regarding the "always spotty" Maybe it's a little dependent on ping / latency.  
---
   
---
I've got a shameful number of hours, and previously I almost never got "loading" on the SBQ, WhiteSprings, etc until a few days into the Post-Downtime cycle, but I live near Washington DC, not far from Bethesda. When I join a game with some of my AU or UK friends, I will consistently get a few seconds to a minute on corpses.  
---
Again just an observation.
---
 Get the Enclave stuff. No one can see it. ;)
---
PS4 
---
It's one of the new bugs introduced, enjoy it, as it's probably going to be there a while. 
---
Can get a quote in the morning if you'd like.
---
F
---
"Disconnected from Server"'or hard crashes?
---
For sure hit me up. I'm in Saskatchewan I'm on PS4 but want the damn helmet 
---
Thank you for the info. I did omit a few cards I only use situationally too. I only use rad sponge in a nuke zone for example. 
---
Good to know about demo expert. That may give me a few points to play with. 
---
Have you finished all of the steps prior to finding the Glassed Caverns? 
---
One particularly annoying aspect of that quest is that you need to do that bit in one go; if you server hop or log out it resets.
---
If I recall, you need to "find the signal" like ~3-4 times; the final step takes you into the GC. If the quest icon isn't right on that area, you've missed a step.
---
One you're at that stage and go inside, the signal strength will go up and down quite a bit. The place is large and twisty, and you'll almost lose the signal a couple of times. Luckily, you can really only go one way, and you'll end up where you need to be.
---
Tiny spoiler/hint: [When you get to the final area in that cavern (you'll; know it when you get there), you may be tempted to run through the area and into a smaller side chamber that looks like the place the transponder is pointing you toward. Don't do that; Taggerdy is in the main cavern - NOT the small chamber. Going back into that big cavern may be something you do not want to do. Again - you'll know why when you get there.](/spoiler)
---
Mine are take less damage while standing still.
---
oh thanks...didn't even notice it's my cakeday 
---
It's not necessarily a bad idea to be near something, though.  When you look at the map and see a player just standing around in an area that isn't near anything, you know there's probably a CAMP there.  Course, by that same token, it also means that if someone is coming for your CAMP, they'll have to commute there first.
---
Thank you! I use glowsight situationally as well. I leave those points in perception to just swap out lock picking when I need it. That's why I've hesitated in filling in rifleman cards and blocking out my ability to swap so easily but I may just have to do that now. 
---
4* Machetes exist because of the sacrificial blade.
---
Yea same thing.  
---
That last patch seems to have broken the game in so many new, exciting ways.
---
My special stats are all over the place with my unyielding build too.
---
Damn, my friend has a few he‚Äôs tired of holding. On Xbox tho. Not sure if Play Station has a groups or community area, but people will post there if they‚Äôre selling them. 
---
 It depends. They mostly land a couple of times and when they are low health. But some will keep flying and I'd guess I kill about 15% in the air.
---
Thanks. (I think?)
---
I didnt know about the armor piercing with them but I will try to invest in those perks. 
---
I was today years old when I learned this
---
I'm not really melee but I like death tambo because it weights nothing. For damage output either gauntlet, power fist, mole miner claw, grog axe, or super sledge. 
---
Ah, a fellow man of culture I see. That was probably the best cutscene in the Just Cause 3
---
It's xbox 1 so disconnect only
---
 No really, I can shot at em' with my 100 damage no AP pistol and it don't hurt em' much. My slightly higher number Lever Action destroys them. There's other AP in there, my perks emphasize it. ;)
---
Server disconnects need to be fixed asap, not later in an update, *Now*.
---
You can do that if you want, but I don't see what point you're trying to prove. I mean it's pretty much cut and dry at this point that the game is a piece of shit, but if you want, go for it.
---
If this was true 1 out of 10 legendaries would be useful and that's not the case. I sell at least 100 legendaries to find one keeper.
---
 Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip, twenty one would be the newbie with a plas mine on his hip.
---
Thanks!!!!
---
Ya. The best damage perks are the ones that work against everything.  Same with weapons. Since the tse nerf the anti armor perk is quite powerful. That's why incisor and tank killer are so strong.
---
I have a level 35 explosive lever action. Running all rifle perks maxed. 3 in tank killer. 1 in concentrated fire, 3 in bloody mess, 3 in demo expert, and I can eke out 225 per shot. 450 while sneaking. 
---
i came into my trash can but i don‚Äôt feel like going outside to wash it out, can you help me with that instead?
---
I think the devs might be doing things without telling anyone. This happened to me as well today. I also noticed, when I bought from a railroad vendor a portion was added to the caps pool. First time I'd seen that happen.
---
it's all good, PlayStation does have communities but I feel people would be less inclined to help without being greedy. 
---
Would a double barrel tse work?  How much are you willing to pay?
---
A month ago, a lv 40 got wanted around my house. he broke in and I fast travelled to see what he was doing. He stole some water and made his way to break down the door lol. I killed him and in return, he came back with an orbital strike on my base. I killed him again and repaired the damage, and once i repaired a turret. It started firing at me... I thought ro myself, being irritated by the constant fire sounds. I wish it did the same to the griefer who took all the liberty in trashing the camp. lol
---
Oh it does? Rip
---
They are out there just available they also have the best stuff too
---
I agree. Sorry. There‚Äôs enough tediousness already. I don‚Äôt want to become vulnerable, mid fight, and have to change it out and *slowly* get back in. No thanks. 
---
I think I have: 15/7/5/5/14/6/5
---
This is my bloodied high rad melee build. These are the perks I normally have equipped:
---
STR: incisor, traveling pharmacy, gladiator(s), martial artist, bandolier, dont remember the others
---
PER: glowsight, either tank killer or rifleman, greenthumb
---
END: radicool, ironclad2, good doggy, solar powered
---
CHR: travel agent, lone wanderer or magnetic personality, tenderizer
---
INT: makeshift 5*, power patcher3*, gunsmith 4*, batteries incl 3*
---
AGL: born survivor1, adrenaline1, thru hiker, white knight
---
LCK: starched genes, bloody mess 3
---
Ive got a complete set of unyielding armor (random types).
---
Im pretty fragile outside PA in certain cases, but born survivor keeps me alive long enough to take care of pretty much any mid level mob.
---
Consider yourself lucky as I had this in reverse - I‚Äôm a level 3 lockpick but the game showed me as a level 1 (or 0 if I had 2 cards equipped). 
---
Great! I‚Äôm excited to see what they have. Thanks
---
You can just walk up to them like any other vendor, the only thing to note is the BOS vendor is downtown watoga area surrounded by hostile robots. 
---
Yeah, if I remember correctly it goes to zero for a while. Just keep making your way through the cavern and it kicks in again.
---
It's fun to do and I know it stresses some out but once everyone figures it out I hope it sets a decent mindset for the new player as they play the game. Starting a pay it forward if you will. 
---
Good to know. I‚Äôll be ready for them
---
If it's latency then it's only to Bethesda, which would be odd. Even before patches I never had rubber banding (both location and health rubberbanding) except for in very specific scenarios.
---
Those scenarios are things like entering Whitespring. There's a very high chance to enter the building, start walking, and snnnnap you're back at the door. 6 minutes or 6 days after reset and it will happen with the chance increased at the 6 day mark.
---
I find it unlikely this is a "my problem" and not a Bethesda problem unless they've decided to run the game out of a Maryland closet instead of via multiregion providers. ;)
---
I hate the assault rifle now its the ugliest fkn gun and it takes up so much screen. Why they ditched the F3 guns i dont understand those 2 rifles and the victory rifle were some of the best looking guns. No we get pipe guns and an elephants d*ck.
---
What more did they offer exactlty? Not trying to argue. I‚Äôd really like to see sources of things they have promised but not delivered.
---
Yeah my tambo is like 0.4 weight, ghoul slayers and it's a nice back up if other weapons break. I carry about 6 melee weapons and total they weigh 7 pounds which is awesome. 
---
My favorite was the "Now I have all the baskets!" note next to the lady dead with 20 baskets on her desk
---
had to wait about 8-10 mins for loots to load the things up...  been getting annoyed a lot.
---
Ugh. These posts are so January.
---
Dont let these naysayers bring you down. Game is legit fun until you complete everything (100 hours in) and realize there's no end game. At which point just pick up another game until they release more content and add a real endgame.
---
This is very helpful. Ty so much. 
---
What we bloody need is reloading benches to break down ammo into gunpower, and junk casings/shells, and tips that can be scrapped and rebuilt so that we can turn all our excess .308 ammo into 5.56 or .50 or *something*.
---
Thanks - with how buggy it has been today (the last hour the transponder% wasn't even showing up on the screen, and see also the post I made about not being able to fast travel despite being under the weight by 10 lbs), I figured I'd ask instead of waste lots of time. 
---
I‚Äôve actually met a few decent people through that. I, myself, don‚Äôt carry junk so it hoards in my stash box. I do a clear out every now and then and give people junk for free. Anyways, it‚Äôs worth a shot. Most times they will advertise the price as well. 
---
I don't recall r91 in FO3, was that a DLC weapon?
---
Pulse miiiine 
---
Pulse mine on his hiiiiiiip...
---
Lever Action is so efficient that farming super mutant overlords for steel is legit.
---
It should be been buffed for the blackpowder weapons because of their slow reload
---
Literally never have that problem, with the exception of logging in to a server for the first time, and "sometimes" after fast traveling, but only see that occur when entering a building several days after downtime.
---
I'm not saying it's your problem,  just I'm observing a different set of conditions.
---
there is a mission you can do in watoga to make the robot not hostile 
---
Sorry it didn't remedy the problem your having.  I'd be happy to try to help you figure it out though.  Couple quick Q's if I may.
---
* What's your specs?  (CPU / GPU / RAM / Resolution and Refresh Rate / Windows Build / Are you overclocking anything)
---
* Are you running any form of adaptive sync?  Ex.  GSYNC or FREESYNC
---
* Can you explain in further detail exactly what kind of stuttering your having?
---
* Do your other games run fine / noticeably better?  If so, what games?
---
If you are spending that many resources and getting oneshot by a puppy dog, you are not ready for SBQ.
---
Still, I feel for you.
---
Thanks for the tips, but how is the SBQ not an animal!?!? :P
---
Agree to disagree?
---
No, it took an incredibly convoluted series of steps involving placing and removing foundations, setting the gate down first and not moving it through the entire series of steps, using foundations to turn the single fence pieces around the correct way, and then snapping other things to the fence pieces that would allow me to remove what the fence pieces erroneously thought were "supporting" them. Having a very flat piece of ground to build on helped as well. It took me several hours of trial and error. Since you MUST place the gate first, it helps to build a square out of the large corner fence pieces to line up everything where you want it as a guide for placing the gate piece. Getting everything to go together and deciding the entire ensemble is positioned wrong is...well, it'll piss you right off. 
---
this would solve the problem for the most part
---
Yea I have a bloodied power fist with power attack damage in the stash but keep a 3* Vampires death tambo on me. Like I said I'm a rifleman but every once in a while I like to smack things in the face. Plus low level enemies dont need to eat my ammo. This games perk system is actually really deep. When TSE was great you literally just needed demolition expert maxed and could do whatever with everything else. Despite the balance being a bit steep I do like how it is now. Makes the perks feel more important. 
---
Lower level players do more damage to higher level players and receive less damage from higher level players. Whether that stops scaling at level 50 or continues indefinitely, I don't know.
---
Also, Watoga‚Äôs train station is sometimes graced by Scorched and Scorchbeast. So, be weary. 
---
Ah my bad then. Sorry
---
Cool, thanks for the tips -- since I don't have a good weapon, I usually just try and keep those pesky critters off the folks with the heavy guns. :)
---
Preach! Lol
---
I don‚Äôt know I think at this point they need to publicize any neat features that they add just to counteract the impression that they‚Äôre not doing anything to enhance the game.
---
i shot a load onto my toaster and it started buzzing and then it started to evaporate
---
Oh god I would love this!, +Thumps Up
---
No problem! I run almost the exact same build. Lol. I have 2 or 3 melee weapons i use too. Trying to find a vampire sword with anti armor effect. The search continues! Lol
---
I always say....nice gesture but make sure your dropping stuff they can use....I've no need to a level 35-45-50.weapon or armor that I'm only going to get again when I reach that level....
---
People need to stop dropping chassis oon really lower level players a boost sure but a Bain to weight for both the chassis and cores I now have to carry..
---
Ammo and stimpaks are the best bet
---
Sb‚Äôs drop ultracite plans. It‚Äôs not uncommon 
---
I got off one shot on the dog when the server hung. It didn‚Äôt kill me. It didn‚Äôt even get a chance to hit me. 
---
Clever creature you are indeed.
---
Silo has 3 hour cool down after launch
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 
---
Yah I think there is a 3 hr cool down but I thought it was per person. I know the last time we mass killed the SBQ (8 times) we swapped servers after the 3rd. 
---
I'm willing to try it but the communities for PlayStation is kind of archaic. 
---
Positively deadly! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Something that my wife has noticed while playing is that when high levels wander through the same zone as her, mobs of appropriate level to the high level PCs appear and kick her ass.
---
These people may be running from you, because your presence causes level 120 scorch beasts to appear.
---
Thanks all, I definitely have finished all prior steps. I was just making sure that transponder thing wasn't a bug. It has been super buggy today even by F76 standards 
---
Sounds good but I don't have a lot of caps. I have 3k in caps 
---
No. They cannot pick up your armor. Unless you drop it. If you drop it from your inventory then they can take it. 
---
Seriously though, I give these people plans, water, food...I also build them the best level-usable armor and weapons they can use with %200 durability. I remember walking out of the vault and getting jacked. üëç
---
yesss there's do much to do it's kinda overwhelming so I had to stop for a few minutes. definitely enjoying it!!üôÇ
---
I'm looking for a TSE Comabt Shotgun...your friend have one of those he wants to sell? 
---
It was the regular assault rifle.
---
It can be done.  When you consider all weapon/mod/armor progression effectively ends at lvl 50 it's not that hard to believe.  
---
I do like the challenge the nerf presented. My only real complaint is how many cards are dedicated to carry weight. If they just somehow worked those a tiny tiny bit better I think it would be so much more fun to play around with weapon builds 
---
Sure, could be luck or favor where you get "a good instance", but unlikely. Rubberbanding at Whitespring is pervasive and often included in complaints. I think Kotaku even had a recent article featuring a video of it.
---
I have very little "problems" with the game and, as mentioned, didn't even notice the health rubberbanding which is most very likely a client and server synchronization issue. I really don't think it's latency.
---
Totally on board for this, tired of swapping cards just to craft, fight a powerful enemy, or farm items.
---
I'm on XB1
---
I average three disconnects per play session, and actually quit playing after repeatedly disconnecting during a relatively long quest chain (forcing me to start over each time).
---
I've also lost my entire camp, I've been unable to leave power armor, I've had my entire quest log wiped out several times, and I get this glitch CONSTANTLY where VATS goes epileptic, making it so I can barely turn my camera or aim my gun until I somehow kill whatever I tried to use VATS on. 
---
I feel you man, when my mutations glitch and I get nothing, pisses me off
---
Yes, but I don't have the stats.  
---
Sorry for the delayed response, busy days these days.
---
Hmmm.  What are your temps looking like?  Download HWMonitor and run it for a solid session, and make sure you hit up Watoga.
---
[https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html)
---
Check your MAX CPU package temp, and MAX GPU temp.  Maybe something is throttling?  Let me know what they read.
---
Also, you could use Cinebench R15 and run a CPU benchmark,  see if she crashes or compares well to similar builds (just ask google to compare your cpu vs others scores, they're easy to find)  Also, run an Open GL bench as well, see how your GPU fairs to others, same as the CPU.

A little Prime 95 never hurts either to make sure shes running like a champ.  It's a harsh fire test essentially, but if she doesn't lock up or overheat during a 30 minute small FFT test, she is likely not unstable.

---
Cheers man, keep me posted
---
I got an anti armor machete but havent used it much. Do you think that would be better than the gauntlet?
---
thanks good to know, i was wary of people around when i doing that
---
if you drop it, people can enter it. that‚Äôs why you place it down by pressing the button you use to equip armor and it lets you place it down, once you do that, only you can enter it 
---
Note he wasn't attacking new players, he was just standing at a free fast travel location.  
---
Its been like this since FO4 IIRC. Sigh. 
---
With perks in gladiator it might be. 
---
To some extent, yes.  The Extra Claw isn't always there, but sometimes it is.
---
Likewise, there's usually some random Marine/Combat/Metal/Trapper Mod of some kind.
---
I can ask. He‚Äôs a night shift worker so he won‚Äôt be on till late. I‚Äôll get back to you tho. 
---
I‚Äôve never had the luck, and hearing of all the people who say they get nothing made me not go out to deliberately hunt them but probably will now
---
I'm not a fan of exploits, but that sounds like it would be amazing to watch. üòÇ

Emmett mountain disposal site. One of downward tunnels you find a lone mole miner then after hea dispatched you cant help but notice the meaty chunks of gore scattered about they are physical items you can pick up lol theres a couple barrels full that you cant interact with but yeah pretty weird lol
---
I see new players all the time. Found a level 9 today while the wife and I were playing. Teamed up and we built their camp by dropping in a fusion generator some water purifiers and brick walls on the open deck camp. They took advantage of our camp locations and opened up some places on the map. It was fun. 
---
Playing this game is like having a bad relationship. You know it‚Äôs bad. But you still keep engaging this person for non logical reason.
---
Were you playing on xbox, and did this happen last week?
---
Whether the scorchbeasts land depends heavily on the terrain and where you stand. However I've had trouble convincing them to land in most Mire locations, even standing right in the middle of the highway, so there are probably bugs. Cranberry Bog is relatively reliable but the queen often won't land if everyone stands on the fence. Sometimes it does the poison runs for a while too, and there isn't much you can do about that.
---
That doesn't sound like an unusual quantity of enemies for an SBQ run. Depends how many players you have and how long you take. Sometimes you just get a team that's pretty bad at killing stuff.
---
As a level fifteen, this gives me hope. Usually if I even see a triple digit level with a bounty from across the way I turn my ass around back the way I came.
---
This is actually listed in a thread on here called "bethesda please" or similar, with all the frequent requests listed there as 'seen by Dev and being looked at' so basically potential updates.
---
Honestly, I'm Lvl 320 with several hundreds hours in the game (aka loads of levels and I'm not actively grinding) and I only see rubber banding in the situations I listed.  
---
Can't account for the different experiences, however I am seeing rubber banding now, more than a week when a half after the last downtime, so could it be just the ongoing unresolved errors killing the efficiency? Again all theory

Steamrolling with heavy guns on fo76 ? Unlikely with the pisspoor damage they throw out, even perk buffed 
---
Casual L100 solo here -- only use PA for when I hop in on SQB; otherwise Hazmat in Nuke Zones (e.g.: Whitespring). Stealth/Sniper build. DR 342, ER 399, RR 76 in my non-PA get-up, and not Perk'd for extra DR/ER.
---
That's pretty far up there. I'm probably &lt; 100 levels behind and I've spent the last month exclusively running events to get the Ultracite Gatling Laser plan ...... But that's another matter.
---
PC? I stopped playing on PC because everyone I knew that wanted to play was PS4. Maybe the PS4 servers are different somehow.
---
Can I give you karma for the laugh this gave me? +karma
---
I want the Assault Carbine or the Bozar!
---
[http://junkmaster.wikia.com/wiki/Assault\_Carbine](http://junkmaster.wikia.com/wiki/Assault_Carbine)
---
I agree
---
They really should. There is meshes for the Chinese Assault Rifle in the game. It's weird that they didn't add it. 
---
Yeah, as I understand it, all the Powering Up quests yield generator-related plans.  You are guaranteed to get one of each before they repeat, so this is how you can get the Fusion Generator, Windmills, etc.
---
Well that just doesnt make sense.
---
Welcome to Mele Royale 76. 
---
Found a ranged weapon that can do insane amounts of damage? No good for Melee. . . NERF,
---
Found a method to evade Melee players? No good for Melee. . . NERF.
---
In fact, if it‚Äôs NOT Melee, pile on the need for mountains of ammo, junk, and the inability to one hit anything.  ALL HAIL Melee!!
---
Ah I read that wrong. Still, SBQ should not be that taxing on your resources. I waited until I had my perks and mutations sorted before launching my first nuke on my sexond character today.
---
My heart is happy that others know of Big Iron. 
---
I‚Äôm game, pm me if you want
---
I paid 1000 caps today for a two star tse combat shotgun. I was happy with that.
---
Yes and no the actual blast really did not hurt the weird HP drain did me in 
---
I just took a friend through this quest, he hadn't seen it before.  I realized after finding the bodies that you and I had both remembered it backwards - from the bodies I saw, Olivia had her arm wrapped around her mother after getting shot by Brody.   Just as sad, just in the opposite direction.
---
I suppose it's possible that it loads differently on different servers, but I triple-checked to make sure I was seeing it correctly.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76
---
Ouch, that the only way to get the Gatling laser plans?  
---
(I'm curious I'll look in xedit when I'm back at my desk).  
---
Yes PC, and I've seen enough reports of PS / Xbox side having issues when the PC is rock solid to think there are some differences.  
---
No. It was too powerful. 
---
There are other balancing issues to address, TSE was a way to ignore the issues rather than actually fix them
---
He‚Äôs on pc and has the same situation as you 
---
Well firstly you can just get the base level of each damage perk and have invested only 3 points for a 30 percent damage boost as opposed to 9 points for 60
---
When aside from 'hand penises' its the most memorable thing from New Vegas.. 
---
Well, that and having fladhbacks to The Strip every time 'Ain't that a kick in the head' comes on. Lol. 
---
Oh, and Johnny Guitaaaaar.. can't forget that.
---
I can confirm this bug exists. Had the same thing happen to me today. In PIP boy it said I was underweight. On the map screen‚Äôs weight display it said I was overweight and fast travel wouldn‚Äôt work. 
---
Afaik the Ultracite Gatling Laser plan only appears as a Cranberry Bog event drop. Unsure if it appears in treasure mounds or containers but I cannot find it. :\
---
Also Starched Genes, for mutations. They make the game 100% better
---
Yep, I‚Äôve gone from having never worried about plastic to always looking for it.
---
"Barely anyone" Wow you saw someone ask for pvp servers? 
---
Nope nothing left, happened numerous times to legendary ghouls too. 
---
That would be hilarious and it would make sense. I think a GM would be fired instantly, and with 20 person servers it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to have that kind of rig from an administrative standing
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing so far! It makes way more sense then only getting a 5% increase per rank up
---
And class freak to go with it 
---
Where can you get addictol?
---
I read that it was useful but mutations haven‚Äôt seemed to be a huge issue is it better for late game and raiding in the blast zones?
---
It's a must have
---
ghoulish level 1, 2 &amp; 3 stopped working for me about 3-4 weeks ago, don't waste your time with them. do what I did and pocket your levels til everything gets worked out. you'll be thankful to have 5-6+ levels banked 
---
Bloody mess and tormentor in luck.
---
Adrenaline in agility
---
Tenderizer in chr
---
Batteries included, gunsmith in int
---
Ah, thx. 
---
Oh wow Radworms takes that ability away, good to know.
---
Yeah it's some kind of lag where the server is not keeping up w the display.
---
I‚Äôve got his greatest hits on Cassette, CD, and digital. Underrated artist imo,
---
If you want it then buy it. If you don‚Äôt then don‚Äôt. Limited time items isn‚Äôt new in fallout. They‚Äôve been around since even WoW. Rewarding those that log on daily isn‚Äôt a bad thing. Stop crying me me me bro. 
---
Hoarders: Wasteland 
---
In answer to the question: no, ammunition weights have not changed.
---
I didn't know it was in New Vegas. I think I'm one of the few 18 year olds that like older music. 
---
Last patch.  Still hasn't been fixed lol
---
I‚Äôm not sure what to think that also. What did you test it on?
---
‚ÄúNot all scorched are evil‚Äù 
---
I carry about 4 or 5 rifles on me at all times. Weapon weight reduction armor is huge and I just run 1 piece with it. I like the challenge but when farming solo I wish I had the old TSE damage back. Just makes clearing stuff solo much quicker. I wasnt a guy that took all the legendaries from uranium fever or anything by myself I always switched weapons. I get the point of it all just liked the damage for solo farming. 
---

That is how a smart, sane person behaves. Don't like something, disengage from it.
---
I usually thrown a comment on some of these many "I don't like the game, uninstalled" ect. posts.
---
You are a bit unusual case since many such posters have rarely posted much here. It seems so odd to me how some random person makes I quit post when they posted here maybe few times in the last 2 months. You have posted more so it's more fair, even though still ultimately in vain, because we already have so many of these threads.
---
&gt;The biggest reason given was that this game is fundamentally flawed in a couple of ways. I'm not talkin about the bugs because that is completely normal at a launch. Everyone complains about how many bugs a game has that launched and pretends that they are far more numerous than other games, but I don't believe this conjecture as I've played in tons of games at launch that have seemed so much worse than 76. No, the fundamental flaws I'm talking about our to the design of the game.
---
Yes, highly agree. That is what ultimately breaks or makes any games. Fancy graphics, or opposite rather subpar graphicss, lots of bugs or technical flawnessness, it ultimately boils down to the concept of the game. What do you do in the game, how you do it, why ect.
---
I enjoy the game. I play it very much like the F4. Slowly just explore and scour every inch of the map. I might get bored once that's done, might stop playing, I really doubt I could seriously try to farm SBQs and nuke sites. I have no expections of DLCs, I know as they are going to be free, they are not going to be very deep, elaborate.
---
Once F5 comes out, I think that's going to sell pretty well just like prior. The idea is okay enough, it's all mostly familiar, but new map kinda gives a lot new always to go and find out. I think the biggest problem F5 might have, if the developers weren't really into making it, because of the bad reception of F76 many they were making. If you have good concept, you might still not make it well if you lack motivation. I could see some extra content coming out to F76 when F5 is few monts old, again nothing major, just to throw little new intrest into it from new players not having played it yet. Ultimately it's all about money. If you can sell 5000 more copies of existing game, you could put little manhours into it.
---
To get back in the bunker find another one of the veils off the dead girls and wear it, the veil opens the doors.  I don't know if you need it for the pilowski entrances.
---
I‚Äôd rather see 1 terminal somewhere on the map that manages a sales terminal for all. Similar to world of war craft. It would give max visibility to all items for sale for hot sellers and buyers. Camp vending machines limit viewers to those in your server which is whack. 
---
I believe the sluggishness is related to how the events are queued, and how quickly they can be cleared from said queue.
---
I can stand at a crafting table on an otherwise responsive server, and craft nuked floora, ammo, stimpacks, food etc... Literally everytime I spam the button, within seconds, there is noticeable lag, to the point of unresponsiveness‚Äî this is repeatable.  So when you have thousands (if not more) messages in the queue due to an event like SBQ, it just takes time to clear (if they clear at all)
---
Ive taken down an SBQ and had my rewards finally appears 5 minutes AFTER she was killed. Eventually over time, it seems like the memory is not being freed and it cannot approriate more memory‚Äî and it crashes with a ‚ÄúDisconnected‚Äù message.
---
I haven't lost my camp yet, or had any problems with any of my stash or vats. The most annoying thing that I've had was/is having to repeat missions.  Perhaps it's because I also dont play for hours at a time, and only really get to play on the weekend.
---
Bethesda support. 
---
We felt that melee having 9 perks 1 mutation and a fucking special stat was not over powered enough we don't want people to feel compelled to play ranged combat so we made it so all repairs on ranged weapons now cost transparent flux.  Which will be released in a later patch which has no eta.  Melee repairs shall henceforth use wood and disinfectant.  
---
We are also giving melee another special stat and 2 more mutations.  We hope this makes it so no one is compelled to play ranged or sneaking which we feel destroys the spirit of the game. 
---
Yeah very annoying!! Was just fine til the last patch... go figure.. fix one problem (lmao) and add one to take its place.. 
---
&gt;I was today years old when I learned this
---
&gt;
---
&gt;&amp;#x200B;
---
I think the longer the game goes on the more creative the "die hard" community will get which will only be for the better
---
Mini guns are kind of bad, though.... queenie has, what, 200-300 armor? Even with prime+zealots, Mingun is like... 25 damage a bullet. Add in 60% from all heavy weapons at you‚Äôre at... 40? Against 300 armor that‚Äôs like... 10 a bullet.
---
(Not real math but it‚Äôs something like that)
---
Im pretty sure bleed and something else aren't affected by pacifist (could be rad damage just can't remember off hand sorry)
---
Same! I never used the tse unless I was solo. But it was so nice to have that extra help when I needed it. I do miss that. Even before the nerf I never was able to one shot scorchbeasts though. But I wasnt blowing through 1500 ammo in 3 hours of game play either. 
---
I'm currently using vanguard armor, with one life saving piece. 
---
I know less about armor than I do perk cards lol. I've played fo3 and 4 so many times it's ridiculous but this is my first falliut game where I've really had to figure out the perks and armor on such an intricate level. 
---
End of March for first pve new stuff 
---
I was nearing level 25 &amp; had ran into griefers a few times already when I was a lower level; so I started being cautious. In some building a higher level suddenly called me by my gamertag and asked if I could use a complete set of power aromor level 25 including fusion core. Totally made my day &amp; restored faith in people. I still use it as I havent made much progress in the game due to time constrain. (I play on X1 and PC on PC I barely made it out off the vault).
---
So whoever you are: again TY!!!
---
I am a bit OCD so even though I am still low level I usually have a ton of stuff. When that happens I just get a work bench (the junk yard one is a fav of mine) &amp; then unload bunches of bags around a camp fire I set up. I also set up all different work benches and beds and protect it well enough for visitors not having to worry. I leave one of the water purifiers open for anyone to grab some &amp; food of plants or recources etc.
---
I usually dont stick around .. I figure I'd appreciate the same.
---
I wish one could make signs so one could leave a note of sorts. Or you know it appears next to ones name /tag. Would make it easier.
---
Until this game gets better / more stable I have no interest in building up my own camp. Its easier to just get a workshop.
---
It be nice if all those freebies one leaves behind wouldn't be lost just cause of a disconnect. 
---
Now:
---
I sorta wandered into the Ash heap area early on and  ended up in a dire situatiin without food and water as Super Mutants &amp; everyone I ran into were all crazy higher levels. I finally ended up asking my son to log in and come rescue me by bringing me some badly needed supplies and taking some of my load of stuff .. 
---
So I'd say look for low levels in notorious difficult areas they prob wandered there by mistake; I am sure they appreciate getting supplies ..
---
Also. I honestly don't get griefers. How shitty must their (real) life be, that the only thing that brings em joy is to to spread their own misery they experience in RL .. by being a shitty person to others: online...
---
Shakes head, shrugs shoulders .. 
---
It been better if Bethesda would have made it that one doesnt drop any loot if one gets shot by another player; only if one dies due to actual game play / fighting. Would have cut all that out.
---
Capture a power plant workshop. You'll get a brand new one every 7.5 minutes. If the plant isn't powered up, slap down a fusion generator and you're set. 
---
Amen to that, let's pretend I never mentioned it.
---
Stop crying about this please. 
---

---
They're just stupid rare. I saw one ages back.
---
How did you stay focused on levelling, I got to level. 15, just kept. Getting killed by every thing when. Tryigg to do missions, hunger etc enemies players, I gave up haven't played in a month
---
I'll buy that to a certain extent, but why do the servers seem more stable shortly after downtime and increasingly laggy and unstable (even on "new" instances) as the days go on..
---
Only mission I've found is mayor for a day where you end up loading the holotape into the computer on top of the building.. that one never changed being kos to the robots.. very interested in knowing what other one there is to do there as I've done every other mission there is! Would like to find a new one..
---
Oh yeah I found some references to that. Im yet to do Enclaive.
---
they run low fast but if you run the constructors half off perk you can make a decent defense grid of 4 or so rocket turrets and every hour it refills some 
---
this lets you slowly rebuild / expand a workshop over time without any real cost and if you get kicked you didn't pay anything so doesn't really matter 
---
To bad it relies on game mechanic exploitation. I prefer more tactical raiders over game exploiting raiders.
---
Prevents auto scrapping of mod items in your inventory. Has nothing to do with mods on your gear you want to remove or put on any other weapon. 
---
We can't give you more PvE content because we ran out of glue to sniff and Todd ate all the good cardboard.
---
Seriously who looked at this model and went...shit.  PvP.  Fallout needs more PvP.  It already barely happens 200+ hours and I have engaged in PvP twice...always in self defense.  Friends of mine have even less.  But more content for PvP to justify the fact that melee is so broken it hurts 
---
They could just add an option to automatically decline all trading requests.
---
I hear ya. I run a piece of vanguard, a life saving piece, a regenerating piece, a chameleon piece, and an auto stim piece. 2 pieces have fall damage reduction so I take 0 damage from any height, 1 has weapon weight reduction, 2 have food drink chem weight reduction. 3 have AP refresh rate increase and the other 2 are like +1 perception and +1 luck. Armor is HUGE. When I'm at full health my resistances are like 361 ballistic and 402 energy. I dont even bother with power armor unless in a nuke zone. Granted I also have grounded and scaley skin mutations. 
---
Heaven forbid I don't see a 10 day old post about something in want to include in a post mostly about something else. Go away.
---
This happened to me once. I ran up to a low level to give em some plans. I was about 90 something and they were around 5. They kept running from me, unaware I could see their name on the map. I finally turned my mic on and really gave chase. 
---
They ended up hiding behind some little structure. I finally had enough and yell, "listen you little shit, I can fucking see you! I'm just trying to give you these goddamned plans. I have like 30 copies that I dont need. I'm just gonna leave these here, take em if you want em, or leave em, I don't care anymore."
---
I left a ways, crouched and used a stealth boy. Snuck back. They thought I left and grabbed the stack. I walked up to them, popped back on my mic and yelled, "fucking thank you!" If only I could have seen their face!
---
Yes. I've used two fall damage pieces, and regularly jumped off rooftops in Watoga. 
---
The crap damage is balanced out by the high rate of fire guns breaking every few seconds.  
---
Just another broken thing about the PvP system. BGS will just make it worse with the next patch. I enjoy this game, but the PvP is garbage, and that‚Äôs being disparaging to garbage.  I‚Äôll stick to other games for PvP.
---
Great. I keep getting thrashed in the silos. Gonna try equipping all Troubleshooter fear. 
---
Even EA had roadmaps for their games SMH
---
That sounds like an awesome set up honestly. I havent thought about mixing and matching as much as I thought the vanguard stacks and that would be better. 
---
I also have bird bones and marsupial and goat legs so I take hardly any fall damage so that's covered. But I may have to start really looking into better armor now. I havent gotten anything with good effects on it. Usually hunters wooden legs and crap lol
---
Hold their breath, stay the course, add garbage to the atomic shop.  This game is a dumpster fire that ignited a coal ore vein under the dumpster.  Even the media can‚Äôt report the coal fire forever, it will never stop burning, just continue until no one cares anymore.  In the end if people continue to p,ay they will continue with the business as usual model of striping out fun elements from their games until it draws to some natural end.  Me, I‚Äôm betting on them giving you nothing at all but attaching a Bethesda Game Studios tag to a withdrawal line in your bank statement, you know. . . Keep the fan boys happy. ;)
---
Fireproof also gives explosive resistance, it was added somewhat recently.
---
Also invest in tank killer
---
When did they state this? Just wondering because id love to know more.
---
They can grief and troll and only got a limited time damage debuff. While those that kill them are marked and get nothing.
---
This is why every chance I get I stop at a station or my camp and dump junk to stash.  That way if PVP is initiated(I neither look nor play for it but it happens) no big loss other than pride.  Lesson learned playing as glass cannon.  Unscrupulous players will grab your bag even if you die whilst helping them.
---
Boa combatldd were at Grafton pre patch. Haven‚Äôt seen them anywhere since. Might be reward items from events now but I haven‚Äôt got any. I have gotten heavy combat plans for legs and arms thru events tho post patch. 
---
oh nice. its easy to bypass though as if you run tank killer i can ignore 45% of armour and chance to stagger.
---
and if people use grenades or Gamma gun the not moving armour isnt the best.
---
Your better off with str8 damage reduction sentinel armour
---
My issue with the game, it‚Äôs been out 3 months and things this simple aren‚Äôt implemented 
---
I put away my junk in a stashbox at 
---
What do you think is the highest jump point? Those high rise mansions in ass heap?
---
Reduces explosive damage
---
A marketing ploy?
---
Thanks guys for showing a idiot some common sense! üòÅü§£
---
Nothing has changed if that's what you're asking
---
Rad sponge if you are playing on teams and spending time in blast zones. Theirs also some good ones in perception. 
---
Hey guy  I complete the update for strong back and rat-pack perk , update my armor to deep pocketed,  got a total carrying capacity of 270-80 or so, but when I use power armor this effects seems to disappear and I got overencumbered. I check weight and says 250-255, I guess its because once you use power the game force you to takeoff your armor . Is there a way you can fix this can wear the armor with power armor just like in fallout 4 or do the ability transferible to power amor. Its fun you can lift more weight without power armor.
---
I know you're being facetious but, seriously.  DROP YOUR SHIT.
---
So basically it‚Äôs still scaled wrong? Boo ok I‚Äôm gonna have to use a power armor I guess lol
---
I put my stuff in my stashbox before I go out adventuring/when I run into them now that way if you attack you get nothing or close to it.
---
I believe it's compounding.
---
Assume you had 20% weapon reduction and a gun that weighs 20.
---
1st bonus = 20-(20*.20)=16
---
Next bonus=16-(16*.20)=12.8
---
My opinion...I don‚Äôt think it was set up to be just a shallow game cash grab....I think they just Hoped that it would not be as bad as it turned out and then pulled all resources away.
---
Prison riot. Wardens vs prisoners. 
---
The dumpster sounds like it has more game mechanics than the game lmao üòÇ 
---
There's a message in the lobby about a citizen complaining about not being able to find any waste baskets as well.
---
I was just watching some vids on Anthem...and it made me think WTF ..... they got it happening!
---
Rad worms buffs all stats by 50% so when u have them everything is better the. When U lose radworms everything gets nerfed 50%
---
This happened to me last week. Had to confirm with my teammate I was in fact swinging that fast with my all rise lol
---
Since patch i have not seen a single dense plan in any vendor same goes for a number of other plans. PC
---
[Somebody's watching me!](https://youtu.be/7YvAYIJSSZY?t=53)
---
I guess. You assume wearing normal armor into a nuke zone will ever be a thing.
---
Where is pumpkin house.  Been playing since Day One but never heard of it.
---
I didn‚Äôt realize that. So you‚Äôre meaning that if let‚Äôs say I got 20 tato, 20 corn, and 20 mutfruit plants and put a tiny fence 1x1 it should deter enemies? Or if I build no fences, then the computer generated enemies won‚Äôt see it as a threat?
---
Yea the game has scaling for pvp. So technically any level can kill you.
---
I was reading some people got their radiation resistance to match hazmat suits without power armor but still took 12/s radiation, so yea lol
---
My friend jumped off the highest point on the monorail ....but with bird bones and survived no problem
---
If this happens to you, why does it not happen to everyone?
---
It's fair enough considering that' been officially said, as well as what's said here, about dev room. Vaults are kind similiar area and not everyone has been active enouhg here to know plenty of players have reached them by accident and few intentionally to explore them out.
---
Bugs matter when a developers' 4th game in a line is filled with bugs 
---
You have a lot to look forward to: I've made a new character out of boredom six times!
---
(You can only have five characters at once, so you'll have to delete the extras as you go.)
---
Im not able to stand still because Im role playing a PTSD ADHD character.
---
2 months later im here looking.  Ingnoe the fuktard.  We appreciate the help.
---
Nice. I still have the hum. Support acknowledged there is a big. 
---
Yea I like my new guy. I wish my blue print knowledge transferred but other than that it‚Äôs cool.
---
Yeah I came on here to make a post about a problem that doesn't exist with a fucking video of it happening because I'd rather bitch about a fake problem on reddit than play a game I like. What the fuck is the point of comments like yours?
---
How much have you noticed about Vault 94 changing every patch?
---
There hasn't been an update in the last two days..
---
I have all three models, I have the least amount of issues on my one x, the original one is constant crash fest.
---
Ironically the s has issues only in one spot in white springs 
---
Hahaha nice one then you'll need the players reduced damage armour that's 8 or 15% reduction per piece of amour 
---
I lost hope for 76 after the first week when I realized the game is PAINFULLY boring. 
---
Im still in relative disbelief how boring it actually is! I‚Äôve fired it up a few times in the last few weeks and didn‚Äôt even clock 20 minutes before my eyes glazed over and I turned it off.
---
I don‚Äôt know how some of you made it all the way to the end game...
---
Happens to me all the time. Stray bullet hits someone‚Äôs camp. Wanted. 
---
And then some level 120 comes to collect the 10 caps. 
---
Debunked
---
They need to add more creatures. There are a lot of animals they missed opportunities... mountain lions, bob cats, coyotes, raccoons, wild hogs etc. Etc. I could envision some of those animals being awesome enemies. A little research into the region could have added more creative enemies
---
Bullet sponges will never be as fun as proper endgame boss battles.
---
I'm on the original. It's about 4 years old. Could be that, but this is the only game I have problems on. Hell over put almost 3k hours into free-to-play Smite and that's crashed five times since 2015. 
---
Don't buy it. This game is a flop right now. Give it a year or more maybe. Right now they are abusing their fan-base too. 
---
A lot of animals in this region*
---
Thanx!
---
I miss that Service Rifle. Weapon diversity in New Vegas was great
---
Fallout 76 for all its faults has a really good customizable system to create characters.
---
lol
---
You can save it 
---
Im level 11 right now. Probably havent chosen my Perk cards as wisely lol but thanks for the tips.
---
I've noticed it too. Based on what I've been able to glean from it all--the good and the bad, without Rad Worms, it's a connection issue. When you get a good connection, things work very well.
---
It also seems that 90% of the time the first server I get connected to when I begin to play is below par.
---
Seems like planning my build is a main game-plan. Thanks for the tips.
---
I propose they don't. They aren't equipped and weren't equipped to make this game and do it right. They aren't equipped to consider the desires of a playerbase over the experience they feel people should have.
---
Fallout 76 is circling a drain and even if the atom store had been priced reasonably we still would have gotten here with how horribly the game and everything surrounding it was handled.
---
Is a constant influx of money necessary for a live service? Yes, yes it is. Does that make it okay? No, not inherently. If a service is good and treats its users respectfully, then concessions can be made for a form of entertainment like this. Here's the thing. The live service model has existed for a long, long time. It's called an MMO, and if you made a good enough product, people continued to pay you money to play it, and for a long time, if you didn't make a good enough product, people wouldn't subscribe, and you rightfully failed.
---
Now we have these new things, these new live services, which are most often based around an inherently predatory monetization geared toward acquiring money from players with no upper limit, often for full priced games, and sometimes games that were full priced, and already have subscription fees attached, one notable example being Elder Scrolls Online, ANOTHER Zenimax product. Just because you like this product and want it to continue doesn't make the product okay or mean it should.
---
Also: Yes, arcade games were and often are terribly exploitative, shareware and other demos were GREAT, as was the era of DOS freeware. Expansions for MMOs were ridiculous because they were already taking money from players to play the games monthly. DLC for standard games had its pros and cons, but overstepped. The Loot Box thing is STILL happening and if you have to remember it like it WAS a thing you yourself are part of the problem.
---
Gaming HAS changed and evolved over time, a lot of it for the better, but that doesn't mean we have to accept the bad too.
---
I know. I meant to uninstall the update prior to the constant disconnects.
---
Adventure mode with ZERO pvp would be fun.
---
Cool, thanx for the advice.
---
They can‚Äôt hurt you properly unless you hurt them. You might as well just run circles around them.
---
Thanx, yeah i've heard getting a frame can help a lot, gives you more carry weight too I believe. 
---
Yeah its like that.
---
If you remove 1 part of PA the same thing happens.
---
Basically a sealed full suit is required
---
So wait... are you complaining that you're going to get "griefed" to death in PvE still or that you're going to get "griefed" to death in the PvP mode... because if it's the former slap damage is still weak as shit if you have pacifist on and don't retaliate.  The stories about "griefers" running around one shotting people with slap damage were 99% reactive BS and 1% dupers stacking magazines and bobbleheads with their TSE's.  And if it's the later then... don't join the PvP servers?
---
Had a level 50 one shot me only to be fucked up by colonel gutsies, dropping all my loot and the loot of many others. He wasn‚Äôt high enough level to retrieve his loot.
---
Stats do change. You can completely change your character with different perk cards which would in turn change your stats. You should know this.
---
Thanks that‚Äôs what I was looking for 
---
Yes

---
thanks, do you happen to know the drop rate?
---
No you still need to tag shit
---
If you're using reddit as a metric for who asked for pvp servers or not then that is a hilarious mistake. 
---
No just terrible tbh
---
I commented on another thread something similar. They would sell a shitload of atoms if they offered up cool wastland gear. Hell, even a couple new paint jobs for excavator power armor! A sweet katana blade skin for chinese swords! AR skins for the handmade! More outfits like the travelers coat!
---
aw, thanks though
---
Uh. . . Wut?
---
Me and friend did this with plasma grenades a while back
---
Like the guy below said, no profit off the shop = no free DLC. Think about it instead of getting defensive for Bethesda :)
---
I listen to cavemen banging rocks together personally. 
---
Most enlightened 18y/o in the world btw
---
It is funny they made that quest so annoying and yeah, no checkpoints. I was interrupted 3 times by various life things and finally got through on my fourth. The second time on all I could think of was, man I am going absolutely love killing you two when this quest is done. Nope. 
---
A massive crocodile at Wavy Willard's and call it Crocolosus (sorry if I butchered the name of the slide). Some mobs could be rad-snakes.

Sorry you're broke. 
---
I‚Äôd say the people who got one-shotted are mostly people who have a workshop and people started the claim then teleported to them. It‚Äôs not clear from the game that it works that way, it shouldn‚Äôt work that way, and yet it does. 
---
The crit meter only resets when you use the crit or when you leave the server you're on
---
So I should play this game?
---
How did you message him? FO76 has no messaging system.
---
Thanks 
---
Thanks for the confirmation
---
Idk I seem to remember blizzard trying this idea, but I'm not 100% on that
---
I'm honestly not sure what other people price them at so I'm gonna just throw a number out there and we can use some of that Charisma to see about haggling?
---
What do you think about 1.5k caps as a starter asking price?
---
People did ask for a separate PVP mode. Bethesda is just going about it in the worst way possible. In no world should progress carry between modes. And also, what people WANTED was separate PVP and PVE servers. Instead we're getting PVP and semi-PVP servers. 
---
It's happened to the best of us. I wouldn't get too distraught over it. There will be many more nuke launches and plenty of opportunities. I launch a nuke almost daily. I will play on the server a bit before I do to make sure it's a good server. If not, I'll do what I can and typically get DC'd. If it's a good one, time to hit a silo!
---
Pretty much! Basically it's Responders v. Brotherhood style of thinking.

Blow the dust out of the cartridge then bang the top of the console.

I‚Äôm going to redouble my theory that what you found is a mislabeled deathclaw nest, I inspected some other deathclaw nests in the game and they are the same, down to the eggshells.  
---
The strongest man in the world could get killed by the weakest. Makes sense. 
---
I honestly enjoy the little dopamine hit of killing a Legendary enemy then going to find out what I have.
---
The problem is they don‚Äôt reliably drop Legendary weapons and they are too spread out for it to be fun.
---
They just need to replicate the amount of enemies found at Whitesprings at different areas around the map, and have them constantly respawning without us having to relog.
---
I enjoyed spending hours and 1000s of rounds at Whitesprings farming legendaries, just tired of the same scenery and relogging now.
---
Thank you
---
maybe cos the guys in a fallout sub and didn't recognise an iconic song features in one of the games. idk tho people be fickle 
---
Seriously some sbq fights that is even more valuable than laying rounds into her majesty.
---
I've only found one so far and can't remember where I got it hoping tongetbthe whole combat armor set so I can wear it
---
I actually found the Combat Armor Helmet as a random spawn at Flatwoods in the small tent camp just near the outside.  It has the two low level ghouls sleeping in each tent and two Radstags hung up.
---
Ontop of a suitcase is a random cosmetic head piece.  Usually glasses or a visor or something.  But one day it was a Combat Armor Helmet.  I was surprised.
---
If you are in PC I can craft a few for you so you can scrap them and learn how to make it yourself. IGN: jchamlin
---
If you are on another platform, you can farm helmets from a potential spawn point near the Harper's Ferry vendor. Search this sub for the post with pictures of the spawn location.
---
I would use my Hazmat much more if it wasn‚Äôt a pain in n the arse when it came to putting my armor back on. 
---
No idea how, but i can craft them, problem is, i uninstalled game a couple days ago so won't be able to help you.
---
Scorched Earth event is broken. Weapons, at 200%, break before she regenerates. 0 things load to loot. The 3* dog that shows up during the event that you can‚Äôt kill (you know, the one that‚Äôs been around since release). 
---
It's kind of stupid in my opinion. Have fun though.
---
yeah I forgot to put on passive mode and tried to help a workshop defense and two level 100+ tracked me down for a 10 cap bounty just to steal my junk I had on me because my stash is full. I moved on but the fact is the WANTED system in of itself can but used to grief and or bother other players. I understand what they tried to do with it but that bounty claimed should be earned regardless if they have the caps or not actually that is a wonderful idea make it put their caps into the minus and they have to gain the caps back to come out of the - this might not seem like a big deal but I am not sure some one would want a 1000's - to their cap purse.
---
Good luck getting those expended supplies back. Mine wasn't so traumatic, but I lost a calibrated leg in the Feed The People event. While putting the ingredients in the hopper, it took my leg out of inventory. I contacted Bethesda and their response: In this event, you need to located and deposit canisters of food into the food-processing machines in Mama Dolce's Food Processing while fighting off enemies and repairing the machines.
---
All of the canisters are inside Mama Dolce's Food Processing.
---
Canisters are never inside containers.
---
Note:¬†Please make sure not to¬†deposit any other items into the hopper besides the canisters as it is impossible to recover items deposited in the Food Processing Machine. 
---
Really.. no shit.
---
Now, this is actually a bug to be fixed on the next update.
---
You can message people on the Xbox by going to their profile. Not sure about PS4 and I‚Äôve heard you can‚Äôt on PC. 
---
You know, after that last last ItV post where they asked about feedback on enemies, as well as an earlier post about feedback on events, im getting the sense they have no fucking clue where the roadmap is. They should probably lookup -  they've drifted off the road and are heading straight for a cliff, lol.
---
If anyone is wondering what this is: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=999RqGZatPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=999RqGZatPs)
---
That would be great, I‚Äôm also on pc. When do you think we can meet. IGN: Ranger_Rancor
---
Deal.
---
What platform are you on?
---
The transponder does works but the path to get to it is quite long and you start up by having to go the opposite direction of where it is due to the layout of the place. At first you go straight then when the path is blocked, take the tunnel on the left. The rest of the cavern is a bit less confusing than the very start.
---
pc
---
That's some Atlas shit. 
---
Guess Redeye wasn't fibbing.
---
I've seen the occasional mod, but not mods.
---
Bethesda said all plans are now static, but there is some rng. The watoga station vendor will occasionally have sturdy and randomly have heavy combat armor plans and sometimes neither, so there is still some rng there
---
There's some in various places but there's usualy one in the medical bay hangar at the Morgantown Airport
---
Deceptive distraction.  
---
It was broke after the Hotfix after the last patch.
---
Wait so are online players given a notification when a new player is being released from the vault? I just got the game as a gift from a friend so haven't tried it yet. But thatd be cool to see a bunch other high level players giving a welcome to the outside lol.
---
Just keep the one you like....I just kept the X01
---
At the moment with all the bugs....Nil.
---
yep its bugged out atm with the last patch. wouldn't use it.
---
If you take 2 ranks of sun kissed in endurance, you will almost never need a rad away. Looked in my inventory today and I have enough that I gifted out a bunch to a lower level player and sold all but about 15 (emergency stash) and they got me almost my daily limit of vendor caps.
---
Take a few ranks of ghoulish to help with healing in nuke zones.
---
Mutations may not be required for end gaming, but they can be incredibly entertaining and can give a revitalized feel to the game.
---
For end gaming, glow hunter (?) (Damage up vs. Glowing creatures) really helps
---
Yep and I think it‚Äôs what is also affecting marsupial from working also weapon swap from wheel esp while wearing power armour and also weapon not shooting I. Power armour at times.
---
Ga,es big hot mess atm....with new bugs every day since last update...it‚Äôs on a landslide... Bugs making more bugs
---
I think this is an excellent suggestion for the lock-picking and terminal-solving cards, at a minimum.
---
In Fallout 4, a basic part of the game design was switching out weapons &amp; armor and deciding when to use drugs &amp; stat foods. Picking one's load-out, customizing it to one's play style at that particular time ‚Äî that's all good stuff.
---
Arguably the perk cards are merely an extension of that for a multiplayer environment.
---
Picking locks and solving terminal puzzles likewise go back to, and before, Fallout 4. I have no problem with having to earn the higher levels through experience or questing. But unlike tactical choices involved in the other perk card selections and situational switch-outs, there's no individuality or creativity involved with the lockpick and terminal cards. It's the same damn thing every time, for every player and in every circumstance.
---
Switching in and out the perk cards for lockpick and terminals, in other words, once acquired at the top levels, is *nothing but an unjustified and unjustifiable pain in the butt.*
---
Lol see I found all and kept them and only use my x01 so I have to agree keep what works
---
&gt;Worried about getting banned for Bethesda putting an area in game thats supposed to be inaccessible lol. So glad I didn't pick up this dumpster fire of a game. 
---
Why are you even here? Go back to fucking whining about Runescape. 
---
Through xbox messages.
---
The constant "caution" and "danger" are bugs? I thought it was a stealth nerf....
---
It‚Äôs those DEMOCRATS in power atm lmao .
---
Take me home...?
---
My bloodied dragon does tremendous damage, add to that a calmex, add a 50% vats crit, add Tank Killer, add riflemans, add firing the dragon without having to reload at all and then add to that all my buddies doing that as well. Never killed her in 30 seconds, but it doesn‚Äôt take long if people don‚Äôt come down there and boost her health up into the stratosphere. SBQ is easier to kill with a few people than a large group.
---
Im level 111 currently but havent played because my weapons are explosive plasma gatling and they just dont work so try to stay away from them lol
---
Dense mod is the God of All Armor Mods. You will no longer fear vehicle explosion and scorchbeast screech.
---
Yea my stuff is mainly trades. I have gotten I think 2 pieces I use on drops. Fortunately I've gotten drops most people want... ie, sentinal and cavalier stuff. I understand sentinal but I traded it for better things from a solo point of view in my opinion. I'm odd though, my build isn't heavily teetered to vats with a rifle build, I run a mixed set of armor, I dont want assessins sentinal, and it doesnt have to match cuz I wear outfits because it aesthetically pleases my eyes. 
---
Ding ding finally it‚Äôs all making sense 
---
I analogize the switch-out process to meditating, and the cards themselves to the selective benefits therefrom: 
---
By spending a few moments reminding myself of the quiet breath, balanced posture, and keen eye of a good rifleman, I'll be able to ensure that more of my rifle shots go where intended and with better effect.
---
And now I'm approaching a blast zone. Just as I'm switching into my power armor, so too I'll meditate for a moment on how I can conserve my power core resources, etc. 
---
Ah, the sun has emerged! Now if I mediate for a few moments, my very cells will begin to heal from their radiation damage, reversing the normal cycle of life through my learned metaphysical powers.
---
The cards are but metaphors, Grasshopper. :D
---
&gt; What kind of story would Obsidian have come up with?
---
It would have been set on the West Coast and the entire thing would be totally different.
---
If it is nerfed that much then...we‚Äôll go stand in the furtherest corner of the map and enjoy stealth lmao ü§£ .... so many bugs ... I think it‚Äôs hard to know anything any more 
---
Dense Plans for all types of armor no longer exist in the game. Now people hop server to try their luck on the mods instead.
---
Other than the fact that DOTO got really boring really quickly storywise. 
---
On pc?
---
Found heavy combat legs plan today at harpers on ps4 
---
Its at watoga station if i remember rightly.
---
but if you are trying to trade because you are low on caps you might want to add the system you are on for people who can/want to trade.
---
Wow that is helpful. 
---
&gt;But yea totally agree with you I want PVE content not PVP content.
---
30 bucks for an expansion every 6 months?
---
Many MMOs tried that and it didn't work out.
---
It might just be all the agility, but it seems to work pretty good. 
---
Energy/rifleman? Isn't energy weapon a joke?
---
Had this happen to me last night. Tired of being robbed by the game.
---
Ps4 
---
That‚Äôs what I was trying to figure out but I figure a lot of the perks overlap (rifleman, tank killer etc) tbh I haven‚Äôt been able to use them much because a lot of them are higher levels
---
No wonder morgantown high school and watoga high school are always empty!
---
This is something like what has happened to me twice in the past few days during my vendor runs. In Watoga train station both times.... A gang of ppl were there and attacking anyone that was trying to use the vendor. They'd keep attacking while someone was in the trade menu and caused them to push the person across the train station (away from the vendor is the point to block barricade them or w/e with their bodies). And they all had like bleeding and stuff on their melee weapons for ongoing damage after each strike and each of their hits were pretty strong with the chems they were doing and other stuff they had stacked I'm sure.. If you tried to ignore them while in the vendor trade screen it meant you can end up dying pretty quick even to the slap and bleeding out damage they grouped up on you.  
---
"Just heal with a stim, some food, and ignore them" is often what I hear ppl say b/c it's "just insignificant slap damage" but that shit adds up quick and you can end up wasting a lot of food and stims on just trying to use a vendor.
---
"If a PROBLEM is cut off, two more shall take its place". HAIL HYDRA!
---
It seems to move her health bar along. I am trading for an AA Minigun so I will tell you how that goes
---
Just make them a 0 cost, so they can still be equipped, but won't count towards perk slots. 
---
Either that, or give us a passive slot every 10 levels. 
---
Pvp with a balanced cap reward would be a better idea.
---
Good luck with all of that.
---
Legit enough :)
---
Bethesda's not going to add anything. Smart money says the last "addition" to the game's going to be the PvP servers, and even then only because they already announced them.
---
&gt; Whether the scorchbeasts land depends heavily on the terrain and where you stand. 
---
Maybe, but what I'm describing is happening in places where I have brought them down before but their behavior and movement patterns seem  very different. 
---
I'd love something nerdy like that but I'm on PC. Maybe we can just get a lot of nerdy lore archaeologists together on a discord server and that was we get to cover all platforms, post pictures, pin things, w/e.
---
rifleman and tank killer don't overlap, they synergize. Use both of them together. If you are using a bolt action pipe rifle, you can even add in the pistol damage perk. I'm a level 170 using a bolt action pipe rifle and I one-shot almost anything.
---
I just went up to the general on the second floor at The base talked to it and I didn‚Äôt have to do it a second time. The dmv sucks though
---
And I want a pony, but guess what? It's not gonna happen. Bethesda's done with this game. 
---
That has been my experience as well, until very recently.  It does seem that I am killing well over  50 percent while they are still  the air.  This is in places where I have repeatedly killed them on the ground after landing.
---
Youd think that, but I have a 3\*Furious/40% swing speed Ripper and it sucks ass, even at 200% repair it does 25 damage and takes ages to kill ghouls
---
This is what I am talking about.  Seems more of them attack at once.
---
PvP is just so unfocused. The only reason to attack someone is simply to be a dick. There needs to be a system in place to give people to go out and fight. They really dropped the ball by not using the faction as part of the pvp system. 
---
I don't believe a single person who complains about the lack of human NPCs. It was just something to bitch about until the "canvas bag fiasco". 
---
The story is absolutely fine. Compared to its contemporaries its leagues ahead when it comes to storytelling. 
---
I've rarely seen a game company thats this verbose. Multiple patches a month since release and constant updates on what they are working on. Anyone who complains about "bethesda being silent" is trying to latch on to anything to have something to bitch about. When the game released so many people were screaming "This game is broken and bethesda will never do anything to try and fix it nor will the listen to us" And since then they've constantly been talking to the player base dropping multiple fixes a month and adding QoL fixes and now its "STOP TELLING US THAT AND TELL US WHEN NEW CONTENT IS COMING OUT" Damned if you do, damned if you don't.  
---
Usually just use the gatling gun because ammo is so cheap and weighs nothing. I have a blooded explosive .50 cal but since I primed the receiver I try not to waste the ultracite ammo.
---
It feels like they didn't really try, but it's atleast kinda a proof of concept. The best part about the game is the first SBQ battle. Especially if you know next to nothing about it 
---
U didn't kill the SBQ, you were there when it got killed by other players. 
---
Yes, the loot is like that. That is why many grind it.  U could get a sentinel assassin armor piece or a legendary rolling pin. The plans and other stuff are a good bonus over SBQ loot. All in all, the rng is too widespread providing loads of potentially crap rolls.
---
Never gonna happen. This game is deader than the residents of post-war Appalachia. I'm betting the PvP servers will be the last piece of new "content" that we'll get.
---
I agree as this is jus a small %of the actual players
---
Yeah i come. Not for caps, but for your tasty meat.
---
How are you such a high level? I‚Äôm having trouble finding things to do at 37. 
---
So what you're saying is that by starting a workshop claim I get around the PvP consent-requiring slap exchange with its owner?
---
best way to test your stealth, is to sit under a scortch beast and see if it detects you.
---
Normally, it spots you easily, however with enough stealth perks. You could sit under it undetected. I could crouch and move easily under it without being detected.
---
That's what I said here at the end of Week 1. Ofcourse I was downvoted to oblivion and told that I'm just a hater and I hate this game.
---
I never hated the game. Even now I still don't. (I just want it to do better) 
---
I've just always hated the whiteknights and the corporation behind the game. 
---
Can‚Äôt imagine using the Gatling Plasma. It‚Äôs such a beast for the one and a half cores you get to shoot out of it before it breaks.
---
Bethesda: "Don't worry! We're putting equal amounts of effort into both new content and bug fixes. 'None' is a percent, right?"
---
Agreed, loot will load faster and she's easier to kill with fewer people if you're geared and perked well
---
No. Pvp is just that unbalanced. They do basically the same thing to each other. Especially with melee. He who hits first... wins. 
---
For 10,000 caps.....
---
trolling? vault 76 is best place to get rid of bounty. If he was trolling he would make trapbase or stay in team. For whatever stupid reason you get pvp flagget with team if you kill someone with bounty so they can defend him. 
---
It sells in game for 1,500. 
---
You need to play New Vegas, it's the best Fallout by a mile.
---
You should be allowed access to more of their inventory like weapons or armor if they're too poor to fight 
---
I got done once by some dude with a buzzsaw at the top of the world train station that'd try to rip low-health rad builds up (who already have low health and sometimes let it go to near-zero from starvation during the vendor run) in the last seconds of that person loading, before they could move. 
---
I keep a bit of low level gear in my stash for whenever I see someone about to leave the vault for the first time. I put on my vault-tec jumpsuit, drop the gear in front of me before they exit, and pretend to he an npc.
---
As soon as they come out of the vault I yell "Happy reclamation day!!" and usually follow it up with something along the lines of "please accept these gifts on behalf of vault-tec." then I will just stand there occasionally saying something simple like it's scripted dialog. 
---
I don't think anyone has actually bought it, but it's entertaining to me and I get to help the new guys out. 
---
Yeah i was thinking about this, but then you don't see if people are in their workshops. Actualy you don't even see on map if someone is hunting you. Thats not good for snipers :D
---
And I thought this was gonna be a rant about PvP balance lol.
---
Not for me. I explored all of 76 before the 100 hour mark. Was nowhere near thah with any other Beth game. 
---
Granted, I never fast travel in single player games unless they integrate it in a RP friendly way. (carriages, boats, etc.)
---
**YOU PROLONG THE INEVITABLE**
---
Awesome shit!! 
---
yes i think  ties into it when i had a ban i couldn't type in the in game chat on ark so i assume same thing
---
That‚Äôs not having fun, that is just paying money for stupid emotes
---
I know you think you're being helpful, but shuo up. I'm level 92 and have gotten along just fine playing this way. I carry around a lot of crap for a reason. Just am trying to figure out why i'm carrying less guns and armor right now and my weight humped by about 500 pounds. 
---
git gut.
---
Stay in forrest, do corn soup farm at your camp, collect weights at gym on north of flatwoods (lead), collect weapons from your enemies (steel), supermutants drop gunpowder. Thats all you need to stay killing mobs at events. At level 20+ go to ash heap. 
---
Precisely what do you know about their player base declining that the rest of us don't?
---
This game is half built on spaghetti code from an engine with roots from 10+ years ago. Why is it that hard to believe that maybe people experience glitches that others haven't? There's a reason the "It just works" meme existed long before 76.
---
Best song from New Vegas. 
---
I use it as a compliment to my handmade and tesla rifle I only pull it out for mob control situations since super mutants love to pull out sledges and go YOLO.
---
Why it is stupid, with right gear low level players don't stand much chance, but then they kill you, becouse you start doing bullshit and accidentaly let them kill you. That happens.
---
wow...but how do you fire the dragon so fast?
---
I'm working on having max level sets of all the PAs. 1 arm and 1 leg from goal.
---
&gt;Name a game as flawed as 76 that was released to the public? Eve Online: Trinity. Remember the joy when people found out it'd delete their boot.ini file? 
---
Wow that's curious. Hah hah lol. Most of my computers have been upgraded and migraded from system to system. That kind of bug could easily hit me as my OS might be on second or third partition on fifth drive. 
---
I remember about 2003-2004 I had a system that I went over 2 GB ram, and I experienced that I could not boot any frigging Win9x because it uses parts of DOS as bootloader and DOS being 8 bit it doesn't like having more than 2 GB of ram as then it only can see about 2 MB, and Win9x doesn't boot with 2 MB. And because pretty much no one had that much, I found no help how to fix it. (I used Win95B to play some old games as Win2000 couldn't drive all of them)
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/about-the-boot.ini-issue
---
There wasn't patch last week. Maybe tommorow.
---
How does unyielding armor help with farming 3* weapons?
---
don't pay more than 1k for a tse weapon.
---
Heads up buddy, anyone throwing higher than that is trying to scam you.
---
Unless it is a tse gauss rifle/ combat rifle/ hunting rifle/ lever action rifle. These range between 2k-3k.
---
why?
---
Thanks for such an awesome game, I'm loving every minute. May I request something utterly ridiculous, that belongs on the bottom of everyone's to-do list? My granny panties are depressing. Could we, (eventually, maybe) get new patterns? Not even anything racy, like, flour cloth prints. It could be a stupidly long questline, filled with thinly veiled bathroom humor and power tie jokes, repeatable each time you want to change the color. It's just, I love the sparkly red dress, but the upskirt shots when I'm sitting are terrible. And the 'Take a Picture in Your Underoos' Challenge. Grimy.
---
Seriously, though. Thanks for everything you do.
---
but i can reply to my own post without a 10.minute wait
---
That's what you people have been saying since before launch. The whiteknights are the only ones leaving. That's because 90% of them weren't interested in the game at all and just wanted to be edgy little rebel kids.
---
Nothing says cool reddit boy like defending corporation against the oppressive evil videojame players btw. 
---
I clicked this post unbelievably fast when I saw the notification... Not disapointed a single bit
---
Sneak works for me, until i get spoted then it is fucked up, in past i could use Escape Artist with knife, stabing enemies in face while "recrouching" now when i am 44512meters away, it still doesn't hide me.
---
In what trailers ir media did Bethesda say all this stuff was possible to do in game though? I keep seeing people say they‚Äôre said that they cannot roleplay as a raider or trader and do all kind of wildly unreasonable stuff that FO76 certainly doesn‚Äôt give you the tools for, but have not seen any videos of Bethesda promising anything close to that.
---
What do you mean I didn‚Äôt kill it. I was literally there damaging it from the star with 8 other people?
---
What's your IGN?
---
I was around 55 and only had the nuke left to launch, but started a 2nd character. Ive been having a ton of fun with it, and its been nice to try new things like camp setups. 
---
Plus Im actually able to be smart with my Perks and SPECIALs now that I know how the game works lol
---
Great story but when I sall Big Brother I thought this was going to be an Enclave conspiracy theory.
---
[You can oneshot most players.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg) With ranged. Don't cry, git gut.
---
Shoot, switch weapons while reloading, reload that weapon while switching back. Doesn‚Äôt always work, and haven‚Äôt tried it recently since I haven‚Äôt had a go at the queen for a bit. Even without that exploit, the bloodied dragon with vats crits is a glass cannon to be feared, can reliably one shot a lot of enemies from stealth. 
---
I think something else is comin in March tbh. The simpler adjustments needed for survival could have been done already I'd imagine, I think some sort of PVE content will come with it so it's not jus for one crowd and so that the new mode will be fun and not jus the same stale content.
---
I assumed the cap is 3. Thanks for the info!
---
They are abstractly a rare thing but aren‚Äôt particularly useful and nothing in this game is really very rare. They mostly cost a ton to build to get the effect of items you have a million of.
---
and good books they are! (loved The Rising/City Of The Dead)
---
The lower my HP the more Damage I do with my Mutation set-up so Unyielding capitalizes on that for me by raising all of my SPECIAL except for Endurance 
---
Someone probably picked up your bag while you were still afk
---
A creature so big you can see it from almost anywhere in the map
---
"Please dont stab other customers while they are shopping"
---
I know its talking about Raiders, but always gave me a chuckle because it applies soo much to players
---
Less secure*
---
At your level the weapons you use most likely won't even deal damage bc of her resistance. A fatman in this games is also pretty bad. 
---
RIP Battlecry Studios
---
Games fail and shut down all the time. Just having a cash shop isn‚Äôt free money. 
---
wrong place to post this dude 
---
That was my favorite as well.
---
Interesting that you know how it would be, when even beta version is not out. 
---
sorry
---
I use semi auto setups with hardened or hair trigger receivers and have pretty decent luck with  sneak attacks and what not. Not against SB or SBQs but almost anything else 
---
 PVP is borked, the just need to give it a pass.
---
It's hard to decide whether or not to approach a high level player lol I don't want to get two shotted. What platform do you play on?
---
And here‚Äôs another weight bug I just encountered: I couldn‚Äôt run but I could fast travel. Once I FT, I could run again. 
---
So buy it then.
---
there is actually a shack near 76 where you can server hop to get one.
---
Lewisburg on the tables is a great source of plastic and if youre in power armor you wont be constantly interrupted by accidentally sitting down
---
That's happened to me three or four times today with enemies spawning inside terrain with miniguns.  Looks like a Landshark.  Only choice is to relog.
---
I would if I had the caps. 
---
I dont understand how damage reduction works here I must be missing something
---
While I mostly agree with the TSE nerf, I completely disagree with the current meta. And if the meta was more balanced, I don't think you'd view TSE as something that was necessary.
---
It's clear that melee is just way easier. Less maintenence due to less hits to kill, No bullets to farm, and all around just super super powerful.
---
I actually like that Melee is good. Not a lot of games have good melee. However, I think you should be repairing melee weapons more than guns.
---
Maybe make guns like 5x as durable and keep melee where it's at now.
---
It's a shame they couldn't get good enough scripts to actually give enemies ammo count, etc. But they should do a better job approximating how much ammo that enemy would have left. No dropping 3 rounds of ammo. If they can shoot 300 rounds then drop 300 rounds. If they can shoot 50 and die before they can shoot, they should drop 50.
---
That's just how I feel about ammo, though. I don't think it should be something you're constantly on the search for like a survival horror game.
---
This game just isn't that. It's a MMO-lite survival-lite with more focus on the former. Please adjust the meta to such, Battlecry. 
---
I also play on Xbox1 but I haven't experienced any of these things in my time playing.  The Bulk item scrapping thing has been a bug since the "hotfix."  I have seen some glitches such as killing a scorched and watching the body fall down a flight of stairs and the head remaining right where it was prior to killing it (it's part of my loading screen now.)  Another funny moment or glitch I had was when I killed a friend who has a 5 cap bounty with  TSE shotgun while he was next to a vehicle.  Killed friend, blew up car, body launched into orbit, only regret is I did not have that recorded but I nearly passed out laughing to hard from it.
---
I don't have too many issues with the game personally.  Connectivity sometimes sucks, sometimes no I don't have any issues.  SBQ fight can be abysmal when everyone on the server is there fighting and once she drops the loot takes forever to load and the event takes forever to register as complete.  Loot tables are bad and Bethesda should feel bad for them.  
---
I don't own 76 yet, but I saw news articles in main-stream gaming news where people were getting banned from accepting items dropped by exploit duppers.   
---
Even if it turns out it wasn't true, I still wouldn't take anything to be sure.
---
There is lots of pvp, lots! Idk why they thought 76/76 killed players with bounty challenge will be enought i want 760 and 7600 challenge for that!
---
I do [Eat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg) my enemies!
---
lol ur weapons are all at lv25. Ur fatman is doing the damage of one shot from a lv 45 tse handmade. (Fyi, fatman accidently got a nerf.) The SBQ gains a bigger health pool for every player included in the event. I can assure you for a fact that your presence was more of a burden to everyone else, had they not have the sufficient fire power. Not to be a dick or anything, but stating the facts as they are. 
---
You got super carried and its completely ok, most SBQ fights go that way, but what is irritating is that you are not even satisfied with being rewarded for the carry lol. 
---
SQB loot is kind of broken, it is what it is.  Also you helped kill it she be a big old bag of bullet sponge.
---
I think you're missing the point. They didn't include their level to say "Look at me, I'm level 250, look at this big dick I fucked your mom with last night", but to underscore that they've been playing the game for a LONG time and thought they'd seen everything, only for this low level player to show them something new.
---
They're not saying "I'm hot shit!", they're saying "This game will surprise you even if you think you've seen it all."
---
There is a place in the Ash Heap that you can CAMP and has a cat called Murgle you can "adopt"
---
There probably was... but now they are just trying to keep the boat from sinking.
---
Been there a few dozen times, nothing.
---
Got thrown off the server during the Caverns part of the mission and had to start over again in Watoga. How many stimpacks, psychos and grenades did I waste? God only knows. Ughhhhh. Guess I won't finish that quest (or even try it again) for awhile. 
---
Oh ok. I was curious, too because with a level one protest sign melee weapon, I was making very minimal progress after I ran out of mini nukes. It was kind of weird because like you said, I shouldn‚Äôt be able to do anything at my level. Furthermore, it did more damage than the Fat Man. I guess it is due to my level 15 strength melee build.
---
I also would avoid gifts since I want to experience the new player experience as intended, and won't get another shot at it again.
---
I‚Äôve read about this location in the wiki, but I‚Äôve been server hopping for a while and haven‚Äôt found anything.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs only 24 hours for your first offense.  
---
or give a fusion/plasma condenser we can build in our base to to condense all of our cores into as few as possible
---
OK, I can see why they would need to limit the number of cards you can have active for this reason, but certain cards are just 'quality of life' improvements.
---
i hopped like 4 times before the hat spawn on the shelf gave me a Combat Helmet.
---
Not my first offense.
---
Also doesn't give me any advice on why I can't join a team.
---
I love the pvp here I do think there should be cap limit of 50 per kill tho. I'm level 73 or something so it ain't bad for me but ya for high lvls I see the prob. If players dont have caps you should be able to fully loot their dead body for to pay their debts
---
What did you said? I will find you and I will kill you !
---
I had to do that once I just messaged them and asked lol
---
Do people actually take on lvl 200+? I mean I don‚Äôt fight anyone but yea amount of caps lost to gain in pvp is crap 
---
Game is dead. They totally ripped us off. If they had any sense of honor they'd refund all our money. Servers will be shutting down soon. This game will become a legend - for all the wrong reasons. Criminal what they did to the Fallout franchise.
---
It is only fair when you are winning right?
---
Same here I found one in my first character but I deleted it after restarting a whole new game, now I have everything but the helmet.
---
The vendors have them pretty regularly now 
---
Had my first encounter with one inside my base. Was checking out my new Daisycutter when i saw a massive wing out of the corner of my eye and nearly shit myself. My base never knew what hit it  
---
My rng just sucks
---
I think OP have full stash and don't even need that junk like other high levels do. 
---
Yeah, nah I'm good. I want to keep my brain INSIDE my head.
---
Agree completely, they went overboard with the pricing here. A very poor decision imo. I mean if those skins cost at most $5 I and many other would probably buy them if they appeal to us simply due to rationalizing it in or head: hey I won't buy a coffee today, instead I'll buy this nice skin I like. But asking a DLC price of $20 for a skin? That just puts everyone off.
---
Some crazy ass machine. Or hell, even make it a workshop or map location.
---
Yes, you do have the means to contest fairly, but there are alot of other additions to take into consideration. Damage resistance / mitigation / negating / evading perks influence your damage output as opposed to your opponent.
---
So in other words, If your opponent was naked, your damage will be curved up, even at lower stats, but keep in mind, they said nothing about curving your opponent's damage down. So, your opponent can 1 shot you if they have enough dps and you do not have the proper damage resistance to take a hit.
---
Seriously a PVP arena ran by another Rose who also thinks she the original Rose, and plots to kill Top of the World Rose 
---
Yeah see now theres a reasonable solution i like that idea, 50 caps per kill. Right now its just not worth it as much as i want to get involved its too un-balanced. 
---
Which vendor sells the mods?
---
RNGesus is the lord and savior of the FO world
---
as raider said it should be caped at 50 since no diff real diff after that level. 
---
I've noticed some rng still as well but haven't seen a lot of the armor mod plans that used to show up, such as in Grafton.
---
Read some of the inside vault stuff it‚Äôll tell you all you need to know 
---
You'll be suprised i was followed by a level 41 the other day maybe because my health was showing as low due to unyielding armour but i actually had to stimpak myself and deal with it before i lost 200 to that "try-hard"
---
low karma thus the cooldown
---
Ya I'm wanted right now so I'm out 70ish caps soon lol, fun times!! I also think that with the new pvp mode comin up that adventure mode should be more PVE  friendly for the ppl who want it
---
Hey I'm on PS4 I have a 2se double barrel or pump Action i might be willing to release to someone for a few caps 
---
I don‚Äôt have enough caps. I want to try to get it cheaper. 
---
I don‚Äôt even launch nukes anymore.  Not even worth it.
---
I'll have a look soon and see what legendary melee weapons I have might have something your interested in also 
---
Oh damn...
---
:D i saw with may naked eyes when a lvl5 radrat destoyed my metal wall and the turrets just remain passive...
---
From the pvp servers announcement, I think it would be sweet to hunt someone til they had to pop out of the armor. I would like to snipe that part in vats, and watch the guy need to repair the suit.
---
There has been a bunch of complaints about how people are forced to use power armor in game. I think it is a creative solution, and the event can be made rare enough that its not that dumb of an idea.
---
I would like to see cores last longer, not the opposite. 
---
Armor mods with legendary effects and talents can pass power armor. But why invest that much into it when I can just wear armor instead?
---
Add more skins and mods for power armor. Make it something awesome to work towards. Maybe even unique or set pieces. 
---
Saying shut up, its dumb isnt the idea.
---
There is a shit ton of tediousness in the game. I want to add some tension. 
---
To
---
Prevent spam
---
Lol wut
---
Like this
---
That man would make a wonderful sapper.
---
May as well of made the game set in Albuquerque New Mexico hahaha.
---
very cool, you should put some red lights on the back of it though :)
---
Ghouls and robots in whitesprings. I should have checked if anti armor perks would show any change.
---
Answer: they knew idiots like us would buy it.
---
Had the same thing happen to me while I was in the mystery cult's console menu. Getting slapped dozens of times, back out of console, find a lower level guy whacking me incessantly with a board. I kill his ass, and immediately a chameleoned 100+ annihilates me from a corner. Barf. Pretty lazy way to get a bunch of junk.
---
You're right, and seeing that the word derives from 'the night [Nacht] before [a period of religious] fasting' "[Fastnacht](https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Fastnacht)" actually is the best spelling IMO.
---
I hope the 'high level players' realize that some of us like to play solo and don't want you around even though you might 'give them stuff'?  In other words, we are not looking for charity.  In fact, I have turned off all voice chat entirely so I can't speak to others or hear others.  In fact, I play the game in a 'lone wanderer' Fallout 3/4 style.  I suspect many others do the same although I fully understand that I'm not playing the game as 'indented'.
---
As an example, I was working on a questline and someone kept pestering me by moving in front of me and such.  Annoyed me so much that I server hopped...which is what I usually do these days when people start hanging around too much.  
---
Leveling is kind of silly after a certain point. It's not like if I go up 50 more levels my character will be that much better when I reach level 200. I've had a level 60 kill me for a bounty and I've killed a level 240 in straight PVP. 
---
Lmao thats something i can enjoy the thrill of being on the run, its just when you die more than once it becomes a bit of a frustration. 
---
You've got a very good way of looking at it all though i like your ideas! Take note Bethdesda!!
---
Nobody sings a ballad like Marty Robbins did. 
---
With the pulse mine on his hiiiiip. 
---
&gt;How hard it is to make a passive mode so nobody can harm you and your base? 
---
That's one sollution but the problem you describe is the bounty system. Bethesda made it to act as punisment system but it's a joke that can mainly used to grief.
---
Some people can "active" PvP if they feel like they can take the challenge, by creating a large enough bounty on themselves mostly harmless way, and then fight the players who choose to come.
---
The assault rifle in this game and 4 doesn't even really feel like an assault rifle. It is clearly based off a MG, and most people keep it as a semi auto weapon for the best damage per shot. Hell, most people avoid it entirely because the handmade is superior, but that's an issue for another thread. It would be nice to have a full-auto-only assault rifle that actually was an assault rifle, even if it used 5mm rounds instead of 5.56. Bringing back the BAR from dead money for a .308 rifle wouldn't hurt either. For a game so focused around the FPS elements, they're missing some key weapons. I guess I never realized this because in every other fallout game one of the first things I do is install some weapon mods
---
Hey, here are some bugs I've found and some suggestions:
---
**BUGS**
---
* Sometimes when I get back to my camp, the holotape "Volunteer Training Camping 101" is dropped (actually duplicated) in the ground and I can't pick it backup (but can play it)
---
* The tent and large tent (camp miscellaneous) won't stop raindrops when it's raining
---
* When you fast travel back to your camp, there is a big chance you will spawn falling off to your death (if you built your camp near a cliff)
---
* When moving your camp, there is a big chance that you won't be able to rebuild it from that automatic stored blueprint. Even when its green and you know for sure that it should be possible to build it there (since you can rebuild it piece by piece on the exact same spot)
---
* Sometimes you will get stuck at "aim down sights" while in 3rd person view (the screen will not be zoomed in but you wont be able to do anything until you press the aim button again)
---
* Some flora that you've already picked up will still show it's "collectible model" when you revisit the area after a fast travel (and you won't be able to collect it)
---
* When you log back into the game, some weird "+ 50 XP" messages pop up and shows me I'm level 1 (until the rest of the game loads up)
---
* Sometimes while sneaking, you will be forever in \[CAUTION\]
---
* Sometimes enemies will follow you [underwater](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aoc8xq/underwater_weirdness/) and do nothing? Also they don't seem to have a swimming animation
---
* When I use a stimpack (pressing the quick heal key, H in my case), a [weird directional pad icon](https://imgur.com/a/lPWWb2Y) shows up even tough I don't have a controller connected
---
**SUGGESTIONS**
---
* Add the fast travel mat (present in workshops) to our camps
---
* Possibility to change the quick slot keys
---
* Separate grenade key from bash key
---
* Change the paper bag model (that players drop when they die) for something else more immersive like a pile of junk or something
---
* FOOD tab, DRINK tab and CHEM tab would make things a lot more organized (the AID tab always becomes a mess)
---
* Add a vendor machine / shopping post to our camps so we can sell our stuff to other players (I heard that this is already being discussed?)
---
* Scrap ammo? Sell ammo? I don't know, I find myself just tossing my excess/unused ammo around since there is no way to recicle / sell it.
---
* Add a button to eat / drink items without having to collect them first, either from a container or from the world (just like you can play a holotape by pressing R in PCs). Just like [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/17608/)
---
* Add the possibility to quickly grab &amp; equip a weapon from the ground / corpse (maybe even drop your current weapon when picking up a new one)
---
* FO4 garden plots
---
* Weapon racks, armor racks (manequins), bobblehead displays, magazine displays, power armor visible at power armor station
---
* Let we craft radios again! (currently we only have the jukebox)
---
* Visible holstered weapons (just like in FO3) -&gt; I hardly believe they have time for this but god I would kill for having this back. It ruins the immersion seeing your weapons disappear into thin air
---
Loving the game so far.
---
Just trade it, with someone. Don't avoid player interactions.
---
Try the Train car. And there is another spot above on one of the buildings at a diner like area where a random plan will spawn on the counter
---
Don't build at workshops. I mean, what's the point right now?
---
Maybe FO76 makes use of Xbox messaging for team invites. And since your banned from Xbox messaging the team invites feature is broken. I don't know anything for sure, just making a suggestion.
---
I know at least one method has been known and reported since the beta that has still not been acknowledged publicly by bethesda, so it certainly is still happening
---
Every vault needs a janitor. No wonder you're cranky.
---
Watoga is the place to find it these plans I'd say. It's a heavy bos area. I keep going there
---
I'm on now. Send me a friend invite and come and find me.
---
Yeah buts hes attracting... deplorables
---
Thank you. Well said, man.
---
Miscreants... 
---
Just did waiting for you to accept.
---
Let‚Äôs be honest the handmade is more of an assault rifle than the actual assault rifle 
---
Yeah it is empty for autistic people who run away from other players. 
---
There are people who played it for more than 600hours (i have over 430 now) If there is nothing to do, how did i spend all that time? 17days in row. lol, like comeon.
---
Give me downvote, or whatever, but we all will know, that you are stupid, cause you go on internet say this game is empty sh\*t, when you can't have fun in open world with loads of options.  You need order to go to bathroom too?
---
I went to truck stop  tonight and noticed all the cars so close together, blowing white springs parking lot to hell with All Rise I hoped I could get a massive chain reaction of cars popping off, it wasn‚Äôt as great as I had hoped. 3 big blasts. 
---
Then 3 big scorch beasts right on top of me for no apparent reason.
---
Exploding cars in this game is one of my top 3 activities. Aside from weight management, and finding novel places to drop 1 Star weapons for others. 
---
Good comment, have an up vote 
---
YOU, STOP, THERE IS NO PLACE TO TELL TRUTH ON THIS REDDIT!  
---
Yea... if you're running a low hp build that's the risk you take, especially if you're stupid enough to starve yourself on top of it. Either way that situation is incredibly unique and is more a problem with loading and not PvP in general.  Also... it's junk, you're not losing anything you can't get back with little effort.
---
Yeah those ugly monsters wearing boots instead of slippers, i must murder them all.
---
Lfg for what? Walking around? 
---
Actually, you just need to be near enough to it when they down it. Confirmed on legendaries in Watoga yesterday. I did not tag, but still got loot when my team killed them and I was right there. For science. 
---
Lock picking and hacking should be separate. Like level 10 you can attempt skill 1 locks and terminals, at least these two through leveling. 
---
You must be having a tough day. Hope the adoption goes well.
---
Since nobody else expalined it and you‚Äôre young: it sounds pretentious.
---
Lots of 18yo‚Äôs listen to old music. It‚Äôs not a unique thing at all. It just may be in your grouping, and you only don‚Äôt realize this because you‚Äôre young and haven‚Äôt had years and the years of exposure of social traveling you will, soon, to the point where you realize this.
---
So it comes off both as pretentious and naive at the same time. Like r/iamverysmart but instead iamveryunique.
---
And really, a little life pro tip: never define yourself through statements about yourself, it always looks really bad and is probably just an aspiration. It‚Äôs common, especially at your age to want to define your individuality, but do so silently.
---
Let people figure you out instead. You‚Äôll get laid more that way too.
---
Yeah i use a semi auto hardened tse handmade and its pretty strong with sneak bonus. 
---
opened the thread thinking it was gonna be rant instead got good story. not disappointing at all.
---
I put over 400 hours in my main, i am near 200level. I can't make alt, becouse i can't play without 20agility, mutations, all plans i collected and things like being enclave general.
---
I tryied several times, but ended back on my main after few hours.
---
Which is bad, becouse i wanted to make charracter for automatic rifles / heavy guns. Maybe some day it will happen.
---
Or being able to hide/show hidden cards.
---
But you should need a minimum special requirement to equip them, otherwise some builds could get away with one perception and still be able to pick locks.
---
That sounds like some shit I‚Äôd walk right into and lose caps. God I hate them taking money when they kill you. I work and search my ass off for caps. 
---
I assumed it was more "Commie sympathizers" than Raiders. You could be right, though.
---
Best 3d fallout, anyway.
---
You what? I don't have that.
---
How about being shot at (but not hit), through solid concrete floors? Enemies in this latest build have psychic abilities, I swear...
---
There is no preset for any asian when you are making charracter. There were no asians in vault. THERE WEREN'T COMMIES!
---
platform?
---
Nah, I personally don't like game exploiting strategies. If you ambush me I don't mind.
---
Very nice. 
---
Things have bee awful for me this weekend on PC.
---
THIIIIIIIIS
---
Oh ffs Bethesda! Now I log in and its showing 2 star with rad resistance as expected. What in the literal hell!? How does a legendary effect not display an entire star!? All good now I guess, sorry.
---
What platform are you playing on? I haven‚Äôt had much tune to play recently, but I‚Äôm still onboard with the game... don‚Äôt do much grinding or any PvP really. Would be more than happy to add a fellow player and team up if we‚Äôre ever online at the same time. 
---
Non-existent, would be my guess.
---
I had a punk in full Grognak costume and one shot kill Legendary Axe, he killed me 4 times with single shot, couldn‚Äôt even find him to fight back. Cost me over 200 caps in 5 minutes. At 7am. I was pissed. 
---
Sell stuff to get caps.
---
That‚Äôs true shit, ask dudes mom who caught that lead pipe.  
---
People still play this game? Damn
---
Stuff &amp; things*
---
Me too. I had something like 80 kg in plans and recipes that I‚Äôve been dropping for low levels, but it‚Äôs taking longer than it should because they don‚Äôt understand. Sometimes I make a few fully modded level 1 hunting rifles and some ammo but that‚Äôs hit and miss too.
---
well.. looks like we now ask for new cosmetics to be only delivered by macrotransactions. Just a reminder: This is a 60$ game. 
---
I like to think they all "trancsended".
---
Ever play Red Faction Guerilla? Because......... 
---
there are higher
---
back at the beginning dropping a nuke on whiresprings gave immense so gains now it's not so great
---
I'd say it's about 90% done, only minor areas still empty, quests can obviously not be started.
---
First time round it was only the first room behind the vault door, and the lighting was not done (no shadows etc). Then later the corridors, furniture etc. appeared and last patch put in trash mobs by the looks of it (mirelurks) 
---
For scorchbeasts you need hunters, as they are animals? not scorched
---
It actually works really well against super tough robots when you are a lower level.
---
Found one in Harper's Ferry. If you put the vendor bot to your characters left and look to the next building ( south, is blasted open ), you'll see a safe and a medkit box and a yellow wooden box I think. Found my helm on the railing, just sitting there.
---
Ur poor people gold!!1
---
I know that I've moved on from the game. I know that nobody on my PS4 friends list plays anymore when there were like 20-25 playing around the time of launch. Some have even gone back to Fallout 4. This subreddit alone is full of posts saying that they're leaving and will come back if/when things improve. 
---
No, I don't have detailed numbers or anything. But the amount of people still playing the game has clearly gone down significantly. 
---
Probably one of the few times I've actually been mad at the game. Was trying to help a friend launch a nuke for the first time, but Everytime I got close to the reactors after the first crash it just froze. Felt worse for my friend.
---
There are no friends in the barren wastelands. Just you and that Somerset special. 
---
Live freee or diiiiiiiiiiiie
---
since when is there level scaling? I've had level 10s and 20s do nothing to me while in light metal armor
---
The last Fallout RPG :'(
---
love the camp and the video and the music.    very well put together!.
---
he has common sense? Literally every game loses 30-50% of concurrent players in their first 3 months. Also just take a look at your friendlist. 
---
There seems fewer and fewer players now so I often re-login the same section when server hopping these days. 
---
lol black powder minigun.
---
I'm guessing thats a ridiculous number.  (I genuinely haven't a clue.)
---
Does 500 caps seem more fair??
---
I would if anyone had any 5.56 or .45 to trade for .308, otherwise I'd rather the convenience to just do it myself.
---
Unless your playing Fallout 4 because you can still sell them for full price. Maybe you can in 76 as well.
---
I avoid 200+ level players as they have full Assasins/sentinel armor. Not killable for me.
---
If you are interested in a Sniper build, You should give the gauss rifle with silencer a try. use stealth armor and some Stealth Perks to do more damage, also there is a Perk to increase your precision if you aim. 
---
Probably be in the atom shop later. 
---
Thanks guys!  Took a few hours but I just made one
---
Yes there are a lot of butt hurt negative Nancy‚Äôs that love to down vote as well lmao
---
I‚Äôve heard that rumor. Haven‚Äôt seen proof yet. And maybe it‚Äôs just that is primed,  but I‚Äôve got a zealots primed 50cal that just melts scorchbeasts. Feels like it does as much per bullet as my AA Gatling gun, with a way higher RoF
---
What time and what system? I usually run solo but am ALWAYS looking for friends. No one in my group is normally on when I am on so I'm always running solo. Feel free to reach out! My GT is the same as my Reddit name! Xb1
---
Yes, I'd love some perks being passive.
---
I like to min-max and my build is full of garbage weight reduction cards.
---
It's just a reddit thing. They see something that resembles a meme and they can't let go of it. That's generally how they work here. 
---
I'm not denying that. They promised more content, and the last thing they want is more negative PR for not delivering it. But how much effort is going to be put into this new content? Will it be enough to bring back everyone they've lost? That's the question that needs an answer, and we won't find out until it happens. 
---
All I can say is that I'm PERSONALLY not expecting much. It's been roughly three months since release and in the eyes of some the game is in an even worse position now than when it launched. I don't want to be a Negative Nancy considering I gave the game nearly 200 hours of my own time and I'm posting on a sub-reddit full of fans of the game, but the "two steps back and one step forward" patches we've been getting don't give me much confidence in the future. I hope I'm wrong. I really do. I genuinely want to see the game succeed. But unfortunately we're seeing the result of what happens when a game comes out a year too early, and I don't think it's ever going to match the hype that many had. I'm taking a break due to lack of PVE content, but I'll come back. Hopefully they pull a No Man's Sky and turn things around. That would be amazing. But let's face it. The next gen of consoles is coming next year, and with that in mind along with a rapidly declining userbase... is it plausible to think that this game will ever live up to the hype that we all had when it was announced? 
---
Anyway, I hope the raids and new content give the game a new dose of life and bring players back. But they REALLY need to work on the bugs, and right now every patch is adding 2-3 problems for every issue that it fixes. It's just hard for me to have confidence in the developers at this point.
---
How about you put your head in the trash. Cos that's were it belongs :)
---
Well unfortunately since they decided to make the game online only and not release private servers for a year (or possibly ever at this point) you need to have the latest update whether you want to or not.
---
Thanks!
---
Not gonna lie, I've lost count of my pvp kills. Iove the pvp and can't wait for the pvp server. I agree that we need more substance.
---
I mostly bounty hunt and capture people's workshops when I pvp. It's fun and mostly harmless. I avoid attacking camps cuz that's evil.
---
Well the point of *GAMES AS A LIVE SERVICE* and charging 60 fuckin dollars for an early access game that's worth 20 dollars is that you'll constantly be refining, and adding new updates.
---
You could say they don't view this as early access, but their letter that came out before BETA says otherwise. Bethesda mislead their consumers. Instead they're putting all their eggs into the "Overhaul in 2020 basket". That's not what we were told. 
---
We're getting garbage 1-3 star drops now..........don't want to see what garbage perks get thrown into the pool with 4-5 stars.  Maybe a 4th star perk is "damages the enemy 10% more and reflects 5% damage back at you".
---
What we really really need is....
---
We should be able to LOCK our items in our pip boy so they can't be scrapped, dropped, traded, or sold.
---
Then any legendary items we have UNLOCKED should be able to be SCRAPPED for a 5% chance to pull one legendary modifier off the weapon.  That legendary mod would act just like a weapon / armor mod (a one time use to attach to any weapon / armor).
---
People can now farm and grind to their ideal build.  Bonus is it makes mass duped weapons LESS valuable.  Why go for a duped weapon everyone has, when you can effectively grind your perfect weapon for your build instead?
---
yep gone from playing every day for an hour or 2 to maybe 1 hour a week if that because since the last patch im constantly being disconnected and when im in the game its super laggy
---
0. Common misconception: Everyone I see on the internet = everyone. 
---
Not so. There was an interesting post here a few days back linking to some research athat shows that only about 15% of any game's audience interacts/communicates about the game online. Everyone else doesn't. So everything you know comes from this segment. 
---
2. You and your friend-group represent one of several audiences that have given the game a go. Old time RPG'ers (who are very skeptical of the whole MMO thing), Battle-Royale loving audiences who got told this is a multiplayer game and came to have a look, CoD/Battlefield players (who I keep having arguments here with, because they don't understand why they need all these complicated mechanics to make their gun not suck - they're used to it being all about FPS skils and not about stats), a huge hoard of people who loved skyrim for the scenery exploring component (and who are thoroughly enjoying themselves here, refer /r/fo76filthycasuals) and so forth. 
---
Of each of these audiences, a percentage came, saw and said "not for me", and a percentage said "you know what, yes, it's different from what I know, but It's okay enough to stick around". 
---
All up, these make up probably hundreds of thousands of players. 
---
And all up, nobody, not Bethesda and not anyone else ever expected all of them to stay. Many won't find what they like - and this is ok. 
---
The game is 2 months old. There is an expected taper-off from the initial swell of people giving it a go. This happens with any online game. 
---
So who is staying? No idea. I don't know of anyone IRL who plays. But I haven't known anyone IRL who played skyrim when I was, or FO4, and yet Bethesda happily became a billion dollar company selling these things. 
---
So just because your irl mates, or the 15% of online-interaction-keen audience are showing a down-tick... doesn't indicate anything. 
---
I think mod plans have been generally removed and you have to rng the mods themselves
---
Winkey face
---
I'm also xb1! Gimme a little to finish my food and I'll add you :) 
---
I'm sick of the crap loot drops as well.  Did about 2 hours inside a Whitesprings nuke zone tonight and 95% of it was 1 star garbage.  So bad that I didn't take ANYTHING home, not even to sell on the trading reddits.
---
Fantastic! I plan on being online tomorrow evening as I have been job hunting alot lately. Looking forward to playing! 
---
Keep the modded armor on a frankensteins monster chasis. You can easily craft armor
---
I‚Äôm L143 and have seen only one Mothman. At least I think it was one, as it was in Cranberry Big I‚Äôm not sure because I thought these mainly spawn in The Forest. 
---
Every player starts with 250hp. Basic sneak have 2x multiplier. So you need weapon with 125damage to oneshot another player. 
---
Now every point in endruance adds some hps but not much, you may met high level players with 300hps mostly. Now armor everya 7points of rezistance should reduce it by 1%. That means when someone is in T-51b power armor, he would get 60% less damage, if his enemy doesn't have any armor penetration. At level 35 you already can have some armor piercing perk cards, Example, melee perk reduces rezistances by 75%. So you need weapon with 175damage to oneshot high level guy in power armor with sneak attack. That is not much, so you can achieve it with any two hand weapon and melee build.
---
Wait for them to hopefully fix it but I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
okay
---
Go into Fort Defiance and pick up everything you can find and then sell the non-junk. Straight Jackets in particular are worth a decent bit.
---
Cazdors, now I would love to find a nest of them to NUKE INTO THE DIRT....lol
---
Even at high levels they were hard to deal with.  Aggro too many at once, goodbye health....lol
---
I'd love new bosses depending on the fissure you target.  Just make them larger, more tanky, more damaging version of the normal creature.
---
You realize you don't have to do the PvP mode? And Bethesda said PvE stuff is coming around the same time. This sub smh.
---
CONTENT
---
That's why all my friends quit.  Nothing new to do, see, or find.
---
It doesn't need to be completely new systems either.  Simple things like making AWOL Armaments occasionally spawn SUPER AWOL Armements with 3 x the difficulty and GUARANTEED 3 STAR REWARDS.
---
My first SBQ was unforgettable, and I‚Äôm glad to have shared the experience with a long time Xbox Live friend. Sadly the magic fades fairly quickly and now the fight seems fairly ordinary. But that first time... fantastic gaming. 
---
Thats why we need DPS meter in our pip-boy.
---
Because you‚Äôre comms banned, you will not be able to join a team.
---
What does you personally liking it, have to do with the objectively poor state 76 has been in?
---
Turns out I violated a Reddit rule. I've since fixed that violation and the post has been un-removed. Everything should be working now.
---
Stealth works, just escape artistan is fk up
---
L66 and I bumped into two at the same time yesterday killed one but one got away üòê
---
torrent it
---
Same actually lol tomorrow is resume day I'll hit you up later then
---
Also if you wanna see a Grafton monster I notice one spawn at Charleston every time I go 
---
&gt;when you can effectively grind your perfect weapon for your build instead?
---
developers actually hate this kind of gameplay because they can't hook the players with gambling mechanics
---
they prefer pure rng because it artificially extends the life of the game 
---
Its awesome before I go to sleep, I post my days journey, and when I wake up I check everyone elses...so much fun...
---
No, see, that's how a CoD'er thinks. 
---
The way an RPGer thinks is "How do I run a low health build **without** becoming a glass cannon". 
---
The game has a whole pile of damage **avoidance** mechanics. You couple those to your rad/low-health build and you're not a glass cannon at all. You just have to put the perks in the right places and meet the conditions that the damage avoidance perks set.
---
Best Fallout. The 3d gameplay is what puts it over 2, and mods put it way beyond. New California is fucking nuts.
---
What do you mean by radiator please?
---
Only when you're literally teetering on the edge of your last health point. If you're anywhere in the 9%-19% area, they can't touch you. Don't get fooled by low health. Rad build builders make it ridiculously hard to get at their health pool. It's usually easier to take down a random player with a full health pool (and a bunch of QoL perks) than a rad build with only 20% health but loaded to the teeth with damage avoidance perks.
---
The mothman will show up if you do that quest at the lighthouse east of vault 76. It‚Äôs impossible to do alone though, need a few people to be successful. 
---
It's likely an exploit, albeit a little tedious one. Take off adrenaline, go to Whitespring, get rad worms, put on adrenaline, kill to max it out, cure rad worms. Bam 30% damage boost compared to normal values. Do it over and over and you can get unlimited damage boost. 
---
Add me gt is s10lowrider

Well I got bored on my main plus I didn‚Äôt really specialize my character because I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing. Now that I have a better grasp on how to spec my character I feel like I‚Äôm going to have a lot of fun level this guy up. He‚Äôs already hitting like a truck and I still don‚Äôt have a super sleg. It‚Äôs only going to get better!
---
No vinyl? 
---
You heathen pleb!
---
Pro-tip: this is only acceptable in-game.
---
Woot love when brave heroes beat the troll horde
---
Yea I‚Äôve read everything this time. Now all the quest make a lot more sense. Somehow I glossed over learning about the scorched my first place through so its been interesting this time around. 
---
Yea I‚Äôm right there with you on that. I expect this guy to be a lot more powerful in the end 
---
I just scrapped mine this morning hoping to learn the pattern.  Spent the rest of the day pouring over reddit and goggle looking for info.   Server hopped on for way to long at various locations and still no joy.    Unluckily with my loot tables.   Wagh. 
---
I remember asking for this on 4.
---
400hours in game.
---
red eye Mothman (agresive)  can be spoted wherever you are on map, My first one was on north of grafton
---
purlpe eye mothman (friendly) appears after you finish lighthouse  event.
---
green eye mothman (scorched) this fucker can eat you while you fight scorchbeast queen.
---
Other cryptids
---
Grafton monster - one spawns in dryed river next to poseidon power plant (lvl10)
---
\-grafton day even have spawn of lvl 30/40 grafton monster
---
\- this is only mob i never saw scorched.
---
Snalygasters - mostly in mire, i got once huge pack of them on west of watoga in broken train depo.
---
 \- they appear as scorched in scorchebeast queen fights too

Or a No Man's Sky NEXT treatment. üòä

wow thumbs down..some people are wicked lol

strange

Would love some stickies with these important information

Are you using the PS remote play app on PC with ur own personal account or ur brothers? I always get an error. My way around it is the PS TV.
---
how do i get minus 7 points?
---
The primary account on my ps4 is my brothers accpunt. I use remote play on my account however. For it to work you must make sure that your ps4 and pc are on the same network, for example using the same WiFi router. Manually pair the ps4 to your pc and it should work.
---
The environment in 76 is awesome. Everything else pretty poor. 
---
Unless they changed it from 4 pulse weapons lost that bonus and are instead just the pure energy explosive.
---
New Vegas wasn‚Äôt made by bethesda
---
Hmmm I get an error Everytime I use my login.
---
I just tested the Tank killer perk on a player and it showed the damage resistance drop there but it wouldn‚Äôt show the drop in damage resistance from my stinging magazine.
---
+karma
---
What error? What steps do you take from the moment you turn on your ps4
---
This is why we need PvP
---
Where's the build?
---
What's the location of the Super Siege and Sledgehammer plan?
---
Why tho, you can pvp now, do you?
---
You just don‚Äôt get the x20 damage multiplier from pumping your entire 20 round mag into a mob inside 2.7 seconds ;)
---
It looks like you know youre way around asylum clothes do you know if blue is rare or garbage 
---
This ^
---
Can we get a sticky for this?
---
He wants to be hardcore man
---
Literally all of management did.
---
Xbox. 
---
*We want. But we won't.*
---
A few others I talked to said they were having the same issue. At least today I didn't get a server disconnect..though it froze twice on loading screens.
---
Should be fixed now.
---
From what I recall he did and then bailed out the back secret exit. It was a pretty interesting story they wrote for that place. 
---
You can't unless you meant destroying camps or ambushing and killing players that own workshop before they can alt f4
---
It's time to fix the fucking game first.
---
Forgive me if I‚Äôm reading this wrong... but you slept for 45 minutes in rl time? Were you also napping in rl? lol
---
ATM is is super bad a lvl 5 deals about 5x DMG to a lvl 50 than a lvl 50 using the same gun and perks to another lvl 50
---
It does. https://i.imgur.com/BOjyIdF.png
---
Hunter/hunted, monster mash, workshops, bounty, you can also slap someone, he will probably try to kill you.
---
Kinda trashy, but oh well.
---
Yup saw it there a few times. 
---
There‚Äôs three tiers of it. Range dropoff, DR and avoidance. 
---
DR works something like this (apologies for the butcher explanation): 
---
You deal 100 damage to a 0 DR enemy, you do 100 damage. 
---
You deal 100 damage to a 100 DR enemy, you deal 50 damage. 
---
You deal 100 damage to a 200 DR enemy, you deal 25 damage. 
---
As enemy DR goes up, your dealt damage starts approximating zero. This is why enemy DR reducing perks (most weapon types have one) as well as puncturing melee mods and perforating magazine mods are basicallly pure damage. Keep in mind that in Fallout 76, a level 68 scorched in a flannel shirt has high DR, and so does everything else. What this means is that you need to be doing about 150+ DPH to be badass, and 250+ (on auto) to be rapidly shredding your leveled targets. 
---
2. There‚Äôs a similar mechanic for damage dropoff with distance. Where 100 damage dealt from 100 Bethesda distance units means you‚Äôve inflicted 50 damage, just like with DR. 
---
3. Last; when it comes to players there‚Äôs also avoidance. A whole pile of game mechanics allows players to avoid a % of enemy punishment  without it ever touching your armor. Rad builds use these extensively. They all have conditions, and players figure out how to play the game so as to meet them. Perks like dodgy, serendipity, lone Wanderer, mods like emergency protocols, legendary effects like blocker, sentinel and cavalier, and so on. You can get to 100% and (very situationally) can even become entirely damage-proof. 
---
I use plasma guns and I noticed it procs all the time if the gun is above 100% condition but pretty much never when it's below 100%
---
I feel your pain, keep searing as RNGesus may one day have mercy on you. Best of luck survivor.
---
Lol damn! Well that‚Äôs not surprising though since we‚Äôre pretty much playing a game that‚Äôs still in beta.  I guess in the mean time don‚Äôt pick fights with lower levels. Hopefully they balance that out before survival mode launches.
---
Buddy of mine had this happen because one of the components was in an unscrapped item that had to be manually dismantled
---
it was level 96 I was surprised my handmade took it down so easily.
---
I flat out gave up on killing golfer ghouls.  Y'all turned Winterspring into a WoW raid, lol.
---
I personally never liked "modern" real-world weapons in Fallout like the M4s/M16s in New Vegas, and a lot of the weapons in FO2 and Tactics. I'll give a pass to the 1950s cold war rifles like the CETME/G3, FN FAL, and AK47, but it just seemed weird to have the M4 alongside a bunch of WWII and old west firearms in that game.
---
NV has the best weapon diversity in the franchise, but I always felt that Bethesda's Fallout titles did the best at keeping away from designs that were too ubiquitous or seemed out of place in the Fallout universe, and instead came up with some interesting fictional firearms in the same vein that Fallout 1 tried.
---
This was fixed in patch 2 or 3, it was re-introduced in the latest patch. The hot fix addressed the issue with being unable to craft from material in your stash.
---
when repairing or crafting, the required amount of a junk item can't span your personal junk inventory and your stash. it can pull from one place or the other for each individual type of junk required, but can't pull items from both locations if the total required spans both locations.
---
 To the place I belong 
---
I never wanted pvp or this mmo bs, i just wanted fallout 4 co op ffs. 
---
Learned this the hard way when I saw a lvl 35 with a 100 cap bounty I hit him I deal no DMG he hits me and one shots me keep in mind I'm in ass sent armor so this shouldn't be happening
---
Yea sneaking is annoying now. It‚Äôs obvious they used an earlier build. Anyone know why they did that?
---
I encountered a situation when that happened.
---
1 of the 2 loose screws I needed was in my stash. I took it into my inventory and I could proceed with the craft.
---

Already launched? 
---
Some people reported grafton (check both station and the bot at the responder clinic), some people reported at Watoga Station.
---
Oh, it was nothing they said, everything to do with enthusiastic, excited fans getting caught up in their imaginations and reading WAY too much into the Bethesda explanations that they wanted players to fill the roles of NPCs.
---
Just now
---
Thanks for the tip guys, I totally forgot about the hot fix messing stuff up. I will give it a shot tomorrow.
---
Same, but I scrapped it by accident :(
---
OP you can have my latest SBQ drop 
---
Three star legendary plastic spoon 
---
Turrets = 0, lights = 0 :(
---
Long gone sorry bud
---
Super cool, haven't hear bout that before 
---
Gives me a weird error saying the remote play cannot be connected.
---
Right, thin air just as I thought 
---
Well hopefully this patch that‚Äôs coming is amazing. When they finally do fix the game I think all of us who stuck by it should get something special!
---
i mean the building parts have no resilience and have alow hp. pretty easy to destroy them. and u can "repair" ur destroyed base for 40cp. u jest need move damaged ur camp. 
---
This is now a change request related to camp storage, one aimed to Bethesda :p
---
\^ total douche
---
Mine hasn't came back since that patch. Weird shit.
---
I'd really love to think they had a reason for that..... But I think it slipped by QA just like the other small quality of life issues and the larger bugs.
---
For real? I‚Äôm not surprised but damn... that was the only thing I expected them to add. Guess they‚Äôre just gonna let it die
---
Yeah that's stupid as fuck, the switch is there and the assets for animation and function exist... But no they just slapped it on for aesthetics (and it looks bad either way)
---
Hell ya thank you!!
---
Or perhaps because the factions don't exist anymore because everyone is dead?
---
You stealth people are only just now encountering how broken the game is. The rest of us have known for a long time.  Imagine going into this game thinking that you are going to role play as someone skilled in crafting power armor mods, only to find that you can't craft power armor mods without plans and the plans are almost impossible to get.  Then they go from impossible to get to being really expensive.  The latter I can live with but it doesn't exactly lend itself to role playing.
---
I power armor craftsman who learned because he bought plans from a vendor for 5,800 caps. 
---
SBQ is pain in the ass for non experienced players (even level 100+). Once i came to the server with SBQ. 7 mins left, she has 75% health. Nobody was around, guess why. 
---
My powered doors never broke for me untill this day tbh. Also a normal door is very easy to break. Also even if the door breaks it doesn't really cost that many recources. I'd rather repair my camp than spend 40 caps and rebuild everything from scratch again.
---
The Atom shop is so bad I haven‚Äôt spent any of my 7000 free atoms!
---
It was already a trash post, but i had to make it worse because it was being insta-removed.
---
Ghoooooost riders iiin the sky ^doodoodoo
---
I've enjoyed my time, it was well worth the money for the time it has and is still giving me.... And while they do notice a drop in players, the only thing changing the game (for better but unfortunately usually worse) is people bitching about it.... If we all said it was perfect they wouldn't have even fixed the issues in beta that made it ACTUALLY unplayable (not unplayable in the sense that you don't enjoy it)
---
TLDR git good 
---
10/10 read
---
There‚Äôs only one measurement. 
---
How LONG it takes you to get through a target.
---
If one weapon (regardless of the shape in which it delivers damage) takes down an SBQ in 60 seconds, and another in 5 minutes, then the first is stronger than the second. 
---
If one weapon clears out the whitespring golf course in 15 seconds and another in 1.5 minutes, the first is stronger. 
---
Pick any target you like. Give each contender all the perks and an accessible 1* weapon of their choosing. 
---
The contender with the automatic gun will close shop and be done long before anything else. 
---
That‚Äôs all I care about. DPH, DPS, that‚Äôs synthetic benchmark. I care about actual whoop-ass. 
---
I‚Äôve had both. Bloodies is where it‚Äôs at. You can get over 300 damage per hit with the right build 
---
Regrettably, furious doesn‚Äôt work the way you think. It only affects the actual swings of the weapon, the power attack. Regular buzzing doesn‚Äôt seem to increase any whatsoever
---
You're never getting text chat.  Consoles have no keyboards and Bethesda has made it *painfully* clear that they're not doing a PC and console version of the game - one build and one build only.
---
No One Cares What You Want. Evidence provided =&gt; Fallout 76.
---
&gt;That or a really badass mini gun. I've seen 3 different players that do it in less than a minute.
---
Mini gun is a shitty weapon. Only .50 machine gun deserves attention.
---
Thanks! 
---
[I am asshole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg) and i kill people without being wanted. You just must be smart asshole. It would be awesome if servers was for 100+people. That would allow people to "roleplay" more. 
---
Us farmers drop items like that in alot of the stations following a nuke (i.e Watoga station suitcase and the ice chest and cash register at whitespring station). I always drop level 10 and below legendaries from events at the overseers camp for new players. Hopefully someday you can do the same it feels great to come across a level 10 players camp and drop full set of legendary armor, weapon and maybe some building plans for their camp:)
---
LMAO!  Your post is a pretty hilarious way of saying what I have been saying since launch.  I noticed it almost immediately.  The legendary Gatling gun that I was spec'd into was doing negligible damage, but a mediocre, non-legendary  super sledge was obliterating them, despite the fact that I had zero perk investment in melee. 
---
This game is ridiculously slanted in favor of high strength builds in general.  Slugger, shot gunner, and gladiator... all in the strength tree. And all weapons in the category do more base damage than nearly all pistols and rifles. Stack perks on top of them and add legendary effects and they are monstrous. 
---
This game is out of balance in favor of strength builds. 
---
How many flux?
---
On xbox??

250s? Those people got their EXP when glowing ones still gave them 4x extra EXP. Good times for power leveling. Now, I just log in daily to clear West Tek Research Centre mainly to collect assault rifles to sell for the daily 1,400 caps. The real endgame is to collect all plans and build a kickass C.A.M.P. You need caps for that.
---
Neat! Do you know if the Plans shown on World regenerate over time? I'm collecting outfits and there seems to giving me different ones (underarmor) from videos.
---
Yeah they have the assets, so I assume they'll change nothing and charge you in the atom store for 'new content' later on
---
Die.

This glitch is the reason i stopped playing, it ruins my stealth  character and makes fast travel impossible.

We learn in of the quest at a military camp that just being part of a union or reading socialist text can confirm you as a commie (its the quest where one must gain a military i.d. and go through training, one of the training mission involve investigating rooms with mannequins that have a few scripted lines)
---
time to post something sensational to get your karma up.
---
Rare
---
Special stats don't change after 50 you moron. It is not "insane" that a level 20 could kill you at level 250. Stat wise you're only 30 levels ahead.
---
Fucking hell the people on this sub.
---
We also know from real history that many so called commies were intellectuals... And vault 76 is filled with the brightest minds ever so it's safe to assume that a few of them may have no quarrel with the communism 
---
There's a very long video on youtube that talks about how fallout 76 should have been and ive watched it a while ago but sadly forgot the name. Try to find it. It blew me away.
---
I wish I didn't pre-order FO76
---
Yeah, GTA Online is really bad about griefing which really ruined the game sometimes. Some of the griefers would join a heist and ruin that too.
---
Rockstar has done a terrible job about controlling it and frankly has made it worse in the last few years with adding ridiculous weapons and vehicles that have destroyed any balance the game had from before. You can always assume that any guy on one of those flying bikes that shoot missiles is an asshole.
---
The game sells it for 1700. I can sell it to you for 1200. 
---
Had thus happen in my camp once...
---
Just run a nuke silo, you get the plan from one of the gutsy robots in there, every single run you will get that plan.
---
What‚Äôs more unique about x-01?
---
I actually think this is part of another bug rather then the actual amount of charge left in the core.
---
So when you equip a plasma or gataling laser weapon, the amount of ammo you have displayed matches the amount of cores you are carrying. So in your example of it saying you have 006 ammo left it means your are carry 6 plasma cores. If you had 8 cores then when you equip your gun it would say 008 etc and always needs to be reloaded.
---
It has been like since since release. Super weird, not sure why it hasn't been fixed yet.
---
&gt; What‚Äôs kept you in the game for so long?
---
I stream a lot on twitch, but now this game is not even worth to stream anymore. Looks like people tired of watching me killing 15 Scorchbeast queens every day
---
Funny way of saying ‚Äûserver not responding‚Äú
---
I don't think there is something similar to Fallout 76. Huge open world, with ability to build house, with lots of creatures, quests, leveling system with cap that motivate you to get best build doable, 24-30 players per server, ....
---
Yeah borderlands are cool, but you can have only 4ppl on sesion, you wont probably be able to play with random players, also there is mission maps with A-&gt;B route. No exploration. Same as destiny, i just leveled up, run thru all maps and deleted those games.
---
Played 8years world of warcraft, now i am 400 hours on fo76. 
---
"Ass" heap? That sounds like a strip club name. Seneca Rocks or some cliffs near monorail elevator.
---
"mildly addicting"
---
Assassins creed, I've been thinking of warframe tho I keep seeing it everywhere 
---
My sentiment is much the same of many in the fallout community, but yeah Bethesda don't give a fuck.
---
It's Damage Resistance is rivalled only by the Ultracite Armor (One has higher radiation resistance the other has more conventional weapons resistance I forget which is which tho....) Can't go wrong with the X01, made my set at level 50 and at lvl 100 it's barely damaged at all (barely a noticeable dent)
---
Oh man the ammo drops. They are truly horrendous in this game, IMO,   Part of the reason is the scrounger perk being so incredibly weak compared to Fallout 4. 
---
In Fallout 4, you found more ammo in containers- ***all containers-*** not just ammo boxes.  And you'd regularly have several fusion cores spawn in ammo boxes with that perk.  It was one of the  perks that made it easy to live in power armor and use a Gatling laser as your main weapon.
---
*Note to stealth players: I know you don't use power armor and don't give a shit about power builds and heavy weapons builds. But that doesn't  make  it  okay to ruin said builds by fucking up the perks that make them work.* 
---
And yeah I know that fusion cores aren't scarce in this game.  But even with power user maxed out and slowing the rate of fire with charging barrels,  the drain on fusion cores using a Gatling laser is huge.  You can see the number of cores depleting as you fire the weapon.

You should grab the Nukes Cola paint job (it's for t51b I think) it's in-game and not an atom store purchase
---
Oh no low levels aren't running from you. There running from the people that your bring with you and by people I mean high level enemies that spawn near your level.
---
Had his happen to me tonight, and my Two Shot MIRV did absolutely nothing against the Lvl 87 in a red dress.
---
Just to be clear. The robots will not be hostile anymore. But their health bar will still show as red. 
---
And just like that I'm loading the game to see for myself.
---
Thanks...
---
Speculations, thats what commies does! Sent this man in jail!
---
45 minutes sleeping on the bed of the enemy you just killed? Sounds like what a psychopath would do. You sure hunger and thirst didn't kill you instead? People login into the area might also cause enemy to respawn. I died while standing on the red truck outside the whitespring golf club when it exploded, the paper bag is visible, but I couldn't loot it. Guess that's worse.
---
Great storyüëçüèª could use a different title low-key tho
---
Well the guy I was supposed to sell it to was buying it for 900, but he never showed
---
People were asking for separate pvp servers early on. When the slap mechanic was revealed, everyone hated it and wanted separate servers instead. When the game came out and everyone saw how bad the pvp is they stopped asking.
---
I can stop whenever I want and do other things
---
It‚Äôs just my brain goes ‚ÄûDude, we could be playing Warframe right now‚Äú every few minutes or so 
---
The mall is the best place I've found for that. I enjoy 'sploding vehicles too. :)
---
I love teaming up with people. But for events? Fuck no.  Wanna know why?  Well, let's use "Distant Thunder" as an example.   Ran the quests 30 times and  have 30  plans for motion assisted servos 
---
So on the subject of events, whether we are talking teams or solo, the answer is... no.
---
I can relate to that feeling.
---
(drinks Dr Pepper)
---
Thanks. I looked up the damage stats. Ultracite has higher damage resist. While x-01 has higher electric and rad resist. 
---
Everyone else might be sneaking
---
This community is so inconsistent. You asked for private servers ‚Äî here they are!

This reminds me of Fallout New Vegas when Fantastic says that he's has the powerplant running at 1% efficiency and that some 'assholes' don't think that's good enoughü§£ü§£ü§£ Bethesda is Fantastic from New Vegas (look him up on YouTube if ya don't know)
---
Literally cannot compete daily events, powerplant stuff, or hold a workshop for an hour.  Something needs to be done.
---
They don't even bother replying. 
---
That same terminal choice reveals several different fun facts, like telling your inebriated parents to use vats cause that's what it's there for lol
---
Watch your mouth you stupid in bred cunt. You could have been friendly and instead you decided to give me a cunt reply. Go ahead and google just how many people die daily solely because of a shitty attitude.
---
All you said was that ‚Äústats don‚Äôt change‚Äù, you never said special stats. Stats CAN change with perk cards. If I added lifegiver to my level 194 character right now, my stats would change because my health would increase. There are thousands of combinations. So saying that your stats do not change is a lie. Saying that your special stats don‚Äôt change is also not correct because they can be swapped around at the cost of being able to pick a card when you level up. You need to be specific, otherwise you‚Äôre wrong.
---
Learn some basic respect and how to converse with others in a civil manner. Cunt.
---
Let's just wait for the mod to come out at Nexus
---
Yeah GT?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm with you private servers with mods would have been dope 
---
I find it odd because there are level 30 and level 50 versions of said armor, and they both have the same name.
---
This
---
The price of messing with TSE...If devs didn't meddle with TSE, the game would be in a better state.
---
yeah it is a little weird to be honest not really a huge pain but just a little odd especially the FC's because if I pick up a FC that is at like 40% charge and my current one depletes you would think you use up the charge in the 40 not a fresh 100.
---
what‚Äôs the lowest you‚Äôre willing to go ?
---
Nobody asked for a demolition perk and white knight perk nerf, but they still do it anyway. 
---
u dont need rebuild u can place it (if not glich build)
---
Fast travel to Relay Tower EM-B1-27.
---
In front of you will be a BOS tank and a few step forward there's a fallen soldier and a military ammo bag and a combar armor helmet.
---
There were a lot of times where I listened to holotape or read about a person trying to make it out in the world and I really wished I could meet them. A lot of them sounded awesome. Kinda bums me out they're all dead.
---
Though it's a bit mutually exclusive. I can't have found out all of this stuff if they were alive. Most of it at least. They're probably private or just non-existent. 
---
I'm running through on my fourth character now, a silver shroud build.
---
Things I've noticed since launch are:
---
-you receive way more plans now for the main quest. Seems like almost every quest gives a good plan like a minigun or whatever else
---
-levelling is waaaay slower. I finished main quest at level 30 and I'd done quite a few side quests. I don't think Bethesda even realise how much they have nerfed it.
---
I live having lots of different characters to be able to switch between builds
---
Myself I consider it a mashup between a flying trash heap and every spaceship I seen so far, and I'm so deep into SciFi that I have already defined protocols of hierarchy establishing for all instances of my person, just in case I were digitised and then instantiated several times while having no guarantee of informational access to thoae instances.
---
r/unexpectedtf2
---
Literally so many people were asking constantly for the PvP mode for like a month straight after launch.
---
Over and over again
---
Are you sure there‚Äôs nothing to do? I‚Äôm level 65 and I know there‚Äôs still gotta be a dozen or so locations that I haven‚Äôt explored yet, and I still haven‚Äôt launched my first nuke. 
---
I don't think the devs are into what you've mentioned, they are more interested in nerfing.
---
Actually, when you get a hang of it - it's pretty accurate.
---
What an idiot
---
Ask them to recycle FO4 Far Harbor, better than nothing
---
It's "scorched".
---
Yes, not only harpers ferry. Happens too often for me
---
Was both instances wearing power armor? Was it a plain chassis @ Beltching Betty?  Most likely just the servers or your connection.
---
Leave him alone. Having to carry the failures of others must be hard. 
---
could possibly be the cause, my camps far to big and close to a spot that has no enemies nearby (also took me ages to align that damned build box) if you clear out enemies i'd try removing the beds for abit and some other things you might suspect drags aggro and see when you server hop if it causes them to go sixth sense on the base again, curious to find out what objects might actually be causing it as i'v been trying to get bethy to fix or at least reduce how much attention said items cause.
---
i mean just because you have a carrot or a bed shouldnt turn a scorch shotgunner or a super mutant into a psychic master marksman
---
I mentioned this last week and apparently everyone was seeking and i was wanted (rolleyes)
---
Was my best session to date. Owned all but one of the workshops and for 5 hrs I collected and bulked junk. It was Bliss.
---
Like playing Fallout 4 but a new map lol 
---
2 nights ago there were just 3 of is in a server. Just as good. Game dying makes it more Fun for us that stay and enjoy it. And... Game doesn't Crash !!
---
If you've played the earlier fallouts and compare them to this then it seems they might have set the bar to low for this game... If you like this game and haven't tried the others go play Fallout 3, Fallout new Vegas and maybe 4 if you want to, you can see that the same thing you like from 76 are probably still there (other than the camp/workshop systems) and they have A LOT more content as of now 
---
Wow so it is a common bug:/ 
---
It's better to do it on low pop servers. The less people who fight her, the weaker she is. High pop servers just means leechers who shoot her once then hide
---
Im going back to eso üëç not a shooter ofc but
---
I hope you find someone to play games with someday, on the same level of bonding. I'm sorry for your loss. Not very good at this, but making the best of our lives today is pretty much the only thing you can really do.  
---
Ctrl + Alt + Del usually works. 
---
How about some WWII / Korean War guns? The M1 and M3 Carbines would be amazing, a Garand and a Thompson would be killer, and there are a plethora of other choices from the BAR to the Springfield; the Colt 1911 to the .30 Cal Browning machine gun. Heck, even bazookas and anti-tank rifles are possibilities, would cover the whole spectrum and all these could be a 'Gun Runners' style of DLC which would honor West Virginia since they had the highest per capita number of vets of the entire nation in every war since WWI.
---
Shhhhh he's sleeping
---
That‚Äôs a bug from beta. I‚Äôve never got that achievement. 
---
You wont have a game for very long with a low pop
---
I appreciate it and im trying my best to remeber the good stuff and not wallow its just hard it still doesnt feel real i can remember our first nuke and how we both ran out of ammo and i feel great but everytime i turn the game on its just not the same.
---
&gt; but their letter that came out before BETA says otherwise.
---
Was there a leak of some internal communication? I'd love to read that!
---
maybe it worked because you were killing people like a cold hearted machine?
---
after all we know pulse mines fries protectrons :P
---
What's the point of bulking thing unless your selling them?! Of course you're wasting plastic to constantly wrap and unwrap items but is there and actual point to it?
---
If you don't see yourself in the mirror, you might be a ghost.
---
People still playing this game? I gave up about a month ago, waiting until its better.
---
YOU GUYS REALLY NEED TO TRY OUT THE NEW battle Royale GAME CALLED APEX legends IT'S A REALLY NICE GAME 
---
I like the idea as an Event. But I doubt BGS would make this any good. Probably they'll turn it into another mindless grinding fest with no sense of progression. Imagine having to deal with this threat over and over for 30 days, killing the same enemies in the same locations... 
---
I can imagine this being a 1 day Event. "Sunday at 00h an enemy will invade Apallachia, its up to you and all server players to join up and defeat the invader".
---
This might work.
---
where you get the plastic for shotgun shells and bulking the rest of the junk?
---
I am so sorry for your loss. &lt;3
---
I was just talking to my wife about this regarding RE2. There's *some* mirror reflections in there but it still has a bit of a framerate drop and some aliasing issues. I'm pretty sure I've seen this topic discussed a few times but I'll answer with my vague knowledge on the matter.  
---
Basically, proper working mirrors in games aren't super common only because it's hard to do. Which is why a lot of times you'll just see broken glass or smudgy/grimy surfaces. In order to give the appearance of a proper mirror, they have to essentially make two parts of the same room and character and everything else so it's basically doubling the amount of processing in one single frame. You see your character in the mirror? That's just another model and not your actual reflection. 
---
There's a lot of mirrors in FO76 so it'd be pretty rough on your system to have that pop up all the time.   
---
I could very much be wrong about this, and I'm sure I'll be corrected, but that's my understanding. I too think it's odd that this hasn't been streamlined yet in this day and age of gaming tech advances. 
---
Vampire^^^
---
If you're in the UK there's an organisation called Combat Stress who can offer you grief counselling.  Well worth a call, I've used their services a fair few times given how many of my mates died.  Chin up, give them a call or I'm sure the VA offer similar assistance in the US.
---
Can confirm. The pip boy goes black screen and even if you try fast travel you'll spawn the same way. Only solution is to disconnect.
---
My buddy and I just dropped over 100 legendaries in that cooler a second ago :)
---
I think they put a ton of props in the game with no use at all. Maybe they want to rehabilitate them later for dlc?
---
Im Canadian and our VA is a shambles right now but i appreciate the advise he was american and about the only american service member i could stand (this is a joke).but arty sticks together and he was a damn fine man ill miss him.
---
I mean, "meditation" won't ever take you from a hulking monstrosity of muscle to a thinned down lab-coat wearing geek, but then again, you know. -gestures at entire fallout cannon vaguely-
---
i'd want to see more content and then more endgame before i see new tiers of legends being dropped, maybe another tier of enemies, a dungeon and bam, game becomes alot more investable, throw in an ultra rare skin drop from said hard content and bam, more reason to farm it.
---
i mean MMO's teach you that people will grind anything for the rare cosmetics. and if the rare cosmetic dropper is hard they'll invest time into beating it as well.
---
so am i üòÅ
---
I think it can happen if the queen has been killed before. The body or meatpile will be where it was first killed. 
---
I've seen it happen enough on/near WS golf club, there's a small pool and surrounding wall next to it, west side of it. (the whole thing could be some kind of "bath house", even though toilets cover nearly 1/4 of the area)
---
There is a cafe or kiosk at corner, and leader ghoul behind locked door. You can farm it several times and it respawns more or less when the GC ghouls respawn. But it's body sometimes warps back to his little room or where it was previously/first time killed.
---
So yeah lol while that boss ghoul body can be found, good luck finding SBQ body if the prime has been nuked several times.
---
Hahaha what the fuck was that reply. You're a new breed of autistic 
---
Oh no, low levels aren't running from you. There running from the people that you bring with you and by people, I mean all the high level enemies that spawn near your level.
---
You‚Äôre damn right I have autism, but my points stand. Good day sir.
---
the trepanning (spelling) drill, guaranteed to drain those lovely brain fluids

from the 800 odd plastic he dropped..we made 5.56 mainly most of his junk was already bulked

---
The  biggest reason given was that this game is fundamentally flawed in a  couple of ways. I'm not talkin about the bugs because that is completely  normal at a launch. Everyone complains about how many bugs a game has  that launched and pretends that they are far more numerous than other  games, but I don't believe this conjecture as I've played in tons of  games at launch that have seemed so much worse than 76"  
---
I can't agree with you here at fucking all... I have \_never\_ played a game that was as buggy as a full launch title as this game is. Outside of other bethesda titles, I haven't played a full launch title HALF as buggy as this game.   
---
Some thoughts: 
---
Honeybeasts are fun! Unless they show up in groups of three. 
---
I still haven't been able to bring myself to kill a Megasloth, even the one that came after me in the Mire. 
---
World bosses, i.e. creatures that require a group to defeat, should in my opinion either spawn in the world where it's actually possible to run away if you encounter them without a group, ot in special instanced "dungeons" especially made for groups to begin with. I don't want to run into them at the end of a quest that is otherwise tuned for solo play. 
---
vampiric electrified Mr handy Blade w bonus limb damage/ 2hand melee perks ...one of my most valued weapons ...never have to use a stimpack ever.... does decent damage ...but more importantly makes you near invincible

The Division 2's beta just ended, so I am back to FO76. I hope, but doubt, that it can keep me interested until TD2 is released.
---
I have backup plan and it's The Forest. I have bought it, but not started it. 
---
never happened to me
---
yeh the damn bomb quest only resets like 1 time a week for me... and its the only one I actually want to farm... fuckin boomer... 
---
The nerf of scrapper is nutty to me. I agree completely... It should rank up, and each rank has more and better resources. Armor drops ballistic fiber, especially. 
---
i'v had this bug afew times, its quite nice tbh, server becomes super stable.
---
perfect time to hold the power plant and food place at the same time.
---
Did you kill the queen?
---
Yeah.
---
No, just a 1* but it is all i wanted. :-)
---
...This post from a "raider" flagged person is just...oh man. Every time I try to interact with a person, it ends up being some scumbag griefer.  Or, as they call themselves, "raider".   
---
And this is a \_stupid\_ idea, besides. Instead of spending time grinding for resources (or, even better, as the comment you replied to suggested, let us re-cycle existing ammo), spend hours HOPING you find someone who is hoarding ammo they don't need to trade for a type of ammo YOU hoard that YOU don't need.   
---
Meanwhile, both of you are hopping to find someone with shotgun shells, because of course you fucking are. 
---
Then repeat, farm and wait for dlc 
---
I work 12 hr rotating shifts but I'm down when I get time off.  GT: Crawls84

That's what I was afraid of.

How good is your relationship with RNGJesus?
---
Or experiment with different locations to nuke. We need a new decent location to nuke.
---
"sociopathic assholes who probably murder puppies for fun" aren't a replacement for enjoyable in-game content. 
---
&gt; :-)
---
Good for you!
---
&gt; ic he dropped..we made 5.56 mai
---
Nice, remember not to "scrap all" when you have bulk items.
---
Lol not ferry but a couple of places
---
Yup. That's this game in a nutshell. You grind and work hard and either you don't get a drop at all (fully half of my SBQ drops are...5 rounds for a gun I don't use) Or a worthless plan you already know for a suit of armor you won't ever use, or a shiiit legendary.   
---
Or, maybe you get something decent, and you get a server drop and loose it all.   
---
It's fucking sad. 
---
"keep throwing your time away, its worthless". 
---
I once nuked Huntersville because that was the firdt location that really gave me trouble.
---
I think it's safe to assume that they read this subreddit, and similar places on the internet, look for awesome ideas, and go "yeah, add that to the list of shit to never implement...we need to make more PVP content for that 5% of our player base!!!"  
---
It's just sad. 
---
You must find the most legendary door there is and plunder it's secrets. It's your destiny!
---
Will be moving to Anthem end of month if the next patch is balls
---
It might become also slower if you have weaker computer, or if you have been playing long. Might be dependant on connection as well. Or server instance age and like total number of players(on that server).
---
I think it works like this:client sends server request to what body XXYY has. That is unique ID of the body. Only at that point the loot is instanced so kinda server then creates a special container for that player. But then either that request is not received, or it's delayed by server, and client is not capable to do anything.
---
It's really hard to figure out since what online games don't display even ping, much less packet loss, so you don't know if your client is chugging up. Particularly because a lot of things happen mostly/great deal client side, so you can't normally notice when you are having lag, unlike in other online games.
---
Happens plenty to me when farming WS golf club, then I usually just swipe fast all bodies to start the process, then go find another group of bodies, then at some point return to check if they have loaded. There's its usually 30-60 seconds, they load fairly "fast", but I don't stare a single corpse because I don't think it helps anything. It either loads in max 2 seconds or it's not happening.
---
There was it just now - an unquestionable loyal fallout 76 redditor just came through and downvoted every single comment!
---
I've never heard a sound cue, but confirming the same bug with recon pips not showing up when zoomed on PS4.
---
Just happened to me in Watoga :(
---
Not constantly but it happens at least once every day. My internet is fine I can play other constant-online games without ever disconnecting.
---
If you use a perk that lowers the cost to repair then it will say you don't have enough resources if you don't have the mats to repair it without the perk. No idea if that made sense?
---
When you find it tell it to send Ultracite Gatling Laser my way.
---
Bethesda has had some stupid fucking ideas...but forced multi-player with forced PVP is defiantly on the top of that list. 
---
You played 430 hours in a bad game bro
---
ok, I stop the discussion with you here. For reasons mentioned in my last post on this topic.

Seriously though it's most likely a RNG treasure item

Has the recent update affected you too??
---
I like the game. I have been capturing every glitch I've come across using my Instagram, since day one. Timmy30274
---
It's fun looking at all the glitches
---
But since the update, I'll press play and have 30 "server disconnected" til I'm able to play or have to wait a few days later and hope i can play.
---
I told my brother and he's like boohoo its not that important.  He paid $80 not me!!! BUT he'll calmly play another game than to contact anyone to let them know what's what.

It makes good sense but unfortunately it's not it... It's a Dragon that I need adhesive and steel to repair, and I have loads of it. The only perk that affect repair is to repair a weapon to 130%, and I tried removing that. 
---
I just ran up there on a vanilla alt too, super weird. You got a suit of power armor or even a frame? Maybe try what that other guy said and use a power armor as a stepping stool. What level are you?
---
Mutual friend of ours just let me know this evening it was an accident from what i understand out hunting and flipped his vehicle.
---
Weird.. maybe try to relog or put it in your stash and take it back out?
---
Tried taking out all the mats I need, still says that I lack the mats... 
---
Now private servers and mods will be the last. That's because it was also announced before launch. But between pvp servers and the private servers all we are gonna get is more "patches" and atom shop junk.
---
No, one with power armor one without. And yeah only chassis without anything on it.  
---
Yeah connection was what i thought but when i went outside from the basement i walked like Forest Gump.When i got inside..well i was more like Lt.Dan  :(  
---
man, I get that one all the time. The one I want is the one for killing cryptids; I've only got it twice ever. 
---
There needs to be a better system for dailies. 
---
When I heard that this game was set a few years after the bombs I was excited. There is so much story that could be told about what happened very early on. Instead they turned into an online game with minimal story or effort. They wanted a chance to flesh out the lore by so much.
---
It‚Äôs still weird to go to an earlier build. The great thing about it is they can continue tweak this game. Maybe the nerf was to harsh and they will change it back or lessen the nerf. It has to be pretty apparent that it was a mistake. I think we should patient if we really enjoy the game. I know I do despite its many flaws I still believe It can be a good game and it‚Äôs obvious that we are playing a beta even if it‚Äôs not official. It was stupid of them to release it like it is but i still  enjoy it. So I‚Äôm trying to have fun with it the best way I can. I‚Äôve rolled another character and have abandoned my level 110. Maybe by the time I get this one that high the game will be better. I hope because it would be a pity for it not to work in my opinion. 
---
They probably were working 2 years on how to make a jumbled mess of an engine that is built on 2 decade old engine, never meant to be taken past the year 2000, to just even boot. Then they started to flip assets and write a "storyline", jumble everything together with very poor online multiplayer framework on top of it. 
---
Bethesda Software Game is the very definition of jury-rigging everything to save 5 cents.
---
They've got to extend the grind somehow
---
if the peoples stop play it they not need to fix bugs...
---
Well that's curious. Which console or PC?
---
If it was officially a beta people wouldn‚Äôt care as much. I spent 60 dollars on it and the game goes for 30. I still don‚Äôt care that much. I just hope they continue to work on it and in the future maybe they give us early adopters something cool for our patience. 
---
I send lots of team invates and so rarely anyone accept them. Maybe talking one per 40 sent. It sure might be small generation gap involved. I can understand all sorts of thing involved but at the same time I can't really understand how systematic it is. I can play 8 hours a day, for a week, and not get a single team invite.
---
On my last game, sadly few days ago, someone nuked WS. I was doing my chores in basement when it happened, as I could FT only by using full unyielding armor and being down to -20% health, and as WS was last vendor stop to cash in on the daily 200 caps, I figured I could take a PA and join it. 
---
Fairly fast I did get a teammate to use rad sponge with, but with PA Im over encumbered as fuck and only getting worse as I pick up all the crappy legendaries, raw flux and any little useful junk.(the nuked ghouls don't have much of that though, but without armor pieces, it's all nominal weight). But as he was running ahead I tried to get more teammates occasionally and no one else accepted.
---
Or another time less than week ago I saw spamming invates as I wanted to leave/quit, I had fairly developed workbench so I kinda wanted to give it to someone. Then finally some fairly low level accepted , I don't think I even managed to thrown a like emote, I just left. As the game doesn't tell you about inheriting a workshop, the player might have had at first quite "uh WTF moment". Eventually the workshop should get attacked by some enemies so that should then show the defend mission and they could realise having one.
---
Yeah 80% for me at harpers ferry and my sound goes out too.  Even at menu off server.  Have to totally close and restart game. Only place so far for me.   Always in Excavator PA since I‚Äôm always carrying lots of stuff to sell to vendor.   On PC. 
---
The [tier 4 legendaries](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/399713408867500032/535475523867115520/unknown.png) are all pretty decent, for guns at least, although *Wounding* will likely be the one that everyone goes after whenever they start dropping.
---
I‚Äôm trying to be patient that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve rolled a new character. I do enjoy  it despite its many flaw. I‚Äôm hoping they continue to work on it. It would really suck if they quit on us. I don‚Äôt think they will though. The game has a decent amount of people playing it and if they can make it work it will be something that profitable for a long time. 
---
Server feels less stable than before, getting more disconnects than usual after the patch
---
A lot of people love fallout so if they can make it work then it‚Äôll be worth it. 
---
Amazing detailed post I loved it.
---
So much Bethesda should read and take heed on.
---
I did it! I don't know what worked, so I can't be of much help if it happens to someone else. However, I did have all the mats on me and not in stash whan I did it, so that might be it. Thanks to everyone who came with suggestions. 
---
A lot stalking me when i wearing the spacesuit 
---
I took out the Flatwoods Monster tonight.  Had to used a ranged attack as it was too fast for All Rise.  I also ran into a Vengefull Mothman, but I had run into them early on when I spent a lot of time wandering the wildness sections of the map.
---
I've seen Snalygasters and the Grafton Monster in Charleston.  Anglers are in the Mire and far north.  I've seen very few Megasloths, but I have gotten a couple of kills in.  Windigos you can find at Windigo cave and sometimes they spawn in Whitesprings, especially after a Nuke.
---
It might be related to carry weight since my PA had calibrated shocks on it when I fast travelled lol , that's weird . I'm on PS4 so it doesn't seem like a console issue . That sucks 
---
yeh scrap bulk...only made that mistake once
---
I‚Äôm level 45 and havnt even done roses first quest, how are people finding nothing to do? I can‚Äôt even get around to doing missions I‚Äôm so occupied on there
---
I'm still playing FO76, but also the new Resident Evil 2, and also For Honor was just free this month of PS Plus. I think The Division 2 is something I might like, but I'm not totally sure if it will suit a solo player. Still playing and having fun and nice interactions in FO76 though.
---
They cut the demo advantage though, no?
---
Now you're back down to +60% with everyone else. 
---
meat hook, pipe bolt action.
---
can we tag bethesda here? love this post.
---
...and yet, here we are, people making dedicated discord channels and already testing tactics for PVP.
---
It's just annoying as all hell. Most of my guns barely break but nvm my gatling I love. 
---
I recently moved from away from Whitesprings. The Mirelurks LOVED my fusion generator (and the occasional mole rat). My new spot near the dried up lake is pretty sick... But on the opposite side of where the super mutants spawn, is my generator. Occasionally I have to kill a super  mutant that decided to go of the road he patrols, down the river bank, across the water, up the river bank, pass the majority of my base and start whacking my generator. I built an enclosed room for it today, hopefully that helps a little!
---
That's weird cause it perks like 24/7 with my Medic shotgun. I thought each pellet counted towards it it procced so often in my shotgun. It's such a busted ass perk
---
Wtf lol, you guys are wasting time. The main portion of the game is PVE and people are mad about it. You should take that energy into a better PvP game lmao 
---
Yeah I think heavy weapons just get nothing from it barely. So annoying 
---
I‚Äôm running around at level 45 with 1 stimpak starving to death and these ingrates are just running away!?
---
Any 2 or 3* intigating + swing speed power fist, mole miner gauntlet, or death claw gauntlets?
---
Gaurentee if you phone the British number they'd happily listen to you and help if they can, there are no borders when it comes to ex military. 
---
Why Do You Type Your Damn Sentences Like This? Stop Doing This You Fucking Idiotic, Moronic, Fat As Fuck Beanpole. It Makes Me Want To Launch Nukes In Real Life When Other People Type Posts Like This.
---
Just tell in Discord that you are nuking prime. Leave your name and if there are players they will come.
---
I don't know who that is. I'd give my soul up to him if he can come through with that plan. 
---
This bug has some exploit tone (doing the glitch the right order can get you +30% each time) so maybe it gets more attention.
---
YES! I had this happening yesterday and had no clue what the heck was going on
---
I'm sure I've seen legendary gear with 5 stars but only three of them are lit up? 
---
PvP is disabled until level 5. You leave the vault at level 2. It‚Äôs a free fast travel. 
---
I think the faction system should be similar to Final Fantasy V job system. Without an affiliation (wastelander) you don't get faction perks available and are treated neutrally by all but Raiders, but can equip any gear. Factions should limit the gear you can use, but provide access to perks to make them more viable in a faction-suitable manner. CAMP items could be made available to members as well.
---
In addition there would be pre-set faction relations, like raiders can PVP anyone at full strength and gain some kind of reward currency for it, but others can do the same to them. Responders would get the same kind of faction currency for dealing with raiders or otherwise helping others. BoS would get the currency from mopping up scorched and enclave, and so on.
---
Taking workshops from a rival  group should also yield extra goodies, and workshop factions should show up on the map and maybe even generate faction-specific events. Changing factions should have a significant cooldown.
---
I put a dry ice bomb in a pumpkin once and blew it up in some douchebag's front yard. Made the front page of my local newspaper.
---
"Mysterious Exploding Pumpkin!"
---
They found pumpkin guts on the house across the street. I wonder sometimes what they think actually happened that night...
---
Ditto, for a while I had calibrated on only one but  I‚Äôm seeing it with two also.    I need to experiment with other locations near there.  
---
Been having this problem as well. Found if I jump to the power substation near Harper's ferry it almost aways works, once when jumping from Watoga to the Substation did it bug, was wearing power armor every time.
---
Uninstalled a while ago to clear space for Anthem but from what I remember I had so much crap in my inventory I wasn't picking up anything but the best weapons and weapons to melt for plans . Don't take it so personally. 
---
Well, technically Im having difficulty finding a 12 year olds having enough persistanse to pester anyone much.
---
Thanks! :)
---
Get off of their post. Make your own.
---
&gt; If he wanted the All-Rise, he should've done the quest for it.
---
He might have done it at low level making it later obsolete for him.
---

---
Probably wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea, but I didn‚Äôt want to push it too hard on my initial post. Never can tell where the sweet spot is, kind of like lockpicking. I worry that they get tagged so much they just breeze over the vast majority.
---
I appreciate the feedback.  I was really starting to worry I was missing something obvious.  My big challenge is giving up supplies.  600 max pounds of belongings is stupid, and I've never been able to fast travel.  Ever.
---
Well can't say so.
---
How did Charleston get destroyed?
---
If you just want the answer, rather than enlightenment, check out &gt;![the Overseers log at Fort Defiance])https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer%27s_log_-_Fort_Defiance).!&lt;
---
I think you mean a direct relation rather than an inverse one.
---
How does this help OP?
---
You gotta open that mouth wide then if you want my meat! Lolz!
---
This has happened to me twice now. Never rage quit so hard in my life. Especially when you launch the nuke solo 
---
It's really a shame that such a fantastic concept was realized so poorly by Bethesda.
---
The bad state of the game and poor PR in the beginning was the biggest blow.
---
I bought the game despite the bad reviews...
---
Honestly I think Bethesda should stick to SP RPG franchise of TES and FO.
---
That's exactly what happened to me , was coming from Watoga in Power armor after going from vendor to vendor selling stuff . I'll keep that in mind lol
---
&gt; Then 3 big scorch beasts right on top of me for no apparent reason
---
They just wanted to join the fun.
---
I got jumped by 3 SB's a little north of the RR Megastop (when doing the silly little protectron quest).  Much green flashing was seen that day.
---
If I may ask what platform are you on?
---
fuck, you got me
---
I have never been a Obsidian fan. They have a catalog full of mediocre and few excellent games, that are just as broken as Beths games are at the beginning.
---
Oh yeah and then there is Alpha Protocol.
---
You start at the golf club, clear all the mobs in it, head northeast towards the apartment complexes, clear all the rooms and keep heading in that direction until all the complexes are cleared.
---
After you clear the complexes, head back towards the white spring resort entrance, you should run directly into the parking lot and mechanic garage, there should be ghouls here.
---
Head to the white spring resort entrance and clear out the complex in between the entrance the golf club.
---
Then head back to the golf club and you have completed a whole rotation, do this a couple of times and you should complete it. 
---
The MP could have been great, they just failed hard 
---
Awesomely articulate bro, I had started to skip past all the consistent hating/whinging posts that this forum was becoming but you have just brought some of the faith back to our community, I‚Äôll keep my fingers crossed that someone from Bethesda actually checks these and takes your suggestions on board, keep up the good work :-) 
---
Brand new (less than level 5) players *can't* be bothered by that crap.
---
Low-lifes...
---
Wait until there is nobody at whitespring. Then go there. I got mine at the chalet places not the clubhouse.
---
I had given up, only had 2 I got in early days. Happened to kill a couple more recently, and I noticed I was pretty much the only person there. Went back a few more times when it was empty of players and finished it.
---
Shouldn't matter what your level is, I finished them at level 72. What matters is no other players are in area.
---
What do these two benefit from ?
---
Xboxone and its hard but im sure ill pull through just was good to get it off my chest 
---
The M16 was designed in 59. That is the cold war era, isn't it?
---
I‚Äôm guessing this still hasn‚Äôt been fixed. If I recall correctly they are supposed to be wearing golf gear. High level ghouls don‚Äôt wear the proper clothes. In order to complete the quest a low level person needs to enter the area first to trigger the low level ghouls. It took me a long time to complete this one.
---
Obsidian was bought by Microsoft a few months back from what I heard so it would be Microsoft buying the rights to Fallout.
---
&gt; keep in mind I'm in ass sent armor
---
Tell me more about how your armor was delivered, this intrigues me.
---
He's talking bout the golfer ghouls quest, they are the lvl 15 ghouls, if anyone in the area is above lvl 20 then it spawns the higher lvl mobs, also if someone higher spawns in while you have the lower lvl ones there they change lvl. I had a golfer in my sights today on a new toon that changed to a lvl 62 chared b4 I pulled the trigger. It's a pain in the adds.
---
The only way to do it is spawn at the golf club and keep hopping server till you get a fresh one.
---
But full auto guns do less damage right? Im struggling with ammo with my semi auto so i dont wanna go trough ammo even quicker. I hate farming. 
---
&gt;  collect weights at gym on north of flatwoods
---
Who are you, Charles Atlas?
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right, my bad too much daytripper
---
Getting to quite like it -- makes the wasteland feel more realistic.
---
I believe that sometimes an invisible enemy spawns and attacks, when it happened to me I would jump up somewhere where most enemies couldn't get to me/shoot me and the damage stopped but when I crouched I would get [Danger] 
---
yup, his sixth sense kicked in as he skimmed the aggro area of said object, this is whats bothering me, one object creates this giant aura that enemies can seem to sniff out even though its hidden, fine lets called it "searching" but the thing is i'v made a litteral 4 foundation home tucked under a overhang of cliffs with only the front exposed and the rest of the area is cliff edges+ one very hidden slope.
---
ghouls came knocking. a whole pack of them from a patrol area waaay down below on a road. now how do you explain that? the suductive whispers of the generator? its dumb, i mean if you have a whole heap of them or a whole crap ton of crops, sure, you'd notice something like that because food especially a small farm grabs attention since you'd be "working the fields"
---
but a hidden cove with just workbenches, a bed and a small generator shouldnt grab the attention of mindless ghouls or scorcched. supers are even a stretch since they wouldnt really be looking for people in tiny hide aways but in towns where they kept finding them.
---
TL ; DR : perk cards are kinda cool. I wish I had more slots in each tree instead of 15. 
---
I liked the concept of SPECIAL 1 across the board and getting 50 points to allocate. 
---
I‚Äôm disappointed with perking swapping and special capped at 15 each. With all the issues in this game, this is such a minor gripe. 
---
Personally, I would have liked a little more commitment with leveling and choosing perks. Swapping out perks in Fallout 3 just sounds like a silly idea. ‚ÄúI want to swap out Puppies!‚Äù Uh, why exactly? That‚Äôs just cruel to Dogmeat. 
---
But having 51 special points is a rad idea and I love it. But a hard cap at 15 is lame. 
---
I was told a while back that the possibility of having 51 Luck would ‚Äúdestroy the balance of the game‚Äù and that would only encourage min/maxing. I fail to see how having base 1 SPECIA and 51 L would literally be OP. No health, no carry capacity, no crafting capabilities, no sneaky sneak. 
---
Because honestly, relying on the perks from one skill tree is the only challenge that sounds fun in this game.
---
But Aurelius, a player with 51 END would have too much health! That certainly is way too overpowered. 
---
I‚Äôm going to refer to the game *Dark Souls*. More specifically *Bloodborne*. In that game, the soft lock for HP was at 40. You could level it all the way to 99 if ya wanted, but it was a waste of 59 levels for no noticeably benefit. 
---
My point being, a soft lock at 15 so a player wouldn‚Äôt get more hp or carry weight or whatever, they would simply have more perk card slots to enjoy the benefits of that particular tree. 
---
Back to the original post. Yeah, perks like lockpicking or hacker should be permanent. And so should the others.
---
If you want to respec your entire character, you should be allowed to bring a Pale Tongue to MODUS at the Enclave Bunker of the Deep. Instead of doing it one by one every time you level. 
---
Say Texas Red. XD
---
2 stable cobalt
---
Great post.  
---
little did we know.. 
---
Damn thanks, been server hopping but nothing yet
---
You don't think when someone is a sliver from death on a pvp server they wont be shutting it off like that ? 
---
Someone said it doesn't work when the gun is overrepaired. Could it be it doesn't work with explosive bullets?
---
Well it's not the only one,even escape artist doesn't seem to work for me.
---
blame the crap dupers did to many players exploiting god like damage to one shot through protection as well as the new exploit involving workshops for killing people. i'd be keeping away as well.
---
You put more thought into this essay that no one will read than Bethesda put into this pvp server that no one will play.
---
Guy who was locked up in vault for 25years

200 is less than 300.

200x20 is more than 300x1
---
&gt;I‚Äôm not looking forward to being griefed and the player gets away with it and my loot. 
---
Good thing then that Survival mode will be a separate game mode, huh? No-one's forcing you to join it.

Education costs money these days.   To be more realistic they should make you take out a student loan.
---
Sure, my issue is more about the varieties of modern looking M4s than the wood furnitured Service Rifle, which I thought was a nice touch.
---
Fast traveling to harpers ferry turns my whole console off (Xbox)
---
I agree. Although I feel like the disconnects are actually the server crashing and thus we get disconnected.
---
Agree completely with this. There was no bug in bulk items. The bug is how it is now, not before. It was working properly before, so I'm not sure how this excuse of "new functionality" came about. To me it looks more like a short cut, or more ill effects from the bad merge.
---
Ill just leave [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amct3e/heres_what_i_could_find_about_the_currently/?utm_source=reddit-android) here
---
 I am not 100% what you mean but the Martial Artist perk (melee swings 30% faster) also works with the Gatling Gun (shoots much faster).
---
Yeah They will likely mess it up but to do so they would have to truely fail. For one can easily to this one well, Seriously they just have to set a different area to spawn the NPCs with new minor events tied to them. 
---
Happens to me. This bug started happening about the same time 'Bird Box' started showing on Netflix. 
---
Coincidence???
---
I was sure that he was going to get banned after seeing that you ban people who just craft too much stuff in a row.
---
im guessing meat hook= unarmed and one handed perks and pipe bolt action pistol and rifle perks
---
Bethesda has a website. Therefore, you can go there to report a bug to them
---
What would happen? Medicore games, medicore graphics and putting the blame on someone else (Outer Worlds graphics look like from New Vegas, especially the characters...yet this time they can't blame Bethesda for forcing them onto a particular engine)....and unfinished games (KOTOR II). So no, I really hope Obsidian don't touch Fallout again.
---
You can submit a ticket.  And I think their community relations person reads comments.   I just hope they don‚Äôt mess up the normal operation of the perk while fixing it. 
---
This is sad on so many levels I can hardly comprehend.
---
New Vegas was almost as bad as FO76 in the beginning. Really the only thing they had right was story, meaningful character choices, and crafting. It was all a buggy mess and rushed enough that they were forced to tell some of the story in DLC.
---
Then there's KotOR2, which they didn't even finish the end of the game, completely ripped most of it due to deadlines. This is Obsidian's problem, they rush and instead of skimping on unimportant things they simply release unfinished products.
---
Besides they got bought by Microsoft which means they'll never have another success like Pillars of Eternity, it will all be rushed and hurt because of it
---
Sure you wasnt wanted?
---
 ;)
---
Just checked wiki.  [*Neverwinter Nights 2*](https://cs.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neverwinter_Nights_2&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1)  great game i played when i was little gamer, but never hear about it from anywhere, old dayz when my parents were getting warez games from guys who they know from local lan-parties.
---
 [*Dungeon Siege III*](https://cs.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dungeon_Siege_III&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1)   Was good game, not as good as II, but still playable.
---
 [*Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords*](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_II:_The_Sith_Lords)   This was great! The best of star wars games.
---
 [*Fallout: New Vegas*](https://cs.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fallout:_New_Vegas&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1)   yeah, buggy mess. fun tho.
---
So  **Obsidian Entertainment** was just stealing popular franchies? Or wiki don't have listed first parts of these games?
---
[Source](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_Entertainment)
---
mine doesnt seem to stay it goes away like normal
---
They said they will buff the damage and reduce ammo weights.
---
I picked one up for you. It has a Scorch Killer Receiver on it, 3 star at 180 damage (for me) but a standard receiver or even hardened would do more damage.  You can have it for free as it was given to me. My gamer tag is ThundaDwnUnda69. Add me and I‚Äôll see you when I get on ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
So it's less mechanical and more not fitting the aesthetic of the setting with the abs like parts. 
---
What about those stocks for the hunting rifles then?
---
Whitesprings is all yours
---
Bethesda and Fallout is like father and adopted son. You just can't divide em anymore. 
---
I don't have time to talk about jesus christ
---
You're right, I did forget they added special respeccing.
---
But the game still doesn't work like an mmo. In wow your damage and defense etc is more or less 100% decided by your gear which give stats.
---
This game is primarily a shooter where stats aren't the sole deciding factor.
---
Almost didn't read yet another bitch post but I think you nailed it. Good analogy. Looking forward to more content, maybe, hopefully.
---
Another complain post just go quit man and move on we don‚Äôt need more of these any way they have discussed future content multiple times honestly overall you hate the game? You hate Bethesda? Snap the disc in half or uninstall and unsub from sub move on with your life you would probably be happier 
---
Just like Fallout 76.
---
is this game really that boring to play, you make another character to play it again? ... uh.. what is the gaming community doing
---
Message me an offer, my friend
---
Hell. go mad, get *all* the power plants and workshops.
---
I'm constantly following the people reporting bugs and it seems that route is the worst path. Either the report is [largely ignored or closed as duplicate](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aobkwm/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_weapons/). 
---
Yeah, they are hired(not stealing anything) to make sequels/spin offs to many RPG franchises, probably because there are people working in Obsidian that made the original Fallouts. Their reputation is based on that fact.
---
You spent over half of your post to demonize some griefers and how they are in real life. That's way too much. 
---
People who have problems, don't always want to admit to having problems, even under anonymity.
---
This post will have replies off.
---
It has been so many months now, it is now classified as a feature and not a bug. 
---
Why the fuck are you on this sub I'd you are surprised that people still play the game? Do you go past your creche and go "People still go here?" 
---
&gt;  The first flaw was the implementation of the arbitrary PVP.
---
What's "arbitrary" about it?  You can do it if you want, or not if you don't.
---
&gt; The second floor is the lack of any NPCs. many streamers believe that this is not a design feature, but instead, a cop-out or excuse because of the fact thatthey obviously didn't have enough time in development to actually finish the game
---
So your second "fundamental" flaw is "not a design feature".
---
Appealing to the authority of "many streamers" isn't a terribly convincing argument.
---
&gt; the story that does exist is so watered down and poor that it doesn't even make sense. 
---
How is it "watered down"?
---
How does it make no sense?
---
Do you want some lube? Or would you prefer Bethsoft go in dry while they fuck the community?
---
&gt; It's like saying, "No one in the pharmaceuticals industry can be profitable unless they're selling crack cocaine to junkies and idiots." 
---
Well that would be silly.  Opioids are *much* more addictive that cocaine, so that's what the  pharmaceutical industry concentrates on.
---
Where is Pete Hines!?
---
&gt; Can they not put some of that in the bank to make interest 
---
Have you *seen* what interest rates are like these days?
---
Fortnite....really.... You obviously didn't play fortnite when it first was released. Buggy as fuck. Hitching issues. Fully pay to win with loot boxes non existent legendary items on normal play unless you managed to get tickets to use on loot box.  Then they bring in BR. Hackers all over the place. People sniping you across the map with a pistol. It's only been the last 10 months they cleaned up there act.
---
Absolutely. I should have scrapped and stashed. My fault for walking around all moneybags. 
---
Obsidian divided them once and Beth Austin(Battlecry studios) this time(FO76 is not made by people that made 3 and 4, but by people who has not made a FO game before). 
---
Careful walking on the road up to it. Usually spawns a scorchy
---
Use discord. That‚Äôs what we do with our group and it‚Äôs very effective. 
---
More likely OP is wanted and hasn't noticed yet. The game fills up server at new logins.
---
Probably just took from a workshop and didn't notice it was owned by someone. Happened to me.
---
Heh. You're a weirdo. I like that.
---
Nope it happened to me last night too. I'm sure it wasnt a map bug because I saw 2 other people left, and then later only myself and I wasn't wanted.
---
So they never worked with this skeletonish engine? Thats maybe reason why 1 fix make 2bugs :D
---
Won't happen. Also the team that worked on NV isn't the same that's working on the outer world's.
---
There are a nice arena "gladiators style" near the top of the world.
---
That place could be nice for fights, also with something like a system of betting
---
There's something wrong with pulse mines in the game tbh - I've died more to killing myself inadvertently with them than anything else combined, even fall damage.
---
Happens to me a lot too. It actually affects every character on the account so you have to exit the game completely to desktop then log back in before you can use the account again.
---
Yeah! And the plural of fly is flies. I have no comment on Fat Beanpole.
---
That was a Brahmin pen used for making fertilizer. 
---
funny how i kinda lost the interest to roast ppl like you when you realized what we realized right after E3 2018
---
One word: Cringe
---
Is actually the effect I want. Developers are focusing on useless things, ignoring the community. I gave them something to ignore
---
Undesirables

Not under rated just out of his time. He was hugely rated during his moment. 
---
Source; lived when he was popular.
---
It would have been the best if the final chapter was actually finished, ha
---
Cool thank you! 
---
Where did you guys see this?
---
Damn, sorry for your friend and your loss. 
---
Try depositing everything in your stash.  If the items are split between inventory and stash it won‚Äôt work.  
---
I had to server hop to get it to work. 
---
I'm truly sorry to hear that. It's always hard to loose a friend. Even if you only knew him online. 
---
I always try to think of it as the soul of this person moving on to a better place. 
---
yeah i played f3 and f4 and a bit of the original
---
That worked, thank you!

5th point
---
Reminds me when I was lvl 30 had everything stacked into rifle/vats crit damage and walked up to a lvl 200 and after one shotting him threw me a bunch of question mark emotes xD
---
It's just the server that can't figure out what's it trying to do. Happens sometime when a nuke drop for some reasons.
---
Don't remember having such a problem, maybe i was mainly playing SW:kotor1
---
Loooong ago haha. Well maybe Jedi academy, or old battlefront could be better, it is point of view.
---
750
---
I'd say this pretty much nails it.
---
What's even worse for me personally is the total lack of any impact - absolutely nothing you do in the course of the game has any effect on the world at large - the state of thing when you leave the Vault is exactly the same as when you finish everything a 100+ hours later.
---
That's certainly a consequence of it being a multiplayer game, but it creates such a massive split between the narrative and gameplay that it just sort of ruins the game for me.
---
Who cares? 
---
I derive amusement from watching you battle royale kids think you and your marginally older 17yo streamer ‚Äúthought leaders‚Äù are literally ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù. Including downvoting anyone who tells you something that doesn‚Äôt align with what the cool kids told you to believe. I had a similar disagreement with someone else on a separate forum, and basically every post that bashed Bethesda instantly raked in 500‚Äôvotes, while doing the opposite instantly put a post in the negative. I have karma to burn, just.. interesting, how the herd mentality ‚Äúmutation‚Äù works. Facts? Bah. This has become closer to a peer pressured dogma. But hey, we all pass through that.
---
And, you know, no facts will convince. If you thought the backfire effect is strong with adults, it‚Äôs 10 times stronger with kids. 
---
But hey, I‚Äôm not here to convince people. Age and a little bit of real world experience will do that, and in no time you‚Äôll have a young generation of your own and *their* views to deal with. 
---
I‚Äôm just here to myself chew the fat and offer a perspective. Do with it as you please. 
---
Pretty sure there working on both pvp and pve content they already announced the pve content actually and the pvp is coop just cause you don‚Äôt like pvp does not mean others don‚Äôt many have asked for a pvp server and now there getting it 
---
Lol - agreed. 
---
Many asked for a pvp sever yes 
---
ye, tse double barrel sold the cheapest when tse was top tier and tse handmade easily is 1k. 500 sounds really reasonable
---
It‚Äôs very different from those games your rant is pointless 
---
just play smash bros if u really wanna smash
---
This game will be great when modders eventually get their hands on it. That's our only hope now imo.
---
Git Gud
---
Just quit why are you stlll coming here 
---
thats the end game content right there...
---
Put it all in your stash there's a bug, mats can't be separate
---
If your ps4 and want a free run message me. 
---
Yeah, it's no wonder, and Battlecry's history with gaming is not that great. If I remember correctly, it's one flop(called Battlecry).
---
That's a really good explanation.
---
Just leave then stop playing and move on with your life you got your money worth Bethesda does not owe you anything nor do you owe them stick to your guns don‚Äôt ever buy a game from them again and consider the company dead 
---
Imagine this.... go to someone in area chat who owns a workshop. Ask if they want to buy all your junk for really cheap. Kill them after and get your junk back. Profit? 
---
If I was Bethesda, I would just hand this game over to the NMS' studio and let them have a run with it. The graphics could actually be greatly improved. 
---
Only place I have problems is ws bunker. I load in  outside and inside the bunker I  get a multi color checker board effect on walls and floors for a few min. 
---
Agreed. I get bored halfway through missions because I know I'm not going to meet any cool new characters, I know there isn't going to be a moral dilemma, or an opportunity for an attribute check or anything else that, to *me*, made Fallout, **Fallout**.
---
And even then the main story wasn't that interesting to begin with, if Im being honest.
---
Eso is a great mmo your tripping 
---
Yeah they already announced it 
---
You should join our discord. We are a bunch of mixed levels who run around helping new players/players who need to farm items etc etc. 
---
Uh, why? These there some bug involved in it?
---
Who doesn't need to increase the strategic stash of junkies rolling pin?
---
Thats the reason i dont participate in any Events except the SQB. 
---
I don't see why the lack of NPC is an issue. 
---
NPC are quests givers most of the time, and here we have robot and terminal interaction for the exact same purpose.
---
I see no difference at all at the end of the day.  
---
If anyone is wondering what that song is in a Fallout sub, things have definitely taken a turn for the odd.
---
same here last week 296 plastic used bulk junk then saw a fan in my inventory and hit scrap all, did the same on the weekend but only wasted 130 plastic  
---
But if you plan on hurting them, make it a kill with the return fire. I've punched quite a few dummies that ignore the rules of engagement. Get your sneak-crit hit in as it is free damage when you can close the gap safely.
---
I haven't been able to play halo franchise since I lost my brother. I try and it just feels wrong. Like I'm missing my right arm.... You explained it well, that feeling. It's a hard one to convey and hard to understand unless you have felt it. I hope no one has to feel it, and therefore never fully understands. I'm sorry you lost your friend. 
---
Pacifist saves me everyday
---
We dont need 4-5 star legendary.  **We need 3* enemies to actually drop 3***
---
Its ridicilous i havent got a 3 star legendary since the laat queen and thats quite a bit of Time. 
---
Vertibot?
---
Killed 16 thugs.
---
What do you get.
---
How about a pulse mine thrown from the hip?
---
One opportunity is to combine weight reduction or others, reducing or removing the general weight reduction only perks. Thru Hiker w/ some of the food / drink in Endurance. 
---
Nah, I heard the gunfire. Woke up to shoot but died in the process. Immediately ran to the place of my demise and exacted revenge. No bag and insane load time. PS4.
---
Imo they should raise the level cap to 100 and seperate pre 50 ans post 50. That way you also have no low levels in the queen fight. 
---
Will do ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I'm UnicornQueen971
---
Had to design a hamster cage for my kids. AFK is more expensive in this game.... But it's possible!
---
Agree. The only "Endgame" is grinding for desired 3* armor and weapons. 
---
To be fair - Not all knows about prior realease/New Vegas, someone in here might have their first experience with Fallout. Remember this sub does have "76" in it.  
---
This!
---
Fuck this game...seriously. The only thing holding my interest still is base building, and I can't even defend my base. 
---
Allllllllll right you got me. I'll go back to fo76
---
I don't think they will. I believe the extra 2\* in a weapon is for the prime receiver mod and a possible atomic shop skin indicators.
---
I've had it for the last 2 days. It's infuriating
---
Call me the bad guy on this one but the "dupers" are the only ones selling high end items for caps. Everyone is in upheaval about one guy posting aa/e bloodied/e weapons for 15-20k everyday on 76, but the reality is, the traders did it to themselves by creating a luxury trade only market. 
---
Looks very cool.
---
I just moved from Twin Lakes to South Montain Lookout at the cliff. The savage Divide is my favorite area. Close to Watoga, close to Whitesprings and a beautiful cliff sight of the Divide, Bog and the Mire. I like to stay in that area so i have two free fast travel points spread far away. 
---
If we consider modding then sure. Fresh out of the box, though, 2 was better. 
---
I haven‚Äôt had this happen to me but I have had other things like whenever I jump because I have marsupial I seen to jump to high and do the power armor super hero landing every time I jump 
---
I found a dense mod for MA at HF vender may try there but its not a bos vender so may not be there. 
---
 For what it's worth I felt the same when I lost my brother and gaming partner 6 years ago.  Over time though gaming came to be the one place I feel like I can still touch a piece of him.  I genuinely hope it works out for you like this as well, hang in there.
---
That‚Äôs rough. 
---
Question: Is "Heart the Enemy" really a daily? My log claims it is, but it has never reset for me, no matter how many times I check that terminal or read the note.
---
True story, it was my 2c. That's a pretty good idea man. I even thought of something else to burn caps on. I've stayed at the Greenbrier a few times and they have a casino. Maybe they can also put a MODUS casino downstairs to allow us to bet on legendary modifiers using caps (since they have no worth) playing roulette or other random games. Or make up a game. 
---
Yeah, you're right, clunky top down isometric RPGs are much better gameplay experiences than first person exploration. How silly of me.
---
I think to be honest, the fact we knew BEFORE RELEASE that everyone‚Äôs dead, killed it for me (no pun intended).
---
There‚Äôs no sense of urgency or even a particular need to do anything. Except maybe leave Appalachia because it‚Äôs clearly a hellscape.
---
When you start any quest at all you know at BEST you‚Äôre crypt robbing. Your ‚Äúreward‚Äù for doing anything is the fact that you seemingly only loot the quest givers corpse after you‚Äôve fulfilled their last wishes via holotape.
---
All suspense is removed if you know in advance that you can‚Äôt save anyone.
---
Will there be mods for consoles?
---
Had the same problem with PA work station had to remove my roof around where I wanted it and then place it the replace the roof.
---
Going by the fact that Todd and Pete have vanished from communication I'm going to guess their entire plan is head to the Winchester for a pint and wait for this all to blow over.
---
The 'greeting' from Ted Bundy
---
I think you are wrong on your perspective. The quests allow you to tour the world. This is a new game and it is an introductory quest line, meant to help you understand the world you are working within. 
---
Like every other mmo game ever made it allows you to redo content. From Ultima Online to Everquest to World of Warcraft and to the shitty game of today they all allow you to repeat content.
---
You are complaining about an introductory quest and game mechanics of the genre. 
---
In relation to fall damage stacking,. Was questioned by another poster.
---
There's plenty of point to workshops still. Just don't go crazy and build some kind of super fortress. There's generally enough free resources to build extractors on all the deposits, and enough generators to power them, and maybe a few defenses. When you are building in a workshop, and the materials are listed in green, those are coming from the workshop's own resources. I almost never use anything out of my own stash, except maybe a few gears. So maybe I get disconnected right after building it, I haven't lost anything except the pittance of caps I paid, and the few minutes I spent throwing down extractors. And in return, I gained the rewards for taking the workshop (which should have covered the caps spent anyway).
---
The only downside off taking shops is the possibility of some griefer using it to trigger pvp with me (even if I'm nowhere near the shop), which honestly, I don't think I've ever had happen in however many hundred hours I'm up to.
---
well its not actually two shot anymore so id like that back lol
---
I'm truly confused about the down votes
---
Thanks.  
---
Cool. Yeah, most of endgame content is south east for now. Maybe it'll change at some point.
---
Huh? You sound like you have a big chip on your shoulder.
---
Could very well be, I hope they find some kind of fix if it is, or better find a full solution to undo this issue completely.  Between red dead and fallout disconnecting I'm getting pretty weary of feeling like I'm getting kicked out for no reason.
---
Me and my friend had someone killed us yesterday.
---
Level 300 odd, wanted.
---
They literally killed us each with one shot. Not even an animation of either of us taking damage. No lag either. 
---
Just one second me stood up, next second dead.
---
Who even knows what fuckery was going on there.
---
I never get any rewards for that one even when I win. Just to be clear you have to get one in each tire right? Not sure if im doing it correctly. 
---
It says removed. Was it a YouTube playlist?
---
I hope so. I dont like level based areas. I was glad when they removed that in ESO. I hope fo76 follows the same path. 
---
That would require a new kind of building system and Bethesda has their hands full perfected our already perfect game to the point that god would be pleased.
---
So please be thankful for all Tod has given us, and remember if you can make it to the title screen then it works.
---
Alrighty, I'm willing to sell it for 500, I don't use it anymore as I prefer my gauss rifle, let me know OP as I'm on ps4 too.
---
The best weapon to take down high level players with is the Plasma Thrower. It annihilates everything within seconds, you just have to go up and personal with it. 
---
Yeah - where are the damn attributes checks, that made a character feel characteristic?
---
If they buff the other guns to the pre nerf tse guns it will be fine. Currently melee is the only way to go, is absurdly stronger than guns. Nerf it to the ground too or rebuff tse or regular guns.
---
Yeah maybe if they even just made them 'key cards'. Like, still have them level locked but have them perma active. Things like weapon artisan should be classed as skills and kept separate. I'm sure BGS' vision for the Game didn't entail having to completely halt you adventure to swap around perk cards for very basic shit like repairing, crafting and looting. Maybe the system needs a rethink.    
---
Keep perks like +5% AP refresh as perks and separate them from unlocked skills
---
Thanks, I appreciate the offer. I‚Äôm on XBOX though. 
---
500 caps plus 500 free shotgun shells sound good to you?  Sorry for that crappy original price, I figured tse weapons were more than 1k, now I know better o:
---
It‚Äôs called artificial extension. They probably don‚Äôt have content ready which is why they haven‚Äôt released a roadmap yet
---
Would be a very poorly investiment of your money to use even 1 dollar in this mess. It will be free to play before the end of the year, if not before.
---
Hahaha.  I can feel the /s.  Funny enough though when I accidentally get 10c wanted for defending a workshop I run around with no DR and some Ballistic Fiber for whoever "handles" my problem.
---
All the time, it cuts out my audio too somehow. 
---
What do you play on? I think I may have an extra plan for it. (Xbox)
---
Civilization VI is getting a new DLC this week. If you‚Äôre into turn based strategy games it is a must have. 
---
Same here, last night I was on a server with like 6 other people at the start, a couple hours in I was one of 2 people on the server.  Pleasantly, I did not get disconnected once the whole time. Not wanted, I had Pacifist on the whole time. 
---
I vote this guy to be the president of the fo76 community. Well said! Great details! Nothing left to say honestly. All that is left right now is a dude at Bethesda sits down and reads this post carefully and hopefully, make use of such well constructed text.
---
Take my upvote kind sir! If i had any gold karma thingies, you would leave me bankrupt.
---
Because Fallout has always been a role playing game. they tried to make it an online role-playing game but now it's dead, so there are very few other players, and there are no NPCs, so there's no role playing. Is it really that hard to understand? Maybe if you can't see the difference, you should play some other games until you can understand
---
In fact the main plot is EXACTLY the same as that movie from 2002, Reign of Fire. In there you got dragons that destroyed the world (in our case West Virgina) and there is a prime like one that if killed solves the issue because they cannot reproduce without it. In the movie its a male while the other minor dragons are female, in Fallout 76 is a female while the others are male.
---
Beautifully and intelligently written and 110% spot on. 
---
I love and fully support the ending bit the best though. Modders have always had to go in and fix and improve Bethesda's games and each game it BAFFLES ME that none of the fixed or quality of life or great and popular features modders have done are even remotely added to the next game. 
---
Bethesda could make some truly remarkable generation changing games if they could just put down their worthless pride and work with some of the outstanding modders who understand their games, and their own game code sometimes better than they do üòî
---
I wish we could broadcast a frequency and anyone who tunes into it can speak through it over their mics like a sort of in game discord, so if someone wants to sell stuff they make a frequency and say so over it, and anyone tuned in listening can respond.
---
Probably will never happen though.
---
Yeah I finally tested this on workshop few days ago, and indeed the spotlights don't consume much. 
---
So my observations had just to be my camp being on same place, over several patches, about from early December or mid December I think, that it's severly bugged. Going to leave to better place at some point so it will likely correct then.
---
Btw if want to do exact testing, workshops are great since they have lots of resources, you can easily drop like 10 units of same resource, and measure it like againts 3 turrets.(I think different workshops have different budgets, the excavator is about the biggest I've seen, so many turrets you can have them. For testing workshops with small budgeds would be probably best, I did mine at nuclear waste dump which seemed fairly large)
---
And you can serverjump to reset them.
---
You can't choose to participate or not in PvP. The entire gameplay experience is based around the fact that you have no choice and you have to. someone can come through and destroy your entire base just to piss you off and even attack you in power armor and with reactive plates, you will become wanted because it damages them. 
---
The story is watered down because there are tidbits of storyline here and there in the form of holotapes, but nothing you can actually interact with, and most certainly nothing that lets you have an impact. In New Vegas and other Fallout games, everything you did, that choice impacted something else in the game. in this game, the holotapes make it to that nothing you do matters. You follow the overseers trail and listen to her dumb Holo tapes. But then what? There's no decisions to be made. 
---
Freaking 80 bucks for the preorder oml
---
Really need less heavy mini nukes if they're not gonna increase the stash amount anymore...
---
I once shot at a turret from a 200+ meters in the woods not realizing it was a player base. You should really be able to lose the wanted level if you survive long enough. 
---
Please find in my post where I said that I hate Bethesda. Please, dear annoyed Fanboy. Find me where I said that. 
---
Wait ur a level 250 y were u using t51b power armor
---
Rng can get it right sometimes.
---
Also the prefix diseased overwrites the legendary prefix so if you ever have a non legendary diseased corpse with a legendary item on it, it's a legendary enemy~
---
I think all of Camden park is bugged. There are days I can't get any of the 3 dailies to trigger. I did dross toss yesterday and didn't get any tokens for completing it, even though I made every shot.
---
Just another thing not working...
---
Then where are the none introductory parts? Not to mention plenty of MMOs have choice in their quests, look at SWtOR for example, multiple factions and multiple choices within each faction's questline.
---
Thanks for the good work. Built myself a spreadsheet to a bit of the heavy lifting. Hopefully it should smooth out this crunchy part. (I do see NukaCrypt, but at least I can claim I did it once, sorta on on my own). 
---
Tip to anyone doing this for the first time: Get this done before you go into the silo. Don't be like me. 
---
I went to Silo Alpha, worked my way all the way to the control room, used my key, then remembered I had to put in the code. Found this page, started working it out, waggling the joystick every now and then. Still trying to make sense of everything, and \*BOOM\* SERVER DISCONNECT. 
---
Logged back in, and the silo was on lockdown. I haven't tried to go back in after it expired, but I bet I have to work my way back down to the bottom again. 
---
Wish me luck. 
---
&lt;wanders off grumbling about Bethesda&gt;   
---
You're not. 
---
Nah, it's not like meme or anything like that. It's due to very specific part of his message.
---
&gt;I think I'm one of the few 18 year olds that like older music. 
---
This statement give pretentious "Oh I'm so unique" vibe which is disliked quite commonly, along with that it is safe to say that more than just few young people listen to old music.
---
The worst is when you realize that to temporarily remove that one piece of roof, you will have to disassemble and store the entire upper floor all the way to the stairs (walls, roof, and all), place your station, then rebuild it all again.  Fun times.
---
The Heavy weapons are a joke the scarcity of  resources coupled with the weight of the individual core and the damage per shot of the gun makes them useless Same thing with the Fatman and Rocket launcher/ grande launchers not to mention the bullet sponge enemies    
---
Do you mean 40megabits or 40megabytes? I have 25 megabits internet speed im pretty sure and i can play other games with barely any issues
---
The hell are you talking about my guy?  It just works.
---
I've got a couple of Canadian vets who went to training with me in Maryland. One is retired and fights for better VA care. I feel you in that regard.
---
Also, I really feel for you as a veteran myself. This is never easy. Holler this way if you need to. Ad victorium, brothers. 
---
So most humans should die from single close range rifle shot? Like to chest, belly, hell nearly anywhere. There should be no "health".
---
No, not in this game, not in many other games as well.
---
Probably fatman and Rocket launcher tho.. not sure if they will adjust minigun and stuff
---
Wow thanks for telling me! Made my day to hear that!
---
Oh.  I thought my character was-- anyway!  Good to know it's the game and not me.
---
I wasn't too happy with it as is though, my character aspires to be as good looking as the rocket girl and part of that was looking like her, except she has her hair out shining and all.  My hair is tucked under some spacesuit cap.
---
Still, I rock the rocket girl theme, have her as my icon, have her posters over my bed at camp, have her ads in watoga photo'd so my loading screens are of her.  Have her suit.
---
Now if only I could find more nuka cola so I can start a rocket girl themed bar and restaurant when player vending comes out.
---
*anti wooosh armor*
---
It's because he was using PA. (Just adding that information in case you didn't know)
---
This is what never makes headlines about games.
---
We love these people and they change our lives because of it.
---
I lost a friend much the same way. Respect.
---
I say Fortnite because it's the big free PvP thing right now. It doesn't matter how different it is, it's where the dumb kiddies go to shoot each other mindlessly over and over. And that is what PvP mode will be in this because of how poorly it's balanced and how they're letting people bring in their characters without making them make a new one.
---
Does the pipe revolver also work like pipe bolt action?
---
Ah. That explains that then. Good to know.
---
Also. To the guy with low health that I shot, I apologize. The wording on the medic rifle I had confused me. I was trying to heal you... But I am just so the dumb.
---
These dramatic posts are getting old. 
---
 Yesterday, me and my friends played for about 9 hours. I had one game crash. One server disconnect. On friend had two server disconnects.
---
We took over three different workshops. No crashes or disconnects from doing that. In fact I‚Äôve never had it happen because of that.
---
The server was full. At one point we teamed up with a stranger at Sugar Grove. They didn‚Äôt talk but we had fun.
---
A few hours later, we had switched to lower character because a friend got on. We ran into the stranger again, and she recognized us by screen names, waved hi.
---
There was about 8 people in the Flatwood‚Äôs area. Most of them low level. 
---
The server was full the whole time. 
---
MMOs are very complex.  It can often take years for simple issues to get resolved. DCUO didn‚Äôt have lots of simple things like chat working fir years. They just turned 8 last month.

all explosive ammo personally, including missiles and 40MM rounds
---
Every server I am on is full
---
also works with the gatling laser's charging barrel
---
Drops get way out of hand in Whitespring sometimes.. 
---
I didnt calculate it, but it seems that higher level players are already out of new cards. Is it.tge case?
---
no. only pipe bolt action.
---
Yeah. I guess so. I was only there for maybe 30 minutes and racked up around 20 pieces.
---
i think i found mine randomly on a Liberator robot a long time ago. not 100% sure though
---
8 per hour. 1 every 15 mins is only 4 per hour.
---
Doctor Strangelove reference?
---
I had given up too. One day I happened to be bored and needed to do a supply run so I hit Whitesprings. Up to this point I had only found 3 or 4 of the folder ghouls. I was the only one in Whitesprings. As I started killing ghouls, I noticed one had on the golfer clothes. Mind you, I was already in the 80s by this time. It took me a little while but I was able to find the rest of the ones I needed during that run (even with respawns) to complete this mission.
---
exactly.
---
Or link to spotify 
---
Just clearing my unread messages list. 
---
I now realize I was talking about wrong place, an actual tunnel. Which can be passed through.
---
no, keep 2- X01 (or any other) and excavator. Excavator because it 4x the mining yield when you mine while wearing it.
---
Do you have chest armour appearing over the top of it? Like it was under armour?
---
Well this is the way to welcome new players.

And welcome Florox.
---
That certainly doesn't sound bad at all.
---
I'm so so sorry
---
46hours in 3months wow. Half of hour daily. It is nice to see someone who actualy don't play and have life. I had more playtime 2days after release and twice your level, and now i have over 420hours in game. I should get rid of PS4 i am ill, addicted, without soul,....
---
poor luck or laggy server, i get one out of the 3 per day and tokens always work
---
Have fun!  Don't hoard stuff - if you pick up stuff too high level for you, sell it, or throw it away.  The game will make more.
---
If someone kill you someday and then eat your corpse, don't be frustrated. We are outside too long, and have no food. 
---
Excactly.  
---
Auction House
---
General Chat
---
I‚Äôm against LFG machine though. It was a cancer on WoW, that completely changed every aspect of the game for the worse. 
---
I didn't read half og that because - well, the grind..
---
Its a multiplayer game and other people can build on your spot when you are offline. Just exit game and you will get a new server and usually your camp pops up.
---
Build limits is for server stability - same with stash. Turrets take a LOT if budget so avoid those.
---
Why would you exit powerarmor and log out??? Anyway, powerarmor you exit can not be stolen by other players and Will actually be recalled to your inventory after 3 minutes. Will be named "power armor frame" and you can click + place it to enter it.
---
This game is survival. There are many elements that are hard for new players, but nobody forces you to battle deathclaws with a golf club. Just run off and save your bullets.
---
Perks are fun and easy to use when you learn the mechanism.. hang in there üôÇ
---
I think they meant the "explosive" heavy weapons, not all of them sadly.
---
Yes but demo expert and grenadier combined with fireproof and dense is still awesome especially with Fatman(fatmen?) And pumpkin nades bc of their rad damage. My two shot Fatman does more damage than my explosive shotty pre Nerf and I never blow myself up
---
Brb doing field research
---
Don‚Äôt drop power armor‚Äî-it will disappear on logoff.   Only ‚Äúplace‚Äù it‚Äîand it willbe recalled to you after one minute.  You can‚Äôt use it as a decoration.   
---
For real I never run out of round for my lever action, my handmade on the other hand....
---
This is amazing
---
It 's not hard to understand, but it's more like a dogma.
---
I play video games since about maybe 25 years now, so I've seen a lot of different stuff. And all in all, NPCs or terminals are the same entities in a gameplay point of view. You go to a point, ou speak or read stuff, there is something to do, or not, that's it. Having a pseudo human face or a robot or a book makes no differences at all.
---
Besides, in fallout76, there is a purpose for the lack of NPCs, you understand that in the long run, as you play and do the quests. And, it's quite good, if you ask me.
---
someone give this guy a medal
---
second hand copy code? you cant use a code once it's been used. you can only get hard copies 2nd hand.
---
I think this is a core problem of the multiplayer of the game. There seems to run 2 instances of the same game (at the same time). One running server-sided and one client-sided. And every now and then they synchronize your character between the client and server world. This is the reason why duping exists. This is the reason why loot vanishes after a disconnect.
---
Example: The character seen by the server is synchronized with your character on your machine at point 0. You play, loot some things, kill the queen, loot more things, etc. But the local information (the character on your machine) is different from (the character seen by) the server. At point X there is a sync, so the server updates its information about your character. So when you get disconnected before the game has successfully synced the informations about your character (skills, inventory, ...) may differ between client and server. To protect client-sided fraud (altering saves, etc.) the server then syncs your stuff back after log in. BUT it has the information before the last sync, so before you looted the queen; before you gave your buddy things to duplicate and forced a disconnect; etc.
---
This asynchronous server-client-management may kill the game, because you never know when your last sync happened. Since this bug is inert to the design of the multiplayer, especially to the client-server-management, it might not be able to "fix".
---
The movie industry does this with trailers (ie Terminator salvation) all the time and I hate it so much. 
---
It's not easy, but it can be done alone..  I only had a few seconds to spare, but was able to finally complete it. I was lucky enough to get there and have almost 15 minutes on the timer too...
---
the problem for most people is that the bugs/glitches have prevented people from enjoying the coregame, the bugfixing is too slow to maintain a level of fun when you keep getting constant dcs/ctds or run into glitches like the power armor glitch. Now sneak and vatscrits are broken after Patch 5/hotfix hit and they havent hotfixed that. Gamebreaking bugs and such introduced by patches needs to be hotfixed as soon as possible and not left on the liveserver for weeks at a time.
---
The patching of bugs/exploits have been done in such a slow and subpar way people are feeling that new content is the only way they can last until it hits. Without it the only thing you have to look forward to is somehow adjusting your gameplay to avoid as many glitches/bugs as possible while trying to make a build you find fun that isnt completely useless due to the broken weapon balance in the game.
---
Thats not even mentioning the effect duping had on the game.
---
The outfit is broken.  Chest armor clips.   I have heard that certain underarmors do too.  
---
You were talking about Big Bend tunnel? I haven‚Äôt been there yet either. 
---
How many caps do you have now?  Managing the 1k for the plan shouldn't take too long, farm Fort Defiance's interior, grab every straight jacket and colored asylum worker outfits, great place for many junk types too (aluminum, lead, steel, rubber, plastic, also circuitry, silver, kinda gold, cloth and kinda acid).  So you can stock up on materials while stocking up on straight jackets to sell to vendors.  48 caps each with lvl3 hard bargain, and I usually make off with ~23 of them every trip.
---
Now if only all the vendors didn't have 0 caps.
---
This happens when you die while overencumbered.  Like stepping out of a power armor momentarily but then getting blasted.  Etc.
---
i personally think the PVP cap reward should downgrade to the level of the lowest fighter (even in teams) 
---
so say, you see someone who is level 8, you are level 77 and you trade them some supplies for free. next thing you know they wanna fight, you manage to mow them down easily to teach them "never bite the hand that feeds you", but their level 250 friend comes along and mows you down for your caps and scrap almost instantly. in this instance, cap rewards are +8 for winning and -77 for being tricked (as well as any junk you had).  with the suggestion i said you would be at a net of +0 caps.. however your junk may still be forfeit
---
Happens a lot with the tents as well. Super annoying.
---
I was at whitesprings about an hour ago on ps4 and noticed the amount of legendary gear me and my friend were getting.
---
Got 12 legendary items in about half an hour, some were mostly useless but a few were ok. 
---
Vanguard marine torso, vampire handmade rifle, troubleshooter broadsider 
---
I‚Äôm starting to think this game is a failure with each passing day. I‚Äôm still wondering why people play it. 
---
Ya, it seems very rare at that location.  I was just looting thru randomly one day and clicked then thought "Wait, was that a Combat Armor helmet?  Neat."
---
Then I found out it's kind of ugly.  (imo).  Been sitting in my stash ever since.  Waiting for find a plan or more to scrap and try to learn it before I get rid of the only one I have though.
---
Yes but what the terminals are holding back is that the scorched and the molerats and goddamn vampire mosquitoes are also hiveminded.  Apparently.  
---
Nah. I think it looks great and am looking forward to playing it.
---
The only reason griefing sucks so much now is that any griefer can TP straight to you for a few caps. In Survival, they won't even know where you are.
---
well on the plus side they've burnt all good will with this game, it was their reputation that made people turn a blind eye to their massive incompetence in games prior to this. honestly if you dont expect starfield to be more of the same at this point you're not paying attention.
---
This should have more upvotes. Thank you for posting this and taking the time to document everything. I know just how tedious that can be. The amount of broken quests this triggers should, at the very least, responded to with, ‚ÄúWe are aware of this issue and will be working on a fix in the future.‚Äù Not being an ass by saying that. I genuinely mean it should be on the known issue list. 
---
Yeah, because the current PvP model sucks balls and they need to try a new one.
---
All my shelves and dressers feel so barren in my camp.  Would be nice to have the Single / Double Display Shelves be able to "add" all these bobbleheads I find.  And the magazine racks actually hold the magazines.
---
Currently that's all I keep in my Stash AID section is bobbleheads and Magazines on the off chance they'll do something with them.
---
The problem with weapon balance isn't actually anything to do with the weapons, they are well balanced in a vacuum against one another, the problem is that the armor system is way out of line.
---
The average armor of enemies is 175 after level 50, 100 as the lowest. and to deal reasonable damage to them takes a weapon with a per shot damage of \~250, which means that almost any gun is completely negated. 
---
Furious two shot explosive bloody instigating aren't good, they are required to reach the threshold where the weapons need to be to actually damage things.
---
The way armor should be balanced is enemies armor is 2/3 the damage of the weapon you intend to be most effective against them. As weapons who's damage is below armor+20% suffer massive damage loss, and weapons above armor+70% don't gain enough advantage to compensate the fact their natural dps is lower.
---
300 damage on the queen means we should be using a weapon with 450 damage per shot to kill her, and anything with more or less should be avoided. AKA, EVERY, SINGLE, WEAPON, IN, THE, GAME
---
To kill a shirtless scorched conqueror as efficiently as possible you should be using a weapon with 150 damage per shot, but the thing is if you have a weapon with 300 damage you can just one shot them, as they have the weakest armor AND health, and things with more health have more armor, even though that is as close to the opposite of what the game's armor system is supposed to be.
---
Enemies should fall on a scale, high armor low health, and high health low armor, an enemy with 10k health and no armor gets chewed through by a stock no perk 14 damage minigun in 26 seconds, to match that with a super sledge requires 16 hits, hitting 0.6 times a second at a per hit damage of 625, to kill an enemy with 140 armor and 1000 health with the same minigun takes the same time, but the super sledge with 140 damage kills that in 15 hits, saving a second. If miniguns were meant to shred scorchbeasts then they should have an armor of 14-28 (2/3 of 21, 4/3 21 accounting for stabilized, you should have a full build for this type of enemy), not 185+ 
---
I create alts.  I recently trashed a level 53 (my first character, it would have taken 6 levels or so to get the attributes fixed) and started over, with the specific goal of not completing any permanent quest until I reached level 50 .   It's been a lot of fun so far
---
I personally use the T51b, it has really good enegry and damage resistance, but it has low rad resist. its basically like the combat armor of power armor
---
Wasn't implying that he was attacking new players. 
---
Stop trying to farm mobs for resources. That's not how this game is supposed to be played.
---
i brought this up a while ago.  sick of spending caps to fast travel to a distant event, only to arrive with no where near enough time to complete it.
---
do not forget the +100 carry weight with a full set. +200 with calibrated shocks
---
But I wasn‚Äôt overcumbered this was on a new player 
---
Most the pvpers who brought the game initially have stopped playing now because of the current inability to pvp, these are likely the people who heard it was a "rust clone" and were dissapointed that you couldnt grief people
---
Best stats at level 50 only bad thing about t51b is rad resist
---
Mind letting me know as well? Can‚Äôt find a decent place like this to camp yet. :(
---
* First, arbitrary PVP implemented into the design. -
---
False. It was not arbitrary. It was based on a slap-to-duel model, and now they are trying something else.
---
* Second, the lack of any NPCs.  
---
Meh. Nah.
---
* Third, extremely watered down piss poor story. Previous Fallout games had 1,000 times more NPCs and dialog where this game has no dialogue or NPCs.  
---
Same argument as second?
---
* **Radio silence from Bethesda with very little information. No updates about future content, just incredibly small changes or fine-tuning that should take a couple days but instead are dragged out for months. They haven't said yet if there will be any future content. Absolutely nothing from them at all. Just silence. A big F U to players**  
---
They have talked about what they are planning? They are working on Events and and a new PvP mode right now.  
---
I call shenanigans on you, sir.
---
You say "rare" and yet I see a ton of players wearing it around Whitesprings every single day.  Not rare.
---
The biggest problem for lower levels is getting griefed by higher level players with crazy PvP builds, exploiting workshop takeover to initiate PvP, CAMPs destroyed, etc.  PvP is a problem for all levels and just totally unnecessary in the game!
---
Lol minigun.
---
That poor weapon is the laughing stock to all those Gatling guns.
---
That's what it used to be, I thought they lowered the output several patches ago 
---
&gt;There's absolutely no pay off, the entire story is just spent following a trail
---
Exactly this. The whole game is **explore, kill, loot, repeat**. When everything is explored and no "story" is left, it is just kill and loot and repeat. Looting is not so much fun, because you can't craft a really legendary weapon. In GW2 you have a tremendous amount of work to do to craft a legendary weapon, but it might be worth it - though I haven't played so much to afford it. Even in WoW legendaries are more and more a thing. And when you enter that raid for the sixteenth time just to increase the level of your legendary necklace by 5 points it's worth doing it - or at least you get some kind of reward.
---
In Fallout 76 there is no motivation to even following another trail when you know there won't be a shiny legendary as a quest reward. Or anything worth your time. So doing quests, exploring, looting, and even crafting weapons don't feel special.
---
Especially as part of the commonwealth
---
Sure, only 800-1400 atom. 
---
Thank goodness.  Every pound matters for me lol
---
Even with around 50 weight available in my stash it fills up fast after a few material runs, and it's ever shrinking as my aid supplies are hoarded for player vending.  Might need to sell my alcohol collection if I ever want to use a fatman lol
---
You are an incredibly condescending ass and it's not making me come back to the game any faster.
---
It's for supporting future development voluntarily rather than through a monthly subscription, not for "buying a thing you want." It's like when you donate to NPR and get a coffee mug. You aren't just buying a coffee mug.
---
i build such large  CAMPs because i build for functionality, not looks.  so my interiors are usually very bare.
---
i got a resource collector going. 4 tato, corn, and mutfruit for adhesive.  2 grain and 2 carrots for food.  4 sm water purifiers.
---
NO TURRETS!!!!
---
Big iron came on the radio when I was in the car with my dad once. I started singing along and he was like "How the hell do you know this song?" Video games dad, video games haha
---
from what i understand tse gause no longer drops. only already existing ones are in game.
---
good luck
---
I didn't when I wore it but that was a good long while ago.
---
I *did* see someone a few hours ago in the nuka girl outfit with their chest armor showing over the outfit though.
---
But is/was there ever an instigating one?
---
Stealth is directly affected by the total weight of Clothing/Armor, but beyond that, there is also something going on with Stealth while on a team since the last patch.
---
I have a StealthBoy Torso for my T-60, which does seem to help a bit, but is clearly less stealthy than not using PA in the first place, also I have seen no real difference with using 1 Chameleon Armor piece, vs all 5.
---
Even when a team mate is not in the immediate area, just being teamed has a significant effect on stealth, I have tested this several times by joining &amp; leaving a team while in areas with enemies, upon joining a team, I go directly from "Hidden" to "Danger", but upon leaving the team go back to hidden.
---
Why do you linger around this sub then? 
---
ü§Ø
---
I know it is. But knowing Bethesda they will only try to do damage control since they nerfed Demolition expert and only buff the laser guns and launchers. I'm still hoping for them to buff the minigun and stuff but i highly doubt it.
---
i noticed it too.  go a 3\* assassin black powdered rifle.  288dmg....stock.  probably takes a year to reload i bet.
---
Instigating would replace the two shot effect.  So no an instigating tse would not be possible 
---
Which doesent help because you can jack damage so high you still 1-shot people.
---
I've never heard of someone trying to sell a used game code, unless they were trying to swindle the buyer. I don't personally know of any game that lets you re-use an activation code. 
---
&gt;they all allow you to repeat content.
---
Yes, but they also give some kind of reward. In WoW you can redo a raid the xth time and you increase the item level of your legendary. You can redo daily quests and increase reputation of certain factions to buy unique gear or unique mounts or other unique things.
---
In Fallout 76 you kill the queen and get what? In Fallout 76 you do dailies and get what? When I have to do the same quest every day over and over again, I want to get something unique in return. And not things from a loot table which is essentially the same as for 3\* legendaries, with minor adjustments.
---
honestly I personally welcome the pvp servers as it means they can focus adventure into more pve oriented and they can move pacifist to full 100% block damage 
---
yeah, but then god looked down, in to bethesda's studio, and there was NO STEW, ON THE STOVE!!!
---
No, instigating is a Tier 1 effect, so is Two Shot - you can only have a single Tier 1 effect on a weapon
---
It also works on pipe revolver. 
---
oh god, yes!  how many times have i almost finished my CAMP, just to have to trear it all down, just because i have to remove 1 piece.
---
so fucking tedious!
---
Yes it was i agree
---
I have about 600 springs. Ill be later today in the game around 7 pm gmt.
---
Add me: paulofg1980
---
Yea explosives tend to suck at higher levels if they arent specd
---
So there should be an instigating explosive Guass ? I never seen one 
---
no, 2 shot is one perk. explosive is another. that leaves one left. minor perk. like +1 strength.
---
I would personally be OK with that.  I mean, I'm always trying to find good CAMP items to spend these Atom points on.  Only got a handful currently (hardwood floor designs, carpet, a couple things like a door, statue or two, and the succulent potted plants).
---
Oh boy I‚Äôll tickle your pickle for 600 springs!
---
you gotta love sitting at the queen, 20 minutes after the battle is over, and you still can not loot it.  happened to me yesterday.  had to wait for every one to leave till i was able to loot.  THEN.......my loot took another 5 minutes to show up in my inventory.
---
unreal
---
Have fun! 
---
I used free Atoms for one PA skin and a floor and never looked back. I also never play the game anymore
---
I don't understand how they thought a story of "Go out and rebuild" was going to work well in an online game where no change is permanent.  It's like mixing water and oil.  
---
And please, add something worth doing those dungeons. Like a guaranteed legendary from a pool, where you won't get a duplicate. Or uniquely designed gear you only can get from this dungeon. Or give us one exclusive outfit (yes, a skin) for completing the dungeon/raid within a specific time, or after 5 times or so...but please no boring RNG roll.
---
Enjoy Bethesda‚Äôs spit, fan boy
---
Wholesome. 
---
i brought up a similar request.  let me play my music on the jukebox.
---
I have my camp near camp mcclintock. Just farm the battered clipboards everytime you go in and you'll gather more springs enough to repair all your stuff for months.
---
The game is as close to free already and you try skim a few bucks off and then whinge when it backfires? 
---
My thoughts aswell. We can only hope.
---
there is an easy fix to this:
---
1. Get all your junk out of your stash
---
2. Jump in a fissure site
---
After completing these two steps your problem should be solved. No need to thank me it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm here for.
---
They eat people. That's why their name shows up red.
---
Ahhh no
---
Is the whole game still under construction as well? This alpha is very buggy can‚Äôt wait for release!
---
As far as I know, possible yes.  There's a lot of weapons I haven't even seen legendary versions of period, I don't think I've even seen a legendary Guass Rifle at all, so the odds might be just very rare, I mean it is a Tier 1 and Tier 2 mod on a fairly rare weapon to start with. 
---
Since the last patch, Marsupial deactivates intermittently. I am guessing this happens with other mutations, but Marsupial is certainly the most noticeable.  It seems random to me, but I have heard it may be linked to Rad Worms or to the various perk cards (starched/strange/freak).  The only thing I've found that resets it is changing server.
---
had the same problem on PS4 Sunday afternoon.  
---
Got quadruple teamed by supermutants at grafton dam.  
---
Respawned.  recover your loot was a misc task, but no markers on the compass or floating.
---
Grid searched the death area.  No bag.  
---
Worst part was losing all screws and balistic fiber... 
---
dont worry i did, after all it has a fusion core :P
---
The hoi poloi...
---
This happened to my friends, his HUD still worked but apart from that the screen was black.
---
We joked he needs a seeing eye Dogmeat.
---
You fucking delusional? This game is far from perfect, still crashes on a regular basis, bugged so bad certain functions wont work, and overall has been a middle finger from Todd and his company.
---
Ive had it non-stop since the last update. Everything takes a while to load. 
---
Lmao
---
Right. It's fine to  fuck over anyone whose build isn't stealth. I get it. 
---
My group was just discussing a similar idea this week. A quest to increase stash size or increased stash per level would nicely buff dedicated players without buffing the value of alt character mules that some heavy traders run. 
---
10 size per 10 levels past 50 is pretty stingy though.   
---
This would also help with the endgame where some players are looking to collect outfits, armor, or different weapons, and currently cannot due to stash limits. 
---
I'm on dat ps4 bro thank you though
---
Haha, I'm glad there's people coming back. :)
---
way to claim things and not provide any sources. If they are really working on a new PVP mode, that's even worse because no one even likes the PVP to begin with, so they are going to give us more of it? Sounds pretty dumb to me. 
---
"hey, remember how you hate that we focused on PvP with this game? Good news. We are giving you even more of that. Stay tuned!"
---
Make a C.A.M.P., make it something he'd have liked.  Tell us what platform you're on, and we can come join you and leave something in his memory.
---
You really paid money for it? Or did you get it for free with a new XBOX One X or a PS4 controller?
---
I hope that you got at least another copy for free to "play with friends".
---
Old school cool!
---
i thought that exploit was fixed
---
?
---
I got two legendary armor pieces off of one ghoul yesterday. Sold them both but it was a nice thrill. 
---
Are you using "strange in numbers" That happens to me when I get the extra bit of height boost
---
If you have a floor above or roof this will happen just get rid of floor or roof then place object
---
It was an NPC.
---
It‚Äôs an actual enemy you can fight. Great description btw.
---
I have a feeling you will be seeing it again soon.
---
would be fun but incase you didnt know cazadors aren't a naturally mutated creature, a particular group at big mountain made them the way they were in vegas.
---
but yeah more boss creatures would be most welcome.
---
Isn't this MMOs, though?
---
Well, must be a lot more than just radworms because I lose it without having a disease.
---
yeah, we know that.
---
You've encountered the Flatwoods Monster and survived!
---
Did getting your sense of humour surgically removed hurt?
---
Bethesda likes taking away our fun, so a GM wouldn't surprise me at all.
---
Happens often to me too 
---
that is what i did.  he played a stand up bass, along with bass guitar.  he passed 12 6 18.  now i have a tribute to him at my camp
---
As far as I can tell, those quests are on a rotation.
---
Day 1 - Mucker
---
Day 2 - Dross
---
Day 3 - Hotdogs
---
Day 4 - Mucker
---
Etc...
---
As for not getting the rewards, I have not ever had that issue.  Hell, yesterday I was working on a new toon and got to do all 3 as part of the calibration questline. All 3 worked fine for me.
---
Not saying you didn't, but I don't think I have never not gotten rewards unless I failed to complete in the time limit allotted.
---
How mant hours do you have in the game?
---
What are you talking about? You overwrite the data you're not adding to it - it's called a restore - no restore involves duplicating files which is why it's caleld a "restore".
---
Other areas to check is moving up the e golf course itself west of the clubhouse.  Then there is a two story building at the northern entrance near the green.  This may be out of the circle for the objective, but you may still get some to spawn there.
---
Nice.
---
These are bugs yes but are really really easy to work around. 
---
My condolences on the loss of your friend. I wish there was more to say. I'm on XBox as well. If you do decide to rejoin, look me up. I'd be happy to lend an ear. It always amazed me how a video game can bring otherwise distant people together. 
---
I went and bought the american flag plan as he was a veteran and loved his country ive dusted off my X01 aswell as he was Enclace proud i do have plans for more its just getting the willpower to even log on.
---
It's worth it. It definately has it's problems, but I enjoy the heck out of this game.
---
The flatwoods monster does not wear a pink trench coat. Probably a player.
---
I don't think that's really relevant to anything. Dupers have tens of thousands of nuka colas, so they don't need caps for anything. Especially now that bethesda actually added an end-game cap sink, regular players do
---
You‚Äôre a perceptive one aren‚Äôt you? 
---
By level 70 you shouldn't need much preparation to fight the hostile Watoga robots near the store. It's usually mostly Protectrons.   
---
The larger problem is that the BOS vendor-bot may walk out of his store, down the street, and just keep walking. He's sometimes several blocks away, in which case the store is effectively closed until he finishes his patrol. If you cannot find him in the store, you may have to circle the block, come back later, or server hop. 
---
Well we're here if you need us.  
---
I'll wear my X-01, too, next time I log on.
---
Clam down, jeez. It's a legit question. I wasn't trying to discredit your problems. I was just curious why some people have so many problems and others rarely have any. If this game makes you so angry you'd cuss a random stranger on Reddit, maybe you should turn it off. Play something different. Have a good day.
---
Brotherhood knights are so painfully literal minded, don't you find?
---
I think that'd be kind of a RIP off, needing to pay real world money for in game scrap seems unfair. Even if I can get atoms in game the idea behind that seems not cool. I personally feel atom shop should be ONLY ALL NEW CONTENT rather than recycled and rehashed assets from other games.. but that's just a personal pet peeve.
---
Does anyone have any information on the spawning for pvp outside of workshops? Are there set spawn points when your team in in active pvp? 
---
You don‚Äôt seem to recognize sarcasm.
---
God. I wanted that game so bad. 
---
I wanted a good survival game in the Fallout setting. I was telling all my friends how I knew that if ANYONE could fix the griefing problems that hit survival multiplayer games, it was Bethesda. 
---
You wanted to say, you bought a PS4 controller and got the game for free, right?
---
I use a PC as it goes and why are you letting Bethesda get away with shitty practices just because they've always done it? I paid for a product to play a game - Bethesda decided to make it online only and would have factored in that cost without the cash shop - the stuff that was in previous FO's for free, wasn't it? You asked;
---
 *In what world does a for profit company do work for free?* 
---
Well it wasn't for free - they made their money. 
---
Additional content? You mean the same content that was in previous games, pulled out and sold as cash shop items? So basically giving you less of a product at launch because they know there's people that will support cash shops and keep the practice going.
---
Sure thing!
---
Auction house would be awesome.
---
I agree it has got worst recently. It is taking ages for everyone in my team to loot everything as a we move through an area
---
Damn that post-apocalyptic realtor for telling me fissure sites would be all the rage. 
---
Same hapend to me, with no meat pile leftovers. Shame.
---
I love doing this to people , LOL
---
Yay 2 accounts woo
---
Start looking down when you place it. You can force the object to the lower floor.
---
Complaining cause you bought a second hand code from a shady amazon reseller?  And then you think it is Bethesdas fault?  LMFAO 
---
Oh... I'll call some in for randoms from now on!
---
I prefer the T51b too. Although i have Reactive plates for the Torso instead of a Jetpack. Helps with my gung ho melee approach. Having said that, i was in Whitespring bunker the other night, took my PA off to use a terminal and a floaty harmless eyebot just casually drifted up to it and died instantly. Probably not intentional but i found it quite amusing. 
---
Not sure why you want to be able to craft that garbage weapon so badly. 
---
Sorry, but once someone reads your username it's kinda hard to take you seriously, lol. 
---
It‚Äôs not an uncommon spawn at that gate with or without nukes I‚Äôve seen him there. 
---
Purplish pink? It happened fast 
---
This is a common feature with games for the last decade or so.  Any game that comes with activation codes are one time use.  It kills the second hand market for that particular part, but publishers rarely care about, or even like, second hand markets.  Any sales done second hand are not giving any money to the publisher.
---
&gt;What is to stop users from buying the game for the code, returning the game for their money back, but since they have the code they continue to play? Does that code get turned off when the customers returns a copy of the game and if so why does it go back on the shelf for resale without a fresh code?
---
The only codes that actually get tracked in any way and possibly deactivated are digital codes.  You can find times where publishers will deactivate codes sold via fraudulent online purchases.  It happens often enough with so called "grey market" or non-authorized third party retailers.  Shady sellers use these platforms to sell digital content codes purchased with stolen or fake cards.  Sometimes publishers find this out and deactivate codes, leaving the end user stranded, having to go to fight the non-authorized reseller for their refund (which... isn't likely to happen).
---
But for hard copies... you can exploit a box store like Walmart if you really want to.  Using the codes, returning the product, etc.  Only thing really stopping people is the effort, and just being too cautious to do so.  Sometimes you may have a hard time getting a straight refund instead of exchange, but big places like Amazon usually don't care.  Walmart will try to give you credit or an exchange on videos or games which are opened.  It all depends on the store and department manager.
---
TLDR:  Don't trust second hand market for games these days.  Publishers have been using one time use codes for some online games for quite some time now.
---
That is not true. I've found dense combat plan in the railway car west of Watoga Station. The plans can still spawn randomly in the world. You just can't buy them from vendors anymore. 
---
I'm actually surprised that Bethesda didn't "fix" Whitespring yet.. They have been complaining about items getting out of hand, but the golf course is one of the only places I know of, that you can get an insane amount of legendary items within 30 mins. Talk about flooding the market with end-game items. I'm not complaining though.. I got a lot of great stuff, and a lot of garbage. I built a trading house CAMP at Whitespring station to haul all of my stuff back and forth, and it keeps my CAPS at a nice level
---
I just reinstalled New Vegas and am playing the New California mod that came out at the end of last year (along with their list of recommended mods). I‚Äôm having far more fun than I ever did in 76. 
---
I‚Äôm both impressed with what they‚Äôve accomplished and disappointed with Bethesda. 
---
Some guys made a better Fallout game in their free time...
---
It‚Äôs fully voice acted too. How even?
---
Me too.  In FO4 I explored first then did the quest - having to go back to locations I had already been too was disappointing.  This time I (mostly) did the quest line.  Still a ton of places I saw but did not explore as I was on a mission.  Which there was a way to mark (multiple) locations to come back to to explore.
---
Level 60-something, on final march to launch a nuke....
---
That's almost as cool and yelling: LEEEEROOOOOY JENKINS!
---
To me though, it's not real money.  I get enough points from challenges that I can buy the few things I actually want by just playing.
---
I think of it more as the old adventure games where you found those rare coins or trinkets to unlock various features in the game.  I just pretend I can't buy Atom points.  And I don't really care if another player decides to spend 100 dollars on 10,000 atom points to buy 5 Power Armor paints and a dozen hair styles.
---
Take the answers given, edit this post, and break it up into 3 or 4 small questions. Post one each day for the rest of the week. There's  too much to unpack to give you any meaningful answers. I will say that the answers are a mix of you not paying attention in game or reading patch notes to the game,  some mechanics that are well known as part of the meta, and some game design issues that have been the subject of developer beat downs for a couple of months.
---
The issue was acknowledged by Bethesda in one of the "Inside the Vault" issues, and I think they were supposed to patch it out by now, but didn;t. I hope it'll make it into the next round. At least it's not game breaking, just annoying
---
Sorry if my comment sounded a little bit insulting. I played around 30 hours and deinstalled the game around the time when they unpatched the patch which patched the bobby pin weight. For me this game is like another No Man's Sky.
---
CAMP
---
If you get the message that your camp cannot be placed it means that someone else already build there on this server. I'd move to a less popular spot if that bothers you. Some places are way more popular then others.
---
When you build a camp, everything in the stored tab counts towards your budget. Some items (turrets and water purifiers mainly) eat up a lot of your budget. People who have those huge bases usually have no to little defences and utility in them. 
---
Putting locks on your door makes sense. If someone picks a lock they get wanted and they'll get a bounty on their head. That'll make your turrets attack them.  That being said. Don't do it. Don't lock your door. You can lock a water purifier or a extractor, but locking doors does nothing. People just want to get in to use the crafting benches or access the stash. They can't steal anything from your stash.
---
Power Armor
---
It is not possible to steal someone's pa. When you deploy a chassis be sure to left click on it. You had to drop it (pressed r). The game though you're throwing it out and things might have got wonky. Check your inventory again, not the stash. Your chassis should have been recalled to your inv even if you dropped it.
---
Perk cards.
---
They're there to help you. Choices do matter. Some perks give you a straight up damage boost for a weapon type, others make crafting mods for weapons and armor possible. There's a whole bunch of utility perks that help with anything from scavenging to repairs.
---
It is the ONLY path
---
If you have a rank 3 card and want to use rank 2 you need to purchase 2 more levels, so you now have rank 2 and rank 3; this means players will be a long way away from buying all combinations. I have 0 pistol cards and I have every shotgun card multiple times (level 220+)
---
There should be, but I don't think the explosive benefits from the instigating (not 100% on this). 
---
Op doesn't  have that achievement and wasn't in the beta.
---
Do you think 13 percent of the people who bought the game where in the beta?
---
Yes. Several players in our group (on PC) have gotten the black screen when fast-traveling to Harper's Ferry in Power Armor. Fast traveling there without PA has never triggered the bug among our group. I also haven't seen it since I switched from Excavator to T-60. 
---
FULLY ERECT HAND PENISES
---
Yep - stay up on top left side of map and work your way around and down some.  Don;t be in a rush to explore the whole map.  I saw a level 17 in the cranberry bog last night and was like damn.... 
---
The grind through my 30's was real though....
---
Ammo weighs a ton and it shoots like once a minute. Is it really still effective for anything more than a few solo targets? 
---
Because, in fo4, they originally started making the "assault rifle" as a power-armor gun.... and then to save resources they just used it as the generic assault rifle. 
---
There's still the half finished resources of the Chinese assault rifle in fo4.... they just never got around to finishing it for release or dlc. 
---
And naturally, since fo76 primarily reuses fo4 assets.... still not proper assault rifles.
---
dang, not one for posting comments really, but I hope you the best, I know that feeling.
---
Their roadmap is to keep scaling back the server expenses, and act like everything is fine.
---
I played the division 2 beta with my wife yesterday, it was so many things I was hoping for from 76.  We‚Äôll never go back!
---
They aren't complete/usable meshes. They never finished developing them.
---
There are so many variables that I‚Äôve been curious about that could all be lending to server issues. Is Bethesda hosting their own servers or are they using AWS like they are for Quake Champions? Is the service they‚Äôre using even optimized for database intensive games like FO76? Could the rescinding of net neutrality possibly be playing into the latency issues?  
---
Quit, and play one of the much better games coming out right now!
---
I would honestly be fine with classic weapons being a "skin" option for weapons already in the game via the Atom Shop. It would be less work to implement and more likely to happen.
---
Amen on the factions!
---
I‚Äôm sorry you took the time to write that all out.  It‚Äôll never be fixed.  Try a new game, seriously.  This one is dead.
---
Maybe since there are so many variables, like faces, hair, hats, costumes, guns/mods, power armors/mods, paints, etc
---
in regards to your radio silence comment; community managers on this sub have continued to tease it, saying it's "coming soon" and that they "are working on putting it together."
---
my hope is that they understand the importance of this info, and are preparing an immaculate and detailed timeline for the near and distant future. this games survival hangs on this roadmap imo. 
---
I loved Fallout 4.   I love what they're trying to do with FO76.  
---
Not sure why you are level 166, with what must be a hundred hours+ if it's a broken piece of shit.
---
It would have been a better game, no doubt. That said, I still think the scorched are a boring, suspension-of-disbelief pushing ripoff of the Master. I know they were trying to combine some quasi-realistic elements by using the cordiceps-esque fungus but the sum ended up being lesser than its parts, and the whole thing just smacks of "the Master, but without a game plan".
---
I'm also just not buying the BOS and supermutants being involved either, no matter how people try to justify it. I have a feeling that it was executive meddling that saw them shoehorned in, and it would have been fine to use the original factions and the Enclave on their own.
---
True, but there have been other references to it in this sub. It's one of the more ubiquitous things you run into about Fallout.
---
TBH, I'd follow the advice laid out by [Aten\_Ra](https://www.reddit.com/user/Aten_Ra) . His approach is thorough and may save you problems in the future. 
---
the other version of the station doesnt jump up iirc
---
TSE needed a nerf man... You honestly think the game was more balanced with them?
---
You don't need to redo all the transponders.  If you want the signal just use the transponder before the cavern (you remember where it was, right?)
---
In fact, if you know where the cavern is you can do the quest without using any transponder except the very last one at the end of the cavern.
---
nice story
---
After level 50 everyone should loss the same. A geared level 50 can be much stronger then a level 300. Once you can no longer pick special points all that matters its if you picked the right perks and have good gear
---
Pay to QA
---
Isn't it in TNT dome with nuca cola t-51 plans?
---
Division 2 has... Disappointed me as of now, like most games. Let's hope they officially launch better as the beta had all the same problems division 1 beta had, but like I said, let's see how the launch is.
---
Look up fallout76 flatwoods monster and tell us if that‚Äôs what you saw.
---
It was me! The infamous pink trench coat spinning Flash light flashing Freak of the southeast! 
---
This community can seriously be amazing. Last night one of my regular teammates and I were leveling alt characters and this level 80 insisted on kitting us out. We politely told him these were alts and it wasn't necessary and in fact our main characters were higher level than him and could likely kit him out.
---
Didn't matter, walked away with a level 20 legendary hunting rifle on the sniper I am leveling (level 22) and a ton of ammo and magazines.
---
He refused anything in return so when he wasn't looking we dropped him a bag of a half-dozen bulked lead for his troubles.
---
TL;DR: There are some genuinely nice people in this game and I try to be one.
---
If you can make the prime fusion cores you can use the almost depleted ones to make a fully charged one 
---
Sorry for overreacting to your question. I made a different post about this earlier and had 3 people saying things like this in a more sarcastic tone within two minutes of posting and it got downvoted 8 times in that span. I did turn it off. I'm done. Hope you have a good day /notsarcastic
---
Yep. They skimped on the NPCs and quests and gave us a game with no content beyond a very pretty map. 
---
Specifically the vendors get 25% of what you pay added to their cap limit, to a maximum of  200 additional caps at a time. Therefore you want to sell before you buy, if you have more than 200 caps of inventory to sell. 
---
I only have rank 2 of sneak and I am never found until I start killing
---
All myths 
---
Hopefully they will have the roadmap released before the game's one year release anniversary...
---
You get 5 dross but only 3 target markers so to be on the safe side and because I have trust issues  I‚Äôve always hit all 5 tyres with the 5 dross even though it doesn‚Äôt ask for 5 hits and I always get 3 mr fuzzy tokens with purified water. Might be worth a try if it‚Äôs not working right for you
---
Look for armour spawn locations, you can farm them for cores and parts.
---
And that's how you know they lied to sell this half finished garbage fire.   
---
How have we "rebuilt" the wasteland exactly? 
---
It makes me a anti scorchbeast machine. 
---
Anglers aren't a Cryptid they're just an enemy ported over from Far Harbor in Fallout 4. Mega Sloth isn't a cryptid either.
---
Kill em both take the loot keep moving 
---
I had the same thing, turn it off and back on, like the ones before me, I welcome you to Fallout 76, this is an indication of how everything that follows will go.
---
Is you camp situated west of Watoga?
---
And you can't actually build new communities, making the wasteland yours. Just a small lonely campsite that disappears when you log out. 
---
"Sarcasm" is an advanced technology that is not permitted. Please cease your usage of such technology or face dire consequences. Have a Nice Day!
---
It's frustrating,  but as players there's nothing worse we can do right now than deal with it
---
Flatwoods monster is an interesting fight. I have had it just plain ignore me to stalking me along mountainous cliffs. 
---
Here's an image someone captured of it:
---
[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/0/00/Flatwoods\_monster.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181023233847](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/0/00/Flatwoods_monster.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181023233847)
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. 
---
If I want solo play I can be a Lone Wanderer. If my buddies are online I can team up, I can build my base if I want to chill, or farm for XP and drops at White Springs. 
---
I‚Äôm level 85, and have seen maybe half the map and maybe a quarter of the quests.
---
So much to do and see, I can live with the odd disconnect or glitch because I have so much that I enjoy.
---
r/filthycasuals is probably a good sub for you! Come get filthy
---
Caps
---
There are 7 vendor factions. Each faction has 200 caps daily. That's all the caps you can get from a vendor. You can't sell every item. That's just the way it works. If you're trying to sell junk items you may have to bulk them at a tinker's workbench first.
---
Enemies scaling.
---
Stuff like snallys, mothman or wendigo are rare and can be considered almost a miniboss. They give better loot too.
---
If you want a good power armor go do the Miners Miracles quest in Garrahans hq. You'll have to make a set of excavator power armor. It has a nice buff to carry weight.
---
I don't recall ever getting an **online** pc game that came with a multi-use key. Once the key is used, it's done. 
---
If a game is returned, the code gets disabled.
---
I bought the game from GameStop preorder. I got my key via email. Make sure for future purchases you buy a digital copy unless you want whatever swag comes with a physical copy. Typically the game is automatically added to your account if you buy it from the publisher (blizzard and steam do this the best I've seen so far), or a key is emailed to you if you buy from a retailer.
---
Don't ever buy used/secondhand software. Ever. The key is almost guaranteed to be deactivated. This HAS to have been in error/slipped through the cracks on Amazon. Either that or a marketplace vendor is selling used keys as a scam.
---
No cd/dvd's isn't something new. This has been the standard model for PC games for nearly 15-20 years. 
---
The empty cd case thing is definitely a stupid idea. Considering that a large number of pc's no longer have cd/dvd drives built-in and the install is like 50gb and most users have high speed internet and most game companies have their own launchers to handle dev lifecycle and and and and and and...many more reasons - discs aren't the ideal medium. So I don't see the point of a publisher issuing discs.
---
Lesson learned the hard way, I guess. 
---
Disclaimer: I stopped playing the game due to all the issues and lack of end game content. There are many issues with this game that are directly Bethesda's fault, however, the issue you experienced is in no way Bethesda's responsibility. They sold their game to Company A. Company A sells to Customer A. Customer A returns game. Company A sells to customer B - code doesn't work. Bethesda, to their credit, still only sold one copy of the game. They shouldn't have to bend over backwards to give you a fresh code, since they didn't get any money for it. 
---
If you group up with people then you are constantly running into people. It is all in how you play.
---
If you're on XB, you can have one. I've gotten 4 of the dang thing in the last 2 days.
---
Mods, not the plans...
---
The liberator bots can drop them sometimes.
---
Look at the outside windows of a bus. they couldnt be lower quality textures. nothing reflected
---
This is really bad for FO76, because I like it very much, but TD2 was amazing.
---
TD1 is my favourite game of this gen, so FO will have to do something amazing to compete with 2.
---
Except in Reign of Fire the characters were trying to kill the dragons in order to save the survivors. They showed us the survivors and spent time with them so we'd want to see them live. We saw the kids watching in awe as the adults acted out a play version of Empire Strikes Back! They did that so we'd like the kids, empathize with them, and want to see them survive.  
---
They weren't all killed off before the movie started by some sort of dumb zombie virus the dragons were spreading. 
---
Even yao guai or deathclaws are cryptids. Check your challenges :)
---
What a dumbass
---
My mutations stopped working when my team members logged out and I still had Strange In Numbers active. As soon as I took it off, my mutations were back
---
ROFL!  First of all, Kudo's for him for even HAVING a mic.  But yeah, that's beautiful.
---
I hear you on that, I've also not bought any atoms, however let's say you just spent your bulk of "free" atoms on a new PA skin then they bring out this very thing we'd like as a bundle  at a ridiculous 2000 atoms and it's only available for 24hrs. You're now in a position where you have no way to make the amount of atoms you need in game, especially if you have already farmed most of the "free" atoms from challenges. This situation is where they are designed to pull in real money, and I just feel that's unfair if it's reused assets from other games I have already bought and own.
---
The stock isn't exactly the same each day. That being said I haven't seen any deep pockets plans sold after the patch.
---
Because it was half finished and the PR team was advertising what they were told the cobbled together game was going to be able to do, despite the original studio Bethesda Austin, and the 6 studios they had to bring in to fix this mess being completely unable to implement.  
---
They were  Molyneux-ing.
---
You gotta have some goddamn faith Todd 
---
Start a new character. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me to level a character past level 60 just to respec that character. Levels 1-50 don‚Äôt take long to hit.
---
Anyone that is past level 60 should just start a new character vs respeccing the one that is there.
---
I
---
Exactly.   
---
It's missing core features that are pretty standard in most online games for a reason. Because they provide stuff for players to do and keep them coming back!
---
The game classifies them as Cryptids? That's weird considering there's no actual cryptid equivalent of them IRL. Deathclaw ==&gt; Jersey Devil maybe? But that's a stretch.
---
It would have been an amazing story in a game that needs 6 months of patching to be playable.
---
hey good on you man i cant there's no end game content or anything but hey good on you finding more stuff to do
---
Currently, the complete lack of reasonable perk flexibility is the problem. To get around it, you have to pour a lot of time and effort into either leveling up to swap points or making a new toon.
---
With the fixes (I mean nerfs) that Bethesda has inserted, I sincerely hope they plan on either renovating the system entirely, perk resets, or perk freedom.
---
As i Type this a Quadrocopter Drone from the Swiss Post is probably transporting a Blood Sample over the Zurichsee to the nearby Hospital. Fully autonomous.
---
Test runs since over a Year, nearly no problems.
---
I waited but was distracted by other enemies.  Lost her meat pile.
---
Can i use it as a weapon? Or am I only allowed to eat irradiated ice cream with it? 
---
How can you compare these two games? Totally different 
---
And then the roadmap would have one thing on it: 
---
Nov 15, 2019 - Servers Being Taken Offline Permanently. Check out the Atom Shop before then!
---
I‚Äôve had prime receivers when more than 1 SB  turned up, had 3 turn up at Lewisburg station once and 2 turn up at camp venture, each time 1 of them dropped a prime receiver 
---
Hard Copy of a 50gb install equates to about 10 dvd's (excluding dual layer discs). An increasing number of pc's that don't have dvd drives. A single .torrent hosted on the launcher can net some really impressive download speeds. 
---
If you want a hard copy of the game, you should expected to pay more for the..."convenience"
---
This is a good point, they got NPCs at least hehe
---
I went back and noticed it too! I think it's the same asset. As for the "clusters", I'm beginning to think people were right: the "alcoves" could be just the "opening" from where the Scorchbeast comes out. And the "deathclaw/scorchbeast" asset is there so the player can search something.
---
Been searching for ever too. Seems just as elusive as the t60 brotherhood initiate paint.  :-(
---
Lurks on thread for game they claim to hate.
---
Sloan1505 Finishes shit post then sips a glass of Carlo Rossi. Smiling faintly looking pleased with themselves in the dim light of their parents basement. They think to themselves: "Fo76 your downfall will be my ticket to the karma kingdom."
---
..get a life.
---
This makes my Iron the big iron
---
It makes me wonder how everone could die in the first place. Especially since you can casually launch a nuclear weapon and then the radiation dissipates after 2 hours.
---
Oh, it can carry an almost full stash!
---
How far away are you from your 60" screen?
---
That.... maybe perked for anti explosive, and wearing dense armor? That setup can reduce a fat man to a tickle. 
---
Only thing I cam think of
---
Cool tactic. Just goes to show level dont matter in this game. I killed a level 140 griefer 3 times in my level 50 character. No power armor...vats and a good melee does wonders lol. 
---
Our bags and stash are too full, can't accept your items without being overwhelmed. :(
---
Yup, its only since the patch, and more so since i got "Escape Artist" at L40.... Still enjoying the game....for now!!
---
Stop saying "That being said..." - this isnt YouTube.
---
Exactly! There‚Äôre a few elements that repeat! I bet there's some clues we can take from them!  =]]]
---
The loot loading is bugged in other ways too.  For example if there is no loot at all, it spins.  r/BethesdaGameStudios_ have a negative caching bug, That may be related.  There network caching and data retrieve is probably suboptimal.
---
Are you on PS4? 
---
My secondary character is Manta Man and I'd love a team up. 
---
I also have a Grognak character at a lower level and my main can totally pull off Mistress of Mystery. 
---
Yeah to .8 an hour then they moved it back to 8
---
It will load, you just need to be patient
---
Do you have the correct perks? Don't some repairs require certain tiers of perks. Requires Gunsmith 2, for example. It will tell you in the menu what you are missing.
---
Sounds like a reason to go on a rampage and mutilate every super mutant you see for the rest of your life. You should come up with a battle cry like the Texans and their Alamo.
---
This is an especially pernicious bug. It is definitely happening more frequently since the last patch. It's like the database can't keep up with all the reads and writes or something. Of all the things that you will address in your next patch, please fix this first.
---
I didn't know the man but from the way you describe him, the world will be a lesser place without him. I'm sorry for your loss. Hang in there.
---
I think in your case it's not being able to find something to do, it's just you don't know what your doing.  
---
The current system puts us at an even 8 across every SPECIAL. You literally can't add another 50 to that. There would be points left over after all SPECIAL are maxed. 
---
Besides, if everyone over level 80 is exactly the same superhuman than it's going to be more boring than it is now at endgame. 
---
TSE nerf could not "destroy" anyones build, because TSE is still very good, so what is the nerf you are talking about?
---
As of two days ago when I stocked up, it was every 7.5 minutes. 
---
Well, i just checked and no they are animals so there are 8 cryptids in challenges
---
Megasloth, fogcrawler, wendigo, snallygaster, mothman, grafton monster, flatwood monster and last is alien (wtf alien?)
---
You took the time to make that comment? -1 for no life.
---
Just more reasons to split the servers for PVP and PVE. On PVE servers the low level players would have no need to run. If the potential PVE servers upped the threat of the mobs a bit (ideal scenario IMO), the low levels would even be happy to stick around high levels.
---
Also, there can be another reason why players are running away - they want to be alone. At least I was/am like this. I want to explore and enjoy the game on my own, at least when it comes to unexplored locations. Usually when high level player came he ignored me, oneshot everything, roflstomped through the whole location and then left. So after a while I learned to move away when a high level player was closing. Then I chose different location to explore and left the original one for the next day.
---
I recall reading part of Quake's netcode was used in fo76. I just don't know how much. 
---
If you're on PC run a file Integrity check. If you're not reinstall the game. It's very likely that some files got corrupted in an update. I was having severe crashing issues a couple patches ago and doing the file Integrity check helped a lot.
---
Sometimes the truth hurts.
---
Do you need someone to hold your hand?
---
Have you tried some of the advice? No one can help you if you refuse to help yourself.
---
Are they that different though?
---
Society has largely fallen; map is made using the real world as the template; 4 player cooperative gameplay everywhere; PvPvE combat; level progression system; loot progression system; server changing resets loot containers; loot + shoot; build your character to become specialized in any area you like, etc.
---
It's not like we are comparing Fallout to Mario here, they are not totally different.
---
It was worth it.
---
The find your big message should not disappear unless someone actually takes something from it. I've tried to put things in people's bags as well and I think that they don't go to loot them because the find your big message disappears when you do that.
---
Fog Crawler? I don't know of any cryptids matching its description. Alien maybe the Zetans which technically are, but they're not implemented in game as far as I have seen...
---
Workshops have a larger budget so they wont be the exact same. 
---
Just joined 
---
I know if posiden is running if you go into or near the opening of the cooling towers it will kill you quickly.
---
Yeah this seemed to get worse after last patch.  I mean a lot worse.
---
The optimal solution would be to have Survival PVP mode as the ONLY PVP mode and leave the original mode as PVE. This would remove the headache of balacing the game for sometimes-on-sometimes-off PVP. And it would allow to up the danger of creatures on PVE mode. Any new content would have to be balanced only for strictly PVE and always on PVP.
---
I had the same thing the other day on PS4. It was so weird going to Whitespring and only see level 6 ghouls instead of the usual level 68 glowing bloated ones.
---
If the power plant has been fixed, the cooling towers emit a toxic gas that ticks damage at about the right rate for you. Note: I don't actually know the damage ticks, but that's most likely what's happening to you
---
The lake flooded them because raiders exploded it to save rose, while I agree that part is a nice post apocaliptic touch, is not really main story nor world altering IMO, just another sad story. Also, you didn't need to have no NPC's to tell that story, fallout games have told tragic events like that in many ways. 
---
I got alien market as killed i did thar challenge already :D so wtf?
---
And fogcrawler is also in antropowhatever it is. 
---
Could be a bug.  I remember after clearing Powering Up Poseidon, I stepped out the door and got killed by a massive wave of Rads (because the cooling towers generate them while active, I guess?).  That whole building is a deathtrap.  It's amazing anyone in Pre-War times managed to work there. üòÇ
---
Good point. But people are switching cards anyways. So they are not really caped at 50. Perkpoints yes but not Perks. I also dont understand why we need 3 cards for lockpick/hackindg instead of 1 3* card. Or that i need 9 perkslots for max rifleman damage.
---
The weight reducing perks and Repair perks should all be passive. Its such a waste of slots and  switching is also tedious. 
---
While it is interesting that you were fast traveled inside of Vault 63... as of yesterday, you are literally the furthest- out of everyone else who plays this game- from being the first to enter Vault 63.
---
Solved! Thank you, that‚Äôs exactly what it was very cool! 
---
The two shot part over writes the instigating part. The game uses 3 legendary sets of attributes, each can only exist once. Prevents Two shot, two shot, two shot from being a thing. Or bloodied, instigating, two shot!
---
Nice. Ill have do try again after work. I dont usually farm much, but might as well take the gamble.
---

---
My Stealth/Sniper build is experiencing the same issues, but I recently figured out that it's related to Team play, if I leave the team, everything works fine.
---
What platform are you on? 
---
As far as I understand he placed it by leaving.
---
Renting Amazon servers apparently
---
I accidentally mutilated that story for me because I found the mother and daughter dead place before I even started the quest, so when I got the robes I already knew what happened so there is another reason why I don't like 76
---
I post a thread too about one weapon and one gear wich have disappeared
---
Nope, someone powered Poseidon. That's hot steam that's damaging you.
---
The active cooling towers damage kills you pretty quick. 
---
Yeah its weird man, I have 0 sneak but have escape artist and i can crotch and melee crit guys assuming i didn't straight up run up to their face first lol. Kinda makes me wonder wtf is the point of sneak
---
Hope you claimed all of the workshops
---
Have you tried eating and drinking?
---
Yeah I understand that. From the aspect of fallout 76. I misread and took it as the whole franchise. Which is different in some aspects. My mistake 
---
We'll see come March, but I get the impression that someone pulled the plug on 76 and is being told to wrap it up.  That's why they're being so vague about it.  I don't expect some miraculous turnaround at this point.  I predict they'll make a big deal out of some pretty meager additions that were planned out in advance and call it a day.
---
Submachine gun is a Thompson. Hunting Rifle is a Springfield. Combat Rifle seems inspired by a BAR. 10mm Submachine Gun seems inspired by an M3. Assault Rifle seems inspired by the Lewis.
---
Yes! Let the hatred flow!
---
Same here. I love just running arpund exploring and killing enemies. 
---
How about we just call em Rock Lobsters and move along with our lives?
---
And I went through *all* of Whitesprings last night and only got ONE legendary item. It is all a matter of RNG and whether the area had been nuked on that server that session, or not. I'm always fast traveling to the service entrance (mostly to pick up technical data), and whenever the weather is fine but the carrot flowers there are nuked, I'm going to the club. The parties there are said to be legen-- wait for it --dary!
---
It's been awhile since I played New Vegas (too long I need to replay), was hand penis really a thing in the game?  I'm at work and I'm afraid to google (or even bing) hand penis fallout

Active nuclear plant cooling towers are not meant to be walked in.

Sucks when you are doing the mission and someone turns it on while you are in the tower.  
---
OP's real response: https://youtu.be/EKlqFSf2qDQ
---
*Woah!* It's your **1st Cakeday** B1ACKM3SA! ^(hug)
---
1) fast travel to HF
---
2) while in loading screen an audio pop will occur and the game will be muted
---
3) load in to HF with a black screen
---
4) forced to close program
---
5) hear audio pop again and sound is back
---
I see this bug way too often and it seems more so lately than ever. 
---
Yes. I dumped 200+ weight worth of \* and \*\* gear in the register at Artisan's Corner yesterday, along with \~50 of junk. Picked up a few \*\*\* pieces worth hanging on to, if not using for my primary loadout.
---
Belongs in r/fallout
---
So I got a whole set off the marketplace on Facebook if you‚Äôd want to see it , 5k a piece really hurt my wallet but eh 
---
Oof
---
Sorry, but once someone reads through your post history, it's obvious how much of a blind fanboy you are. you spend most of your time here in this subreddit or others discrediting people who have valid criticism of the game, pretending that bugs and glitches have never ever happened to you so they don't exist, and that any concern people actually have that is a valid concern is nothing more than their own BS opinion. go ahead and point out my funny username, you sad little fanboy
---
I don't think there's a consensus between 3 and NV being the best. I think anyone would argue they are the top two 3D games in the series but it seems pretty split depending on the person 
---
This is good to know, thanks.
---
The club was definitely rockin'. But it was just me an another person, neither of us were above lvl 60, and it didnt have any nuked flora or super crazy ghouls. A few 62 toasties, but mainly anything from 22 reavers to some 40 something variants. Oh and the wendigo that made me shit myself when it darted past in a blur at the end of the hall.
---
You can already do this: Gain a level and reassign your points.
---
There hasn't been a single change that put a build into an unusable state where you couldn't just gain a level and start investing in an alternate.
---
Correct. I believe there's even a condition for it in your Pip Boy.
---
who knows at this point i have no idea why they threw fo76 on bethesda game studio Austen the ones with the least experience in all honesty i hope they able to salvage the game or just give it to the modders to fix once again
---
Almost makes me wish for a nuclear winter 
---
I kinda figured the M16 style rifles disappeared because of all the bad press surrounding the M16/AR15 platform. The handmade is very AK, which whilst comparable, doesn't have the negative brand recognition of the other. They might have been trying to avoid a PR nightmare.

Oh, I have a stalker do I? I'm flattered. I don't need to read your post history to know you are a troll. Your username is not funny. . . Just sad btw. 
---
inb4 our comments are -37 because of weird anxiety issues.
---
I just hope the level 39 didn't grab it before the level 13 respawns to get it.
---
It isn‚Äôt an exploit
---
Because games like this just work for me. I spent years on Destiny's gameplay loop, even when there was nothing new to do. I just create activities for myself.
---
Out my group, I am the highest level at 112. The others range from 50-90, so there are times when I just help them do things. I also have relocated to several home sites, haven't explored dozens of locations, and the list goes on and on.
---
Now of course, I will eventually wrap up everything there is to do in the game as it sits now, but I am hopeful that new content is on it's way.
---
How does that work for you? Focus on Charisma and Endurance? 
---
dont tell the anti pvp faction of this sub, they are dead set that there is 'no lore based reason for pvp, it doesnt make sense" 
---
And then proceeded to take pictures of every little detail and post them publicly...... When they should of just fast traveled out.
---
ok, i misunderstood, i thought that because people were carrying unlimited loads during these it caused the server to lag and they had to wait 20 min to pickup items.
---
I appreciate the input... .  . ..  . . .
---
you're probably not wrong... But, I've followed the story (still trying to launch the nuke), kept trying to find new locations, etc., but nothing else story-wise is happening other than just random quests from new locations and dailys. 
---
There is a long tunnel under the main road North out of Watoga.  Not quite what you are looking for but it is a nice location for a bunker.
---
Game is over guys and gals. Time to find some other meaningless crap to fill time in your meaningless lives. Let's face it, to those who spend so much time on this dead game and dead subreddit posting page long complaints, your life is meaningless at this point.
---
That was the excuse they used to explain the server lag, yes.
---
I have had a few servers where my camp couldnt be placed but overall not a big issue. 
---
Yeah bc its a camp and not a settlement budget is pretty low. If you dont use turrets you have a bigger base. They take up around 10%/ i think.
---
I use my camp as fast travel point. Vault 76 in the North west and my camp in the south east region. I like my little house so i never move it. 
---
Power armor is stored as "Power Armor Chassis" Dropping it with square on PS4 will drop it like you would drop a weapon. If you place it with X it will be recalled to your inventory within 1min. You cant leave you PA open. You gotta have it in your stash or inventory.
---
You have different vendor bots: Brotherhood, Free States, Raiders, Modus, Whitesprings, responder and two traveling merchants grahm and the bot. Thats a limit of 1200 caps or 1600 if your lucky.
---
If you specialize your perks to a build you prefer you will be much stronger. Find a good balance between damage and other stuff. Dont waste slots for "passive" perks like for repairing stuff or ammosmith and such.
---
Ignore those launch codes, encrypting them is stupidly complicated. Theres a website for the codes: www.nukacrypt.com
---
You can go into the Silos to launch nukes. The codes will be needed in the final step aswell as a Nuclear keycard. Then you can choose a location to nuke, preferably the Fissure Site Prime to spawn the queen or Whitesprings for XP. 
---
Its such a weird comparison for me, but I came to the same conclusion last night while playing TD2 while my friends were playing FO76.
---
I thought this unlocked automatically when you picked up Angler meat?
---
I could be entirely wrong, I suppose.
---
&gt;I paid 60$ for a product, it's not functioning, and the company I purchased it from isn't honoring their word on supporting it with new content in a timely manner. I was drastically mislead
---
Translation of your post 
---
ive been reading notes fine on a 40" screen lol, OP has vision problems or needs to move closer to that huge freakn tv
---
Sometime on this past Thursday  night, I was holding an explosive combat rifle and decided to srver hop for new events  for the weekly atom challenge.  When I logged back in, i was no longer holding  my explosive combat rifle.  Went through my stash and inventory and sure enough, the game ate it.  As such, i am now using melee until further notice, because this is the 4th weapon the game has eaten of mine just server hopping.
---
The game and servers as a whole have been incredibly laggy since last patch. I had noticed up to a 5-8 second delay. Sometimes my pharma farma wouldn't pop until I exited a building. It's ridiculous.
---
I use past tense because it's one of the infinite reasons why I uninstalled.
---
Seems currently Deep Pocketed and BOS Combat Armor plans are not available at any Vendor since the Vendor change update.  Not sure if this will change with a future update that will better clarify the fact that some vendor plans are still RNG.  Update notes said some minor CAMP and Workshop plans would remain RNG, but didn't make it clear that some plans would just no longer be available from vendors at all.
---
You have to find them in the wild currently.  Time to start searching Plan Mod spawn locations.  I've been focusing on a few spots I know each day.  Not really server hopping but checking them every time I get on, or have to go to a new server because of a disconnect.
---
They are at least looking at heavy explosive weapons but hopefully they look at the minigun, LMG, and flamer too. 
---
As it is now, it's a "dead game." The community is a pile of crap, as evidenced here. Why don't you give some constructive criticism to my post instead of some playground bullshit? I'm so glad that random comments from some no name on the internet doesn't bother me. :) 
---
I like the game for what it is, and hope to see it succeed, but it seems everyone else just wants to see it burn. I want to have the option of being able to play when they inevitably take the main servers down because people talk others out of giving it a chance. 
---
To the other comment on here, yeah some of us like grindy games, and no.. Bragging doesn't matter. It's the reason games like destiny and Diablo exist. Those are basically playing the same events over and over again just to get better things. Mod support would allow people who are actually invested into the game to include quests and story as they see fit (read: fallout new Vegas new California or whatever?)
---
If they did that but opened up the game to modders maybe in 6 months we would a working online game and a full single player one.
---
Had someone ask me that, but I had to turn pacifist mode off first and I don't have chat so he wonder why it took me so long.  My only player kill.
---
&gt;  Bethesda has managed to announce a future patch that will only tweak two things related to Scorchbeasts. So let me get this straight: 
---
No, you are wrong. They never give us full details of what's coming up in a patch, until that patch goes live. (provided they don't miss something that should be mentioned in the patch).
---
For example, in a past ITV, before the one about scorched beasts sonic attacks, they linked to a list of game issues that were being most talked about and that they were working on, and looking at. One of them was fixes to the perk Bear Arms, which they hoped to have out in patch 6. Which would be the same patch the are making changes to the scorch beasts. 
---
Patch 6 will have more than just changes to the scorch beast. But people don't read what Bethesda puts out there, even though people scream and scream for better communication from Bethesda.
---
For example, everyday, there seems to be several new posts asking Bethesda to allow for people to rename items and armor. And they have said they are working on that, it will be in the future. None of these posts say, we need that sooner or later. They are all clearly written without even knowing that this is something they intend to do. 
---
The next patch will not just contain changes to the scorch beasts attacks, and the SBQ loot tables. That's just one of the things they are confident that will make it into the patch, so they are letting us know. 
---
Yeah, TSE is nice if you can find one. I have a TS handmade, but no explosive yet.
---
My issue involved Demolition. Grenade and mine damage was nerfed.
---
There have been several high-level players like you that have dropped bags of plans and bullets and other really useful stuff for me!  I've rarely come across players that just want to be dicks.  I admit that seeing a super high-level player moon bounce up to me in my camp wearing casual clothes and shooting off his TSE shotgun was a bit alarming.  He ended up building up a high-level shotgun for me, finishing my wife's excavator PS, and adding fusion generators and missile launchers to both of our camps.  It was pretty badass, I'll never forget you Shakespeare! :)
---
Insanely fucked up weapon damage thanks to broken damage multipliers from perks and certain legendary weapon damage multipliers.
---
Anthem already has a roadmap and it isn‚Äôt even released... ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I made the mistake of trying to repair a weapon during the SBQ fight and got stuck at station for the end of the fight. Couldn't open any menu. Stayed there for \~40 minutes hoping the CAMP would despawn or something.
---
I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. I‚Äôm glad you met your friend, and I‚Äôm glad you have such fond memories of him. I‚Äôm proud of you for telling us too. 
---
Big hugs from Ottawa. 
---
Nah the server just struggles regardless with all the loot piles around and the players in such a small area it doesn‚Äôt load it all up very quickly at all. Probably more complex than that though
---
There's nothing much to do once you clear main quest line and repetitive events....
---
What's the point of a video game if you use cheats to get places. Some of us actually like the grind. Some care about bragging rights sure, but to some of us, the accomplishment of finally getting "that drop" is worth the grind.
---
Someone may be able to answer this better than me, but I was underwhelmed by that little misc quest. I don‚Äôt remember how many mounds I actually stumbled upon, maybe 3? I know (for me) there was one in the church and I think 2 out between the buildings. But yeah, they didn‚Äôt just jump out at me‚Äîit was more like dumb luck that I found what I did. 
---
I can‚Äôt answer the one about the uniform, sorry. 
---
Dude I log in nearly every day but I some items disappear before I find out about it. if your going to put them up for limited time keep them up for 24-48hours 
---
Don't forget a shoehorned antagonist at the end of the DLC that is obsessed with you for something that happened in your absence.
---
It's when you see a bug like that one, that you realize how incompetent Bethesda really is. Even indie online games never gave me that kind of bugs!
---
You mean the power armor pieces?  It's a long existing bug.  The power armor chassis does not properly save / load it's last loadout.
---
The only way I have been able to fix it is to repeatedly do this:
---
Place the power armor Chassis
---
Remove the items from the Chassis
---
Wait about 20 seconds.
---
Load the correct armors into the Chassis
---
Wait another 20 seconds.
---
Enter the Power Armor
---
Wait about 10-20 seconds.
---
Leave the Power Armor
---
Wait another 10-20 seconds.
---
Collect the Power Armor.
---
Place it and try again normally to see if it saved the armor loadout correctly.
---
I don't know if you have to wait.  I do just to make it ... "stick"...  It hasn't affected me in quite some time now though.  Sometimes I had to repeat it 2 or 3 times.
---
I hadn't worn if for a while and put it on yesterday and noticed the chest armor showing
---
It‚Äôs really the color scheme more than anything
---
Leveling is obviously an option, but for players who don't have excessive time to pour into the game it takes the fun out of leveling or bringing up an alt.
---
Not knowing definitive changes before a patch makes it difficult to plan ahead. I would rather spend my time improving my current build instead of having to accommodate for a nerf.
---
That would destroy the lore of being a prewar human
---
&gt;  Feel betrayed.
---
Drama queen.
---
&gt;Have a Nice Day!
---
That's a funny way to spell "Ad Victoriam".
---
Try r/cooking
---
Pretty sure the lore has been shat on at this point lol.
---
It's pretty shit that before the game released, they hinted at some mutations creating aesthetic changes to your character, making it sound like you could look maybe like a ghoul.
---
Oh well, add it to list of other things that were promised like foreshadowing storied quests that would lead to bosses like the Mothman and tons of camp items shown but not included such as vending machines
---
True 
---
The thing is, they didn‚Äôt skimp. The voice acting and the writing and the quest design was all there. They spent the money, put in the effort and did the work. They just did it all in a way that makes it feel
---
like it doesn‚Äôt really matter. (For some people. I play regularly with a group of friends so the world doesn‚Äôt feel lonely at all. I don‚Äôt care much about being fake friends with NPCs.)
---
Few days ago i left whitesprings with around 14 legendary weapons and 10 legendary armor. All 1* tho. Nothing useful. Did the loop for like an hour. I found 1 or two 3* enemies both dropping 1* gear. Legendaries are fucked up. 
---
As a heavy weapons user, it procs all the time for me and repairs a decent amount of the weapon. I rarely have to repair my heavy weapons. My Dragon breaks down "a lot" more but it's easy to repair. 
---
I have it maxed. Weapons I know it procs for: 
---
* Minigun (standard &amp; bloodied)
---
* .50 cal (standard, suppressor, &amp; furious)
---
* Gatling Plasma (standard, anti-armor, &amp; zealot)
---
* Harpoon Gun (standard, hunters &amp; suppressor)
---
* Gatling Laser (standard, ghoul slayers, &amp; junkies)
---
* Light Machine Gun (standard, &amp; troubleshooter)
---
I think it's just a low % chance proc, it repairs a lot though when it happens. My dragon breaks more because each shot breaks it a significantly, so there's few shots/chances in its lifetime for it to proc before it breaks. Maybe exploding breaks effect has the same effect and just breaks the gun too rapidly to give it a chance to proc.
---
Could you imagine a super mutant speaking with the voice of a 13 year old? Lol! ‚ÄúHey man you got any good legendaries you want to trade?‚Äù
---
I hope you're right. Just a shame they can't be confident enough about sharing updates on game breaking things like primary weapons or armor disappearing or not being able to exit power armor or only being able to use the headlamp in 3rd person. 
---
It does not take _"excessive time"_ to level up. The side effect of playing the game at all is to level up. This game throws mobs at you constantly and the fastest way to level up is to kill things.
---
There isn't any reason to accommodate for any nerf that has happened. The build still works. It is not unusable. It does not take _"excessive time"_ to continue playing the way you were and invest in an alternate perk path. You'll end up doing that, anyway.
---
Anyone experience moving at 1/2 overencumbered speed in power armor after contracting a disease? Curing the disease with antibiotics or disease cure doesn't fix the slow movement, but will sometimes fix itself if you wait the disease out. Other times I just have to log out and switch servers.
---
This only began happening after the last major patch.
---
Buy an outfit off a player, maybe.
---
&gt; A 50 cal eats 50 rounds in 4.2 seconds. That‚Äôs circa 12 rounds per second. 
---
A bit fast.  It should be 8-10 rounds per second.  Unless you're rocking with the aircraft version.
---
Was the disease Rad Worms?  Rad Worms was broken in the last patch.  Supposed to make you take 50% more rad damage or something like that, but when they tried fixing it, it now affects pretty much all positive and negative effects by 50% until you cure it and the rejoin a server.
---
I'm not saying this as a insult or slam on you.
---
But just considered that you took the ITV, which was skimpy, as the only thing they are going to fix in the next patch. People just don't read everything, or they read the parts that matter to them, and forget the rest.
---
They can only really put the information out there. They can't make anything else happen other than that. 
---
I suspect rad worms and glowing pestules as it has happened with both.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll try that!
---
Its been  bit since I played but I was in my xo suit at lvl 120 and tripped a pulse mine. Melted me. It was a quick flash, boom, and dead.
---
&gt;It is pretty annoying that power armor regularly picks the unused fusion cores over the partially depleted ones in our inventory when the equipped ones run out.
---
I've thought the same thing since Fallout 4...
---
Also, on that same topic, fusion cores with the exact same charge should stack in the inventory, or at least sort into an ascending or descending order so they are easier to scroll through... 
---
That interface is clunky enough when having to find the lowest charged core to sell, scrolling through hundreds of line items is a huge waste of time. And in 76 everything is cloud storage so you can't stash the low charged ones in an ammo box to sell later to Trashcan Carla.
---
Agree with everyone here. It should be fixed, but Bethesda will never touch it.
---
Almost willing to bet they removed certain items form the database, but accidently left them in the loot tables.  The game is stuck trying to drop items that are no longer available.  
---
Nice write up!
---
As a lower level character who likes to play solo in a Fallout 3/4 'adventure mode' style, I've found that crouch is key.  If someone does happen to see you the 'crouch and fast travel' also works well.  However, I've had one instance of harassment where I had to switch servers.  
---
Is crouch annoying?  Yes it is slow going.  However, because of my play style I'm really in no hurry to 'beat the game' or anything like that.   There is some great scenery in this game!
---
I think I need to look into  Chameleon armor, etc...
---
You do realize that you won't have to play on the Survival servers if you don't want to?
---
So you won't have to worry about getting griefed and people taking your loot. If you were really reading and paying attention, you'd also know that there are lots and lots of player that actually want this and are excited about it. 
---
That would make sense. It's gotta be something like that. 
---
Depends on how laggy the server is... I've had a weapon break mid way through the queen fight only to tell me it broke 10 mins after she died. Then I know I still have to wait for the queen reward to post.
---
Step back for a time. I started FO4 again and having a great time. I will be back in one or two months.
---
Activate pacifist that helps with these issues. 
---
I've had so much fun with my friends playing the game! So many laughs and good times!
---
Why do you guys still play?
---
Always happens to me.  Yes I have calibrated shocks also.    Interesting.  
---
Well said. FO76 still has so much potential. So many ways B can go with FO76. 
---
"The earth is slow, but the buffalo is patient."
---
LOL. you deleted the game because they made a mistake, which they fixed two days later?
---
Please don't expect me to consider you a rational smart person, who's views and opinions should be taken seriously. 
---
There are higher priority bugs, but yes, it happend to me aswell and should be fixed.
---
I intended on selling them, but I had to wait for the vendor reset. I needed them out of my stash to put the important scrap in so I didn‚Äôt risk losing them
---
Found mine off liberators 
---
Yeah, the game was clearly made for another audiance... that I guess Bethesda utterly failed to advertise to.
---
hahahahahaha
---
Was able to be undetected for about two hours sneaking around enemies, just by crouching even if I was right infront of them with my level 20 character. Was a big bug that I used to my advantage, got a lot of plans and weapons like that.
---
No, please no 
---
Definitely not. The water is too radioactive for fish, and any left would be so radioactive that eating them would be suicide
---
I find putting down all the junk extractors at Charleston Landfill is the best way to get screws/gears and other mats like rubber that aren't always the easiest to find.
---
Have you tried Goulish or Mutations?
---
Need tips on these and gears too.
---
Nah, I like helping folks when I can.
---
I'm using both the game and the reddit.
---
I've encountered only one dude so far who was doing any kind of PVP
---
If you're on PC, there is a mod on Nexusmods called "Glowing Meat Piles" that makes them much easier to spot in grass, etc.
---
Maybe instead of starting as one, do a small quest that will turn you into one? It could have some positives and negatives. Like Super mutants can't wear power Armor, But have Crazy strength and health. Gouls are weaker, But take no Rad damage and can move faster.

Screws:  lots of places.  Most every "dungeon" or zone type area you would go out to explore can be filled with Hot Plates, Desk Fans, Typewriters, etc.  There are a couple popular spots (Horizon's Rest, Helvetia) but they are very popular and looted often.  Many other places will have similar results if you go out.
---
Rubber:  Look for things like Gyms.  There is one school in Grafton, lots of Kickballs and Basketballs.
---
ok? what you want a cookie?
---
Actually, in Fallout 4 Far Harbor there was fish
---
I have not, and I travel to Harper's Ferry at least once per session. I'm not coming from far away (it's more of a "pay one cap to not have to climb the hill" distance).
---
As has been mentioned, junk extractors at the workshops are your friend, aside from that, be sure you have those components tagged for search, so you can easily identify loot that contains them.  Without doing the workshops I generally have 'enough' to get by just from looting locations.
---
CAMP:
---
* No, you are doing nothing wrong with the placement of your camp. There are some spots more favourable than others. Either there is endgame content (Whitesprings) or resources nearby (and fast travelling to the camp is free). Or some players just prefer the view.
---
* It is all about min/max with the camp budget. And turrets eat up a lot of it, so you might just want to place a few of them.
---
* I had no problems to find some workbenches or tables around in houses to scrap my junk. So in almost every bigger building I have seen one or even two - sometimes you have to search a little. I placed a very small camp with all work stations and used it to (emergency) fast travel when finding a lot of loot/junk to process. When overcumbered just drink/eat something, which increases your strength. You will be able to fast travel to your camp without leaving too much stuff behind.
---
PA
---
* I think your power armour just despawned. Like you dropped some stuff. I would recommend to have 1 PA chassis with you and put on things/mods you need. The rest should be stored in your stash as long as you don't meet the level requirement. Why to lock your camp? Because when a player glitches inside (using a bed near an open window) and has not the required lockpicking level, he must use fast travel to leave. And when he is overcumbered and you have no stash inside your camp, he has to drop some things. So you can build a trap base.
---
* How does spawning of items work?! Long story short: The PA pieces might have been looted recently on your server. They will respawn after a certain time. So you either you have to server jump, wait, or look at another location for those pieces.
---
* I don't know this for certain, but I think this was a design choice. You need fusion cores to power a PA. At the beginning of the game they are rather rare. So when leaving the vault and your core is depleted, it would be confusing to new players what to do. Should they abandon the PA or look for cores and where to find them. So it would be easier to make a questline with level restrictions.
---
Carry Limit
---
* Difficult to master. Just take what you need and leave the rest for junk. Depending on your build you would need 2 to max. 3 guns, and 1 to 3 melee weapons, 1 complete armour set, 1 PA, some chems/food/drinks/stimpacks/rad away. You can mod your weapons/gear to weight less. But I know with just the basic stuff you will already weight around 120. I regularly exchanged broken weapons with looted ones, when the durability was low. Take also care of your ammo, because missiles weight 3 per item and are only used by a rocket launcher (20) and are often forgotten weight. Use every workbench you come by. Also loot things around and immediately scrap them. Note: This is for leveling. Endgame is different.
---
* There is no other general advice, because you must get a feeling for the items, if they are worth looting. Picking up a rocket launcher (20 weight) only to scrap it is...let's say inefficient. I would say that increasing strength for more carry weight depends on your build. If you plan to go melee, then go for it. If you want to play sneaky sniper (broken at the moment - sneak bugs), then it would be not so good, if you want to min/max.
---
* It is a feature not to sell to much to the vendors. They have limited caps, so that people can't exploit them.
---
Perk Cars
---
* From level 50 onwards you get the opportunity to respec your points (one point per level), so you can also adjust your build with other perk cars. [Here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=) you can find a perk planer, if you want to go into it. There are others out there or you can also look into some "builds", just google them. Otherwise, it depends if you want to go melee or pistols or sniper.
---
Enemies
---
* Yes, there are balancing issues. There are also spawning level 6 enemies next to level 14 or 21 or so. Don't know why, but this is another "feature" what we can't adjust and have to live with it. And yes, there are a lot of reports lately that enemies are like bullet sponges and it takes ages to kill them. But I hope this will change with another patch.
---
* What region do you refer to? [Here](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-zone-map-with-recommended-level-range/) is a level map guide. Maybe this will help you to find an appropriate area for leveling/questing.
---
* Those are the codes you need for launching a nuke in lategame. The codes will change every week, so don't be confused when they are no longer in your inventory
---
Bugs/Disconnects
---
* Disconnects - they are normal (at least in Fallout 76). Even with a cable you will get those on a regular basis. Hurts when fighting the queen.
---
* I never experienced that there were no enemies in sight and then suddenly spawned - but I was once in a building, killed all enemies and suddenly they all respawned, because another player entered the building
---
* Shooting enemies, which freeze, lag, regenerate health, ... yes, this is also normal and not fixed yet.
---
* Yes, also loot not loading or taken a rather long time for loading is "normal". Has a little bit to do with the connection, but also a cable won't fix it.
---
* Yes, there are weird places to spawn when fast travelling to the camp. Be warned when placing your camp near cliffs. I placed it once at a hill with a steep slope, so I had to fast travel twice to spawn at the top or upper part of that hill.
---
Grinding
---
* Yes, the game is grinding. There are a lot of posts claiming that stealth is broken at the moment. So I would not recommend that until it is fixed. Also the enemies have to be patched to scale properly. Also there seems to be a problem with armour scaling - and scaling in general at the moment.
---
* IMHO the game has **NO** story. What's the story? Following tapes of people long dead? Rebuilding Appalachia while launching nukes in endgame? Being a lone survivor enrolling for the Fire Breathers, which are also dead?
---
* I think you can remove the quest markers on the map for events - but otherwise I don't know how to opt-out or something.
---
* Yes, you are doing survival and repair right. They just need to balance things. So that fast firing weapons do not break so quickly. Because somehow the durability is tied to the bullets fired. Also the survival mechanism would need more balancing, because I think I have 50% of my carry weight occupied by stimpacks/rad away/food/drinks to actually just wander around.
---
* Yes, the also have not thought about the multiplayer aspect of this multiplayer game. There are no trade hubs or places where players can meet. You might want to find a discord channel to meet up with people, if you'd like. Otherwise it is normal that the game is empty. Or you are hunted down and one-shot by others. So being alone is not the worst part of this pvp-only game.
---
* Yes, you are doing it right. Since we got no text-chat (which should be a minimum requirement for a multiplayer-online-game) there is no server-wide communication. If you have no mic, you are screwed, because your emotes might not be understood correctly. Just wait for a text-chat. This will improve the communication between players.
---
* And yes, they have not managed to implement zoning, so you can do a quest inside a building alone. When a persons enters the building, it is very likely that all monsters respawn. And you have to fight them again.
---
Go in the water, there are fish in some places
---
Continued:
---
&gt;If I team up with others then I may find the OP enemies less of a  problem, and I may keep more of my resources, and I may level up quicker  - would this be a fair statement?
---
Yes, this might be true. But the question is, do you want to? I also like to be a single player, a lone wanderer. And if a game forces me to play with other to achieve certain things, I have hard times playing such a game. I'm not talking about temporarily random grouping for a dungeon/battlefield, but finding the group or a bunch of friends first to start that event afterwards or kill a bunch of enemies.
---
I started playing The Witcher 3 this weekend for the first time and it is awesome. I started with "On Blood and Broken Bones" difficulty and it is very challenging. Before every fight I save my game, because enemies are unforgiving. I like it. And when a quest is too difficult, I do another one to become stronger. Same with many MMOs. When you can't do it now, do some low level things, advance, become better and then try it again. I'm not sure if this is also the same for Fallout 76 without too much grinding - but it might change when we get private servers.
---
I hope the game starts focusing on some endgame and NOT fishing
---
You can farm two events for a VERY RARE white Firebreathers outfit. It looks nice
---
Sorry if that was condisending. 
---
Trying to point out that in a way you already can. 
---
You can even put on an unruly golf ghoul outfit (it's kind of fun)
---
I did this quest several times with different chars, the disturbed dirt pile will show up inside the church along with some mole rats. Loot the pile (use transfer to make sure you remove everything) and it will vanish, just to be back after about 1 minute at the same spot. After some cycles the event is complete.
---
What I'm trying to hint at, to avoid spoilers, is that FO76 is *not* a story about how the scorched killed everyone.  Something else, which started before the war, killed everybody.
---
You couldn't have NPCs tell this story because it's the explanation of why there are no NPCs.
---
You can tag what you are looking for, like screws and such. I think you can do it when crafting. When you tag items, a little magnifying glass will be next to the name showing you that item has the resources you are looking for.
---
Then you learn what items have those. For example, life preservers have rubber and springs. Typewriters and desk fans are great. And of course, plungers are rubber. There's a lot of items you might not think have those items. But when you tag for search, you find out quickly what does. 
---
Then search out those areas that would have those kind of items. Office buildings, in fact, just about any building will have a lot of those times. Offices that you instance into, tend to spawn fully when you enter, unless someone is already in there, or maybe just left. 
---
Maybe take some notes on places that you find a large amount of. For example, Morgantown High School has  lot of plastic. But so does the AVR Medical center. There's a large cafeteria with trays and such. Also, Lewisburg was having a street fair when the city was abandoned. There's all these plastic cups and such. 
---
Once you have some locations figured out, do a run through every game session or so. You will soon find yourself with more than enough, and your new problem will be your stash box is full.   
---
Make a list. Seriously it may sound dumb but that's how I managed to get over 600 screws and had to start dumping them on other players. Just slow down a bit and do some individual breakdown after checking components and collect as you go along. Once you know what items have the materials you need, you start to notice them everywhere.   
---
Screws: Desk fan, typewriter, handcuffs, globe, hot plate, toy cars, giddyup parts, pepper mill, and more.  
---
Rubber: Mine suit breather and Mine suit filter from Mole miners, Kickball, plunger, and more.
---
For Rubber, check the school in Grafton.  It's to the east of Grafton Station and usually has quite a few Super Mutants around it.  There's a room with a ton of kickballs in it.
---
The power armor bug freaked me right the hell out last night, thought I'd scrapped the torso piece on accident for a second... till I found it just unequipped itself.
---
Fire extinguishers for rubber and you'll be swimming in it.
---
There's plenty of land locations far more radioactive than the water. I certainly don't expect to find fish in the Toxic Valley. But the river west of the forest seems only mildly dirty and radioactive. 
---
I think you have a long wait for more content that is going to be considered endgame. 
---
 Desk fans are probably the best. Any good office building will net you quite a few.
---
* Desk Fans
---
* Watches
---
* Cameras
---
* Typewriters
---
* Mole Miner Suit Scrap
---
Well, if they do add the ability to fish. There better be an option to catch three-eyed fish. That kind of fish really needs to be in the game. 
---
If it matches my own experience, i'm going to guess either you or the other player had multiple "technical data"s in your inventory, but hadn't dropped your first one off for the miscellaneous quest.  I did this to myself yesterday, lost a stack of 7, but 1 remained in my inventory.
---
Right I forgot about tagging! Thanks for the help!
---
Thanks, that's great advice :)
---
Im afraid you are right my friend . Also afraid in a few weeks there will mostly be the most casuals left in the in the game. Atleast if friendlist is any indication 
---
Its a weird one - other people around you can see it, and if you pay attention to the HUD you'll notice it too.  Doesn't always happen but when it does, it continue to do so each time until you start a new session.
---
I am sorry for your loss of a battle buddy. I know it can be tough, I have experienced the loss of friends but service members hold something more dear to one another. 
---
Personally I would encourage you to log back on and encounter those memories and steel yourself to them. Playing with your buddy gave you insight that helped you along your way and even though Ben may be gone, his friendship and wisdom is not gone. Play in his memory and play for yourself, to overcome grief you must face it. 
---
Good luck, fare well and always face the storm. 
---
Thanks for that, will give it a go when I get off work.  This has been driving me crazy.
---
What you aren't supposed to be doing, This is the most exciting stuff about the game sadly
---
Also, everything Bethesda *has* said, has killed this game
---
Makes sense.
---
Power armor for pvp?
---
Lol 
---
Do you need a Round Table Meeting when there‚Äôs one person working on the game?  I think any table would suffice.
---
Because I had reactive plates and was in Passive mode - apparently when I was killing a bunch of Ghouls at Whitesprings, him hitting my armor did damage back to him triggering a wanted status.
---
It took me close to 45 mins to find someone who would kill be not realizing it was a trap - but the second he killed me, he logged out thinking there was a trick.  It sucks that people like you are doing stuff like that that screw us from getting legit killed when we are wanted.
---
Generally I hop servers to fix this, but I will give this a go.
---
I know when you're powering it up there's an option to raise/lower blast shield.. what does that affect?
---
In a way you already can:
---
Equip goulish and put on a golfer outfit/visor (and hang out at whitesprings, if your sneak is high enough you can just chill with the ghouls)
---
Get some mutations and maybe try altering your appearance (I think that you can do it at any at any time, but I have not tried it myself and do not know how far you can go)
---
Broken?  Yep, it sure is.  I don't even bother with this Event now as it seems perpetually bugged, and given how long it stays on the map, I seem to be in good company avoiding it.
---
Yes, and who exactly is ringing the church bells?
---
Maybe!  No matter what, we know Bethesda‚Äôs definition of ‚Äúbleeding edge‚Äù is a 20 year old joke. 
---
I don't think there's been any 'breaking' changes, but, to your point, I'd love to see a perk reset made available any time that balance changes are made, at least for people using perks that are touched by those changes.
---
Ah, a representative from the thought control generation, responding to the cognitive dissonance they feel when they witness other people with brains and a spine, with the go-to response, of begging for more thought control.
---
it was in the old world blues dlc
---
I get wierd emoji responses, and runaways because I sometimes wear a pink swimsuit - once someone up and moved their camp after seeing me.
---
I feel your pain too. 
---
Sounds plausible, ftp model with lootboxes(lunchboxes) containing legendary items and perk cards, cosmetics, skins.
---
The collectors edition debacle to me says they rushed it and didn‚Äôt put much effort in. It wasn‚Äôt evil or deliberate. They just threw it together last minute and ran into production issues. 
---
So instead of releasing FTP and making next to nothing, as the game was broken and bad and they knew it. They used the Fallout brand to push full price sales to recoup their losses.
---
It just makes too much sense. 
---
I got it mainly through trading on here and discord *traded guns for it or armor that I had*
---
I have 3 ass sent 1 chameleon sent and one life-saving sent
---
Nope. The only outfits that can spawn in there is one of four Jacket &amp; Jeans outfits.
---
I love how the players take all this careful time to figure out what is wrong with the fucking game, and how to fix it. The players and fans give the devs pretty much all they need to get this game up to its full potential. But BeThEsDa Autism still sits with its thumb up its ass doing nothing. Give it to the modders, you guys did a shitty job as of yet. They can (and will) fix the game. 
---
It's ok man. I feel the frustration too, sometimes. The fallout universe has been my favorite leisure time getaway since fo1. It's a shame to see the neglect this game is getting. It has so much potential. I would suggest not giving up completely, come back in a couple months to see if things have changed. See you in the wasteland. üôã
---
I don't think this game is really designed for anyone that is hardcore, or close to hardcore. 
---
it was never meant to be about getting to the end and beating the game. Like all the past Fallouts. I'm not saying that's good or bad.
---
But no game can be all things to all different kinds of people. Just because nothing really can. 
---
And considering the games dropping in february&amp;march.
---
That's the plan. I'm done for a while. Have a good one!
---
They did ambush him though... That's not really exploitation.
---
I will be now.  Sucks because I wanted to farm regional apparel.  I haven't done too many events until recently.  So I'm starting to notice how broken some of them are :(
---
your comment speaks volumes about how little you know of the subjects you choose to talk about.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought. I appreciate the response.
---
I absolutely think they intended to sell perk card packs in the FTP model. That explains why they‚Äôd have such a peculiar FTP mechanic that doesn‚Äôt actually let you purchase packs. 
---
Clearly you forgot my theoretical degree in physics.
---
Alright, so it's inside the church?  I mean, that makes sense, but I swore I combed that up and down last time.  It doesn't require a Shovel or something to see it, does it?
---
I read the notes on my 42", but I also keep a banana chair in the living room now just for playing 76.  I can't complain overmuch, I actually liked that the environment told the story.. kind of a throw back to when games actually took effort (I've been gaming for 35 years... so there's that).  I've definitely got my moneys worth from the game, twice (started on xbox, then switched to ps4 for friend lock-in).  As for legibility, make sure your console and tv are set to play nice.  Pretty much agree with everything you've mentioned on the bugs... they can be frustrating, but I've sure enjoyed the game.
---
This is as bad as when people come up with theories about shows where the main character is crazy, and everything is happening inside their head. 
---
I was making fun of your abbreviation of "assassins sentinels" as "ass sent", i.e. you seemed to be claiming that you pulled your armor out of your ass.
---
They paid $60 and got screwed for it.
---
a) everyone needs to know that Bethesda steals money
---
b) every person in that situation deserves to get their $60 worth of entertainment by ruining this game to whatever tune gives them $60 worth of satisfaction
---
c) making you feel stupid for liking a bad game is a public service
---
I just use Spotify, play anything you want then.
---
So you think they were gonna release the game as is and never add any content to it? Lol
---
I saw a squirrel the other day that had a fluffy tail. 
---
Let's go ride bikes. 
---
This game reminds me of A Series of Unfortunate Events 
---
Wow! That was a great video, thank you for sharing. I thought I was good at base building, but Jug is a Master! I learned a lot watching just that one video, and now I have to watch them all.
---
The RNG bringeth and the RNG taketh away, blessed be the RNG.
---
I've heard about this too, thanks!
---
Thats a good point actually. Atleast i got my money worth.  I also think a was hoping for more of this game due to my passion for these kind of games
---
Oh lol I'm just way too type it all and have a high chance of misspelling it
---
My child's all grown up and learning now. 
---
There are workarounds to both your problems;
---
(1) If the event gets stuck, there's at least one mirelurk where the pathing to the island is broken. Wander around the lake, even up to a very far distance north or west and find and kill the stuck mirelurk(s). 
---
(2) If you complete the event successfully, you get no rewards (seems like a bug). Let at least one mirelurk get to the island so the mirelurk queen spawns and kill it. You will at least get half rewards.
---
(3) if you get on the island to start the event and it doesn't start, give up. There's no workaround we've found for that bug.
---
Bethesda has never been great about ongoing support. I suspected right after release they would make a big deal about a couple of patches, to make it seem like they were responsive to try to save a little face, then would let it die quietly. My prediction seems to be coming true.
---
yeah for any sneak builds, the last major patch took a slightly buggy but doable build to completely broken build.  i used to play couple hours per session, now i just do a few quests and log off.  its sad.  devs said they will "look into it" but acknowledged nothing.  i have little hope to be honest.  its depressing how broken stealth is now.  
---
See it‚Äôs shit like this that made me quit. I won‚Äôt buy it for more than $20.
---
Yes, this is why no one reports it and why there's always people on Whitespring's Golf Club. I've seen legendaries dropping from non-legendaries which is weird considering it gets reported when it happens backwards.
---
No, I think they knew the game was being released in an alpha state. And that initial adoption would be low, and wouldn‚Äôt generate the funds the continue devoting recourses to it. Launching FTP would have been a death sentence for the game.
---
So they charged full price. Used the Fallout brand to push sales. And that injection of capital will be used to get the game into a playable state. And hopefully from there more people will play and then they can consider moving back to their original business model. 
---
Well, I mean he died before you were born, so the previous comment still stands.
---
In my opinion this is a horrible theory for the simple fact that you could make a fallout game not up to par(76, and I love fo76 still) and it can be a steaming pile of cookie and still sell well. On top of that still charge for the game and the items. Bethesda doesn't have to release an in house game ftp that's fallout or elder scrolls.
---
What platform are you on, i think I have a duplicate set (I'll have to double check though)
---
What platform? I've got the outfit, but I have no desire/reason to wear it. Not on much (just mornings on weekends) but I'd give him mine if he's on PC.
---
Watoga Station and the BoS Pheonix vendor bot has it consistently for me.
---
They want to die they can beg like everybody else.
---
Yeah, unless I'm at Whitesprings I almost never see anyone.  Sometimes at quest places like the Mystery Lair or whatever.
---
Except they did skimp.
---
Compare the quantity and quality of audio lines, and quests to something like Fallout 4, or even Fallout New Vegas. This is no where near what it should be for a game this size. Even for an online multiplayer game this size. 
---
I can get more story, quests and dialogue from Destiny 2. The only thing this game compares positively to in those cases are pure survival games like Ark, and Conan Exiles. And that's only an excuse because neither game really has any of those elements.
---
Another one bites the dust!
---
Yeah, it is a little vague though... Kinda hope it gets fleshed out after launch
---
Yeah in Old World Blues the half-crazy computers in the Think Tank think your fingers and toes are "hand penises" and "foot penises".
---
He'll giving to the modders will make the game better and more interesting. Also im fairly certain the game is about as stable as an excavotor on a tightrope.
---
It‚Äôs like every open world Bethesda game. That why I love their games. You can make new characters and experience it in a different way. This time I was able to zone in on the story more than I was the first place through.
---
So nobody has answered the question and I am also looking for the answer.  I'm using one harder to detect piece, a chameleon piece and all 5 pieces are shadowed, sneak 3 and escape artist. My agility is 21 due to mutations and armor pieces.  While crouching, I can move full (crouched) speed (speed demon mutation) across the map and NOTHING (other than dogs/wolves) will see me.  Scorchbeasts will not see me even if I'm moving, even in broad daylight.  I've walked under a landed SB wings and not come out of hidden.
---
I said I deleted the game around the time this mistake happened. And no, this was not the reason why I don't play the game at its current state.
---
I don't like it, because it has no story (following notes/holotapes of dead people is not really a story). There is no reward in exploring all of the places or doing quests (no legendary/unique reward like in Skyrim or even WoW...rewards are more or less RNG) and a lot of grind. And the endgame (launching nukes) is in contrast to the main goal (rebuild Appalachia).
---
Rare, random, spawn around Flatwoods.  The Flatwoods Monster.
---
Pray to RNGesus and explore the Forest.
---
The monorail elevator is the highest I can find.  It's even more of a drop than Seneca rocks.
---
The fix for this is to stash any extra armor pieces you are carrying around and not wearing. If, say you have two leather left legs, and one is equipped and one is in your inventory just being carried around, and you climb into your power armor or fast travel, your power armor left leg will not be equipped. This can happen with multiple PA parts if you have more duplicate armor pieces in your inventory.
---
Thank you for your service, when we loose a friend that we have shared so many memories with it's always hard at first. 
---
I'm sorry for your loss, this sadness will fade and be replaced by the fond memories of fun times. Hang in there!
---
The whole tone of the quest has a weird present tense vibe, almost like they intended to have an NPC there at some point.  Was salvage part of *every* Mole-Rat raid on this church, such that you'd actually have it in a recording?
---
And if the Mole-Rat invasions happen so regularly that you'd have to rig up some kind of automated bell ringing, well, maybe it's just not a good place to hold a town meeting. üòÇ
---
They are pretty rare. Just do some daily and weekly challenge until you get what you need. Also don't worry about those skins. Some better ones will come a bit later. 
---
Valley Galleria is one of the best parking lots for blowing up cars.  Nice evenly spaced explosions after you blow one up.
---
Fallout New Vegas was such a gem of a game.  Even though most people seemed to hate it, my favorite DLC of all time (any game) was Dead Money.  Such an eerie vibe and I still remember the way I felt when I was playing.  Sometimes the best movies/games/books are the ones that stay with you the longest even if you didnt think if was great as you were playing.  
---
It happens when your camera loads while inside a wall. Something happens and it bugs out. Nothing you can do but relog. Re-traveling does nothing. 
---
I get this response. I kindof miss the derpy, repetitive NPC‚Äôs too.
---
I‚Äôll admit that these player raiders were a little short on themeing/role playing. They didn‚Äôt give me overacted audio dialogue or conversation trees. But that kind of NPC, in ALL Bathesda games, has always felt very robotic. Robots wearing costumes. No matter the game/theme. 
---
This at least felt real. Because it was. I‚Äôll take real live raiders over derpy themed robots any day. 
---
Extra points to raiders (or other players) who dive in and really cosplay/roleplay. 
---
I find this annoying as well.   What good is a stealth build if you can't disappear from enemies. 
---
Yep.
---
This needs more upvotes... very well written 
---
We want this to be a great fallout experience! Please listen Bethesda 
---
I'm running because I have no carry weight and I don't want to be disappointed by all the great stuff I can't carry or store!
---
I never play a game once it's become work.  I've more than got my money's worth out of this game, and still play from time to time, mostly when friends call or i'm feeling up to some camp building (I would love to see the camp building in 76 modded into fo4).  Do whatever you find fun, if that's not this game, go do something else.  The way I see it, a movie costs $13 for 2 hours of entertainment, so, if I pay less than $6/hr to play a game, I'm ahead.  No need to bore yourself to tears.
---
It's gotten so bad I've stopped farming nuke zones. It's not worth the hassle and expense of resources to either not get anything at all (never loads) or get sub-par legendaries not worth the resources spent to get them.

Only because your shit didnt get broken.
---
Many thanks from everyone here for letting us know
---
hey i‚Äôve filed this one. in regards to potted plants and wall conduits/pass through a. 
---
Where are those lunch boxes by the way?
---
I would say that if you create the server frame with playdo and the room created by the workers from crappydesign subreddit. You have a more pleasant experience. 
---
There is an Achievement/Trophy called Good Grief for killing 20 players. Sounds like a reasonable and easy achievement for anyone that says they are playing as PvP.
---
[3.25% of players have earned this on Xbox.](https://account.xbox.com/en-us/GameInfoHub?titleid=332913499&amp;selectedTab=achievementsTab&amp;activetab=main:mainTab2)
---
[9.69% have earned it on PS4.](https://psnprofiles.com/trophy/8434-fallout-76/42-good-grief)
---
I think it is safe to say that on console at least the demand for PvP is very low.
---
Lol, it's not so much about the skin itself, mostly just setting a 'personal goal' to derive some 'progress' satisfaction.  
---
Yeah it can only spoon Ultracite Ice cream 
---
Good, fuck you.
---
There is no "right" way to play.  Live people are a huge variable.  Announcing your intention doesnt hurt, but may or may not not help.
---
As such, Server hop can be your friend, and so can pacifist mode.
---
Had a group last weekend made me feel like I was the victim in "a clockwork orange"
---
Another group that send a low level to pretended to be friendly, then sneak attacked by 2x high levels, who then chased us across the map repeatedly killing as soon as we respawned.
---
  Then a duper asked me to be a mule - although he admitted if I got caught, my account would be suspended.  
---
  OTOH, I've had high level players  build a house and generator at my camp, others  have given me better weapons and armor, repaired stuff, fairly traded, etc.
---
  I ran across a wanted player at a workshop.  He was about 20 lvls higher than me.   
---
 When he approached weapon in hand, I announced bounty hunting/PvP was not my thing, I was not going to bother him, just passing through....ended up trading a few items, and both went on our way.
---
Overall, I hink its about 70/30 with most people either helpful or completely ignore   
---
 or avoid me, and about 30% griefers/bad apples.  But yea, those 30% serieouly detract from fully enjoying the game.
---
Neither did yours, unless you've somehow built completely around the M97 Grenade Launcher Rifle and in that case.... wtf.
---
Are you not able to make simple decisions for yourself ?
---
Damn... I've over 100 hours into this game.. and I start every play session making the run from the overseers camp to flatwoods.. it's a great food/lead run (if the gym is spawned).  I don't think I've ever seen it.
---
If you see white smoke coming out of the bottom of the cooling towers then don't go in there as it's not smoke, it's steam, that's why your HP gets drained.
---
"it just works"  
---
i agree w biffbuttcus.  yes these requests may have some good ideas but ALL of this is nonsense when the game doesnt "just work"!!!!  a cool gun in a broken game is STILL a broken game.
---
The broken stealth is almost killing me, literally. The latest patch really screwed up stealth.
---
I've taken to playing the game every few days now and if I am playing I'm just doing random shit like selling crap for caps or messing with spawn points.
---
I always felt the Chinese Assault Rifle was more appropriate, as it was built on the RPD instead of AK, so pointed out how the Fallout universe was different from our own.  Just like the water cooled assault rifle, the odd calibers, etc.  
---
Many are broken in some way or another.
---
The ones which are pretty notorious for this are Swarm of Suitors and It's a Trap.  Census Violence often places the robot, but you can't get him to start doing anything.  Protest March often fails to spawn protestors, but the quest tends to auto-complete itself after a time.
---
Lastly, any event that concerns burrowing enemies, like Mole-Rats or Radscorpions, has a pretty high probability of failing to have the enemies spawn or unburrow.  So, when you see something like "Mole-Rat Horde," don't bother.  Likewise, Workshop events that involve burrowers tend to be broken too.
---
I think I speak for many users when I say that Mole-Rats could disappear from the game tomorrow and we'd all be better for it.  They are *that* broken.
---
chameleon isnt hard to come by. I personally use a 1* one that i picked up from whitesprings. I added deep pocktets to it and it works just fine. U could put it on the hotkey for quick equip if you don't want to always run in it.
---
I honestly do alot of pvp, and win most of it. I am always concerned that someone may pay my camp a visit, so its the crouch life for me. It works perfectly honestly. 
---
This just means the people who are taking pains to grief other players are going to be shunted away into their own game mode where we don't need to bother thinking about them.
---
In other words, this is a good thing.
---
I personally think, that I'll wait for the pvp update, that's the game I've always wanted to play, so to me it's the best time to start with a new character
---
But you didn't say that. You made it sound like you deleted it because of bobby pins. And also, there's totally rewards for the things you say.
---
But hey...whatever. If you uninstalled the game back then, why still hang out in the forums dumping on the game.
---
Because again, I find that kind of behavior really creepy. You didn't like a game. And now you feel compelled to try and prevent others from playing it and finding out if they like it? Oh sure, you'll deny that.
---
But here we are. Talking about this over a post where you're attacking someone for buying the game. Because you think the game is so bad, it's not worth money.
---
Ugh. People like you are so terrible. You must be the kind of person that shames people in real life for enjoying something you don't. I bet you make a face and then some snotty comment. And then defend it by saying, you have taste. 
---
Don't bother, Bethesda doesn't bother either.
---
please implement this so i can steal all your stuff LOL.  seriously you think a few turrets and locked door will stock thieves?
---
Just started Fallout 76 yesterday. Left the Vault, went south, found this old house not far down the road. Picked up a machete on the way. Found my first Scorchers. Took them out. Went upstairs and was looting. Heard footsteps and prepared myself for more Scorchers. Was surprised as hell when I saw this armored dude running towards me. 
---
Now I‚Äôm not super experienced with previous Fallout games. My initial thought was this was a high level enemy and I was like, ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm gonna die.‚Äù But it was a fellow player! And he was emoting at me. And I did back, but at level 2 I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable accepting his team invite because I like to get my bearings and some experience in the game first. I felt bad after emoting a bit and he kept inviting me so I logged off. 
---
You‚Äôre a good dude, fellow PS4 player. I just wasn‚Äôt ready. Don‚Äôt let it detract you from helping other, worthier players!
---
That‚Äôs always been there.
---
Upvoting for visibility.
---
I gave Fo76 a go Friday after not playing all week, and was excited when I actually helped killed a SBQ and got some decent loot.
---
Then, had several disconnects over a few hours (once in a nuke zone) that were extremely frustrating. 
---
Had to move my CAMP at one point because someone was in the same spot, and when I broke down my blueprint I lost several objects (mostly floors &amp; walls).
---
Another server crash caused me to lose more floors and at that point I just gave up. It's absolutely unfuckingacceptable how poor the state of the game is after being live for 3 months
---
Neat
---
Strong words coming from someone who‚Äôs name is in reference to their game...sure I‚Äôm the fanboy 
---
Thanks for the offer.  I'll mention it to him.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs more to do with being old enough that my parents listened to ‚Äúoldies‚Äù still in the early 90s along with newer music allowing me to appreciate a lot of older artists, and younger people now seem to think 80s and early 90s bands are now ‚Äúoldies‚Äù and barely register anything earlier than that.
---
This happens to me as well... I don't get it, there are practically no penalties for dying.
---
I have the best luck when I talk to other players with area audio chat. I'm a charming fellow.
---
I forgot what mission it is, but I cannot get big game hunt to start for me ever
---
Yeah I am on PC too, so a discord might be the best bet.
---
Pete Hines did say the game would last forever, which I'm sure would make that false advertising. 
---
\^  
---

---
Yeah, this occasionally happened prior to patch 5, a little worse with patch 5, but the hotfix after 5 made this extremely unbearable.  I struggle to even log in anymore... I played maybe 3 hours this weekend, when usually it's a weekend long event.  
---
The issue is, that loot is fine when you're running around solo.  But group up with 3 other people and your loot will take 20 mins to load.  It's severely impacted by the number of people in the immediate area... 
---
This should be number one priority on their list IMO.  It's not so much it impacts loot, it impacts playing with others!
---
Hmmmm can I scrap the ultracite ice cream to harvest the ultracite?? 
---
They "fixed" bleeding in 76. It's not like FO4 where you could stack bleeds, it just extends the duration. As well as being enchantments, they don't get a buff from any perks or mutations. It's just a flat X damage over Y seconds (Legendary Wounding looks like it will be 50 damage over 5 seconds, which is so very useless). Burn looks slightly better as more damage over a smaller time frame. Cripple will probably be what most people want.
---
It's completely boned weapons like the Syringer that rely on the bleed effect to kill anything. All DoT effects got this treatment in 76. Makes any DoT build completely useless.
---
I've tried this event a few times (4/5) and I still don't know if
---
A) it's bugged
---
B) it's weird as hell
---
Well, in Fallout 4 the Combat Rifle took the place of the R91 as the "standard battle rifle" of the US armed forces, or at least the standard ballistic rifle. 
---
I'm pretty much OK with this, but I certainly wouldn't have minded if they had made it look like the R91 instead of the BAR. Not sure why it had to use the .45 ammo rather than the 5.56 though. 
---
The Handmade Rifle pretty much *is* the Chinese Assault Rifle, and I'm not sure why it didn't appear in the base game at all. It makes little sense to me why the raiders at Nuka World would have such an abundance of them while nobody else has any, or why it suddenly has a new name. 
---
There are a lot of weapons that are in Fallout 3 or New Vegas (and the earlier games for that matter) but not in Fallout 4. In a lot of cases it seems to me that this is at least in part to avoid using weapons with real-life brand names such as Glock or Colt. I don't know if this is because of something to do with copyright, or because they want to set the world of Fallout apart from the real world. And, of course, it also has to do with a lack of development resources. 
---
Well quite, and let's not question how the event voice recording/instruction gets transmitted to our ears - pip boy?
---
The more you kill the longer you have to wait. However if you all kill enemies in the same spot it makes looting easier. 
---
I'm pretty sure all the loading screen stuff was there from the start.  It hasn't changed.
---
Honestly, I'm not sure anyone has found egregious contradictions with the story.  Even though it's mostly told through terminals and holotapes, they did cover their bases pretty well.
---
Be careful not to hit R instead of T when trying to go into perk menu. I've unknowingly dropped lots of good weapons this way. 
---
Really? Apparently I havent been paying too much attention then!
---
I always wanted PvP since there is practically none, but I assumed it would only take a week at most, since all they should have to do is do stuff like change "slap damage: enabled" to "slap damage: disabled." I know it is probably more complex than that, but it can't take more than a few days. But I could be wrong. I also agree some PvE would be nice.
---
More shit posting please. Jizzy Adams doesn't do reddit trades
---
Well you‚Äôre wrong and stupid. I can‚Äôt just say this is true because people will demand sources I don‚Äôt have, but it‚Äôs true. I would bet my life on it. 
---
- Hiring many years ago for a bleeding edge freemium game 
---
- Fallout 76 having perk card packs, but not letting you purchase them. Sure looks a lot like they built the leveling system around a FTP mechanic and microtransactions, and then changed course last minute
---
- The collectors edition debacle, and running into ‚Äúproduction‚Äù problems. Sure looks a lot like the collectors edition was rushed and thrown together last minute, no?
---
- The E3 press conference. All the secrecy around the game. Not even telling us what the game is. They knew it was broken. They knew it was bad. They were relying on the Fallout brand to push sales. 
---
Literally every single facet of the game and course of events since it‚Äôs disastrous launch point to a FTP game being changed last minute to full price. 
---
What you said barely qualifies as a coherent thought. It‚Äôs ok. You were duped. So was I, I paid money for the game. But Bethesda pulled some serious fuckery here, and duped their core demographic to cover marginal costs and losses.
---
That happened to me. I was even able to pull the same broken weapon out again and use it for a few shots before it disappeared from my hand.
---
Another likely explanation, which is fairly common practice, is that the server is scheduled for a restart/maintenance.  
---
Instead of booting people it simply stops accepting new players, and just waits until everyone eventually leave.  
---
Thanks, no I have a PS4
---
It's only been a couple of months since launch. Don't expect them to talk about dlc when the game is still broken. You, and your friends, are asking for too much too quickly. 
---
If you see him coming better step aside. A lot of men didn‚Äôt. A lot of men died. 
---
Atom Shop floors in your shanty.
---
That's all in the game
---
Yeah, I've taken to playing Fallout 4 for a day or two before coming back to 76. Oddly enough, having played 76 for a while has changed the way I play Fo4 in a good way. Survival mode doesn't seem like a horrible chore like it did before.
---
Now, what that says about 76 in general considering I hated survival mode in Fo4 before because it was too tedious...well, I enjoy the Fallout world so I won't look too hard at that...
---
*\*squints at Bethesda\** For now....
---
I thought the same thing when this happened to me, but spawns dry being alone.
---
what on earth is a prime fusion core? are you talking about the ones made from stable yellowcake etc?
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
Also died on some ramps there a few times... not near the cooling towers.
---
Yo I'm 38 years and I still feel like a big kid.
---
Yep.  I can't wait until private servers are a thing and some serious modders get ahold of this.  FO: Frost and FO: New California are some of the best games I've seen.  
---
This is also exactly what I think. No way is Bethesda going to admit they're all but abandoning the game. They'll just issue vague assurances, while doing as little as possible in a bid to save money.
---
No shovel necessary, it's just a dirt pile that will pop up at the opposite wall to the speakers desk inside. Make sure you kill the molerat waves before/after it shows up, I guess thats what triggers the next (identical) stages till it finishes.
---
I have no friends to team with :(
---
Yeah I think they take violet.  I forget what they are exactly call but they are used in a prime gatling lazer 
---
I took all of my cores, carried 40+ on me, took off my power user, and purposfully did things to drain them over the past week. I am down to 16 cores.
---
There's a quest in the Mire called Queen of the Hunt. you fight three different cryptids and need to collect tissue samples. Its relatively easy and every time I've done it, I've come up against a flatwoods monster. Outside of that, I only fought 2 of them. The first teleported when i got near it and the second was last night actually doing Census Violence when it was at a SAM camp in Cranberry Bog.
---
I would like to disagree saying you can wander around and go scavenging and you will always find useful bits.. but let's face it - your stash is full, and you've only got 90 units of space.
---
Did some Whitespring Golf Club farming a couple of times either the ghouls disappeared after killing them or it became loot spinning madness.   Either way, it sucks.  Do all the heavy lifting and don‚Äôt get rewarded.  
---
Is this readily available from a set vendor since they put the kabash on vendors having a loot pool?
---
Todd said the game has 16 times the detail of fallout 4, so everything is possible. 
---
It‚Äôs an MMO-lite. Can‚Äôt call it an MMO as there‚Äôs not really any world persistence and you can only have two dozen people in a world at once. Can‚Äôt call it an RPG, those systems are too watered down. It‚Äôs a light survival shooter with the Fallout name.
---
Don't worry, just contact support and they can.. Oh wait, they "Don't have the tools to create items for players".
---
Guess we're screwed. 
---
You cant really do a hub. The build area fir camps is pretty big. What I have recommended is that we do a stretch of highway. This may be even better when we have player vending. From train station to train station. 
---
Something like hwy 105 from Whitespring to the Top of the Workd
---
It's to keep the jukebox running since so you can complete the One Violent Night event without getting out of your PA to play the instruments.  Have to repair it because the attracted ghouls attack and break it.
---
I'm still not preordering an EA title. Not will I consider buying it until the cash shop is live. No bait and switch for me please! Also, I hope their stock price keeps falling after what they've been up to.
---
In videogames, when it comes to locational damage, it usually takes real world counterparts when it comes to critical damage or increased damage.
---
For example,
---
If you shoot someone in the heart, head, and sometimes even dick, you can expect to do more damage in a lot of games.
---
It encourages precise aim and also kinda helps you to suspend your disbelief.
---
While I don't think 1 head shot should instakill everything unless you're using a powerful rifle like a sniperrifle, I definitely think it should take significantly less shots than other parts of the body.
---
I'd say a scorched/ghouls should take 2-3 standard handmade shots to the head before dying
---
Super mutants 3-4
---
Armored super mutants 4-5.
---
Something like that.
---
Very rare.  I have managed to kill 2 Flatwoods Monsters and neither were in Flatwood.  I saw a third doing battle with some random Ghouls, but it teleported away before I could get there .  If you see enemies that have a pink glow or mist about them, then they have been struck by a F.M. weapon, look around and you may be lucky.  Both my kills were made wondering around in The Mire, and the sighting was in Clarksburg in the Toxic Valley
---
Since they changed vendor inventories, are these sold from a set location now?
---
But I need to know if there's pillaged loot.  
---
This is slightly better than the break up posts
---
This is what makes the game a lonely experience. 
---
It's a CAMP deco so it would be non-interactable. The only thing you could take would be a photo.
---
Really? Are you on PC? I kept going with my level 139 character no love at either.
---
Another incel pretending Bethesda is their RL girlfriend?
---
Or an airplane announcing it‚Äôs departure?
---
Players like me are always crouched so you won't see us on the map.
---
Dem downvotes though
---
Don't take this guy's word as fact. He doesn't know any more than you or I do. People have become salty to this game. I can understand some of that. But anyone telling you "how it is" is just guessing. Personally, I feel that anyone betting against Bethesda is more than likely going to eat their words. I could be wrong, but I like my line of thinking more than these impatient haters. I don't know why people can't just hang it up and walk away if they don't like the game. Except, everyday we have another copy cat story of "I hate this game and this the end for it." It's getting old, especially when these people really have no idea about the direction of this game. 
---
Ahh dang, you got me now
---
Thats currently a bugged feature but will be fixed once we get NPCs and stable servers update 
---
I paid $80 for this game
---
Looking forward to it new friend!
---
The only plans I‚Äôve been finding are combat armor plans. Going to have to craft/scrap for mods it seems. 
---
Same! I shall add you my gT is the same as my Reddit name (:
---
I guess I gotta do that one, then.  
---
At 360 hours in, I'm running out of things to do.  I'm not a huge fan of the Events though, so I haven't done them all.  
---
Getting to 25k caps was a goal that carried me through the last couple of weeks.  I hit that last night.  Now I really just want to meet the Flatwoods Monster and the Pied Piper, launch a nuke, and that'll be that.  Not sure what's going to keep me playing after that point unless they add new content.  Might be time to finally buy the last Forza Horizon game and go through that while I wait.
---
Also notice,  like his FO4 builds he is doing this on a gaming pad.  Yes,  he is doing it on an Xbox console.  smh.
---
You can also find some more info regarding what the FEV did if you go to the WestTek building.
---
Also, how the fuck so you get that from what I wrote? Are you like 13? Holy fucking shit you‚Äôre stupid. 
---
I try not to level up anymore. I am level 120
---
I PvP alot. The way the game punishes us just for pvping with other players who also want to pvp is a mess. 
---
I don't wanna lose so much every time i die. Cap it at 50 caps. Imagine being level 200. You would lose 1000 caps in 5 deaths??????
---
I gotta grind a nuke zone to get 1000 caps so i can lose them in less than an hour of pvp. Great mechanic Todd. What a mess. 
---
Which became Bethesda Austin, which brought us...?
---
While my list of criticisms and desires for FO76 is far from a short one, I‚Äôve been pretty much obsessed with it for the past few weeks. Just landed level 62 and finally launched my first nuke today with some friends. While I‚Äôm a bit nervous about running out of ideas to modify, improve or better-optimize my build (and wasting the increasingly harder-earned levels as a result), I find solace in that there‚Äôs still a ton of the map left that I haven‚Äôt explored yet, and that I can rebuild my base almost anywhere I fancy.  I hope Bethesda manages to turn things around for 76, as I‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing what this game becomes.
---
If the most of the quest lines are seen as introductory quests then someone has shit the bed.
---
Yep. You have to hang around for 5 to 10 minutes. Dropping an item doesn't fix it as folks have mentioned. You know you're getting unfrozen when you start seeing the legendary pop ups for the items you picked up several minutes before. 
---
Glad you said that... To date I don't think ive had a gaming experience like Dead Money. Beautifuly built. 
---
The only lore thing that's been really bugging me is how we know how to use power armour. 
---
In FO3 we had to be taught 
---
FO:NV we had yo be taught
---
FO4 we are a military vet so we already knew.
---
FO76: yolo?
---
Like i get we the best and brightest, but i don't see how a bunch of civil engineers, chemist, physicist, ect. gained sufficient military training to literally be able to operate power armour as soon as they walk out the vault.
---
Great post!  Love the faction idea.  And I'm hoping that maybe one of the Vaults open up at some point and reintroduce some NPC's and new quest lines into the world.
---
No the blast shield is in between the control room and the reactor room. The steam is at the cooling towers outside of the plant itself. 
---
No.just info. All the wikis say are useless infos like how to get random deseases or how to cure them. But i need the last two for the challenge.
---
If you're lower level or just want to see a rarely visited area there's the river rides dock on the west side of the map north of the nuka factory.
---
All the life preservers there give 2 rubber.  
---
How did u get the Bos combat armor helmet 
---
I mean I get punished for not participating in pvp because I get one shot randomly and lose 100 caps for not participating I can‚Äôt believe what it‚Äôs like at higher levels 
---
I always thought it was horseriders XD
---
And this is based on what? You really think Bethesda would abandon this game?! Just admit you, along with everyone else, don't know what you're talking about, and you've just stumbled upon this thought because it's trendy to be pessimistic about the future of this game. 
---
Yess.. Instigating repeater carbine...how is it called in english? The cowboy rifle from NV / Far Harbor, you know. 2 of them! And more :) 
---
Stray bullet hits door?  Wanted.
---
Open the wrong lock?  Wanted.
---
Graze someone during the Whitespring grind?  Wanted.
---
Stray fire during SBQ?  Wanted.
---
Deathclaw peed on the astroturf?  Wanted.
---
Seriously, I dropped by somewhere to check on loot and there was some dude with a 5 cap bounty.  Saw me and got ready for a fight.  I just waved hi and went about my business.
---
I'll be sending your recommendation to the CEO :)
---
Yess.. Instigating repeater carbine...how is it called in english? The cowboy rifle from NV / Far Harbor, you know. 2 of them! And an AA combat rifle
---
and how is it "supposed" to be played?
---
I bought it off someone for real cheap; it should just be an unlocked paint job for the helmet.
---
They already get a ‚Äúbankrupt disease for 3+ hours‚Äù -50% damage vs players.
---
I feel you there. All my friends have left me now!
---
I even decided to brave One Violent Night on my own. my heart nearly gave in lol. I'm still playing but I just wonder round on my own then go whitesprings to kill things and just generally mooch about. It just looks so beautiful and I don't want it to end! I think I am gunna get anthem though when that drops. gunna pre order it on Thursday. The fact that its not a typical pay to win EA title makes me a bit happier.
---
TL;DR 
---
Based on the first few run on sentences, I could tell this was just another dumb idea rant, reposting what others have suggested or come up as a new way to bash the game. 
---
For a player built hub that's a good idea.  But I'd prefer Bethesda actually create it's own hub somewhere.  A new area of Whitesprings, a remodelled Top of the World, a reopened Vault 76, anything like that.  That way you could potentially have more than 24 players at a time, and everyone knows where it is.
---
Wait till you get your first serum recipe...
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahaahahhahaahahahahahhaha
---
How would you know what is shitty or not. Look at how you write? LOL.
---
Eh. Very different settings, but similar genre.   
---
I'm curious how many hardcore Fallout fans are still playing 76 to be honest. It didn't do much to hold onto us or draw us in. It played roughshod with setting lore, and added very little in terms of interesting stories and whatnot.   
---
I mean, Fallout 4 gave us cool additions. The Institute, the evolution of the east coast BoS, what how survivors in Boston made it by turning the stadium into a fortress.   
---
Fallout 76, gave us...um...zombies. I'd say it gave us the Responders and similar lore, but no it didn't. They're all dead and gone. Killed by zombies. It gave us static towns filled with zombies and little else. 
---
He also said you can roleplay as anyone, but if you roleplay as someone who created a machine to duplicate items, you get banned.
---
I hope ill have that rs with my son when hes old enough to play someday :,) amazing!
---
I've tried a bunch of things... Yaoi, hounds, dogs, a fox, a rabbit, a cat, etc etc. Nothing. :(
---
Wow, that is one thorough post.
---
I haven't noticed this bug myself, but it should certainly be top priority.
---
Ahhhh makes sense ive been collecting TD and turning them in trying to get bos pa paint tnx for clearing that up 
---
Go and run on up to the water amusement park to grab prizes. Screws in toys, rubber in basketballs; it's a very easy run 
---
"The small amount of content". 
---
Know whats gonna blow your mind? It is still buffed compared to the other skills. 
---
How many points would one have to invest in riflemen/shotgun/heavy weapons to get 60% damage increase? (Hint: 9)
---
How many points would one have to invest in demolitions to get 60% damage increase? (Hint: 5)
---
That something I would actually be willing to buy atoms for!
---
He aint wrong though. I quit and started playing the older games that was waiting to drop in price. kh3 came out, playing that now. Then Jump force, pick up smash finally.. or multiplayer stardew for me and the wife. New Animal crossing eventually. In terms of mmo styles. Division and Anthem both coming out soon which will prolly kill fo76 before they get the chance to bring it back.

On ps4
---
I find the ones I visit do.
---
They've always been instanced.  Think of them as a container that gives up a specific flora.
---
I would LOVE if they did that, but they said private servers are no longer being planned.   
---
That broke my heart because that means no mods.   
---
The servers are unstable as is, so mods would throw that into even more chaos. Also, since we have zero control over what servers we log on to, there's no way to make sure players on a server are all using the same mods. That's just asking for server crashes. 
---
With certain melee builds, and if they pull her out of the nuke zone.  A proper team could accomplish this.
---
Sadly I think someone pulled the plug before launch. Or shortly after the BETA came out and people started canceling pre-orders. 
---
Each silo has a physical silo door from which the nuke launches from and can be seen launching into the sky before it disappears if you are in the area. 
---
Silo Alpha door is located just south of Yellow Sandy‚Äôs Still. 
---
Silo Bravo door is south east from the the entrance. You can follow a dirt road leading up to it. 
---
Silo Charlie door is almost directly north of the Scenic Overlook, to the left of the monorail track. 
---
Thats a new one to me, thanks for the info. Always said (well, for the past couple weeks) that we're all just one miskey away from disaster.
---
I know people are going to give you advice. Some of its going to good and bad. All i got to say is grief takes time. just log out walk away for a bit. Maybe some day you will want to play it to remember the good times. 
---
WhyCantIHoldAllTheseLimes meme except with fusion cores.
---
...Congratulations?
---
Yeah, please tell me than "how it's meant to be played"?  
---
Thank you for posting about related CAMP issues. Definitely important and aggravating to those who invest the time and effort into CAMPs, and there are many who do.
---
You are obviously using a Melee build to have the viewpoint you have expressed.
---
The Patch that Nerfed stuff had a dramatic affect on Stealth/Rifleman builds, and changing your build is not as simple as moving a few special points, at level 120, I calculated that I would need 36 levels to make the transition, since I need to rank up quite a few Perk Cards first, before I even start shifting SPECIAL points.
---
Post Patch results for a Stealth/Sniper build with several TS and/or Exp rifles (Self Looted);
---
1. Stealth is wrecked, intentional or not, and is next to useless if you are on a team.
---
2. TS took a significant Damage reduction for an effect that already had an excessive accuracy nerf.
---
3. Explosive effect took a nerf to both Damage &amp; AOE resulting in an overall reduction of around 70%
---
4. Rifles &amp; Shotguns are degrading quicker, &amp; "Luck of the Draw" isn't helping.
---
5. Ammo consumption has increased by 700% (ammo drops were nerfed in a previous patch)
---
6. I now use a 3\* Instigating Death Tambo as my primary weapon, because it's the Highest 1st hit Damage weapon I have, even though I have no perks to support it.
---
Congratulations? Is that an insult?
---
üò¢üò¢üò¢ but If you ask me it looks nice
---
It's probably been 150 or so hours and I have not lost one item that I've noticed yet.
---
I had one close call though, when selling excess weapons to a vendor. The selection highlight jumped to the top of the list, **after** the sale confirmation dialog popped up for the item I intended to sell, and my equipped gun was sold instead. I was able to buy it back. So beware that the item you chose to sell, that it says you're selling, is not always the item that is sold.
---
Marsurpial is, in my personal opinion, not even a choice, rather an obligatory survival tactic.
---
I was hoping for more instanced type views of sections of the map after completing some quests. Like in WoW in some places if you were farther on quests than your friends your view of the area was different than theirs. It didn't really affect them but showed you made some progress. The only time this kinda comes into play is the Mayor for the Day quest but it would be nice if you had some sorta lasting effects. Even if it was just local to you and to smaller areas. Meanwhile they need to add instanced repeatable dungeons/vaults whatever they want to call them. Grinding is a major part of any MMO but not to have a fun repeatable way just make it boring. Still baffles me there is no other instanced raid/dungeon of any sort. SBQ is nice idea but its implementation is not ideal but thats its whole topic. 
---
The lack of NPCs is one thing but they have the remnants of each faction. You should be able to pick one or all and continue their story. It is sad that there is no surviving MoM or BoS you eventually find.
---
If there was no story, there would be NO STORY!
---
Way to figure it out.
---
Thanks. Most posts of this type address a specific user's issue, as did my first. Taken in isolation its not very meaningful. Summarizing just some of the posts gives it context.
---
I feel its because the translation for single player to mmo is so difficult for both new players and the company's overall design being the major issue. 
---
I mean I'm used to mmo's so weird bugs is pretty normal to me and I feel the first real how a games doing for mmo is how it looks like in a year not a few months but the people not used to this kind of concept I can understand how jarring it is as a reality. 
---
I mean I remember way back at the releases of tons of games that went on to be huge - ultima / everquest / anarchy online / wow.... and so on and so on all of them had massive bugs early on and the server stability was terrible and I had to pay a monthly fee while I waited on top of a 40-60$ price tag - and with fallout 76 if I feel a patch was buggy I just wait for the next patch while playing one of my other games a few weeks knowing I'll be playing F76 for months / years as it grows and changes so why rush and kill the game for myself?
---
Whitespring is basically already a hub, all we need is to remove the fast travel cost there and to find a better place to nuke.
---
queen loot should all be dropped by the quest as should all legendarys 
---
just run a simple background hidden quest that gives out loot when a 1 2 3 legendary is killed or a special creature like a scorch queen this way we auto get the item we really want and actually went for without worry 
---
Yes it can, but starched Genes can protect ya
---
This is literally what I think of with every single one of these posts https://youtu.be/w2X3vVMdh-s
---
Enjoy it while it lasts
---
&gt; I mean, I don‚Äôt make games. But isn‚Äôt that just a case of changing some numbers? 
---
Testing the game after changing some numbers takes most of the time. A public Beta test server would have solved that problem long ago :/
---
I agree, though. It's sad that they focus on that - or at least only communicate that.
---
Upvoted! I see my post in the list, and I hope this time it get the devs attention. 
---
Ah man that's the kinda sweet teamplay I love to hear about. I've been trying to get my group to play something *other than Overwatch* but not much luck yet. 
---
That said I've been playing for hours every day, since day 1 and I've finally completed most every quest with the last two being I Am Become Death and the Overseer's Quest (somehow I've not found all the holotapes despite getting the achievement for it??). I agree that for the price (and despite the bugs), I have definitely had my money's worth of fun. 
---
I remember that alien, randomly found one teleporting around. Saw it was shiny, shot at it a lot, crap loot. Mildly interesting to look at though.
---
Are these weapons duped? Instead of bans are they resorting to just pulling items?
---
I would gladly accept an update where that's the only bug they fixed all month.
---
Right now I'm using those succulents as "placeholder" decorations, in the hope that we will get something along the lines of collectible or junk decorations in the not so distant future, but who knows? 
---
Hi pandaru\_express, do you have any trouble blueprinting your camp?  The foundations that were placed with the campfire trick seem to be considered by the game as "floating" structures, and the game doesn't seem to blueprint them because of that.  I'm building a 7x7 pyramid and am running into this problem.  I couldn't even manually select such structures to blueprint.  When I tried, I heard that short "buzz" sound, indicating it couldn't be blueprinted.  I just don't know what would happen if the game tried to blueprint the camp for me in the case of another player occupying your camp location.  If the game's auto-blueprinting didn't work, it could mess my camp.  Another issue is that I wonder if these "floating" structures would cause server instability.
---
Ah, thank you, I honestly have never really tried to understand what it's for.  I usually do the full repairs, so I can get some random lowbie a decent event reward, fire up the reactor, then fast travel back to the reactor (quickest way back to the front yard lol). 
---
As one of those people, it's very frustrating hahaha
---
But I can only imagine what it's like to lose a prized weapon, I would uninstall so fast if I lost my All Rise because a bug they haven't fixed.
---
Good research, it's definitely a huge issue and Bethesda needs to address stuff like this if they truly intend on keeping this game alive 
---
I'm not convinced these aren't user error, in which case, the devs have much bigger fish to fry.
---
What are you dumb?  Just use all the amazing tools included with the game to figure out who you need to trade with, just go to the central trading hub for all vault dwellers.
---
It is worth trying?
---
I got an acces but the *universe* looks boring.
---
That's where to get that paint?  Damn, I'm gonna have to start turning them in lol.

One workshop PvP griefer/exploiter - happened on my 2nd character, guy shows up, hits the workbench, goes for the kill and server hops after that (workshop PvP should be for those actually interested in taking over the workshop, not as a means to get cheap PvP kills - IMO to prevent this, the person taking over should only be allowed to do full PvP damage while inside the takeover zone by the bench unless the owner actually fires back at them)
---
Everything about this portion of your write up is aweful. 
---
1. You cant greif in PvP workshops. 
---
2. The guy could have disconnected
---
3. He could have fast traveled with your loot. To stash it. 
---
4. Pvp "zone limit" would create worse exploits than we already have. Bad idea man. Sorry.  But im sick of bad pvp suggestions on this dying forum. 
---
Why don't you claim the workshop and get some from there?
---
Source on the private servers no longer being planned?
---
With feelings of accomplishment and reward.
---
RemindME two weeks
---
Considering how often this seems to happen, I can only assume that it's working as intended :-P 
---
It‚Äôs just you.
---
Can I get that cultists blade from you?  PC player here.
---
Wot?
---
Every time I log out all the soup in my inventory disappears since this last patch. I use this as my primary food source for ap reg. So it‚Äôs like 30 soup every time. No biggie but annoying and time consuming 
---
Well, you can see the type of people that play it just by reading this post. They‚Äôre not exactly well adjusted. 
---
He never took over the workshop - if you want to contest a workshop then fine.  That's what workshop PvP should be for - contesting workshops.  Not PvPing someone for caps/loot.  Its absolutely griefing/exploiting the system for something it wasn't intended for.
---
That's what I am doing but will be ages for a good amount of cores
---
I can make them for a 100 caps
---
Yeah, I'm getting that as well.
---
Also getting the "cannot enter the bag's inventory" so I have to pick up legendaries that I know are probably crap just to look at them.
---
This happened last night when the SBQ fight came down to the wire and a bazillion scorched got spawned during the fight. Since the game has to generate loot for everyone who tagged any mob on the ground, the loot generation queue is completely backed up. Mark where the queen is and retrace your steps back to the stuff you've killed before - loot should spawn chronologically from the oldest kills first. I tend to try to "clean up" by looting everything I can... in any case, it's not like you're going anywhere while you wait for the queen's loots to spawn.
---
I've found for some things, such as a fusion generator, if you look DIRECTLY down, it can place correctly...sometimes.
---
go buy that $40 skin on atom store and we will talk about roadmap aite? 
---
The Beta test experiences with ‚ÄúDreams‚Äù and ‚ÄúFallout 76‚Äù couldn‚Äôt be more different.
---
Media Molecule did it right, and are holding off announcement of the release date until they‚Äôve analyzed the beta results.
---
Bethesda decided the release date by looking at the calendar, totally ignoring the beta experiences. 
---
I came back to FO76 to check on the progress only to find that things still disappear and the servers still disconnect.
---
Nothing disappeared for me during the Dreams Beta, and the only times I had the server disconnect was when I put the PS4 to sleep.  Within 5 seconds of waking it up, the server connection was reestablished EVERY TIME.
---
Interesting. So that explains why nobody knows the exact values; it just will not show any changes from the magazine mod. Now I wonder if the anti armor magazines actually work...
---
as previous stated the white springs is pretty much the hub. The problem is its location. It's far from end game content and the vendors are pretty much useless. unless you need your 200 caps per days. its has crafting stations and if a nuke zone hits their its good for scavenging masses. frankly i think watoga is a better player hub. close to the end game content.
---
The only thing that I got confused over, are Super Mutant Behemoths. I was under the impression it took a *long time* for that to happen, more than what we had.
---
&gt;It just looks so beautiful and I don't want it to end! 
---
I'm sorta there too.  It's become a late night ritual for me.  My fiance goes to bed a little earlier than I do, so once she's settled in I'll spend an hour or two roaming the hills of WV.
---
I'm a creature of habit, which is a partial explanation of why I have so many hours in the other Fallout games.  Steam tells me that I have 1,393 hours in Fallout 4, and I know I've played Fallout 3 more than that.  When I find something I like, I play it way longer than any sane person should.  
---
So I don't want to give up on the game, but I'm feeling a little discouraged at the moment.  I'm not going to go into the bitching that can be found elsewhere in this sub (or in my own post history), but I'm burning out faster on this game than I'd hoped.
---
The Hero We Need.
---
One of the gas mask looks really good with the helmet. When im not in my captain america combat armour i use it.
---
No CAMPs are needed for a hub. It just needs to be a safe, PVP-free zone for people to hang out. The problem with players themselves designating an area as a hub, and building CAMPs there is that doing so increases the chance that people's CAMPs are on top of each other when they log in, and it requires people to be aware of it.
---
I am wondering, do you feel like you got your money's worth from the game? Are you happy you purchased and played it? I have about 200 hours in, and am finally getting pretty bored. I definitely am glad I bought the game and had my fun. If they come out with good expansions and fix some things, that is just icing on the cake for me.
---
Thank you for not just posting "i quit..bethesda is crap...i want my money back!!!!" Those posts are just pointless. 
---
True! I started playing survival as well! But 76 was literally so shitty it made me cancel my Xbox live. I loved it for awhile, but it just became obvious they are not putting any priority on getting it fixed.
---
 I quit Fast traveling and I  run into situations all the time. If I'm not in a hurry I'll take out that town full of Mutise, if I am I'll just tweak em' a bit and move on.
---
 Recommended.
---
I agree 100%.  My OCD on this drives me crazy.  It makes me want to get out of my power armor and risk a radiation death just so the LEAST charged core is in there.
---
Same. In 4 I did the entire Minutemen to NCR mod with Dust Bowl. I just spend my time there by patrolling some unnamed part of Southern California with my FCOM team. 
---
In 76, I‚Äôm just waiting for my level 33 friend to launch a nuke with. And I‚Äôm fine with that, cause I always find stuff to do until then. 
---
Literally 3 every 15 minutes
---
Fallout 76!
---
which system
---
PS4
---
I would love to see indestructible Player Vendor terminals all in one central location.
---
Two Reasons:
---
1.  It will be super easy and fun to shop ALL of the Player Vendor Terminals in one central location.  You can even server hop to see everyone's shop in that new server.  Super easy, fast, fun trades.
---
2.  Player vending at camps will be a disaster.  There are already people having problems with other people blowing up their bases.  Now increase that ten times because they show up and didn't like your prices, your selection, or just decided "nope, no selling for you today".
---
Rightfully so I might add
---
I do think this is a real problem.  I've had the carcass/meat piles disappear before I've had a chance to loot (e.g. after waiting).  And yes, I'm pretty sure I put hits on them.
---
Why not both? I personally cant wait for Survival Mode. If its done right a dangerous environment can make a game so much more enjoyable.  I would certainly like to see more PvE content but I want me a DAYZ experience in the FO76 skin.
---
 Yeah I had plans for Marine Armor, I can make it all, but Heavy Combat kicks its ass hard, so that's what I use now.
---
If you're on PC, I can build them for you, just provide the mats:  5 violet flux, 17 aluminum, 17 adhesive, 17 fiberglass (per leg).
---
They are busy making patches and developing new content.
---
I'm sure they'd be happy to know you agree with their approach.
---
Untrue. Had a level 125 kill my level 60 with one shot. He had a bounty and I didn‚Äôt. I went back to get my stuff and he did it again. Respawned not too far away and he did it a third time. Haven‚Äôt played since. 
---
And if you're into 40k, there's always the [Boltgun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFRa0KZsGhc) cover/parody.
---
I would be soooooo f-ing down for a co-op fallout 4, maybe more like the fallout Miami that's coming. New area, new story, multiplayer.... and made by the people that have been fixing bugs in these games for years... I'd crowdfund a project like that so fast
---
Things and stuff like a bittersweet death
---
 Perfect Roe. No! I can't do that again.
---
I enjoy the idea of a actual player hub but I think RuneScape tackled this problem way better. Mind you it's been years since I've played. I have no idea of the mechanic even exist but I remember being so happy when it was introduced. Here's how it worked.
---
It's not based on actual interactions. You list an item you have for sale. Let just say a T60 Jetpack. You put in a value that you'll take for it. Anything from say 1000 caps to 1200 caps. It then physically takes your item and holds it. When it sells, you pick up your caps.
---
As a buyer, you can do two things. You search for what you want. So you search for t60 jetpack. All the t60s available pop up. You'll see the price. You make an offer. If it's accepted, your caps are removed and the item is given to you. 
---
You can also put in for items. Say you want a T60 jetpack for 900. Same as the seller. It will take your caps and search for you.  Once a item is listed for 900 (or less) it automatically completes the transaction. You just need to pick said item up.
---
You can get your item or caps back at any point pre exchange. I think something like this would be amazing at boosting the trading community. 
---
Wow, I stopped playing nearly 2 months ago because one day I logged in and my Weapons, Armor and one other tab was completely emptied for no reason. That was just 1 of the MANY issues I had.
---
I remember these infinite loading issues existing way back in the beta and being a big problem for everyone.
---
Great to see that these piece of shit dev's have their priorities straight as far as making the game more enjoyable for people.

---
Level 90 was attacking my base, I at level 45 ran up and smacked him for a surprising amount of damage. He turned and one shotted me with his sniper rifle.
---
And then last laugh triggered and he blew up.
---
7/9 perfect PvP encounter
---
Had it in PC too. 
---
Its a good question, thanks. First time I read about this I thought it could be duped items, and maybe thats the case with some. But this is more than weapons, its outfits - common and rare. Its food. Its CAMP items or complete CAMPs disappearing. Its armor taken from mobs, and ammo. And finally its quest rewards. Would anyone dupe quest rewards? Or food? I dunno, but I think dupers would avoid those things as not worth the time or risk.
---
If they had a real roadmap it would have been shared already. The Divison 2, Anthem and Apex all have released roadmaps already because they know how important it is to keep their consumer base engaged and anticipating future content.
---
Yeah, I spent 2 hours in the nuke zone yesterday at Whitesprings.  Didn't even get ONE item worth keeping or selling to other players.  The RNG on this game is HORRIBLE.
---
Something needs to be done. I've got 60 FC's on me, stash box is full with another 30 more. I can't run, I just started giving them away just to drop weight.
---
Ok at work give me 6 hours I what 1
---
Well, you said you weren't paying attention for 6 hours. So, I mean, people could have come and gone aplenty in that time. Plus, ok, if "currently" was 0345 EST Monday morning, 0045 PST Monday morning, 0845 GMT Monday morning...not exactly peak hours.
---
Whitesprings is too spread out, and too dangerous for low level characters. It's also the #1 nuke spot for some reason. I like someone /u/ConflagWex's suggestion of Top of the World (the interior). It's small and contained enough that people could easily congregate there, and it being an interior means you're safe. There could be an event where you clear out the enemies, and clean the place up a little bit, and from then on, it becomes a hub. They would just need to make it possible to log in/out from inside of it.
---
I feel like I got my money worth, just not at the same value I typically get from the series.  I still play some, but I'm down to maybe 2-3 hours per week.  I have a melee alt I want to level up, but the times I've been free to play I never actually log in.
---
PLAYER BASED FIX: During SBQ fight, Pick up **everything** from every dead body and meatpile (Your Excavator Armor can handle it ;) ). Then everyone dumps everything they don't want into one lunch sack. All of the instanced loot from all of the dead bodies in the area are lagging the server. If everyone collects everything dropped and puts it into one sack, the server should recover faster. 
---
Plus, all the extra ammo you don't use goes to someone who will.
---
I've actually seen one!

So very many idiots then. And what is the job of the UI and server / client synch? To protect everyone, idiots and skeptics alike. Have a think on it. Or wait til something you value goes poof. 
---
 You must learn about your junk. Did you know a Carlyle Typwriter has 2 screws? A Tin Can and Combination Wrenches both have 1 lead ... I could go on. Study your junk. ;)

They are going to be so surprised when their bullshit announcement that will most likely be nothing we asked for or hoped for get a bunch of backlash like Blizzard and their mobile Diablo announcement.

I've only seen Flatwoods monster once, Mothman twice.
---
Snallygaster and Grafton monster are common around Charleston. I've also seen a Grafton monster around Whitesprings every once in a while. 
---
I do like hearing the recordings of the people who‚Äôve died, they do add interesting bits to the game. But I know they‚Äôre dead so I feel no motivation to finish their quests. If there was random NPCs around to interact with the world wouldn‚Äôt feel so empty. I know players were supposed to fill those roles but I‚Äôve rarely run into anyone while I‚Äôve played. I‚Äôve tried to fill the role by making a hostel off the main rail line hoping I could help out players who are more nomadic, but I‚Äôve met maybe 7-8 people total and only 3 have had a mic

What I do when I want to find anything is google that item in a phrase:

I've had it for a few weeks. It USED to only be Harper's Ferry for me, but then I had it happen 2x yesterday traveling to different places in Watoga
---
I was going to go for heavy BOS combat as well, but I got really lucky and managed to piece myself together a full set of max lvl 3* Weightless Marine Armor, so I'm pretty attached to it. Nice weight reduction perks, too. 
---
All the in-game lore states that Marine armour *should* be the best non-PA armour, so I'm holding out hoping that at some point Bethesda will balance that out properly (LOL, I know). We'll see.
---
Cool, just shoot me a message.
---
I like this story. Plus, bless you bounty baiters. It's one thing to theorycraft PvP, it's another to have someone to test it on. As well as someone to remind me to TAKE OFF SUPER DUPER AND PUT BLOODY MESS BACK ON. 
---
Hahaaa! I never played 40k but I did play Fantasy and have some good friends that gotta hear this. Thanks &lt;3
---
I would be done after putting that many hours into any game.
---
That was the whole reason I bought the game was the announced private servers, where is your evidence link to go with this no more private servers. I am sure there would be a shit ton more anger in the forums if this was true.
---
I wrote my last response after Bethesda rolled back on an older patch by accident.

I think that‚Äôs what made it worse for a few days.

My cpu gets to 55c max and rarely goes over 50% usage on all cores, gpu max 80c with close to 100% usage, Ram 50c max and it takes up to 9gb of ram (I have 32gb ram)
---
I locked my frames at 100 per second and I rarely drop below that. If it drops it‚Äôs when many reflections are on the screen, like water or glass and it‚Äôs more likely to drop in rooms behind loading screens.
---
You know that people can use words outside of YouTube? Just because youtubers employ oral communication doesn't mean they invented it. 
---
About half of what I killed there last night dropped more than one legendary piece
---
It will change the code
---
Well that sucks. I wonder why that and the WS bunker showers have a chance of removing mutations even with SG2, given other decon showers, you know, don't?
---
If your camp will transfer to the new location via blueprint "I think" they stay the same.
---
If you have to drop everything back down manually, they will NOT stay the same.
---
Your best bet to get a good door code is to make the door the LAST thing in your storage to place.
---
1. Drop the door, it will give you a code.  If it's a good one, you're done.
---
2. If the door code isn't good store it and drop it again.  If it's a good one, you're done.
---
3. Go back to step 2 until you get a good door code.
---
Or the wanted player will retrieve 200 caps from his teammate/friend....then leave the team and have his friend kill him and retrieve his bounty.....then rejoin the team and repeat......we are surviving in a NUCLEAR WASTELAND......my answer to what everyone is calling "griefing"..... think small and unassuming.....i place my CAMP and nothing else this way i have a fast travel point and just keep all my necessities stored until i need them, then set them up..... use them and when I'm done store them again......VOILA....NO CAMP TO DESTROY....and as for people hunting you down and harassing you or killing you......IT'S A NUCLEAR WASTELAND......people role playing as RAIDERS was an intended dynamic....you wouldn't roam around in the open in a real life scenario with something valuable on you, you would hide it (STASH) it somewhere safe......the Block for Session option was another intentional mechanic included for a reason.....USE IT...... SURE I get harassed....SURE I've been killed for NO REASON, it's part of SURVIVAL, which is the meaning and idea behind this game....BETHESDA has much larger issues to address with this game then finding a solution to what some consider a problem that they can easily fix themselves by realizing this isnt Fo4.....store your junk OFTEN...... remember its a CAMP not a MANSION, if you choose to showcase your CAMP like an episode of CRIBS someone is gonna get jealous.......it's a WASTELAND out there after all 
---
Dang
---
how do you people play games for this long at a time.. 
---
I have read here on Reddit that it is a possible event loot for the "Daily: Cop a Squatter" (in Watoga). I have been doing the event every day and have yet to receive it.
---
I agree, I think more communication that didn't come off as a quick blip to the community (which is what inside the vault feels like to me) and something that seems more engaged with the community, more like a conversation... So much of the communication about the future of the game and how it is being developed etc seems like it is being run by the CIA or something - everything is some big secret and ask communications honestly seem shallow except the community people on here. 
---
It‚Äôs not a fix, but I have found a work around. Place what you want on a rug and move the rug. You can‚Äôt store or delete the rug after the move but if you position things right you won‚Äôt be able to see it. 
---
I used it with resort planters and the modern fireplace.
---
That's why I only bulk when I'm storing or selling now.  What a PITA.
---
I've had that start happening too after the last patch, but haven't experienced it recently.  Now that I think about it every time it happened previously I was doing my vendor cap runs and coming from the south (used to start at white springs then head South, East and then North to HF), then I moved my CAMP and started going to HF first and it hasn't been happening so I wonder if this bug is dependent on where you are Fast Traveling from perhaps?
---
Good news. You don't have to play the PVP servers.
---
Its nice to see someone who was killed and looted who isnt screaming rape. I cant wait for SM. See/Loot you there lil buddy.
---
Well, Raiders rely on teamwork more than most. Makes the dream work. Even if those dreams are murder and mayhem.
---
72 of the fixes in Patch 5 my friends and I didn't even care about.  And smashing all those fixes in there added back OLD bugs that my friends hated.
---
My friends list isn't constantly 95% offline because of bugs, nerfs, or small QOL stuff.
---
They're gone because they're BORED.  Bone deep cold stone BORED.
---
They need to chill on the bug fixes.  Work on the 10-20 worst ones each patch, then STOP.  Work on CONTENT after that.  Give my friends some reason to play.
---
I put a bag next to their bag, because of that. They will come back see their bag look at the other bag 9/10 times.
---
More power to ya, I don't like nuke zones enough to use prime ammo.  Now that I can buy the PA mods I want it's all funneling that way.  ; )
---
This has been in the game since launch... 
---
You have no clue of what you are talking about other than being convinced you are right. Nothing you have said is factual or leads to even a logical conclusion that can be drawn.  No matter if the game is bad or good, you are biased and there is no direct correlation with what you said.
---
Duh! Why didn't I think of that? That's the perfect solution, thank you! 
---
I use the little letter/number set to put the door code above the access panel, saves trying to remember it or write it down
---
I did steps 2-3 SO MANY TIMES to get a good one.   I need to reposition my camp because it's built into a hill over a resource deposit.  What I was thinking of doing was to tear down the whole base except the door and surrounding foundation, blueprint that and then move it.
---
I need to move the camp because I started with the camp downhill from the deposit.  If I start with it uphill, then I can make my camp taller.  I can't quite place a roof at the top.
---
just a friendly tip, tagging people in the post doesn't tag them, only ones done in comments are seen 
---
I use that on the inside.  I'm not giving out my code to strangers walking by, but still, I have a really nice code right now.
---
I think if they would have shipped a quality game for the $60 customers paid this wouldn‚Äôt be as big of an issue. Unless they pull off something like No Mans Sky did to fix their game, no one is going to be eating their words except those that defended Bethesda‚Äôs poor performance here. 
---
r/redditsings
---
Every day since launch, I've played. Still loving it. I'm on PS4 , gamer tag is signgorilla. If in need of help , I'm on from 5-10 pm central time.
---
I have teamed up with randos several times, and every single time it was awesomely fun. Take a chance on someone and see what happens!
---
Lol
---
I tag workshops then fast travel to the owner to kill him and grab the loot all the time. Sometimes my buddys will find you. Then ill tag the bench and they kill you. 
---
Its not greifing. You own a PvP node? You are fair game. Dont claim them if you arent looking for a fight. Alot of us are out looking for any fight we can get into. When most of the community is pve weenies, we need the workshop to know who is down to fight. 
---
Pretty arrogant to believe you can push an "ediquette" of not attacking workshop owners. Thats lame man.
---
No workshops for you if you wanna call fair pvp greifing.  Watch your back if you own a shop. Its the rules given by the game right now. 
---
Bottom line: you own one, im going to hunt and kill you. Fair game.
---
The problem is that, every week they don't release the roadmap, other online co-op games are coming out to continue to erode their player base. 
---
It looks like it'll be alot like div1, where you play an interesting campaign, have fun, then never play again.
---
You had me at ‚ÄòSid‚Äô - loved his work.
---
Knowing how the patches tend to go, they'll fix it, but break a half dozen other things.
---
&gt; I played the division 2 beta with my wife yesterday, it was so many things I was hoping for from 76. We‚Äôll never go back!
---
I snagged D1 on a steam sale, hoping to dive in this weekend for a bit and see how it goes. I hear great things about d2, maybe I'll snatch it up later this year. 
---
They had three patches during the beta. Everything (and there were more than a few) wrong on my first day were gone by yesterday.
---
My favorite was the layer game meltdown. Went into the quartermaster menu to get a new skill. The three tip panels wouldn‚Äôt go away. Tried going into my equipment menu. It transparently layered itself behind the three tip panels. Tried pulling up my map. It transparently layered behind all of the above. 
---
Started mashing all the buttons to try to get it to unfuck itself. Randomly hit the inventory button again, and my little character standing on the map *pulled up a tiny little version of the equipment screen next to itself*, while my real equipment screen was still up, and the rest of the map, and the tip panels.
---
It was a hilarious, glorious meltdown.
---
&gt; TD1 is my favourite game of this gen
---
Glad to hear this!! It was on sale for $5 yesterday on Steam so I grabbed it. I'll have a bit of time this weekend to finally play it, can't wait! 
---
It's all just guessing because there's no roadmap. Until Bethesda fills the void with confirmed plans, this is the best we get.
---
Well have my upvote. It's not lay in the corner and cry annoying but it is annoying.
---
OMG The demolition expert perk feels absolutely useless now. Playing a level 96 character and lobbing a frag grenade into a group of 10-12 level 24 ferals should kill them not damage 1/4 of their health. Maybe not kill all of them, but at least half imo, now I have to wait 10 levels to reassign my int to another stat and have the cards ready for the move.
---
TLDR explosives feel useless now.
---
I‚Äôm not really a microphone guy so I never have anyone to team up with either. Same problem in Destiny. 
---
I agree re: Scrapper. Scorchbeasts are already getting a pass, and soon, including loot tables; my source is "Inside the Vault."
---
I disagree that "most" enemies aren't worth ammo. Depends on the ammo, and the beastie. That being said, your point is not invalid.
---
None of my best drops are from 5 star giant space bats, but rather gifts from RNGesus. Legendary may drop squat but his little brother standing next to him could be toting the AAE hunting rifle on your wish list.
---
He's right though; my camp is on the western river and you can see them swimming around before the water loads in.
---
I'm also getting tired of killing legendary glowing hordes to have the fusion cores and legendary weapons dissappear faster than I can tap my E button.  Their bodies are just gone.......vanished like a fart in the wind.....
---
You on Xbox?
---
Go through your Overseer's tapes and listen to each one completely. That will complete the Overseer's Quest. The achievement is only for finding them.
---
At least we would get shit fixed. Modders are awesome.
---
Okay, then the disincentive is that a 100 cap bounty costs the wanted person 500 caps.  Add "bounty hunter administrative fee" that has to be paid at a vendor (400 caps in this example) before the player comes out of pacifist mode.  That will reduce the ability to grief because it will cost them caps.  Also, note that I said that they were already ejected from their team when they became wanted.  This way, attacks on them don't agro their former team.
---
&gt; but they said private servers are no longer being planned.
---
You gotta hit me with that source dawg, cause I haven't seen anything about this being said
---
You're also pointing to statistics for a game who's current PvP mode is basically just duels.  I don't have enough kills in PvP, for example, for the achievement as I hate the idea of dueling.  If I'm able to play a raider character on a survival server where playing is the equivalent of consent, I'm much more willing to participate in PvP.
---
Lol rip. I hope it all gets fixed. I'm hoping it won't be another Destiny 2
---
I don't agree
---
The lackluster patch updates in the past several months (even regressing backwards at times introducing old bugs back in) was caused by this "pessimistic trend"? Or maybe you've got the cause and effect backwards since not many people can remember a game that rebounded from a launch this rocky with so little progress after all this time while still being told to sit tight for what's coming.
---
Sorry. I'm on PS4. I don't even run a melee build (4 strength), and it was damn decent at killing stuff.
---
&gt; I'm still not preordering an EA title
---
Bingo, I'm not preordering anything from any company - it's just a bad practice. 
---
Strength for carry capacity. But I think he means he's just gonna wait until this blows over to play like he used to
---
I beg to differ. I used to be able to kill super mutants with grenades, now ghouls laugh at me. Explosives are useless now. I also think it takes excessive time to re spec if you want to do it right. now I have to wait 10 levels to actually change my 5 points from INT to another stat and have cards that are meaningful to avoid having unused perk points or filling up with useless cards I got from packs.
---
That being said, no it wasn't
---
Dang ok.  That weapon looks really good with the ritual outfit very creepy like
---
Ahhh, I hadn't thought about that. It's very possible that I didn't finish them all. Thanks!
---
Doesn't help when it's a workshop. I found placing Flamethrower Traps on Camp Fires then move the Camp Fires to place it on the lower floor works.
---
Yeah agreed... I'm just pointing out that it's a noticeable lag when your looting enemies mid-fight and that's popping up on your screen lol. Seems like an easy fix and somthing that would reduce some performance lag. 
---
NPCs are all over this game
---
'Fun with friends' is not exactly a resounding endorsement of a game.
---
Also if you think this game is on the same level as titles like Diablo 2, Mechwarrior 3 or early WoW expacs then...well.
---
Good one and thanks for the reminder, I call that menu bouncing. Sometimes its because you move the mouse (or stick), but other times? Mouse didn't move, but the menu auto sorted and bounced way up, or way down and the confirmation switches to that newly "selected" item.
---
My kid asked about it because her friends are hyped. We had a talk about gaming ethics and voting with your wallet. The next day she laughed about her friend who got his mom to preorder anthem.
---
I just grabbed TD1 on the cheap thanks to the Lunar sale on Uplay, and I have to say, this game is a lot of fun, so far.  I won't pre-order anything, but I may wind up getting TD2 at launch if the reviews are favorable. 
---
&gt;6 Studios 
---
Source for this? They mentioned all the BGS studios worked together during the final stages of production, which is rather common in studios under one banner.
---
It is really nice to look at. If they ever let us display stuff in our C.A.M.P.s, I'll definitely mount one.
---
Sorry for you loss.
---
Take time to grieve man, there's no rush. When my sister died it took months before I could go do the stuff we used to do together...I went 6 months without a chocolate shake lol. 
---
It will come back if you want it to, take a break.
---
A better solution is..........if you're getting spin circles you should be able to "enter" the loot window of a certain enemy / meat pile and the server will PRIORITIZE getting that loot sorted before other bags.  So you can bully past the spin circles and force the server to open up that 1 bag.
---
I can't count the number of times last night that I was getting nonstop spinny circles on everything.  Took forever to go away too.
---
I think waiting until you're out of combat will kinda screw people over at the Scorched Earth event.  95% of the time around where the queen was you're in combat for 10-20 mins until most people leave that zone.
---
Yeah I'm on Xbox
---
I quit playing div1 shortly before the first dlc came out. I feel like a lot of the differences between div2 and when I stopped playing div1 debuted in later dlc and game updates, but I genuinely enjoyed playing div2 and all the quality of life changes with a friend this weekend, and we actually started a div1 playthrough since he never played it when it launched due to all the hate. I am curious, what did you not like? The only problems we had were connection issues for my friend, small graphical problems, and enemy skill spam in the end game mission (but that could be working as intended). 
---
I did the similar thing except I went back to fallout 4 to replay it till the dlc is dropped on 76, I personally would like to see 76 maybe have their own private servers where you can pick and choose who's in the world as it sucks sometimes when I'm out doing my thing and a Nuke is getting dropped right where I wanted to go to do some things ehh oh well the game is still fun I just have a hard time focusing on it at times.
---
I just finished setting up a camp in the mire when this random cones up, like a third my level(im 87) and a mirelurk queen comes out of the water at the bottom of a straight drop cliff, i jump down in my excavator armor, this queen is leveled like 20 for the random, and i furious grognak axe it to shitz, then i finish building, look at the map, and see random is at the big maw, go over, try to keep this glowing gulper at like 15% health so random gets the big kill at the big maw, but he dies after i fall into the deep water so i fill his bag with a few things like a grape mentats, and walk away-i sure hope he got it all!
---
LOL. I quit fast traveling. That's most of it right there.
---
When I went into West Tek in Appalacia, I totally forgot they did the FEV work and went in hoping for power armor goodness...
---
Imagine my surprise...
---
Do you ever have an issue with their being none? I‚Äôve spent the last few days server hopping to get the clipboards to appear. One time I saw them on the floor, but they disappeared. I usually show up and the gutsy is dead and there is nothing. 
---
Yeah, if you're describing the game that vaguely they're totally the same. And if you describe Fallout 76 as a game where you stumble around the world without encountering human NPCs while collecting materials to build yourself a safe haven from the weird and distorted monsters that are running around then you could compare it to minecraft, and say that minecraft is better because it has a physics engine that deals with collapsing structures better. 
---
I can be your friend. You don‚Äôt have to be lonely.
---
It's based on observation skills and an understanding of how customer retention in the business world works. A company fighting hard to fix a broken product isn't silent about it. They are actively communicating with the customer base to keep them customers. Otherwise the customers move on to other products and vendors, and it's much more difficult to bring them back. At this point Bethesda would have nothing to lose and everything to gain by telling us all the big plans they had for the game... If they had any. 
---
I can see where OP's coming from. The edges of the paper are dark so it sometimes makes it hard to read what's on the edges. Maybe my contrast is a little high but this is the first game I've had that issue with in over nine years using my TV. It's not a deal breaker, just an inconvenience.
---
I'll be back full time for the PvP server but I love survival PvP like Rust etc.
---
I've only had that happen when I tried to place a water purifier on a campfire indoors, never when I'm trying to place an item where it can normally go.
---
There's a fair bit of 40k music on YT. [War Cant of Mars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-sVTaZRPk) was based on [Battle Hymn of the Republic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy6AOGRsR80) is the only other cover/parody I know of. HMKids, Galaxy Aflame and StringStorm make original songs. First two are mostly dead, but StringStorm is very much active.
---
Now if only someone made a 40k cover of Blood upon the Risers inspired by Astra Militarum (Imperial Guard)...
---
the damn name of the game is fallout... holy shit this is so obvious how could it be missing?
---
The worst is when your waiting only to see it disappear right before your eyes... I've had that happen both to the loot inside the meat pile and the whole meat pile itself.... feelsbadman
---
I always wondered if a player could join your game through the companions. 
---
You‚Äôd still have to give them weapons and such but basic shoot and attack functions would still work. The jumping might be an issue never seen a companion jump.
---
It does happen to me every time, only when I'm in power armor tho.  The screen goes black and no sound.
---
I would love for those to be heavy weapons. Probably also have to increase their damage a bit to make them worth using. I would like to see a single shot heavy energy weapon.
---
Please stop with suggestions like this.
---
They currently have ZERO AI fish (models, animations, attack damage, defense) and they may not have the mechanics in place to confine fish to water areas.  So even if you got your fish, they'd be buggy as hell, swimming under map meshes, and probably flying in the air.  Then you'd complain about that.
---
There's so much faster content that could come in NOW if they could just concentrate without silly suggestions like fishing that would take a lot longer to implement.
---
A year from now, sure, great, fishing for everyone.  Not now.
---
That sounds almost word for word what I was told by the devs making the Gameband Smartwatch.
---
*shakes head*
---
My first ever Kickstarter and...man I got burned on that one.
---
&gt; You are obviously using a Melee build to have the viewpoint you have expressed.
---
You are completely wrong.
---
&gt; The Patch that Nerfed stuff had a dramatic affect on Stealth/Rifleman builds
---
Except it didn't.
---
&gt; Stealth is wrecked, intentional or not, and is next to useless if you are on a team.
---
This has nothing to do with nerfing a mechanic. This is a bug.
---
&gt; TS took a significant Damage reduction for an effect that already had an excessive accuracy nerf.
---
TS was pointless, anyway, as you mention because of accuracy. You were better off with other affixes. The total damage number means nothing if you can one-shot with a VATS critical.
---
&gt; Explosive effect took a nerf to both Damage &amp; AOE resulting in an overall reduction of around 70%
---
.....
---
&gt; Rifles &amp; Shotguns are degrading quicker, &amp; "Luck of the Draw" isn't helping.
---
There was no published change for this. It isn't related to a nerf. Have you used energy weapons, by chance? Bit of a tangent.... but also has nothing to do with TS/E.
---
&gt; Ammo consumption has increased by 700% (ammo drops were nerfed in a previous patch)
---
This is absolutely not true because I'm not using 7x the ammo with a VATS crit handmade to kill a super mutant.
---
&gt; I now use a 3* Instigating Death Tambo as my primary weapon, because it's the Highest 1st hit Damage weapon I have, even though I have no perks to support it.
---
It's good to hear you're adapting.
---
That's what I was figuring.  Thanks for the confirmation
---
Compare/contrast, Lucky Hole Mine's primary resident...and Harold, c. 2277...
---
I'm sorry for your loss.... you have my thoughts and I hope you can mourn and grieve and let yourself feel what you need to feel to feel better (eventually). 
---
I had similar happen to me just last year also, so I empathize very much. You're not alone. I met someone that became one of my best friends, she was like my little sister. We met through our guild right before The Secret World came out and then we played through all the content nearly every evening together for the next four years. Made so many good memories, became so close. And then, one day, we found out that from her family that she was in the hospital and then suddenly died. She was only 19 years old that year.... It happened so fast and so abrupt and so was painfully mortal and fragile that it was a jarring reminder how fleeting and short life can be. I couldn't play the game without it being a hurtful reminder of her and all our memories and the large blackhole it left with her absence. 
---
I uninstalled and blocked news and info about the game to cope with it and have my own time to mourn. I completely understand not playing a game after someone close to you that you made so many memories with passes. I hope you have close friends and ppl you can lean on during this time.
---
Bet
---
If you haven't launched a nuke yourself, definitely do that.
---
A great many people asked for a buff to TSE weapons.  The demolition thing provides that, although maybe not in the best way.
---
I honestly think the regular bethesda games may be spoiling you for all the others, including non bethesda games.  Very few games that aren't built as a repeatable experience (competitive games, sports games, etc) give you anywhere near the game time of Skyrim or Fallout 4.  A handful do, but honestly most games are less than 100 hours worth of quality game time, probably well below that.    
---
That's fine too.  You shouldn't judge a game by how much of your time it sucks up, you should judge it by the quality of the experience.  
---
Ohio River Adventures; also I think the life preservers give plastic, not rubber. 
---
If this skyrim mod proves anything, it is that there is a substantial amount of cash to be given to the person/team that does it: [https://www.patreon.com/skyrimtogether](https://www.patreon.com/skyrimtogether)
---
A lot of the recipes are just random drops.  You'll get them all eventually.  Just takes time.
---
If you really really want it though, go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits and offer caps.  Someone probably has one in their inventory they don't even want.  They'll sell it to you for caps.
---
Every decon shower has a chance to remove mutations if you are not using Starched Genes. Including the one in Blackwater Mine. I *used* that one to remove mutations when I was collecting them and wanted to get rid of empathy. 
---
Have you ever been to Jita?
---
Agree.
---
Pretty sure Bethesda C-D'd the multiplayer FO4 project so üòü
---
This is very bizarre. It seems to be happening to you constantly, and yet I've had no issues with missing items at all. Well actually last night I had a weird glitch where my Fusion cores all disappeared, but I quit and rejoined and they were back ... so it wasn't a server inventory glitch but a client glitch.
---
This doesn't seem to be a common complaint. Some people have one or two items go missing, but most of those end up having been accidental scraps, accidental drops or accidental sales. The fact that it is happening so often to you would seem to imply you are doing something to cause it... which must be very frustrating to hear, especially if you ruled that out yourself already.
---
This is correct, Instigating and Two Shot cannot be on the same weapon.
---
I love it when people try to sell you items like stumps me for 10 caps each 
---
Then you go to check and instead of putting 10 caps they put 100 caps thinking you‚Äôll drop 1000 caps for 10 stimpacks.
---
They don‚Äôt live very long after that. 
---
I do that too, but this guy was running all over the place.  Looks like it's the glitch like the youtube video someone else posted.
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.
---
People buy and sell everything there for caps.  Usual price for springs and screws is 2-3 caps each.
---
The Magic Boomstick is an Instigating Explosive pump-action shotgun, so yeah, I imagine it should happen.
---
&gt; all the quests and dialogue etc from such NPC's
---
Somebody pointed out in some other thread that they do have the voice acting in the  game, it's just in the form of holotapes rather than dialogue from "living" NPCs. That actually makes it even stranger that they kept with the decision to not have any non-robotic NPCs in the game. 
---
Wasn't there something about a trade exploit mentioned, perhaps you were a victum of this.
---
Someplace, like say, Vault 76? Instance the empty vault for character creation and every other time you visit it's after Reclamation day.
---
&gt; I beg to differ. I used to be able to kill super mutants with grenades, now ghouls laugh at me.
---
Pulse grenades still DOT out super mutants and that doesn't even make sense. That hasn't changed. Is your entire build just two cards - grenadier and demo expert? Surely you have unspent perk points to use if that was your focus. Grenade-bang (throw mine, VATS the mine) still works fine.
---
What are you doing that lobbing grenades into a group of ghouls was a viable and superior build than something else like, say, shotguns _in addition to explosive_?
---
&gt; now I have to wait 10 levels to actually change my 5 points from INT to another stat and have cards that are meaningful to avoid having unused perk points or filling up with useless cards I got from packs.
---
That's part of the game. You will inevitably end up with unused perk points and useless cards. That complaint isn't valid as this is going to happen regardless of what you choose.
---
That's like 60 8 hour days. I'd say you got your money's worth. That's more than I've worked since release!
---
Funny thing is that in this fkin challenge you have to kill flatwood monster and alien, arent they same thing????
---
Hahaha I posted this like 20 days ago. do you just scroll though looking to get in internet squabbles? you had to dig deep for this. 
---
EN-GER-LAND
---
TD1 for the first time. I am so jealous.
---
No, game is good. Mods are for cheaters!
---
The servers are garbage, the game would probably be fairly solid if it weren't for that. Fallout 4 was remarkably stable for a Bethesda game, even when modded.
---
I'm on PS4 and can confirm, it's Radworms.  As soon as Radworms are cured, your Marsupial mutation is nerfed. 
---
i didnt even get a chance to kill him for a bit of satisfaction either.
---
You can‚Äôt hide from us Bethesda 
---
pretty sure that was patched. Can't patch me being thick though!
---
The when a male wears this costume they look great! Thanks Bethesda foe the LGBTQA+ love!
---
I am jealous. Have fun.
---
It means you have more imagination. On Sat some guy attacked my camp while I was in it. My reaction? Destroy my square hovel of no thought invested that took 5 mins to make? Go ahead, bro. 
---
Those who care about their CAMPS (the majority, I suspect) would have a different reaction.
---
My only day off and I did everything else that needed to be done
---
Personally I just like to run around with the smoke grenades and not actually have any artillery set up and watch people panic when I throw 1 or 10 in there base lol
---
First, I'm not the first person to suggests this. 
---
Second, you have no idea or evidence on what takes longer to do, or not do.
---
Third. I never said now.
---
Forth. How selfish to think the game should only do the things you want now. 
---
I've made tons of post on broken events with a lot of upvotes an submitted the bugs several times. They don't care at the moment. A lot of events became broken in the last patch an added to the existing ones like swarm of suitors.
---
I hate when this happens but this was happening to me over a month ago. I don't know if it has something to do with my time I am on or what. Yes it is sad and happy at the sametime. 
---
I don't know if it's the one you're thinking about, but Fudgemuppet made [a nearly two hour long video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2uzSs2AgHo) on this exact subject. 
---
I did actually üòá
---
Think it isn‚Äôt the showers at Enclave Bunker, rather the ‚Äúdecontamination room‚Äù that you‚Äôre forced to go through as part of the quest, the showers are fine as long as you‚Äôve got Starched Genes lvl2... I think, hopefully some other people can add/confirm..?
---
We were there, we all just had you blocked. :)
---
False.
---
Quit. The declining server numbers will send a message to reporitize 76 to the top of Bethesda‚Äôs list, instead of two other games that can wait. If they don‚Äôt, 76 dies. Either way, lesson learned.
---
I wish you could appreciate how unthinkable it would have been before launch for me to type this. I‚Äôm one of the ultimate Fallout lovers and Beth apologists. But this shit is beyond acceptable, and now beyond insulting.
---
I've tried your method many times and I have to say...  IT REALLY WORKS!  *sigh
---
what do you expect us to do? Do you want us to go and rob Todd Howard at gunpoint and get your  $80 back?
---
Hot damn thank you!
---
Nah.. it gives them a legit warning before it lands and three minutes to move.
---
I‚Äôve been killed by a nuke before along with my base. No wanted flag.
---
Man, no, workshops are place where i come, ask you for food, you gime me food and i go away. When you dont give me food, i open pvp via workshop, kill you, eat you, go away.
---
Thats legit.
---
&gt; But now it turns out they're reneging on both of those promises. 
---
What?  Source?  They said it'd be a year after release.  I know people like to pretend this game has been out for longer than it has, but are we pretending its been a year already?
---
Remember when they said as long as people play the game they will keep the servers?
---
I've seen some streams of Bloodied builds doing obscene amounts of damage.  A good crew running that probably makes short work of SBQ.
---
Black Desert did the same thing or pretty close to it. 
---
Glad to know that this method is tried a true
---
More like an Open World Action Adventure Game with a crafting system than a survival shooter. Condidering you can just walk up to almost any enemy and whack'em or plink'em with your nerf gun to death without even thinking if you have decent gear and/or PA.
---
My game is bugged too......Items are now stuck above eye level and dont move up or down anymore. They no longer "snap" into place when near a spot I could normally place them....Iv tried logging out and resetting the game. I just gave up and havnt played in weeks now because there is really no point in playing since i cant even use half of the game....
---
Todd was never really in charge at best he oversaw it.
---
It's Bethesda Austin formerly Battlecry Studios.
---
System?
---
Oh sorry PS4
---
Ooh that'd explain why I don't blow myself up as often.  That and the weapon nerfs of course.
---
Okay, so, here's the thing.  A one or two-year roadmap should have been something the developers and leads had put together MONTHS before the game was launched.  That they will not show one means they don't have one, and they probably never did.
---
Let that sink in a moment.
---
Why a drill?
---
&gt;I feel that anyone betting against Bethesda is more than likely going to eat their words
---
Want to put some real money on that?
---
Seriously? [The hell does he want now?](https://i.imgur.com/MDhbuT6.jpg)
---
No
---
I have chameleon mutation. U can see me, don't lie!
---
"Controversial" = "nonconforming" = "wrongthink" ... I hate wrongthink police. Gaming is low stakes compared to most things. So I go to (some shitty game) -&gt; Controversial a lot when it comes time to sling shit at wrongthink police
---
It‚Äôs hard to establish a goal there. I‚Äôve done it a few times too and it always ends up being counter productive to what I‚Äôm trying to do or I am rehashing the same things I‚Äôve already done to help them get through a mission. 
---
It‚Äôs not a bad thing. Just that I don‚Äôt care for it as much. 
---
I thought you could connect a terminal to the door and change the code manually?
---
From what I saw from videos and friend-reviews, we have all been playing D1 since it came out and it has very similar issues to D1 beginning. Connection issues, graphical issues, and even heard of hackers but I have yet to find any real concrete proof of the last one. The only real change I saw in the game was that players had armor now instead of bigger health pools but other than that it looked the same and that is what disappointed me.
---
So they get kicked from the team.....trade to get caps.....have friend kill them.....BOUNTY GONE......forcing someone into pacifist mode destroys the enitire idea of WASTELAND SURVIVAL.......this isn't the SIMS....we arent building a UTOPIAN SOCIETY.....if someone kills you and takes your stuff you have 2 options.....KILL THEM and take it back or RUN AWAY and live to SURVIVE another day.....if this was a real life scenario (which once again is the IDEA of a SURVIVAL style game) you ADAPT to SURVIVE or DIE....... you couldn't CRY to GOD and demand he put them in PACIFIST MODE....well i guess you could, and you'd get the same response BETHESDA is giving.....SILENCE.....I'm NOT supporting or condoning the actions of these people, but there are MUCH BIGGER ISSUES that need attention.....flooding the forums with complaints like this is drawing attention away from the more pressing issues with overall functionality of the game.......at the end of the day.....ADAPT to SURVIVE......or DIE
---
That's amazing.
---
I hope so
---
I'm on PS4 but I won't be online for another 6 hour or so. At work right now.
---
While I agree that the BoS were most likely shoehorned in just to "tick all the boxes", I think they were given a pretty decent explanation. 
---
I think I would still have preferred to see some other faction in their place, such as a local contingent of the US Army who, disillusioned by being left out to die by the higher command, set out to help survivors with the resources available to them (i.e. a similar background to the BoS, but different enough to feel unique, and with a stronger local connection). 
---
Agree I am in the Mire and it seems like most the dailies in that area dont want to do right for me.  T-T 
---
Unfortunately it's not something you can really provide proof for, and if it was happening on a major scale we'd see hundreds of posts. The fact that this hasn't gained traction suggests that it's only affecting a small number of people, or it's caused (partly or in whole) by user error.
---
Hope it gets fixed if it's a significant issue, but I wouldn't hold my breath unless someone manages to capture solid data about it to share with the forums/Bethesda.
---
Technically at this point it's a rumour but I'm thinking the mods won't take it down so you should be fine.
---
Ok, if theres no other person who can help me lemme know when u online :)
---
I'm having this problem with potted plants almost all the time. It have happened with other objects as well but not as often.
---
I second that nomination. 
---
I got my first one from the BoS-controlled Dam damn in toxic valley.
---
It had no core
---
What's worse?  
---
Getting the spinning arrows and hoping the loot eventually loads
---
or
---
Killing a shitpile of enemies only to have their corpses disappear
---
Agree. I kind of enjoy this quest more than any other in the Mire. 
---
Hunter/hunted you will be only person there, monster mash no one there if any he will leave after you start killing him, answering the slap rarely happening.
---
Yah I always make weird faces at my screen when I see comparisons like these. Division, Destiny, Anthem, Apex, w/e aren't even the same style and scope and type of game background to compare with. I mean I guess if you're just doin a vague theme compare then ok. But 76 is weighted toward exploring and looking at things and places and reconstructing what happened, which I say is just as important as just following the Overseer plot. These other games are designed from the start with the emphasis on loot and shoot primary.
---
I literally just found this tunnel this morning, after 150+ hours of gameplay
---
sure thing!
---
I hope it works out for you too, and that I'm not sending people out on a wild goose-chase now hah. Best of luck! :)
---
I don‚Äôt know,  chasing a player and constantly attacking,  making them use healing items,  seems pretty god damn griefy to me.
---
Would have jumped servers but I didn‚Äôt want to have to start my quest from scratch.
---
Yep, drove me nuts. I set up a sick survivalist camp on the tiny lake above Watoga an the spotlights were a huge in making the theme come together but they always keep turning off an it was annoying as hell.
---
I'll assume they died of the scorch infection. 
---
I feel the same way. Overall, I really like the game, but it is disappointing compared to other Fallout games. Hopefully some bugs will be squashed and some content will be added before too long!
---
Funnily enough, this and server drops/hops are the reason I ended up with so many full cores before I even realized what was happening (pre-bug fix).
---
If it were constant I'd have quit : ) About 1 item every 82 hours, just long enough to have confidence in the game and then bye bye item x, and that does not include scrapping. But you can assign blame to me, thats all good and I understand your reasoning. Read the summaries I posted, or search vanish, disappear or missing. Its not just me, and its not happening to a couple people.
---
Point being: It should not happen at all. For any reason; thats the function of UI and client/server code. Unless you can tell me what other AAA or close to AAA game has these server and/or UI issues. That would be news to me. 
---
Ahh, yes. The Soon^tm that warframe developers use. Have fun!
---
bE sUrE tO cHeCk tHe AtOm sHop
---
Definitely agree with you on the damage for two shot legendaries being double. Lately it's as if someone replaced the additional projectile in my guns with a tampon or something, so humiliating.
---
Sadly though I can't say I agree that TSE is the most valuable prefix with all the Bloodied legendaries doing some crazy damage as well as being worth a very pretty penny nowadays.
---
Hell, Half Life 3 is more likely than a good FO76 update
---
I found my first power armor sets in the booby trapped barn outside Mama Dolce's.  Then in the building outside Belching Betty when doing the Firebreather's missions.
---
Then I server hopped at those two locations to get a full set of T-45, followed by T51b and T60 as I leveled up.  But after getting that T-45 I found a ton of other places that spawn 45, 51b, and 60 in the Forest area.
---
Didn't even bother with the few Raider armors that exist, except for Fusion Cores later.
---
Many times now though, Fusion cores are taken.  People just grab them all the time (and sometimes the armors themselves, cause you can scrap them for Plastics).
---

---
If this was a real life scenario, me putting a 308 into his face would hurt him...
---
Perhaps a monetary disincentive - an "administrative fee" that needs to be paid off (at a vendor) in order to allow the griefer to start griefing again.  So if he gets a 100 cap bounty, he not only has to lose the 100 caps, but has to pay a further 400 caps to the "man" to clear it up.  It wouldn't stop anyone from griefing, but it would stop serial griefing.
---
You aren't playing the right games my friend,
---
TES games and FO games last quite a while. Like.. Insane amounts of replay-ability. 
---
Hell I have 1k hours in Rust Legacy, 500 in DayZ, 800 or something in Arma 3. 600 in CS and 1k in R6 siege. Probably a shit ton in BF3. 
---
I hate buying new games and I love games with lots of longevity and that are hard to master.  Thank God I never really got too deep into any MMO's hahaha. 
---
I've had this glitch happen to me a few times, but it seems to disappear over time. I can still fast travel as long as the enemies around are actually dead. I think it disappears after I've fast traveled and dealt with fresh enemies.
---
So much time for this comment
---
In terms of other games griefing, thats nothing, you also have the option of storing your junk, blocking the player and fast travelling away or letting them kill you andbgetting a bounty
---
 Go away. Then you will be happy, or do you need to do this?
---
It's almost like level barely matters. 
---
This would be great! 
---
Somehting like every player being able to own an associated tradebot (with some decent weight capacity) to sell in a trading hub.
---
I will happily pay atoms for something like this.
---
Sadly, too late to implement it, I guess...
---
I once was bounty hunting and spotted a lvl 50 with 10 caps around the overseers camp.
---
When i arrived there i saw he was sitting wayy up in some kind of army-parcour styled camp with already many ppl trying to get up.
---
You had to pass a few barriers on a few floors with stairs and electrical lanes hanging in mid air to get to his room at the top.
---
Oh, and there were also hidden traps along the way up. Flamethrowers behind walls that suddenly went off and stuff. He pretty much designed his own lil dungeon/tower iono.
---
Then he was sitting there on a chair, i was able to see thru a window. Only thing was, i couldnt reach him other than hit this camp in some way. And thats what i did. Punched a wall down, got to him and killed him w/e.
---
That was the moment one of the other guys (who i thought was just another bounty hunter) "locked" me in with a wall replacement behind me.
---
It was also the moment i realized the dead guy was in a team with that dude and another one who was standing downstairs. 
---
As soon as i punched down another wall to get out of there the whole thing got blewn up by a fatman from the lvl 200 downstairs. I saw the lvl 50 steal my junk then, and hell i had no problem with that lol
---
Iono i think it was a neat.
---
Feel like anyone betting against Bethesda would have already made all the money they'd ever need but ok
---
Passive mode
---
I've been through the bunker decon showers many times with Starched Genes x2 and haven't lost any of my 5 mutations. I'm kinda paranoid about it, and check at each login that all my perks and mutations are still intact.
---
If you've ever removed the perk temporarily, I've heard that even "Sun Kissed" can cure mutations.
---
Perfect lmao 
---
 That's two of you today, missing the most important part of F4 survival. No fast travel.
---
 That's what I've been doing and it makes the game much better.
---
I had few hunter/hunted events done. I had brutal murder season with guy on monster mash. And slap, sometimes they accidentaly start it.
---
Easiest fix they should have done prior to the tse nurfing and other bull, make a time cool down going into or out of passivest mode and making you unable to deal any damage or take any damage in passivest mode including your base.
---
That would have been easier and they wouldnt have to keep trying to fix their fix of a fix they tried to fix. People who don't want anything to do with pvp get what they want and then it would make more sense to have a hardcore server choice where its all pvp all the time.
---
Woah, calm down Dude. He just said his opinion about this game. You are the one who sounds like a smartass nuka cola gamer boi 
---
Last night I ended the potential of camp griefing by building a base that can't be accessed by anyone but me or destroyed by anyone thanks to some building videos I saw on YouTube. I agree though, in general, consequences for griefing behavior need to be added to the game unless you choose to play on new PVP server they are adding. Personally, I hope at the same time they add PVP they also add an option for coop only servers. Wishful thinking probably.
---
Fishing outfit there limited time, becouse now your wife smell like fish! Original price!
---
I've hardly played recently because the poor state this game is in. But I think a lot of us would like to see a comeback, or at least Bethesda acknowledge that this game is in a bad place and they intend to fix it.
---
If you don't, that's fine, but that's why I made this post. 
---
They committed to Player Vending some time ago.  They've repeatedly confirmed it since then.  So I'm not worried about it happening.
---
What I'm worried is it will be at my camp.  I don't have problems with griefers now, but I'm sure if I plopped down a vending machine and made my camp visible to everyone on the map............that would change overnight......lol  Also there's no going back, whatever they implement will probably not change for a long long time.
---
As long as they do indestructible terminals all in one location, it will be fun, easy, and problem free forever :)
---
Nobody should have to suffer from the loss of a friend or a loved one.  You are no different, you sound like a good man and your friend sounded like a good one too, there's no doubting that.  This place can be pretty toxic sometimes but there are good people too.  
---
I'm truly sorry for your loss and I know you'll mourn for a long time, but that's natural, I've lost many friends over the years and all of them hit hard.  The memories are there, keep them, cherish them, they're the things that'll make you appreciate them more and make you realise you'll always have them to remember him by.. and nobody can take that from you.  
---
I hope you find your peace, you deserve it.
---
Yes, on PS4, but only happens when I'm in PA.
---
[The bugs may he](https://i0.wp.com/uhhuhyaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pp550x550.jpg)?
---
I would imagine that because the projected profits of this game were earmarked to fund future projects, which will now be in jeopardy, I expect the bean counters at Bethesda will attempt to cut their losses and recoup as much as possible with minimal outlay. I doubt very much that there will be new content, or new content which will cost big money.
---
And like I said, neither will the Far Harbor Trappers or the Rust Devils, yet we still have the armor they created (Trapper and Robot armor).
---
The fact that a DIFFERENT Raider group also calling themselves "Trappers" also created IDENTICAL armor in Appalachia at a completely different point of time speaks to how little lore gets in the way of adding this stuff.
---
And there is ZERO chance that the FH Trappers are descended from the Appa Trappers, cause the group in 76 were COMPLETELY wiped out.
---
Don't you own a phone? Coming soon! Fallout Mobile!
---
Yeah, I've had that as well.  At least if you got to "force" that one container to open, you'd be able to get a fast shot at it before it despawned.....lol  Some chance is better than endless spinny circles leading to no chance :)
---
the game is mostly about honoring the dead maybe someday you can come back and use the gameplay to honor that experience and the totality of what the connection meant to you, in solitude or with new friends
---
Whoa thanks. I tend to assume that, if the Data section says I have to redo some step, that I do. I've been 2/3 the way into the Cave prob. This will save me a lot of stimpacks/etc that I barely have.
---
This reads like one of those Facebook posts where some child makes a scathing critique on the state of gender inequality completely unprompted. 
---
Its bugged. If a team mate has the helmet mod that does the same thing on their power armour if effects the entire team as well.
---
I don‚Äôt think Bethesda has that type of tech üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I hope Bethesda nows that Camp Shops are a bad idea. I have a reason to not show everyone my camp. The bounty is no real repercussion for leveling a base. 
---
Yeah.  My current base has three layers of foundation and two metal, so you can't marsupial / strange-in-numbers / jetpack your way in, but the weak spot is the powered door at ground level.  It's still destructible.
---
Dude. I think you're the one getting over worked. 
---
Besides, there is something definitely creepy about people who continue to post about a game they stopped playing. 
---
Just as there's something creepy about people that go right to insults that mean nothing, like nuka cola gamer. I don't even have any idea what you are trying to infer with that. Just...another reused insult someone smarter than you came up with probably.
---
Oops, typed this out on my phone and forgot to finish that sentence.
---
Hmm well maybe we enjoyed it so much since we didn't see these changes present in division 1.  It sounds like there are a lot of end game modes though, so hopefully it will stay fun. I won't preorder it (76 was the last time I will ever make that mistake) but I could imagine picking it up a couple weeks in if it doesn't get trashed. I do remember having next to no faith in what was a hostile, incompetent community/deceloper team when the dicision was struggling so bad, but they managed to turn it around.  Hoping another game company does the same...
---
Oddly enough , the bug only triggered for me when I switched from Excavator to T-60 , but at least it's clear it's at least somewhat related to PA . 
---
Boooo. That sucks.
---
They probably will, last i heard the radiation resistance was bugged which is the only reason why it ultimately has less defense. But once they fix it then it should essentially have the same values as combat armor just spread out over physical,energy and radiation
---
I've never removed the SG2 perk card. I check my mutations constantly. I have a buddy who lost two mutations randomly (he has and never removes SG2, too) but they came back. I am hoping that is what is happening here, but man it would just suck if they made it so your personal decon shower has a chance of removeing mutations while you;ve got ST2 equipped. That just seems cruel.
---
I think there's a weight "arithmetic" problem that goes beyond server lag.  When the January 31 Hotfix dropped the hard weight limit on me, I spent three solid hours trying to shed nearly 1200 lbs of stuff.  I noticed that the weight change as I removed items never matched the weight listed for the items.  For example, I ate a bowl of soup weighing 0.1 lbs and total weight dropped by 15 lbs . . . then it shot back up by nearly 20 lbs . . . then finally stabilized at a 2 lbs drop.  Same thing for adding items to Stash . . . increasing weight fluctuated but only approximately corresponded to the weight of individual item.  Who knows . . .
---
7.5 minutes per core, so.... literally 2 every 15.
---
Still more than plenty if it weren't for the near-guaranteed-disconnect within half an hour of claiming one of the core producing workshops.
---
I kid, but those disconnects can definitely be annoying when farming cores.  I feel like I have to do that once a week for an hour or two tops though and I have plenty.
---
First, I'm certain they're not going to just shut it down.  That's bad business as is. But second, you would think they'd have some sort of development roadmap down already. Assuming everything went well at launch, and the plan was to add content and continue the story when the game went Live, something has to exist.  Didn't they tease a month ago that a content update was coming "faster than expected". They couldn't have possibly been talking about the PvP bullshit, could they?
---
Is there a bug chasing trophy you get for collecting  all the diseases?
---
Just do what some of us are doing and play more enjoyable games until the fixes and content are done. 
---
You should never force yourself to play something you don't enjoy, that's what they want and why they have tactics in games to keep you playing (in the hopes you spend more money) 
---
Not sure if you ever found it but the vendor at R&amp;G Station down by Spruce Knob has the plan for Long Rustic Bench. Best of luck!
---
&gt;  absolutely nothing you do in the course of the game has any effect on the world at large
---
That's pretty much par for the course for online games. Were you expecting differently?
---
The issue is your level. Those guys only spawn for low levels, up to 15 I think. If you are over level 15 you will never get them to spawn. Get a low level buddy to go to the area when no ones there and a few will spawn. You will have to repeat a few times.
---
I've worked in the game development industry before, so yes, I know what it takes.  Coding, modeling, animation, level design, etc.  Remove one of those and you'll have something that isn't even remotely close to working.  You're talking hundreds and hundreds of labor hours from multiple team members.  And then when they implement it, many many more hours ironing out all the bugs that creates.
---
Bethesda treats everything here as a NOW priority.  They don't do in-game surveys to figure out what the "whole" player base wants so your fishing suggestion gets stacked right up there with Player Vending and Larger Stash.
---
How selfish of you to think 10 people suggesting fishing should have the same footing as the 1,000 posts about Player Vending and Larger Stash.
---
Get over yourself please.  Just because a random idea pops into your head means it's a good one.
---
This is the bit which annoyed me more. Sure the Raider and the Enclave aren't by favorite factions but they exist and are options later in the universe. Yet there is no way yet to rebuild as you are meant to. 
---
I think I can fit it if you still need 
---
Okay.  You want me to support future development of the game?  Make things not cost $20 motherfucking dollars.  $20 is outrageous.   
---
Stop making excuses for these shitty fucking practices.  Holy shit, you are only perpetuating the problem.  
---
Expect better and DEMAND better.  Don't just take it like a dog.   
---
Here's why:  I can guarantee you $20 skins is going to do the opposite of supporting any future development.   
---
But hey, if you like a dying game, then keep on supporting their shitty practices.  You'll get what you deserve.  
---
&gt; explore, kill, loot, repeat.
---
Been doing that for a couple of hundred hours and enjoying myself ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Atleast hire some modders to fix you game while you get out more content how bout that? 
---
They've been sort of silent in a collective way despite comments from community managers here on a lot of the posts from time to time.
---
I think they are reeling over the way many changes and mistakes in the patch experience have been received. It feels like they don't know what to do, I expected them to hear the player bases (Casual, and the meta endgamers) and start addressing the most central issues in UI, usability, and perks/items and start finishing the things that are closest to being finished but the biggest sources of player frustration. They've shown almost no ability to hear those things, no changes being implemented other than the Known tag on plans reflect back to these strongest needs of the players for the game to start reaching a more finished responsive and customizable state.
---
It needs to be opened to modding to the current live game UI officially and then opened to a marketplace / steam workshop like system where the most passionate creative fans of the game will drive it forward much like the original classic multiplayer games and even many modern games do.
---
It'll be fun to see the response from Bethesda be adding a roadmap to the store for 1500 Atoms.
---
Just wait for more content. I'll probably enjoy survival mode because it's actually something new to do 
---
It seems related to doing cap runs as well for me . I was in the same boat , usually I went to Harper's Ferry last , but now I'm gunna go their first to see if it makes a difference . It seems like it could be dependant , although I've tried fast travelling from numerous spots after cap runs with the same black screen result . 
---
They count as the same thing but i dont think it was intended. Someone glitched one a while back and you could see they used a Zetan model for it. So its ‚Äúthe flatwoods monster‚Äù but its also got the same code as a Zetan thats not supposed to be in the game yet.
---
Basically they probably used the zetan as a base model for the monster and forgot to remove it before launch
---
Trapper and Robot armor are both teh sort of thing that probably developed independently several times.  Operator, Pack, and Disciples are a bit more specific and are less likely to have come about previously (though the idea of roving packs of killer furries fills me with dread).
---
Yes, one of the highest single shot damage guns in the game.  More damage than assault rifles, faster shooting and reload than dragons.
---
What I did is built everything out of foundation and have a "crawl space" that is accessible by storing one block that is easy to snap back in a hurry. Also most people spawn inside when they fast travel which is convenient :)
---
Speaking for myself, I'm a 'Hardcore' fallout player and I'm still playing 76, but that's purely because I love fallout.
---
Content wise after 300 hours and 140 levels I've done pretty much everything. I just like shooting mutants
---
In addition to the gyms, Ohio River Adventures (NW of the nuka plant) has roughly a dozen life preservers scattered around the area. There's also a bunch of golf balls in the bucket down near the water in case you need some plastic.
---
Also, farming mole miners is an easy way to rack up some rubber and other materials. Their breathers break down to rubber and aluminum, and the "suit scrap" turns into black titanium, gears, and steel. 
---
*Sighs in native-resource only PS4 mod* 
---
So strange to see threads about all of these issues that I have been seeing since beta, but I was always down voted to hell for mentioning them.  Glad to see people are aware of them now that the game is pretty much officially ruined. 
---
I guess a month from now we'll see threads talking about RNG based mods at the Enclave vendor are a big problem. 
---
Works pretty well as a single-player game.
---
Oh no, she's a teenager. It was totally promoted, by teaching her about the situation. It wasn't a scathing critique by any means. She very quickly understood why I immediately said no and laughed when she asked if we could buy it. She was pretty hurt until I explained the situation though.
---
Level up.
---
Are you letting it run its course or using a disease cure?  I noticed yesterday that if I cure it quickly with a DC it doesn't mess up the jumping.
---
That is what it hurts the most.
---
This game had a lot of potential: the map is great, the enemies are fairly varied, the fauna is interesting, the crafting system is immense‚Ä¶
---
They just condemned it with bad decisions, like to launch the game not polished at all, to mix PvP and PvE, some tedious features...
---
No, it‚Äôs only a challenge. 
---
I have seen this many, many times when I try to join a world to team up with a friend.   I‚Äôm on PS4.
---
Yeah, they need to add more content.
---
I'm on board with them doing the PVP mode, but they have to fully think out the implementation before they dive in and do it.
---
In the meantime I'd really love some new events, harder events, player vending, increased stash size.  There's no reason to play except log in and do atom challenge rewards.
---
My friends are BORED with the lack of content.  That's why my friends list says offline, offline, offline, offline for 95% of the people I know.
---
Lol.  I'd make a floating camp that requires a jetpack and marsupial, but I often play with lower-level players.  They're already freaked out by my cantilevered viewing platform with the 6 story drop underneath it.
---
Yep, it's broke. I've yet to complete it successfully. Either solo or partnered up. First time, a lone mirelurk spawned underground and it failed when time ran out. Second time, there was 15 minutes left and my partner camped out on the island while I cleared the ones that were stuck in buildings. Failed with 12 minutes left for some reason. Neither of us had any clue why.
---
Given that the whole point of the event is to prevent the mirelurks from reaching the island, they should remove the condition to kill the mirelurks from the objectives. You should just be able to wait out the timer if they get stuck since you've kept them away from the island. /u/jessBethesda /u/Ladydevann
---
Shit happens all the time it only means that the remaining eight people who still play the game are all logged in at the same time lol
---
Cmon Sony. Just let the PS4 boys play too 
---
For me it's always empty, accidental slap was happening but it's more like free caps then fight
---
 The game is fine. I play every day what is your problem?
---
Tood
---
i dont even bother with nuke zones anymore, the juice isnt worth the squeeze.
---
I am waiting for Patch 6 - Like when is it gonna come out, what are they fixing (I guess just SBQ issues according to the last official post) and what if anything they will add to the game (I highly doubt anything at this point other then some Atomic Shop stuff- I am good with it as long as it is camp related).
---
Every. Single. Day.
---
I see it fairly regularly joining friends games. Just wait in que, normally doesn't take that long for some poor soul to DC from server and let you in
---
Someone in the comments mentioned it but the prefix ‚ÄúDiseased‚Äù overwrites the legendary prefix, so most of them are actually legendaries; you just can‚Äôt tell. 
---
Or fix the servers?
---
I feel like they‚Äôre trying to figure out a lot of these stability issues and other glitches down before they work on future content, other than the ‚Äòalways on‚Äô PvP servers. 
---
How long after launch did Elder Scrolls Online get more content? 
---
Even though it had more content at the start compared to FO76. 
---
Ah fair play, I didn't mean anything by it just made me chuckle. 
---
The game isnt worth playing.  This is about the point in time where we have all simultaneously realized it.  Many people like you have good reasons, some have shit reasons, but regardless of the explanation, it‚Äôs simply the case that the number of people quitting has reached critical mass. 
---
I'm not blaming you, I'm just pointing out that the fact that happened so often to you, while many others have no problems suggests that either something in your configuration or in your actions leads to the condition. 
---
 I assume you've already tried deleting and reinstalling to rule out file corruption.
---
Maybe but you are the one trying to write an entire essay about people who aren‚Äôt as smart asyou by trying to imply them that there is definitely something creepy with him going  wherever he wants, even if he doesn‚Äôt like a game that subbreddit is about. He just stated his opinion offending no one besides you. 
---
It's a hell of a lot more stable since launch that's for sure 
---
As for white knight I've been using it since day 1 basically and since the nerf I've played around 8 hours playtime and I still haven't needed to repair anything even with the 60% boost now 
---
Enjoy it while it lasts - this will get fixed eventually.  You are proof positive of the players that only exist to make the game worse for everyone else.
---
You know I gotta say I love getting the stable flux from the quest rewards, only to be killed by another invisible/lagged out enemy, then loading back in, having the quest rewards screen pop up, rubbing it in my face.
---
it is one of the best games in a long heritage of adventure and RP empowered titles, manages to honor classic multiplayer and classic adventure games about collecting details in order to advance, I was and am still amazed at its accomplishment there, the pure power of these collisions of genre is awestriking. hopefully some day it will be both finished and also opened to basic modding in the full experience plus offering smaller creator driven custom modes
---
I'm really enjoying the environmental stories. People complain that all of the story is delivered in holotapes and terminals, but my favorite quests in Fallout 4 were the ones where you pieced together stories from clues.
---
source plz?
---
Raiders know how to use PA and they‚Äôre not overly bright. It‚Äôs just an exoskeleton, I don‚Äôt think it would be super difficult to figure out. 
---
That takes insanely long at high levels
---
You don't know how Bethesda treats anything, because you don't work for Bethesda. And you haven't. I can say this. I've worked in publishing and I know what it takes to put out even a simple book.
---
However, that doesn't make me an expert on all aspects. I would never presume to suggest anything about how editing works, how it should work. Because all my work in publishing is on the design/art and production side of things. I know the whole process it takes to get a book from start to finish. But the only things I can speak on with a degree of surety. What happens once the design and production phase starts. Which does overlap with the editorial part. Which never ends, even once the book is printed. 
---
So whatever your job was in game development industry, it doesn't make you an expert on how a company works, unless you've actually worked for that company.
---
I've worked for the top two sci fi publishing companies in America. I've worked for the top educational textbook company (no longer the top), and several smaller educational/textbook companies. Every single one is different. Every single one has different concerns and focuses. 
---
And again, you aren't reading. I never once suggested this should be put in the game in any time frame. I didn't even suggest the game needed it. I just wondered if that the Atomic Shop item might mean they are going to put it in the game soon. 
---
You're the one that's selfish. Now shut up. I'm so tired of negative people like you crapping on anything that you don't like. The world is bigger that your small mind. 
---
It really doesn't.
---
What level are you?
---
Umm if you explore western and then hunters vile read the terminals it explains the whole story , not ok let that , but they then experimented on the mutants and chopped them up to pieces before bearing them in the tunnel in Emmet Mountain Disposal Site.
---
Me too. Cuz my wife won't play them with me :(
---
I've seen the crap you're talking about. I get it lol. I just didn't want it to seem like this was a little kid who couldn't understand what I'm saying they commented on. She's old enough to be developing thoughtful perspectives about things.
---
128 and I can't force myself to xp grind anymore 
---
Kudos to you for just typing all that out. 
---
Agreed! I played this with friends and we had a lot of fun. Lots of laughing about dumb things that happened/bugs/etc. Every time it would crash, someone would inevitably say, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!" and it was so stupid that it was funny. 
---
We all eventually stopped playing when the quests got too long and drawn out and just not possibly fun. 
---
But for around 50 hours? We had a lot of fun. I only paid $25 for the game, so that's a pretty good fun-for-the-money investment. 
---
And the amo is cheap to make. Only steel and lead required ...
---
Oh that‚Äôs right, that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt find BOS armour or Unclave officer suit eh , there‚Äôs also no responder outfits in the game at all right?
---
Yeah, that's not difficult. You can hunt large monsters and/or do events and you'll have a level.
---
Find yourself an Assassin's Gauss and you'll be set for mobs and griefers. I love mine ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Thanks, flaming Bethesda or asking for people to get fired just isn't the right way to go. I'm hoping this thread can drive the point home that we need more engagement from Bethesda. 
---
But man that's tough, I don't see much reason to play RDR2 online, but I was under the impression it was somewhat decent.
---
New cave to explore every 9 months, boyos
---
I got grill plans from my first queen fight
---
The generator spits out 8 cores per hour, but it can only hold 3 at a time. Empty it and go do something else for 20 minutes or so. 
---
Usually I'll claim the workshop, immediately power up the generator, and then start building the other resource collectors and stringing wires. A few minutes later the "defend" event will pop, and by the time I've finished that there's usually 3 cores ready to go. 
---
Grab them and hike over to the Landfill (I try to avoid fast travel to minimize the odds of a disconnect), claim that, and then defend it. By the time that defense event is finished the next batch of cores should be ready. After that, I typically just wander around cleaning out the various locations in the area (AMR Medical, Charleston Herald, etc) and collecting all the low level weapons to scrap for steel/wood, and pop over to the workshops every 20-30 minutes.
---
Level 250 is just Level 50 with more perk cards.  Not sure why you act like you're 238 levels more powerful.
---
This is a great idea. Load up the terminal (or bot) with the item you want to sell and set your price. When it sells you retrieve your caps. It's quick and simple.
---
Yeah, I have since learned my lesson
---
Have to agree with out. I've got countless hours in skyrim (400+ on ps3, ~500 hours on pc) and a ridiculous amount of time spent in the Fallout games. Well over 1000 hours in 4
---
Yeah. I get you there
---
76 is a whole other topic that all I will say is I think Bethesda does care about it but even though their parent company (Zenimax) has made a mmo (ESO) this is Bethesda first thing at anything like it at all and they realized they muffed up. They gave people what they promised, if not immediately, then eventually, now they just need a few more bug patches that don't make new bugs, a few optimizations, and the game will be on a fast track to glory.
---
I have seen the same problems you indicated.
---
Stealth/Rifleman builds were definitely nerfed. The first shot is still effective, but after that you are forced to abandon that playstyle and shift to something else to be effective.
---
Not having a TSE weapon, I was not impacted by the explosive damage nerf. However, having a TS is still a real ammo saver, but the nerfs made ammo more scarce. I have to run with the ammo loot perk and still don't come close to breaking even as I could prior to the patch.
---
My weapons did start degrading faster after the patch. I assume this was due to a prior patch correction being accidentally reversed. Even with max level degradation reducing perks, it is still very noticeable.
---
or add a feature where the person with the most caps automatically wins the duel. \^/s
---
I agree with most of it.  They need to work on all of that stuff.
---
But what they need more than any of that is:  **In-Game Surveys**
---
Right now the development cycle is:
---
Step 1 - Look at a few reddit posts.
---
Step 2 - Pick one of them at random to work on.
---
Step 3 - Code, code, code.........ignore all other feedback.
---
Step 4 - Release Patch, community is pissed.  Nobody is happy.
---
Step 5 - Act confused, return to Step 1.
---
Watch when Patch 6 comes out.  It'll be Scorchbeast changes and bug fixes.  You're going to see another community uproar after that one.
---
They have no concrete analytics on the PRIORITIES of the entire player base.  Like I would love to see the PVP mode, but ONLY after Player Vending, Larger Stash, and a few new events / harder events are in.
---
But my wants / needs might not reflect the priorities of the entire community.  Some players might want events first.  Others might want PVP first.  Until they gather the required DATA they're literally stabbing in the dark hoping "whatever" they do will get the community off their backs.  If they did In-Game Surveys they could correctly figure out, ok this first, this second, this third, etc, etc.  Nail down the things that are MOST important to the WHOLE community first.  Then work down the list on small niche items.
---
There's something creepy about anyone that has to spend time bashing ANYTHING they don't like, aren't doing, or gave up. 
---
There's something creepy about anyone that also defends hate culture people like you are trying to do.
---
It's creepy. You stop playing a game, but you still lurk around the forums taking time to tell others you stopped playing and how much you hate the game and how terrible it is. 
---
Yeah, that's not a very smart use of someone's life. 
---
Just like how your defending those people. Really? You think that needs defending? Do you see yourself as one of those people? Maybe some personal reflection on yourself. 
---
or that known issues thread?
---
I don't see why they would ban you for taking pictures. Their game was the one that put you in there. As far as I know there is nothing in the terms and conditions that say you can't take pictures inside unreachable vaults. Unless they ban you for exploiting, but it sounds like others had the same experience.
---
They should have an update to the map that includes new cities, possibly add npcs to the mix. Now that we have been released from the vault it would be nice to see the rebuilding process start to take shape in the form of new cities.  New factions could begin to form and collide. New npcs could be introduced as vaults open up.
---
I agree but not 25%
---
Maybe 5 or 10%. Or remove the penalty. You can equip a 3* wepaon with that mod and it gets a 4th star so thats op already. 
---
I sent this to my friend. She's been hunting diseases from day one. xD
---
 Its a terrible gun. My fully tweaked 10mm I don't use much anymore, is far better.
---
Game will be dead by the time you get to K because everyone has quit out of boredom.
---
Yeah, they can even use existing vendor code too.
---
Just add the ability for players to add / remove / set prices on items..........and withdraw caps.
---
This would give me something to do every day.  Something I could look FORWARD to doing.
---
I want to buy your stuff!  I want to sell you my stuff!
---
I didn't log in for 2 weeks and my hazmat suits were gone. Yes I had too, one normal and one prototype. Both were gone, one from my inventory and one from my stash. And that's just the things I notice...
---
128 isn't an insanely high level, level 300+ is however 
---
&gt;https://youtu.be/EKlqFSf2qDQ
---
I hear stories like this and I realize how super lucky I've been when it comes to high level players doing this. I had a lower level try to melee me once, I tried to ignore him but he wouldn't stop. I killed him and that's when I learned you don't get a bounty if it's self defense. I play on passive mode with all of my characters, I might play pvp if it were a separate map like how ESO does the wars where there are different servers for different levels. Maybe if you post in the Enclave sub? Those guys might team up with you. My boyfriend and I team with people sometimes. We play PVE though you run out of things to do in higher levels, they need to fix that. The game has huge problems but there are still some fun times to be had.
---
I bet you found a lot of things creepy
---
Thanks for the advice! That‚Äôs definitely what happened on the server I was on!
---
There was no core and no armor pieces on it at all.
---
A friend of mine found something similar at another location
---
Ahh yes, the grand exchange the last good thing to ever happen to RuneScape before it became what it is today. 
---
You don't need a roadmap for a sinking ship 
---
What's your short list of best prospects?
---
Yeah, this is coming from a player who quit after level 57ish and finishing most content but..
---
If you guys release decent roadmap and it looks promising it might pull people back into atleast keeping an eye on the game. 
---
PS4.
---
I'd like to get in on this action if possible lol 
---
Cavalier armor would be what you're looking for.
---
&gt; Walking along, not in combat,
---
when out of an orange colored sky...
---
FLASH, BANG, ALAKAZAM... wonderful you came by. &lt;3
---
I feel awkward teaming up with people because I feel like Ill be boring 
---
They would definitely have to get a handle on the duping first though don't you think?
---
What does it do? Sorry new to the legendary scene never bothers with them in fallout 4
---
Not really unless you like fishing and hunting. It is mildly amusing with friends for a while .. I am really surprised it isn't similar to GTA full of interesting missions and stuff, maybe it is still coming, but not sure why it has taken this long. Maybe they still trying to figure out how to make money from micro transactions in the same way.
---
4th time?  Strange that this has literally never happened to me, and I server hop very often.
---
Drills have some sort of damage buff on CAMP objects, they do serious damage very quickly
---
Same here, more hours put in, lots of server hopping, never ever lost an item.  But yes, I've come close, with the Feed the People hopper and vendors I can see people making a mistake and not catching it in time.
---
Yoo-hoo, it's me, hardcore fallout fan. Got fallout 1 and 2 back when they were new, then got 1, 2 and tactics when they came out on gog (and I guess got them again, now, on Bethesda launcher). Got the collectors edition of 3, the one in the lunchbox, then got all the dlc. Ultimate edition of NV. Got 4, and grabbed the season pass when the announced it. Who knows how many thousands of hours between them all over the past 20 and change years. Pre-ordered 76, played the beta, 300+ hours since launch. Still playing it. It ticks the same boxes that made fallout 4 my favorite; the map, exploration, scavenging are all too notch. Only now, i can share that exploration with my wife and mmo guild/clan/company mates, who also came over to 76.
---
I have crafted and scrapped a lot of pieces. 
---
Supplies are a challenge.  Also trying to build and scrap my way to a better radium rifle. 
---
Nitpick comment, but the max level on the Somerset Special is 45, you receive a Somerset Special of a less high level matching your current level's 5 increment for finishing Final Departure. Now i wish I had leveled up higher because it's a badass pistol that i use and fix all the time
---
"This weapon is a quest reward for Final Departure. As a quest reward, this pistol can drop at a much lower level than most .44 pistols, however it is able to scale up to level 45 depending on character's level when completing the quest."
---
I agree with this sentiment. Despite being multiplayer, Fo76 isn't a game that can be played ad infinitum. The content must run out eventually. But the amount of (non-repeatable) content in the game is huge enough to justify the 60$ purchase. I'm probably around 200 hrs and I have only Watoga and Enclave bunker left to explore. After that I'll drop the game, but without any hard feelings... 
---
It reduces incoming damage by a ton though. To the point where there isn't much risk. 
---
What flux do you need?
---
Ugh. 
---
I feel this is why so many people are upset with FO76.  We see its potential, and we are disappointed the game  isn‚Äôt close to that.
---
Up to +3 to all stats except endurance the higher your health is.
---
If it's got a second or third star those can vary.
---
You can server hop at a known PA spawn and literally get fusion cores every 2-3 minutes. Not every server hops will give you one, most will though, you probably can get 50 in 1 hour easily ..
---
Holy crap. Now that I think about it I was on selling runs and in Excavator PA whenever this has happened. Only has happened a few times but yes I was in PA every time I got this bug. 
---
 Thanks good to know
---
No way .. what colour was the tail ?
---
put the hub in the vault and as its own sever. Make a shop system where everyone's offers are shown in a big list of player offers
---
The disturbed dirt are those piles of dirt that molerats leave behind after they burrow. The one time I did this quest, the only dirt pile that had the junk (30 screws!) was inside the church on the opposite side from the pulpit. When you find the right one, you will get a prompt to search it (not a normal loot window at first).  It really sucks to do this at night and I've failed to find the dirt both times I tried this in the dark.
---
You can try selling on /r/market76 or /r/fo76bazaar 
---
I haven't tried but I'm 99% sure that you can't do it just because I think the game actually rebuilds the blueprint when you place it so all the rules have to work. Also I'm way over the blueprint cap anyway so meh. 
---
Did you actually get the full 7x7 to build? Because I think the height cap is around 4 or so (sometimes less depending on how you place the c.a.m.p.) So that last block might place but then you can't put anything on top of it. I'm pretty sure that 9x9 will exceed that limit unless you have some trick to lift your c.a.m.p higher first. 
---
tbh, I'm kinda over this whole mechanic.... its getting abused too much (see posts on completely floating camps) I can't imagine they're going to let it stay. I'm probably rebuilding somewhat soon. 
---
There is a lot of hate. In some ways rightfully s. In many ways,  you should be aware many of the negative posts are a minority of players. I personally think the game has a lot of potential and I enjoy playing. Whether Bethesda games Austin can live up to it anytime soon... idk. 
---
Lol always reboot first ;-)
---
There actually are a lot of idiots, also liars and people who jump on bandwagons.  This sub has a history of people making up bugs, and then suddenly people are all ranting about a bug that never existed.
---
I can't take people seriously here anymore.
---
Must have been prepatch because explosives ate every nerf last patch for a cumulative -65% damage
---
&gt;I can‚Äôt wait for E3, Howard cannot dismiss this whole thing as another joke like he did last time
---
He won't. He'll take it on the chin because what the fuck are we going to do about it?
---
I have never seen this in 500 hrs, but then again, ive never seen a TSE either.
---
There is one! Theres an event in the Toxic Valley, the one where you fix the air purifiers. If you're (agility?) Is 5 you can bypass looking for whatever it needs.
---
Yeah i though that was kinda stupid that it says 8+ players recommended and squads max out at 4...what happens when they release the PvP servers and everyone is able to attack everyone by default?
---
All good, was just using an expression. I'm not mad and it wouldn't matter if I was : ) Uninstall and reinstall? Yep. Last patch broke ultrawide and thus wouldn't launch. So that's fixed, but this stuff goes missing issue happened before and after that event.
---
How many people are having this problem? No idea, not just me. Not one or two or ten, its more, and it should not happen. Maybe I'll search again and count them up. 
---
Ye I still need it. Using a until rifle for it but I'd prefer it on combat rifle
---
What are ya, some sort of super mutant
---
I think you can put a resource extractor on top of it and then it won‚Äôt hurt you 
---
Brown! 
---
Roadmap? More like a roadblock.
---
&gt;The Roadblock is coming soon, don't worry, as we expect to continue make changes to the game in the future. We are excited to tell you that later this year we are planning to remove fun completely. This is a long effort as it takes time to make sure all players are disappointed equally.
---
Hunting rifle I mean. But need it for combat rifle
---
My dad is 48 and I'm 28. We have gone through the same stuff and miss the good old wow days.
---
This post just reminds me how rare and awesome father and son gaming is with a good 70s dad lol :)
---
Unfortunately that is where I got mine so I can't tell you where else to look
---
Not buy their games, fo76 made it certain casuals won‚Äôt pre order the next game
---
I'm over 1000 hours in "the forest" and trying to teach my 5&amp;6 year olds to play
---
what are your dmg specs on that?
---
I'm so sad I wasn't playing video games for the earlier releases. I hear so many of you talk about how awesome the stories and world was in the early games. I started with Fallout 4 so I never got to experience the games made by the other studio. I heard they re released those games for pc, wish they would for PS4. It would be something to do while we wait for more content. 
---
Charleston Herald building
---
Bog Town
---
Sugargrove
---
National Radio Something Something 
---
Rinse, repeat.
---
Yeah, but the cave is very snug, so my idea was to utilize without the extractor. Well, I'll try building around it maybe, see how it goes.
---
The funny thing is you can completely circumvent the story and start the enclave missions at any point. I launched my first nuke before I did any brotherhood missions 
---
Wow that was lucky to see that, I think they pretty rare now days, especially during winter, I will grab my bike and come with you.
---
And what do the +3 stats actually do as I know it doesn't mean more perks
---
&gt;Instead, they punish the NEXT game out by that studio.
---
It's not going to happen. Most of the people claiming they're done with Bethesda will all come back when the next great thing is launched. Sure there will be some principled people out there but the masses will return.
---
&gt; They currently have ZERO AI fish (models, animations, attack damage, defense) and they may not have the mechanics in place to confine fish to water areas.
---
They have plenty of fish models, AI, and mechanics that they could pull from Skyrim, just like the dragons/scorchbeasts. They just have to re-skin them into radiated fish instead of slaughterfish.
---
&gt; People were asking for separate pvp servers early on.
---
Yeah, especially before the game came out (then again, lots of people were just wrong before the game came out, "400 stash size is more than anyone needs", "respecs shouldn't be added, stat choices should matter", "junk doesn't have weight in stash").
---
Then the game came out, we got to try PvP, and most people realized how bad it is.
---
Cavalier reduces damage u take by 15% when you are sprinting. It is weak modifier
---
..now that it's mentioned though, it sure would be cool to have one! :P
---
Theres a mod for fallout 4. Bunker living? Anyway you slap a bunker door on the ground (like the one behind that house in Sanctuary Hills) and it spawns a new internal cell that acts like a settlement.
---
Its possible to implement but let's be realistic here...
---
The Tesla Cannon from FO:NV OWB, maybe
---
hah, good luck to your friend! Being a mutated plague-walker, I know the feels of chasing down diseases. "You are suffering from Flap Limb" --nay, I'm _thriving_ because of it! More! :P
---
Would have been great to meet some survivors, to break the "I don't care because I know that they will be dead, like the 10 quest givers before". That's why I hope in the future update they'll add some NPC from outside WV, that you can help to settle. 
---
Don't know if you've played it but given your list of games, try out Battletech sometime.  Its PC only though.
---
O cool. I was wondering what they were good for.  Does that work on gun turrets in the wild. too?
---
Sh*tpost tbh
---
Not doing the whole mutations bit... So i guess i'm safe for now
---
It never existed.
---
No, i did it accidentaly, whole camp broken, just frames were there. No bounty nothing.
---
&gt; 3.25% of players have earned this on Xbox.
---
And I boosted that achievement just so I could 100% it before I stopped playing. I got like 4 wanted kills before that and never any duels/murders.
---
Yeah. But in in FO4 you can follow elements of the story and still complete it. You can't decide to main, say, Railroad. Or Institute. Or whatever. In FO76 there is one story. And it isn't much of one. And once you finish it there isn't anything.
---
Why go to the trouble? In Texas, and in most if not all other states, every employee is presumed to be an at-will employee.  This means that you can be fired "at the will" of your employer. 
---
The don't need some complicated evil plan to justify it.
---
Got a 1* instigating I've been using with hopes of getting a 2* or 3*, but frankly if ya hit anything in the head with it they're going down in one shot. 
---
From the few numbers that we do have that I have seen something like less than 10% of players have a Queen kill so this seems unlikely. 
---
I plan on getting Fo76 soon so any free DLC is better than paying imo. I think they should add human NPC's with every DLC the longer the game stays active. It would show a state rebuilding and people flocking to that state as a result of that. 
---
Where can I learn this power?
---
Bethesda: What's that? Nerf Ultracite Ammo, you say? Well, if you insist!
---
Why do you think our fusion cores deplete so quickly? Were dont know how to use it *properly*. We can still use it but we are wildly inefficient
---
I'm sorry for your loss. You don't have to meet someone in person for them to be an important part of our life. I have a lot of friends I've met due to gaming. While most have been through gaming in person, I've made a few online and consider them just as much friends.
---
I hope you are able to connect with others in your games.
---
Does that mean it is directly below the purple glitched texture on the road due east of Whitespring?  A friend theorized that the textures were the developer room entrance.
---
Well, it depends on how they are defining DLC. 
---
For example, adding stuff to the current game, doesn't seem like DLC to me. Even if it's new quests and such. There's 8 TNT domes at the Black Mountain Ordnance Works. But currently only a couple of them can be opened. So I can see them adding quests that let you open more of those. 
---
I can see new features being added to the game. 
---
But not really being considered DLC. 
---
So it's possible to get new game mechanics and quests without new zones.
---
I there's definitely room on the map for new things west of the river. Even a little bit east. I think any new content that adds new zones, is probably, at best, 6 months or more off. From this point. They have a lot of tweaks and fixes that should be addressed first. 
---
I really shouldnt be posting stuff like this from my account tied to my roleplay guild but...  I will. Just understand that i do not speak for the Kingdom of Gadlantis but i speak for myself. 
---
As someone who is a "camp griefer" i wanna let you know why your plan is stupid. I dont think there is ANY griefing in this game. You guys are just in denial of the mechanics. I will use your word, "griefer" in my response below, however i do not consider it an accurate term. 
---
The POV of a "camp griefer":
---
1. I want you to find my camp and try to fight me there. 
---
2. We dont have fancy decon showers that require flux to fix ( I avoid breaking them as well, i understand they are tough to repair all)- i do however use them to coax people into pvp. "Fight me or i break your shower". 
---
3. "Griefers" are rich. We are junk rich. PvP is the best means of farming junk in the game. 
---
4. Your plan will have this effect: disappointment. When a "griefer" gets a chance for some pvp at their own camp, its a treat. We consider pvp when we build them. Its a chance to test. Its fun. Its home court. 
---
Your going to end up compiling a list for someonething that takes a "griefer" 0 time or energy to fix. We are junk rich.  36 wood and steel + 5 gears, springs, screws to fix my base, then you dont even fight. Boring. Thats nothing to me. No emotional attachment, no rage. I would just be disappointed ans confused as to why you did what you did. We want to pvp. 
---
To add: what you are doing is targeted harassment. What these "griefers" are doing is not. You have a list, a motive, and an odd emotional fixation on these people. The second you chase someone to a server, thats harassment. I dont chase people into other servers. It's against the rules dude. You may be asking for a ban. 
---
If i choose to shake down people in game, smash camps, takeover whitesprings or whatever. Thats doesnt specifically target anyone. Im just roleplaying as a raider or pvping whoever i come across. You on the other hand are breaking the rules with your odd fetish you just posted. 
---
Dont chase people around into other servers. Not cool man. Not cool. 
---
Get it?
---
Thats just what i read on here have yet to c it but ive run out of stuff to do so ima carry on i got some sweet outfits so far but no pa paint
---
Unfortunately with game design, you have to learn the basics of ALL aspects of what it does to be effective.
---
Can a level design person just terraform a world without knowing the min/max climb of both characters and vehicles?  Nope, otherwise all that work is worthless because the players can't climb the terrain they made.
---
Can a coder just say "damage AOE arc here" without matching that to what the animator is doing?  Nope, otherwise the Scorchbeast queen could do no damage to targets hit by the wing animation because they didn't see what the min / max animation range was.
---
Now here's the kicker, can you have a Socrchbeast Queen do all of the proper AOE damage arc with a corresponding animation on a 45 degree incline of a mountain..........that brings together coding, animation, and level design all together........and makes it even more complex.  The answer right now for Bethesda is NO.  How can I know that????  Because it's all game design.  It's all integrated.  Hence, why the SBQ fights are all on a level plane around the Fissure Prime site.  It reduces the amount of coding, animation, and level design needed.
---
It's the same in EVERY game engine.  Unreal, Frostbite, Fallout.  Different code, yes.  Same mechanics all of the time.
---
So no, it does not vary by company.  Bethesda develops games just like ALL companies develop games.
---
A min/max climb is the same in Fallout as it is in Unreal.  A min/max AOE damage and animation arc are the same.  Maybe if you had some development experience you could offer your insight.
---
What Bethesda has shown us is they are pitifully bad at prioritizing and implementing things.  Patch 5 fixed 100+ bugs and introduced 20 more that were as bad or worse.  Patch 5 showed they have no idea what nerfs and buffs should be.  Patch 5 didn't include any new content the community was ALREADY promised.
---
So adding more pointless things like fishing to their already overloaded and overwhelmed team isn't helping.  Let them focus on things that they've already PROMISED before you keep pestering them for more things.
---
Stat modifiers don't allow you to equip more perks in that category.  But each stat has affects your character.  You can see what they do in your SPECIAL list.  STR increases melee damage and carry weight, CHR gets better prices, INT lets you craft items with better starting CND, Luck lets you find items with better starting CND,  END increases your health and disease resistance, etc, etc.  That's not all the effects, but just a few.
---
100%
---
Sounds like they are going to fix it in the next patch.   (Well, it sounds like they think they will fix it in the next patch... but they may end up breaking it more.  Now instead of putting your nearly irreplaceable stuff into the hopper, it will just delete your character for you...)
---
Cafeteria trays in Morgantown and Watoga high schools. The cat house between Morgantown High School and Bolton Greens has a ton of cat bowls. Hit up Sugar Grove for tons of cigarettes and pens. Search every cigarette machine for an almost guaranteed 1 or 2 cigarette packs. If you have plastic tagged, you shouldn't have trouble finding it. I have it and lead tagged for shotgun ammo and always end up with 2x as much plastic as lead.
---
1. remove ceilig above bugged part
---
2. place it
---
3. place the ceiling back
---
4. place soemthing on the uper celling to prevent teleport up if ur camp location is ocupied and u need relog to get back u camp.
---
I need field medic and good grief. I am available anytime today CST. PSN: achillies14 would love to help you out!!!
---
Yay bikes! I can bike really really really a long way. 
---
 Never seen it in 500+ hours on PC.
---
Thank goodness. It's about time.    I'm glad, but damn it was a long time coming.
---
Yeeeeeeeah my wife and I discovered Far Cry 5 (co-op!) and haven't touched FO76 since. We only liked it because we liked exploring together. And with New Dawn coming out... welp...
---
I always hit up Camp Venture when I turn in Technical Data.  Found Deep Pocketed Marine plans and Marine Armor Torso/Leg plans.  No BOS yet.
---
Exactly! I went to West Tek to take on groups of super mutants and encountered the exact same problem when lobbing MIRV, Nuka, or Nuka Quantum grenades. It is pretty bad when high damage AOE weapons are less effective than other weapon types.
---
I did read on another topic where someone expressed feelings that damage resistance values were a significant part of the problem in comparison to FO4.
---
I‚Äôm on right now. I have good grief already but will help you with that too.
---
What has happened to him? Jumped outta window upon connection lost?
---
I know you're teasing, but for others that may not be familiar with this bug:   The screen doesn't show you any of your inventory.  It shows just quest items.  As you are putting quest items into the hopper, all of a sudden a piece of your real inventory shows up and can easily be put into the hopper by accident if you are just hammering through the list like any normal person would do with a tedious task.
---
I tell ya, I've been playing Lone Wanderer since the Beta and I still have no interest in forming a team but gosh dang it I do kinda like it when I run into another solo player just out doing their thing and just ever so briefly we work together toward a common goal, loot the poor dead bastards we killed oh so efficiently, wave goodbye and go about our merry way.
---
Great info. Thanks a lot. I'll be sure to pass it along.
---
Ok, I just logged on with the wrong character, as usual so I'll jump off and check
---
I would hand you that truth regarding Robot Armor, but not Trapper. It's so specifically crafted using boat and harbor materials. Disciple and Operator Armor is WAY more likely to be coincidentally crafted in different places/times in comparison, considering it's a bunch of metal sheets welded together.
---
And pack armor is just cloth with stuffed animals and bones attached to it, both of which are in abundance in Appalachia (The same exact "souvenir" bears and sloths used on the armor are even in the game!).
---
The game is supposed to run for years with content updates advancing the game world.  You are simply impatient and want years of effort up front.
---
sounds like it would actually happen in fallout lol
---
" The problem is that "
---
they already got their money... so its not problem.
---
Weird. I've completed it every time I swim out to the island. 
---
&gt; It makes me wonder how everone could die in the first place
---
So you haven't followed any of the story?
---
I guess big brotha is watching you constantly
---
I didn't order this. I think Bethesda did a terrible job on this and made it worse in how they handled it.
---
Most people were told it would take like 4-6 months to get the bags. Which to me says, they are being made from start in china, and will likely sit in a shipping crate, waiting till the freight boat is filled, before getting here. 
---
And there's a part of me that thinks this. The bags might still be crap. They might be poorly made. They might get packed wrong. Who knows. The ship might even sink. That happened with Lego once. Whole shipment sunk.
---
Anyway. Once the bags arrive and people start getting them in about 3-4 months, I have a gut feeling it's just going to be another punch in the gut for them. 
---
 Nope, it'll still damage you.
---
Me too man me too. Dont know what the damage mod is for power armor but it must be pretty insane. 
---
You are right to be skeptical, and you're not alone. I get it, you suspect haters are making this up.  I dunno how to address that other than check my post history for hat3rz comments. And others think its all the user's inputs and thus their fault. Didn't think it would be a struggle to lay out first person accounts and the argument that UI/UX and server stability is the root. 
---
There's is one that gives you a damage resistance bonus the higher your health, vanguards I think it is
---
Good let's pick up some pizza along the way and have a picnic somewhere, that will be cool
---
i traded with so many ppl just from here..whats great is that u can use the chat option here because the psn chat is mehhh ive even roamed thru the wasteland with a few redditors..i would love an actual hub we can just go to
---
Alright il have a look strange it won't let u have end as that seems the most useful.... So is it really worth getting the armor over power armor to fight other player I can see the armors effects are useful but don't see how in a combat situation 
---
I had the 'scrapping from the wrong menu' in the BETA twice. Not since. And I built hundreds of leather armour pieces for a couple of experiments before scrapping every single one as fast as possible (testing how to learn armour mods).
---
Unfortunately the abundance of hyperbole in the criticism of this game, making it out to be the worst thing of all time, and thus the terrible sales numbers for the game have pretty much guaranteed that the full potential never be realized.
---
Well I still hope Bethesda will continue to invest some money and time to this, you can guarantee that it will be a fraction of what would have been put into it if the game had been a resounding success. You don't need a degree in business to recognize that. I'm sure they'll continue to support it as long as it pays its bills through the Atom store, but any hopes for large-scale new development are pretty thin.  It's a shame really, I think this game had some issues for sure, but was not nearly as bad as it is portrayed to be.
---
I started reloading mine back in November, should be done tomorrow
---
Stockpiling perk points when leveling seems to the be the viable option given the poor set of circumstances. Moving points over as they are gained results in a weakened playstyle over the leveling duration in contrast of changing from a previously effective build to a currently/hopefully effective build.
---
I run unarmed/explosive and it used to work wonders, now I have to just jump in and punch everything to death and it isn't fun. I did the heart of the swamp event last night and the group of feral ghouls walked past all 3 of my grenades. One had crippled legs. one. That would have taken care of at least 3 if not 4 or 5 before but now it just makes me long for the days of high risk high reward weaponry. 
---
Side not, grenades will still one shot you though, so let that sink in.
---
I got that disease once and didn't even realize it was special.   Wow.  
---
Because you are those children, not the people who are already dead before the game starts.  In the movie, most of the world was already dead, just like the people outside the Vault.  You're performing bad comparisons.
---
After 196lvls. I played beta, that was mess like oblivion. Now we have skyrim. It is little buggy, but it works.
---
I can have workshop, send three nukes, kill three last bosses and server is still on, here i am defending that workshop i took hour ago.
---
Honestly, I would just be happy if they fixed the content they have so far . . .
---
Only communication I've had is my replacement bag is confirmed, and that it'll be dispatched anywhere between May &amp; July. Be nice if they also include a bonus code or two for exclusive skins or such for all the B.S, but just waiting like the other thousands for it to happen.
---
Well I'm on PC and I can help you with the instruments.  My camp is just up the hill from you (on top of the cliffs).
---
I've seen people suggest several times, there should be a mailbox type collection spot. Any loot you don't pickup while going through an instance or boss fight ends up at the mail box for you to take later. They did this in Destiny 2, and it saved me from losing some stuff i ended up using fairly often. 
---
There would be a basic cap on the amount of items you can have stored for later in the mailbox, and a time period you could collect before they're sent back into the void, making room for other stuff you leave lying around. Probably not feasible for them to do something like this but it would be great to see.
---
That horse kinda left the barn already.....lol
---
They still haven't killed 100% of the dupe methods.  Even if they do, the dupers will be hard at work finding other ways to do it.  Every multiplayer survival game has cheaters.
---
Want to know what would really suck for the dupers?  :)
---
Fallout isn't defined by the game format, but rather the lore and game world it inhabits.  It's not unusual for games to expand to different genres.
---
Not to mention, Todd frickin' told you all this stuff up front, and that it was an experimental new game for them.  But you decided to ignore him and complain that it wasn't what you had made up in your head.
---
sad but true :( At least we can move the points now though right? baby steps.
---
I'm sure a roadmap exists somewhere. The question is whether or not that roadmap is being followed at this point. I started playing about a month ago when there was more community optimism and Bethesda participation on this forum. The latest patch killed both of those things. 
---
So while we can't be 100% sure, we can use our powers of deduction here. Our once active, transparent developer has gone almost radio silent when the game is in a really bad place. The developer is a large business that thoroughly understands PR and does not "accidentally" forget to do it. There are 2 highly anticipated loot based progression games coming out very soon. 
---
Take it as you all will. I understand you want to be optimistic about a game you've heavily invested in, just don't let it cloud your analysis. 
---
Last time I heard something about a roadmap, they said something about artistic team working on it. 
---
So... I guess bethesda employee are really, really slow at work... I don't know... or they simply don't know what to put in it.  
---
I got my email when I sent in my support ticket. It said my canvas bag will be sent in 4 to 5 months. In the mean time they added 500 Atoms to my account. 
---
Have another one: MY story.
---

---
Once you hit 20 you pretty much hit level cap. After that its just grey cosmetics.    
---
Well sure, if you suppose that they are entirely satisfied with the amount of money they have already received for the game and are not interested in receiving more, either from MTXs from existing players or actually moving new copies of the game.
---
I've had this too a couple of times. It helped to wait for a bit without doing anything after rejoining, but yeah, it definitely sucks when it happens. 
---
Cavalier gives -15% DMG taken while sprinting (it's only possible on 3 star legendary pieces) with all pieces you can get -75% DMG while sprinting. Only legendary effect that scale with high up is vanguard and it gives you+35 resistance at full hp. Only unyielding is giving bonus to all stats the lower your health.
---
Do u know if the armor with the effect is a better thing to use over power armor in a pvp combat situation 
---
I had seen a few bags of ammo and other obviously discarded things dropped in a very near by area.  I picked them up because there was quite a bit of stuff I could use.   Outside the door I saw another bag on the ground so I stupidly assumed it was another discard.  I should have realized that the bag contained junk, but in the moment I just thought:  Oh, neat, they left some junk too.  Right after I emptied the bag I saw someone running towards me.  Crap.    I dig through my inventory and drop a bunch of stuff.  I know some of what I picked up but I have no clue how much or what other stuff might have been in the bag.  I use the "come here" emote and the guy comes back.  He gives me a thumbs up and goes on his way.  I hope I gave him enough stuff back.  I felt bad I had taken his junk.  It wasn't intentional.  I was on a discarded bag-picking spree...
---
This is basically F4 survival except with no sleep and fast travel.
---
Unless you want permadeath, but then i have no idea how popular that could ever be.
---
If Zenimax cared enough to polish ESO then they'll do the same with F76. Cosmetic shops make more money than their single player games ever did, as long as the atom shop makes money they'll push the game
---
Modders are awesome??
---
What?
---
Don't prime receivers hit all scorched for higher damage not only sbq? 
---
Okay, then I'll just wait. Thanks!
---
Apparently chameleon is bugged now and causing perma-invis. It happened to me too, a buddy pointed it out. 
---
This happens very often for me when I first start the game on PS4.
---
It seems to be related to me moving my character or opening my pipboy right away when the game first loads, but isn't actually done loading.
---
The only thing I can do in game when it happens is open my map (Options button) and move my cursor and fast travel to a location.
---
Only fix is for me to quit the server and rejoin a new one.  At which point I have to wait 60+ seconds after my character loads in to make sure the game is actually done loading before trying to move or do anything.  Else it may happen again.
---
Seems that after my game loads correctly it will not happen again until I completely close the game and start it fresh (usually the next day).
---
Me too, now I'm starting a new character with a few decent starter weapons/armor with the goal of exploring new areas I missed and going slower so I can catch more story.
---
I would much rather have gotten Fallout 5, but this game is quite enjoyable.  It's not a single-player CRPG but it never pretended to be.
---
You got that pasta sauce??
---
This game is literally a F4 multiplayer but in a different map.
---
Right, for the combat rifle I can fit auto .38, critical .38 and precise .38 receivers
---
PC master race, bud
---
That's pretty much what I said. However that will still be a fraction of what could have been done if this game had been a resounding success. I'm sure they had plans for both scenarios ... And we will definitely be getting Plan B
---
I agree. The only small tweak I wish they had done was to make some of the stories into quests. 
---
I've stumbled upon things here and there completely out of order or missed stories completely. 
---
I dont mind the reading or listening but at least if they were actual side quests there would be some linear movement to the story and I think that's what's missing for me. 
---
There also seems to be set ups for things that should have been quests but weren't. For example, theres a crashed space station, trailer with a UFO nut and a tin foil hat, an alien blaster and in a separate place rounds for the gun and notes. This screams to me that it should have been a great story to tell and a quest to get those items but it wasnt. I wish they had written more. 
---
Since the boosts are Health-level related, it would probably cause issues if they increased the Health stat as well.  Seems like they took the easy way out of the issue and just made the boosts not affect END.
---
they reopened requests until end of march, i believe. They likely wont even start manufacturing them until they have a solid figure on how many they need to make. 
---
Why would i want to make you mad? 
---
I want to PvP. Alot of us do. We take workshops to signal to other players we are ready to PvP. 
---
And here you are fucking up that whole system pvpers have. 
---
After i gank you, id go back to your workshop and claim it. You would know where i am. Come take it. Its pvp man
---
There is no greifing at the workshop. Just crappy mechanics. You can shoot me while i find you out in the world you know.... My name will be red...
---
People like you, who take workshops but dont want to PvP. Or take them but dont engage in the wasteland when i hunt you down.   Its you guys who arent following the rules. You cant make up your own ediquette. 
---
Play within the parameters we are given.
---
Ok. My username is DARKVAMPIREKING
---
That's already a thing, and so was elder scrolls before but we don't talk about that one anymore... the hype's on the new one!
---
Awesome! I can be on in a few minutes of you're available. My username is SoraD98
---
I can't remember exactly what the verbadum line was, but Sarah Lyons mentioned something that withhout training it was just a slow moving hunk of junk. 
---
I mean sure if you look at something long enough you can figure it out. Assuming most raiders post war had blue collar jobs, a few of em coulda been mechanics or something and with enough tinkering figured it out.
---
But if we look at the setting, we are just educated ppl with relevant skills in rebuilding infrastructure. Thats like if you saw a military fighter jet and just jumped in and flew it with no training. 
---
I know from a game play perspective not being able to instantly jump into a frame might be frustrating, but i wish they adress this somehow.
---
Like you can use a frame cuz heavy lifting will be required to rebuild and technology could be broken so heres an exo suit as you leave the vault and proper training on how to use it, and then you'd learn how to properly attach the power armour to it later (with raider power armour needing no training but being objectively the worst of all sets)
---
your laughable ignorance doesn't dictate reality, bro.
---
I stopped playing over a week ago. I love the fallout series but 76 way too repetitive. I only get an hour to play a day so it just isn't worth my time anymore. The hoping that Bethesda would make the game better is a lost cause to me. The PVP update was my last straw, they just don't listen. Bethesda just doesn't care and it is a loosing battle anyway. The game is likely dead to me and I don't see why Bethesda would pump significant money into fixing it.   
---
With Metro Exodus coming out on Friday I am looking forward to that. 
---
Had a similar issue on XB1, opened my Pip immediately upon arriving after fast travel.  Closed, restarted, (Did the EXACT SAME THING AGAIN BECAUSE, patience. Closed, restarted) and it worked, and then later didn‚Äôt seem to be an issue, as I was constantly opening pip boy too fast after screen opening
---
There is a lot of content.  You are just small-minded.
---
Can do either I don't mind
---
You get resources from scrap mobs are the obstacles? Was that not abundantly clear?
---
I should probably get used to it. Thanks for the info!
---
Intentional or not, weapon durability was severely affected by the last patch, I have a 3* Furious, Explosive, Faster while aiming, Gatlin, with a 500 round Magazine that I have used in numerous SBQ battles (3 in a row without repairs) that since the patch cannot get through a single magazine without breaking (No changes to perks).
---
I have several 3* energy weapons, but do not use them, as I'm not built for it (They are for Sale)
---
Level 68 Super mutants required 2 shots (torso) with a TSE Handmade pre patch, but now require 7-8, I have also experimented with changing out the magazine for better armor penetration, but it has little effect.
---
My Mutants Exp, Hunting Rifle was a OHKiller pre patch but now does little more than a BOS Recon rifle.
---
I have an instigating Handmade that works well when Sneak isn't screwed up, but that a real crap shoot lately.
---
They "soon" a lot of things, but they've pretty much always delivered!
---
I may add you as well. I typically play with my bf (level 36), but when he's not able to, I'm by myself, sneaking around lol. I'm just level 20 though and new to gaming. I'm chakra_bender on PSN.
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer not sure if the devs are looking into this yet, but it is a frequent bug and appears to be related to other players being within the vicinity.  The more players in the area, or who have tagged a target for loot, the longer you have to wait for the item to show up.
---
This is very interesting, thanks for your insight! Do you have any thoughts on the observations that point to servers having some kind of seeded loot table? IE Individual servers appearing to have a set pool of legendary types they draw from, so rather than running an algorithm and pulling from the thousands of possible legendary types/secondary effects they just randomize a portion of the total pool first and then draw from the abridged version. For example, my friend and I looted the SBQ a while back and we both got the exact same 3* armor piece with the same secondary effects and everything. Then later on that server I got the same armor piece with the same prefix but different secondary effects. 
---
You're right about the nuke table not checking for damage dealers, on PS4 I can also grab hardened mass or high radiation fluids from things I definitely didn't tag. I hadn't really thought about the "why" before, though.
---
I've also noticed, particularly with the SBQ, that sometimes her loot appears one way when it first loads in and then quickly changes to an entirely different set of loot. Could have something to do with trying to load in a regular enemy vs a nuke enemy vs a legendary nuke enemy, though I don't see this as often (or maybe ever) on WS glowing ones.
---
Except it's not a single-player CRPG and never pretended to be, so comparing it to those makes you look silly.  You should have listened to Todd when he told you what this game would be, instead you made stuff up in your head and let yourself down.
---
Why would I play Fallout 76 when I can play Apex instead? Or Overwatch? Our fucking Fallout 4?
---
Too add, agility is your total number of AP and luck effects how fast your crit refills.
---
With 20-30 in both stats with unyielding you can live in Vats.

Zealots wood...all natural baby

Sweet! It looks like discord server is the way to go. I've never used discord before, but it's a mostly voice chat host? People could team up cross platform for expeditions and even though not everyone would be seeing the exact same things - kind of like two connected teams exploring the same world in different dimensions - they could still discuss and research the same areas together. Is that how it works? If it is that sounds kinda cool actually - could have a few together on xbox and a few together on pc ...

To that end I've set up a discord server called FO76 Archaeological Society. Since I've never used discord before I'm a little uncertain how people find it or are added. I have a link to the server - should I post that here? Or send it to y'all? There are two people on xbox and two on pc so far. If someone sends me their discord tag I could add them directly from there as well I guess.
---
Would be cool to get u/33Games looped in as well, and some of those other comment posters on that thread.
---
Or in publishing terms...........how would you like it if all your customers came in and threw suggestions at you like:
---
You should make books 6 feet tall with 1,000 font size text.
---
You should make books that will fit into my top left shirt pocket with 0.25 size text.
---
You should make books that are tri-lingual.  So you have 3 different translations stacked on top of eachother in the same exact book.
---
You should make books that are for people with smaller or larger hands.
---
You should make books where half the pages are right side up, and the other half are right side down.
---
Try to take one title and do all of that.
---
Eventually, you get enough of those requests, and enough pissed off customers, then see how easy your job is.
---
CHILL, let them work.  Quit throwing stuff like this in their lap.
---
Are you listening Bethesda? This guy happens to be pretty smart. üòä
---
I do have Chameleon armor, yes.
---
Start playing RDR2 instead
---
To be fair, the box price is not a "heavy" investment for me.  I actually really enjoyed the game, and was minimally affected by the bugs. As were most of my friends playing it.  The problem now is there's just nothing left to do...finished the quests, explored the map, build cool bases, killed the SBQ bunches of times, got cool guns...what next?
---
All in all, the content drought is a bigger issue.  If you could somehow have an honest poll of every single FO76 player, lack of content would score higher than bugs.
---
You are right, halifaxes. The trading thing, remember that? I do, got us all riled up. I'm not trying to stir the pot, and I don't hate the game (quite the opposite). You can be confident in not believing me or other people until this happens to you. Maybe it won't, and frankly I hope it doesn't. 
---
You haven't unequipt Gunsmith, have you?
---
I also have a Gatling with increased speed _with_ martial artist and I can go through quite a few drums.
---
TS has an impact on durability.
---
Awesome! I got a message from another person too on xbox, so that's 3 of us. I guess as I figure out this discord stuff we can get rolling. 
---
Get Ammosmith, you make 80% more ammo
---
Upvote just for the title.
---
Whatever with sentinel modifier.
---
Maybe metal as it have biggest balistic rezistances.

I've played Elite Dangerous just fine for years while dropping 10 or 20 bucks every few months to pimp my rides. This is exactly the same funding model. Nothing in the Atom store is necessary. It is all cosmetic. It's all optional pointless bullshit that you can buy if you want to support future development for this game.
---
People have been saying Elite was a dying game for years, too.
---
You can make new builds, I guess
---
Well the choice is yours, all I need is the materials and a small payment of 1 million caps. Not really, I'll do it for free if you have the mats. 
---
Time to come join us on the war front over in r/battlefieldV soldier.
---
I personally didn‚Äôt feel like me untill, I was 30. 
---
The lack of replayability is why I stopped in early January.  I have 3000+ hours on FO4 and over 2200 on Skyrim.  Those are replayable.
---
I can confirm this as well. It usually happens when I exit excavator power armor. Wild fluctuations in capacity. I was finding that I needed to be about 100lbs under the mentioned capacity, whatever that ended up being, 280, 295, 300, 305, 310, 390, before the icons would turn off and I could fast travel again. 
---
It seems super random to the point I‚Äôm having a hard time tracking what might be causing it. I‚Äôm also using a bunch of weight reduction perks so I imagine that‚Äôs playing a major roll in this but even un equipping them does not help the issue when it arrives. 
---
Heavy Metal can reach the highest physical damage resist, and as most damage is physical probably the best. Heavy Combat is more balanced, it has less physical resist but it has higher energy resists making it preferable for an all round defense.
---
Or the suicide one...
---
Yeah but ESO had a rougher start than 76 did, and look what they're doing with it now. They'll never abandon their IP and own up to a failure, it would look too bad. It took a whole year before ESO saw its first major dlc and that was... A PvP oriented release with the Imperial City add-on
---
Given all the issues with Mole-rat spawning, maybe that's part of the issue.  One or more just don't show up = no pile.
---
On my main I have most of all the cards maxed out so I can change to different builds 
---
How sad is Fallout76 where those of us with ocd are excited to get elusive diseases in game because that‚Äôs the closest thing to content there is?

Its not the advice you're looking for - but my advice would be to take it slow and enjoy the journey.  You can easily get to mid 30s before you even really need to think about power leveling and for a first run thru I wouldn't even rush it at that point.
---
If you want a better start - for adhesives you can plant tato, corn and mutfruit in your camp.  Power armor can be used starting from lvl 15 - Raider, which you have to go further north on the map to find accessible ones.  You can use an empty power armor frame before that - still provides some decent protection but probably not as worthwhile given you'll have to look for some fusion cores to keep it running.
---
Early game - the hunting rifle is probably the easiest weapon to learn mods for, and do decent damage with.  Always keep a melee weapon as well handy.  Combat shotguns are a good option for extra punch once you level up a bit.  Heavy guns should be reserved for later on, don't even worry about them till you're 40-50.
---
Just pray it doesn't happen when you disconnected at Sunnytop Station and 2 Scorchbeasts spawned when you reconnected to a new server and you cannot hide/move and are stuck wearing plain old armor.
---
Well that cave is a great source of acid, and directly above it is a lead deposit.  If you position your camp properly, you can get both.
---
What you may be interested in is the cave due west of there.  Walk along the cliff face and look for a white board.  Then look to the left of it to find the entrance.
---
There is another similar cave at the very top of the map, north of the ammo factory.
---
Not sure, I always scrapped them before, but saw a video on YouTube the other day with someone using one on a CAMP, and then got one off a 3\* Legendary Wendigo Friday (He dropped no Legendary Items), remembered the Video and decided to save this one.
---
So, is it a fine for those, who makes some kind of false start? :D
---
It would be cool have a single place of contact across platforms. I've never played video games with other humans before so I'm still figuring this stuff out ... but I think we've got a start!
---
I have the same problem with SuperStimpak before patch the enclave vendor sell it but now...idk
---
I‚Äôve got over 2000 in Team Fortress 2, so there are definitely games that will last that long.
---
This is basically an "Auction House" implementation.  Several MMOs have done similar things.  Put in an in-game location, with some robots as "auctioneers" that handle putting things up for sale and taking bids.
---
Handling WTB would be a lot more complex, as using search terms gets messy quickly.
---
Having a web-based interface to it as well (or just by itself) would be very cool.  Purchases get delivered on next login.  Would have to have the ability to select which character is buying/selling after login.   Then the WTB and WTS get access to easy text entry and search parameters through the web interface.
---
I know what you mean. 
---
I found explosive bait somewhat useful in some situations, but it just does not deal the damage we need. 
---
When in melee and kiting mobs, I move backwards, drop mines, and hope other incoming damage does not stagger me.  Just trying to make the most of a bad situation.
---
Are you sure that‚Äôs the game you want to teach a 5 year old to play? 
---
It would be cool to have a single place of contat accross all platforms!
---
This game is done for, after the back lash, Bethesda just peaced out and now in damage control. You will get a bit of content so no worries there but not much.  
---
Ok I'm One_Hand_Chop add me and let me know what you want and I'll message you with the mats I need

Todd talked about it at E3 and they reiterated it earlier this year: [https://bethesda.net/en/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019](https://bethesda.net/en/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019)

Once you get the quest, a marker will show you optimal place to farm which is right under a scorchbeast. You can stay near the house and farm what you need without crossing the street.
---
If someone blocks you you can't see them on the map. I do this when I'm bored and see a level 1 coming out of the vault for the first time. I block them then sit on the overseers crate with a ritual mask and straight jacket and then use my chameleon to invis until they approach. &gt;_&gt;
---
The supply drops are buggy / show up as markers when they aren't your supply drop.  This leads to people farming unaware players.
---
This is really stupid, Bethesda.  My level 7 character received a notification AND a map marker to collect a supply drop that was right next to the agricultural center south of Flatwoods.  I went to collect it.  It was locked.  I picked it without thinking and was instantly killed by the people in the area waiting for me to do this. They also picked up my junk.  So they are were farming low level players here.    Another roughly level 7 character was there right by the supply drop and the level 107 was over a ridge trying to be sneaky but moving around a lot. (I should have known something was up from the way they moved around, but failed to stop and think about it.)
---
It really pissed me off that they were doing this to low level players just out of the vault.   I couldn't care less about the junk that I personally lost, but what they were doing to new players was just plain crappy.
---
Bethesda:  Why the heck did I have a map marker / quest objective marker to get the supply drop if it is going to make me wanted?   Stupid, stupid, stupid.   These two people were sitting there waiting to farm people going to the supply drop, so they obviously knew that it was bugged and were taking advantage of it.  How do I know?  I watched them for about 10 minutes.  Then I spent the next 20 minutes screwing with them with a suppressed handmade and chameleon armor.  At one point I dropped an orbital strike on them.   Sure, it didn't kill them because I didn't initiate PvP with them with my level 87 character, but I still kept them busy for about 15 minutes while they tried to find me.  Eventually they found my level 7 character on a rooftop, so when they pulled out their guns, I just exited the client.   It took them a good long time to find my level 87 character taking pot shots at them from all over the map.  I could have taken them head on in PvP but they might not have initiated it back, they might have won, they might have lost... who knows.   Instead I exacted my revenge by playing a game of hide and go-seek that I ultimately one by repeatedly shooting the level 7 in the head from many places.
---
Thats what most of the community asked for in the beginning. After watching some streams of the B.E.T.A or whatever it was called, I couldnt believe that even one person would buy it. The first days after release, I was just sad what happend to my beloved franchise but after that faded away, it turned into malicious joy of all the threads about bugs, exploits, glitches and so on. Im happy for all the players still having fun and getting a product worth their money, for all the disappointed costumers it was hopefully the wake-up-call to stop buying games blindlessy.
---
Yes... They love watching it and wanted to learn 
---
I'll test that, but I don't think so.

I always wonder if developers thoroughly play other games in the genre and take the best practices from them. Borderlands 1 had lots of problems with accidentally selling weapons you wanted to keep. In Borderlands 2 they added a simple "favorite" feature to pin your items to your inventory: couldn't sell them and wasn't affected by "sell all" until you unfavorited it. That entire problem went away with that one UI change. I'm not saying it's easy to retrofit an aging inventory system to handle that, but it seems wrong to release a game like this without genre-proven quality-of-life improvements.
---
They fill the same role: they give quests and provide flavour. Their lack of interactivity is beside the point. 
---
Try Rimworld, Civ, or Mount &amp; Blade lol
---
A fair point, certainly true of the ones in Fallout 4 which were mutated almost 200 years earlier.
---
I did build a bunker. Under the highway north of robot city and south of the super mutant public workshop there is a cave system that you can build in and last I played a month or so ago it worked pretty well

99% of the players don't care about PvP and will never respond to you.  You are exploiting a badly designed workshop mechanic for your PvP kicks.  Go slap people and if they shoot back, there, you have your PvP signal.  Join Hunter/Hunted.  That's how PvP was intended to work in the game.
---
Stop trying to ruin the game and being selfish.  You won't get anything from exploiting bad workshop mechanics.  There's other methods to engage/signal PvP.
---
Just go outside or read a book. Games are shit nowadays. 
---
elmer fudd hat
---
Int also affects how much XP you get from kills
---
No, running level 2, I have a level 5, but not enough Points to run that in Battle, and it's not a TS, it's a Furious, I think it has more to do with "Luck of the Draw" which triggers much less often and repairs very little now.
---
How about scorched beasts fights. How does that go? 
---
BOS Heavy Combat Armor is the best in the game. With Dense on the Chest and Strengthened on the Limbs I can put a 40mm into the ground at my feet and take no damage.
---
 Her screeching does nothing, its explosive damage. ;)
---
Thank you! I'll check out the cave to the west. I do know the far north one, and while it's nice - it's just so far away from everything.
---
Or you're greeted with a level 107 standing off to the side waiting for you to pick the lock and instantly kill you the moment the lock is picked because you didn't know that supply drops were made to be unbelievably stupid, recently.   My level 7 character never knew what hit him.  The lock clicked and he died.  It was instantaneous.  People are now farming these things to take low level's junk.
---
If I see these people again, I'm going to just stand in front of the lock and not move.  See if they like that.  I can park my low level alt character in front of it and just let him sit.   Maybe I'll turn pacifist mode off and when they damage me, I'll return fire and use my other character's two-shot black powder rifle to end them.
---
Yes, a plan is forming in my mind...
---
Electrifying story
---
I received an email update from Bethesda support a few weeks back. Apparently canvas matetial is extremely rare and we are in the middle of a global shortage of canvas material due to the Yeezy clothing line by Kanye West. 
---
If I were intending to play PvP, you'd be correct in that it probably sucks. But I have zero interest in that. Right now, at level 59, my build is perfect (and convenient) for my play style. As perfect as it can be with the points I have, anyway. I'll look forward to seeing what new cards that pop up as I go, though. Thanks for that insight.
---
What level are you now? I'm level 20, soon to be 21. Add me if you still want to team up and aren't to far above my level. I usually play with someone about 16 levels above me, who helps me get XP. Otherwise, I'm usually alone, sneaking around lol.

Pfft. Sure a percentage of the noble principled ones won't but realistically we're all going to buy the next shiny thing that Bethesda releases.

I saw someone killing people who didn't know about the lock / lockpicking / wanted level for cracking open the supply drop.  They killed my level 7 character the moment I opened the lock.  They were waiting their just for that.  I watched them for a while and then decided to play my own version of hide, seek, and shoot them in the face with a suppressed rifle for a while.  It ticked me off that they were preying on low level characters and taking their junk.  I dont' really care about the junk I lost.  It wasn't much, but to brand new players it could have been a far bigger loss.
---
So what are you saying you would rather pay a monthly fee to keep the servers and development funded? You can't be that dissalusioned that you think they are going to keep running the servers forever out of the kindness in their heart are you?
---
I'm not entirely sure if this is a bug, if Yao Guai are like rabbits and are meant to spawn/breed like bunnies... but on multiple occasions during my playtime of FO76 (and I have been playing since the very first BETA) I have experienced the oddity where I will kill a (usually high leveled or legendary) Yao Guai... only for a new one to immediately spawn in. Sometimes, this will happen AGAIN, resulting in a buggy third Yao Guai. 
---
On one occasion, when I was with a team of two other people at the Middle Mountain Cabins near White Springs, this happened ENDLESSLY, where we just had to abandon ship due to being swarmed by endless high level dusky, albino and glowing Yao Guai. 
---
My most recent experience was during a blast zone at White Springs. The Yao Guai had spawned in the middle where the 'boss'/high level spawn usually is. I kited it in to the hub to let the robots help me finish it off. As I was heading to the Golf Club, I realized another had spawned in, this time slightly lower level than the last. I did the same thing, only this time, the corpse disappeared immediately/before I could reach it to loot it. And just as before, there was another spawn to replace it. I killed him, and this time there was no replacement... though strangely, I found the corpse of the second bear had respawned out by where the Yao Guai were spawning from (which seems to be past the Sulfer Springs Fountain.)
---
It's all very weird. I do have video of this most recent encounter, though I cut it short and it's only the first two bears, as I wasn't expecting that third one. :( I will upload it off the PS4 and onto here next time I play. But I'm curious if anyone else has noticed this, as I haven't seen it mentioned? Am I just cursed by Yao Guai? Or is their spawn rate screwed up?
---
I'm just starting to get into the game. I started alone or with random people I found. Now I have a semi team. But I go in between single and a group. I find that both are fun but a group can make it much better. 
---

I wondered the same thing the other day. I thought maybe it's Per Game Hour not Per Real Life Hour ? 
---
 Still, I made a ton of Gold and Silver, so it's all good. Apart from not being able to sell it anywhere and it weighs too much. So I just dropped what I didn't need at the station 
---
Then it breaks as soon as it reloaded.
---
Was I just to early talking about it during patch 5, and now we need something to bitch about and throw a bone at the Youtubers?
---
For anyone interested, I tried downgrading drivers (several versions) to no avail. Finally got tired of fooling with it so I RMA'd it. 
---
Considering trying a 2060 but might as well let my 1060 (3gb...üòê) live a little longer.
---
Go to the power up the power plant. I don't remember the name. I think it's like Monogah power plant. If you complete the power up mission I believe you get a fusion generator.
---
&gt;have to say this game ranks in my top 5 all time, it's right up there with Age of Empires series, MechWarrior, Sid Myers Railroad Tycoon, Diablo series, WoW series...blah blah blah.   I bought the tricentennial and did some math of what it cost me to play this game by the minute but got a quick headache doing that high level math, I made out like a bandit.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;BLUF is this game, for all it's bugs and glitches, is amazing, especially if your into the multiplayer thing.  My 3 kids and I laughed so hard I cried on multiple occasions.  I can't tell you how many times I yelled "LEROYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY JANKINS" and charged into battle to have my kids yelling at me at the top of their voices, DAD!!!!  STOP!!!  
---
&gt;With that said, it's time to pick something else up and wait for that DLC to hit.  
---
&gt;Again, I want to stress, if you havn't yet tried this game in a "Team", please do so, it adds so much more to the game itself.
---
Out of the loop here, what are we talking about?
---
It could be that the Degradation is simply the cumulative effect of using many more shots, but pre-patch, I seldom repaired my weapons (twice a week at most), and now it's every hour or less. I never crafted .556 ammo before the patch, and used to have a lot of extra before they nerfed ammo drops in a previous update, but now I'm gathering lead, steel &amp; gunpowder constantly.
---
Wow, never thought someone would have to literally state inventory integrity is a core function.  Crazy.
---
If the Pacifist doesn't fight back, the workshop should become yours.  I have no problem with your right to contest workshop ownership.  I am against the broken ass PvP that allows someone to initiate PvP by contesting the workshop, fast traveling AND killing you before you even get the notice that the workshop is being contested.  There is too much delay between the notices and the person "defending" has no shot.   Also, there are teams of people that go around taking workshops:  They find the person they want to take the workshop from, 2-3 team members go near that person and wait. The other person on their team starts to contest the workshop so the other team-mates drop the original owner without warning and without even a chance to fight back.     Broken, garbage.

Treat it like an experiment.

Here is what I expect the roadmap is:

Q2 2019 - survival mode releases
---
Q3 2019 - a vault opens, stash increase
---
Winter 2019 - private servers
---
Q1 2020 - fo76 goes into "maintenance" mode

Workshops belong to PvPers. Theres even a warning before you take it...
---
It doesnt matter what you think 99% of people are doing. Your statistics are bogus. 
---
Once again, arrogant PvE'rs trying to take over the one machanic pvpers own. 
---
How am i selfish for playing the game?? I bought it for pvp fallout.  Your selfish for asking me not to play the game. Lol
---
Dont you see?? Im playing as it was designed and you are not. lol. Then you ask me to stop??? Im not asking anything of you but im selfish? Where is the logic???
---
Also i run a roleplay guild that gives quests with fully voiced npcs (us the members). We are about 20 members strong with about 2 hours of custom quest content... If you are interested. PC. No rules. Just fun. Write your own quest and we will act it out. Any roleplay is welcome. You help us run quests and we help you run quests.
---
590 hours in ,still playing every day, I love it .
---
There is no stall.  There is already a timer on Workshop ownership.  The owner should be notified immediately that the contest is occurring and they have to decide by the end of the timer or they lose the workshop anyway.   If they decide to fight, then they should have a timer for that as well to get back to the workshop and defend it otherwise they lose it.  The current system is terrible and unbalanced.
---
I'm pretty sure there are people that have logged 3200+ hours in The Division, so it's definitely possible.
---
There's still so much to the game I haven't discovered, yet. Thanks so much for your comment! I've barely done much with crafting, to be honest. I have the excavator power armor and I always do what I can to improve my weapons and armor, but otherwise, I'm not dabbling too much with it. I work best with the lever action rifle, so my build basically does what it can to boost that and help with my weights and damage resistance. Maybe it's just the fact that I have anxiety, but leveling has become stressful when it comes to deciding if I can afford to move points or just need to waste it on a card I likely won't use any time soon. I'll keep these things you've said in mind! Thanks so much! I appreciate the kindness!

Impressive command of the English language.

Multiplayer anthem looks like its going to be good if you want to be iron man

Nice flair, 76 h8r

I think in a future update they should turn either Whitesprings in to a hub or make faction HQs.
---
I can't. My mom grounded me for using harsh languages on the interwebz. 
---
If you are on PC, I've got one that just hit 26 that would love an explosive lever action rifle!
---
Tip. Some pipe weapons count as both rifle and pistol. Long may it last.
---
Only if you‚Äôre f2p. The whales can get much better cosmetics 
---
Oh, tiny factions then. 
---
Or at the bare minimum they need to provide a way to let a workshop go if you don't want to keep it.  Complete the event and push something that says:  Leave Workshop (or similar).
---
Yeah, that's pretty much my point; the devs are continuing to fail to give people reasons to invest their time (and presumably their MTX dollars) in the game. There's just too much competition for attention these days. 
---
Civ will give you that many hours in a handful of games
---
Same with almost all gun types, pistols supplement a VATs build well as they have the lowest vp cost
---
Walking into a certain area gives you quests the npcs have nothing to do with it. They aren't the same and you really just don't get it sad to say.
---
I love this! I feel similar,just haven't found anyone to play with online, as all my friends and family are mostly console players and not into fallout at all...
---
Can't agree more. Very much looking forward to jumping back into The Division. At this point FO76 would have to come up with something truly amazing to save their player-base. What makes it worse is that FO76 really does have the potential to be an amazing game. 
---
As far as seeded tables go, I'm not sure if it applies to Legendaries. It does apply to normal loot drops though. Normal Super Mutes always drop from a smaller table that seems to be tied to the type of mutant it is. Caps, bones, gunpowder are in all of them, then there's ammo type which is tied to the gun typically. For example I haven't had a laser mutant drop a mini-gun. 
---
One thing that I noticed over this weekend was that some enemies seemed to drop a cloned pool for teammates. It would make sense to apply that to the SBQ, to reduce server overhead. (4 people have the same roll, meaning that it eliminates 3 requests from the queue.) I haven't seen examples of that on SBQ though, only when on a team against normal enemies. 
---
If I had to guess, the inventory change that you saw might be related to a cache being refreshed, either from your previous battle or from the last time the server had a SBQ. 
---
I suppose one way to reduce the SBQ overhead on the server would be to change her loot pool to being locker/storage box keys. Gold, silver and bronze keys. Gold being the most desirable, with silver and bronze filling the other roles, but all keys have the chance to generate decent loot. The keys would then stagger the loot queuing, as they would be used when individuals go and claim the item, rather than immediately having 15 people trying to hit the server for a broad loot table request. They could be used to unlock crates or lockers in the domes, or even scatter them out so they could be locations within the different factions that you could access them. 
---
basically every patch we get like 35 I've quit the game posts - problem is several are written by same people meaning they came back to break up with it again
---
You should follow the Bethesda employees that regularly post here. 
---
They are listening and passing on ideas and suggestions.

I bought some statics recently lol. Sorry

I feel ya. I have a few more hours than you do but I really like the people I play with. I seriously don't want to find something else until and unless they leave the game as well... I *just* found one really cool person to play with and I fear though they will get tired of it , I mean I am really good at amusing myself solo but I really like playing with people I get along with. I don't have this kind of camaraderie in other games. I wish I did. 
---
Gunslingers do work, but not without VATS. I know two diffrent people with endgame gunslingers and both have different but simmilar builds focused around VATS and Western Revolvers. Neither uses power armour as the core cost for VATS heavy builds is too big. (Sharing Radsponge with a full team for nuke zones)
---
The Gunslingers biggest need is more pistols viable and endgame, it's currently the Western or nothing.
---
What does whoopsies even do
---
I like this game
---
Yeah, probably healthily north of 5k in the Dots/LOL genre, easily north of 2k in CS.
---
Well, I'll throw this back at you.  What evidence do you see of a miraculous turnaround in the works?  There has been no - and I must stress no - additional PvE content since release.  Broken Events remain broken.  And adding Known Plans is the only real QoL improvement.
---
They are not acting like they are in an all-hands-on-deck situation.  Turnaround times are lethargic and patches create as many issues as they supposedly address.
---
I enjoy 76.  I also think it has (increasingly, "had") enormous potential if it had the right attitude behind it.  But the post-release work can only be described as soulless.
---
That's fucking harsh, not bugging until you kill the ultimate enemy? I would ragequit too
---
I just reinstalled Fallout 4 because I‚Äôm bored with 76 but super into the concept of Fallout right now.. 
---
Lol...gray cosmetics and stat nerfs üë¥
---
I hear people put A LOT of hours into Warframe (2,000 plus).
---
Right now the meta is:
---
Assassin / Sentinel = Full health ranged characters
---
Assassin / Cavalier = Full health melee characters
---
Unyeilding / Cavalier = Bloody low health melee characters
---
Expect that some of that armor is going to get nerfed in the future.  With Assassin + Sentinel or Cavalier you can theoretically get over 100% damage resist.
---
And with the Unyeilding pieces, expect those to get hit with a nerf as well.  You can get insane damage with low health and unyielding.
---
I'm hoping they don't nuke nerf armor like they did to TSE.  They need to do SMALL buffs and nerfs to things until it's all balanced like League of Legends does.
---
The safest bet is to go X effect plus Sentinel or Cavalier.  Be warned though, trading for those pieces is going to cost an arm and a leg unless it's a bad one (like Ghoul Slayer / Sentinel).
---
But they need to put more people into the dev team..each update could add more enticing improvements.
---
Stability YES, but more content too.
---
Definitely not, my place was flash fried twice near being white springs. I originally thought both places were well outside perceived blast zones yet I was proven wrong as the landing zones changed.  
---
That's evil. I like it!
---
The meta seems to be Combat Armor or Marine Armor.  Slightly different DR / ER values on both.
---
That‚Äôs the spirit!
---
Are you allowing anything like WIKI style edits or just feedback? I was just going through it and found some stuff that wasn't accurate (namely 2 PA spawnpoints that are Raider power armor, but not tagged as such on your map)
---
The issue isn't the lack of a player hub - Whitesprings is clearly designed with that sort of role in mind. The issue is that the number of players on one server is too small so usually there aren't any players there. Any sort of "player hub" thing would have to be put on a different server under the current setup.
---
Pulling the PA station further from the wall fixed this for me.   Otherwise it was on the level above.....
---
I'm actually loving Fallout 76. Relatively new player and casual so I can't really speak for the end game hardcore guys. Point is I'm having fun. Even with the occasional annoying bug. That being said, when Division 2 comes along, it will be my go-to. Absolutely loved the first one. Sounds like u had a blast as I am even with all the hate.
---
I think nicer high level players are in the minority, I can say from personal experience that whenever I run into a high-level player they just run up and attack me and they don't say anything, it always pisses me off and I give them the thumbs down and I feel like it's a wasted opportunity for a friendly interaction
---
I love this. Every ten levels like I suggested seems to be a no-go for most players. Which, considering I don't play PvP, I can see why I didn't think of it being as big a deal as the others. But you've got an awesome suggestion that, to me, seems it could work great without making PvP a massacre for those that enjoy it. 
---
I'm hoping the make factions a bigger part of the game if they ever introduce new content. That may make it worth creating a 3rd character. 
---
I've had Mirelurks reach the island and no queen spawn. This event has yet to give me any rewards and I've run it quite a few times (&gt;10). These were all before and after all the patches. I've just stopped doing it. I hope they don't change events based on popularity since the numbers will be skewed due to known issues. They should fix the issues first and then reassess which events are popular.
---
'We see dead people... they're everywhere'
---
Or he/her is wanted 
---
It is a poor choice security wise to not run dumb terminal style games where the server does the actual work. Way too prone to abuse.
---
I see people creating new chars, but i cant understand the interest? what makes a second character fun?
---
Master thread, thanks. 
---
was there not a glitch at one point where people could just take your stuff in the trade screen? early maybe just after patch 1.
---
Go look around the forums here buddy - you'll see thousands of upvotes for PvE and people not caring about this PvP mode that's planned for the game.
---
As for workshops - you probably are hard of reading.  PvP was clearly intended to be within the workshop constructs with the warning message, but badly implemented mechanics means people like you are taking it far beyond what it was intended for.  It will get fixed, Bethesda has already acknowledged this in other topics discussing this - my best advice is enjoy it while it lasts and maybe when they fix it the new survival mode will be out where you can PvP all day long.
---
I only noticed this like a week ago despite having been two solid months of playing 
---
How many people are on the dev team?
---
Haha righto. Sure im down to play. Do you use discord?
---
I'm level 20.
---
PSN: chakra_bender 
---
I keep my expectations low and I anticipate they will struggle to even meet those.
---
I'm not being cynical because it's trendy.  It's because in the months since release, they can't be bothered to fix the existing quests which are already broken.  So, why should I be hopeful about new quests?
---
Co-op is outstanding, really enjoy it.  IMO that should have been the focus, Single player and co-op, forget PvP or do that as a separate add on later.
---
I got this for killing a ghoul to close to me with a 700 damage tse , really point blank , then got the woopsies , I thought it was because I accidentally overkilled myself 
---
Understood. By "heavily invested" I meant time. A lot of people are very upset right now because they expected the game to last longer than it did. 
---
Oh, but you get to dictate reality? You said false it wasn't arbitrary. That shows how silly and naive you are. that was my opinion. My opinion can't possibly be false because it's an opinion. I thought it was arbitrary. So I said it was arbitrary. Who is the one who is being childish and trying to dictate reality again?
---
where do you get that?
---
An old vault dweller was shootin up a goul in whitespriiiiiiiings.
---
Yeah, stuff was happening before the war here. 
---
I'm a stalker because I wanted to see if you are this Petty in all of your comments regarding fallout76, and lo and behold, I wasn't disappointed.
---
Ha!!!
---
My g/f and I BOTH lost our melee rocket powered bats.  Granted, we are playing low level characters so the loss isn't that big but still. We didn't scrap them and there is no way we would drop them.  But BOTH melee weapons.  
---
This next part is details for the eggheads trying to find a correlation. 
---
This happened while both of us were in a Nuke zone. 
---
Our rocket power bats were in Favorite slot 1. (both of us)
---
We auto-scrapped at a crafting station but did not manually scrap anything yet. 
---
Both stored a few Glowing mass/fluids and nuked flora and a few legendary 1 star items in our stash.
---
End of nuked event we noticed our stacks of cram were gone, (no we didn't eat and it didn't go bad) our bats were missing.  
---

Thank you from this Canadian gamer, and my family. I‚Äôm sorry for your loss.  (Also on Xbox)
---
Should have given a new power armor paint scheme. Would have stopped the bleeding. It could be exclusive to these canvas bag recipients.
---
These forums are dead. 
---
Redditors are notorious for being lame. This place is not representative of the in game community. I bet you think r/politics is an accurate display of how americans think about politics too?
---
Pvpers just dont bother commenting because of the care bear brigade that runs this sub. You guys are in full denial mode. 
---
 Well thank, you a coma might have helped, its true.
---
How did they like Rose's plotline?
---
I'm a simple man. I see ugly green/red/brown heads, I pop them off. Almost 120 levels now and still going strong.
---
Clutch. So clutch. Thank you!
---
They hit hard, but I‚Äôm not sure they have the highest DPS. On my VATS sniper, I use a lever action because it fires instantly and fast. The charge-up mechanic on a gauss is just annoying. 
---
I agree with your research op , I've noticed the same things
---
I haven't exceeded the height limit yet.  But then, my lowest level is slightly sunken to the ground as my picture shows.  When I get home tonight I'll try to keep building up to find where the limit is.
---
THIS.  We need more Roleplayers willing to make the effort.  On all platforms.  I mean, once you get past a certain level, and have killed the SBQ a few hundred times, if you want to have fun, you have to make it yourself.  And doing it in such a way as to not grief/annoy others.
---
I doff my Civil War Era Top Hat to you, sir!
---
 There is nothing slight about the differences. ;)
---
My xbox tells me I've spent 1798 hours on For Honor...
---
They needed a Whitesprings that was useless to nuke, but had convinient access to other excellent nuke locations.
---
Glad the game did it for you. 
---
What i said has nothing to do with pvp but ok.
---
You can deny how helpful so many perks are if that's your prerogative
---
I can tell you that at top of the world their is a wooden fighting ring that spawns a max level raiders pa often
---
.........but I live in Detroit.
---
I was alone in one last week... didnt make a difference really, since all my friends quit long time ago
---
It's happened to me twice. Both times from CTD or disconnecting from the server.
---
It's like we're Bethesda's parents: "We're not angry, son, we're *disappointed*."
---
Top 10 in sales for 2018 is "terrible sales numbers?"
---
yea it's a little odd to understand but basically any of the events/dailies listed out to the side of that region can give you any of those cosmetics not just the one directly out next to it
---
Right on. I haven't put that many hours in. But I've gotten tonnes of enjoyment out of this game, bugs and all. 
---
I've explored every nook and cranny of Appalachia, I've joined factions long gone, I've solved mysteries, hunted monsters, avenged deaths. I've traveled solo and joined bands of warriors. I've hunted bounties, and built safe havens for new wanderers in the wastes. I've fought off waves of Scorched Beasts and their minions with a horde of Mister Gutsy and Graham by my side when I was far too weak to try and lived to tell the tale, and I've unleashed the power of the atom over the Wasteland.
---
But now I'm ready to do one last thing. This weekend I'm going after the Queen, and when I've put her down, I will take my well deserved rest.
---
I'll be back one day, to explore the other vaults, or new frontiers when they arise, but until then, I leave West Virginia for other explores.
---
Ad Victorium brother, I hope to see you when a new adventure awaits.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôve made three characters but there‚Äôs no replayability‚Äù

Lower ur empathy perk

Ammosmith pushes 50 cal to 180 a pop.

My build is a Level Action using Sneak/Rifleman build that relies on Chameleon (mutation +1 armor piece), Speed Demon, Marsupial, Adrenal Reaction, and Scaly Skin. Chameleon gave me an opportunity to focus on my Perk set-up as I leveled without having to worry about Armor as I used the Mistress of Mystery Garb with the Eye of Ra - (80DR 80ER +25% Sneak as long as you don't get killed or jump into Power Armor if you do the Eye gets mad and drops the extra stats in half). Mutations changed my gameplay and I prepared well in advance as I added more :)
---
Bah, pls not 
---
It's time for a new character...just joking. The Division 2 is out in a month. I recommend that.
---
Heavy BoS Combat Armor...for now? All the in-game lore states that Marine Armor should be the best non-PA, so hopefully Bethesda unfucks that soonish.
---
Will post if I find the source. Came across it late jan. Official comments regarding private servers. There wasn't a ton of fanfare around the announcement. 
---
You're obviously looking to validate your "opinion". I'm starting to feel sorry for you.
---
so basically any of these

Losing the player base is actually a positive for Bethesda since they rent server time on AWS. Less players means lower costs for them since resources scale automatically. The only thing that would really light a fire under them to fix the game would be if sales took a sharp decline, or if a court ordered them to. All we‚Äôre doing is giving them free publicity by continuing the conversation, regardless of the content. 
---
Oh thank God. I thought I would have to spam Guided Meditation. Thank you for the clarifier!
---
Can confirm.
---
Bought civ 3 and 5 with a friend to do multiplayer. Almost 100 hours in between the two of em and we haven't finished a game 
---
As a low level player who is enjoying (more or less) this game, where the hell are all these people who say there giving stuff away? Since this game has been out I‚Äôve meet two people who gave me something worth while. I don‚Äôt really need anything but seeing people who would give me something instead of the typical you got any mini nukes or middles I can have? I legitimately have let about 5 random people party up with me, ask these questions, then not even 5 minutes later leave saying I just needed someone to fast travel to. 
---
You bring up a great point, and it's something I left out. The issue with PvE damage is multifaceted and beyond simple output numbers. It's about unbalanced damage resistances that need to be revisited and reworked. 
---
Are you seriously blaming critics for this games failure? Jfc dude. This isn't the fault of critics. 
---
Bos is a mod. I got mine scrapping combat armor pieces from events
---
I imagine they did have a road map, it just hit way too many bugfix potholes along the way. Now the axle has snapped and they're trying to figure out what to do with it. 
---
I log in every day but not for as long as I used to, I‚Äôm desperate for more stories, holotapes, notes, areas and events because atm i feel like I‚Äôm just treading water, it‚Äôs just a vendor run, cap stash run, technical data drop off, distant thunder event if it pops up, and a Camden park event if it comes up when I visit for excavator plans for some Mr Fuzzy tokens, buy some plans with the caps I‚Äôve collected because it‚Äôs taken me to max and I might as well spend some then it‚Äôs rinse and repeat the next day, I check out the atom shop each day for anything new but not much appeals so I‚Äôm sitting on 1400 atoms that I have nothing to spend on so il never spend real world money and so Bethesda can‚Äôt be making much if others are sitting on atoms too just like me and not buying atoms with cash. I just hope better items come to the atom shop and more content comes sooner rather than later and that PVP development doesn‚Äôt take away from new  PVE content.
---
Trying to track down source on this. Sorry, came across it in late January.
---
not enough
---
The only time I've seen a real PvP engagement myself in game is very early on just after beta.  Recent encounters (just 2 since that first one) were quick kill you and disappear types...  they never took the workshop, just wanted a quick hit/run.  Not sure what that says but given the hours I have I'd say PvP is nearly non-existent!
---
Maybe one day I'll run into you, might even shut off my Pacifist and try to reclaim the workshop.  You seem to be the exception to the norm.
---
I greatly appreciate the kind words, sincerely.
---
Does it matter what order you listen to them in? I was going to try this, but I hate to have to listen to them all twice over if I don't do it right the first time. LOL
---
Both of my weapon losses (non legendary thank Odin) were from crashes, one of the client, one being just from the server. I can't prove it, but I had the weapon equipped (both times a 45 handmade that I had... hand made) and both times it was there, the game went kaboom (once in combat so I KNOW I had just been using it) and upon restarting I had no weapon equipped, a blank spot on my favorites wheel where it had been and it was just gone.
---
I would 100% bet they are satisfied with the money they‚Äôve made. 
---
This game was not made with a big budget and there is NO WAY they ever thought it was going to have a long shelf live. 
---
It‚Äôs so half assed that they knew HAD to know they were going to have a steep decline in sales quickly. 
---
The Atom shop at this point is only for the biggest suckers (sorry guys but let‚Äôs be honest). 
---
I‚Äôd bet $100 bucks that by the end of 2019 Bethesda ends support for the game, or at least content drops. 
---
I'm blaming critics and toxic fanbase for being overly critical.  A game can't just have bugs, these days a game has to be the buggiest thing that has ever been produced ever and is the worst game that was ever released. The hyperbole is out of control
---
yea thats why i clarified lol :) didnt want to scare you away 
---

Sad
---
I have one "jack of all trades", one for team play(high cha) and one heavy guns.
---
So a 3 billion company should find ways to make a ton of money by adding more devs to a team we don't know how many are on.
---
I mean that sucks but you're also a sucker for falling for it.
---
I've successfully done that quest once, but the several other times I've tried it (including since the latest patch), I've not actually gotten any disturbed dirt to loot.
---
Cmon man lol
---
I was thinking the other day that it felt like a Fallout game happened, THEN we showed up. The BOS and Responders last stand, various faction interactions, the climactic Dam explosion. All the elements of a Fallout game are there, we were just late cause we apparently REALLY slept in.
---
It's more that it's mind blowing buggy and they have the decency to leave the BETA tag for as long as possible (but still bringing in $$$ with micro transactions of course)
---
sad state of affairs for a lot of good looking titles.
---
LOL was that a mic drop?
---
How do you get the paint?  Just scrapping combat helmets?
---
There's also specific spots where Sentry robots spawn too.  Have to spend ammo but their charge is consistently 50% or better, and easier to get them to spawn while server hopping.  
---
Like the black cowboy hat I just got... picked up from the freak show (where it spawns) and had it on my noggin... and it was gone next login. Thankfully it's not hard to replace, but still unnerving.
---
I'm lucky enough I guess so far to never have had an item disappear. I would go mad seriously. 
---
10% off everything.
---
EVERYTHING MUST GO!
---
So many things could have been so fuckin cool. Nuke zones could have been amazing. Dungeon raids could have been sick.
---
More bosses like SBQ would have been cool. Maybe at the end of a dungeon with immense levels of challenge to win 
---
If something sounds too good to be true, that‚Äôs cause it is 
---
Even if it was broken it would not be the best mmo lite. It's a failed experience nothing more.
---
The problem is try finding all of the legendary effects you want with "heavy combat required" as a rule.
---
You've got to broaden the search out to get a full legendary set with good effects.
---
Example:  A light leather Assassin / Sentinel set (chest, arms, legs) gets over 100% PVP damage reduction as long as you're standing still.  For PVE that's a 75% damage reduction on top of the base armor stats as long as you're standing still.
---
Right now I'm trying to get "any" marine or combat armor pieces with Assassin / Cavaliers for my melee.  It's like trying to draw water from a stone.  The stuff is impossible to trade for....lol
---
If there's any place that would make a good open Market, it's Flatwoods
---
I personally disagree. I think it really depends on what you're looking for in the game, the attitude you go into it with, and the kind of gaming you enjoy. 
---
I have played all of the (main: 1, 2, 3, NV, 4, 76) Fallout games, and what I love most about them/what drew me into them was the lore. The world they were set in: this idea of a post-apoc world that was frozen in the 50s, where now people were learning how to survive and rebuild using what was left to them. The idea of the Vaults, and that they weren't as perfect as they were promised. The mysteries of the war and civilization as it was before, and that we don't really know who dropped the bombs, even though we have our theories. The knowledge that we *have not learned our lesson,* and man is still at war in the form of the various factions we meet through each of the games.
---
Fallout 76 is everything each of the other games is; it covers all of these things, it checks off all of the boxes. But it adds new elements and mechanics, and change is a hard thing for people to handle, especially when it comes to something they love. (And believe me, I get that! I'm tough on change too. I hated the idea of an online only Fallout at first.) But when you think about it:
---
* All of the lore is present, and in tact, and more importantly, is elaborated on. We are given a look into the beginnings of the Brotherhood of Steel that before, we'd only heard second-hand. We learn more about another important faction (no spoilers for our new friend here who probably isn't that far along yet!) and their downfall on the East Coast. We learn about the extinction of a lot of the wildlife that we no longer see in the later entries of the franchise. It all flows nicely into the later entries.
---
* In my opinion, this game is actually Bethesda's best storytelling yet. Yes, you have to read the terminals and notes, and listen to the holotapes. But learning about the fates of the factions, of these people who fought for the greater good so valiantly and sometimes died in horrible ways... some of it is heartwrenching, and the voice acting in this game is the best we've heard yet, really bringing it home. Some of the holotapes are straight up disturbing. And in my opinion, it's a lot of fun to read a name on a terminal, and realize later on while reading something else "hey! I've heard this name before!" and connect the dots as you put together the clues and the story as you follow someone's live/footsteps. Not to mention, as always, Beth's visual storytelling is on point as always. 
---
* I have said this in many threads already, but there is something amazing about coming across another player, teaming up for an event (be it in a literal team, or just assisting each other) and then giving a thumbs up and heading off on your separate ways. Because that's how it would BE, for a wastelander. You'd help each other out in the face of trouble, maybe sometimes suspicious of the other person, but in the face of death what else can you do? And then once the danger is through, it's off on your way, knowing that you helped someone out, and not everyone in the wasteland is so bad after all. That's what I love about this game - that immersion is fantastic. 
---
And that's just a few of the reasons, but I think I've babbled enough. :) I know the game has bugs... BELIEVE ME. But hey, so did NV... and those were WAY worse. (And it STILL has bugs ten+ years later! Yet most of us love it.) So once everything dies down... I think people will realize 76 isn't so bad after all.
---
(PS: Why was this thread removed for Rule 1? It totally has to do with Fallout....)
---
There's a funny horror comedy called The Final Girls that has a trailer that gives away every major plot point, setting and joke. I recommend the movie, but avoid the trailer.
---
&gt; Their roadmap is to keep scaling back the server expenses
---
Possible gross understatement here, but if this game failed to reach projections by tens of millions of dollars or even more... then the internal roadmap itself is being reevaluated and changed.  Resources devoted to it are indeed going be significantly lower.  
---
A lot needs to have happened internally before they'll be able to provide the honest and detailed roadmap we expect and deserve.     
---
Hope you grabbed all the fusion cores
---
Can we us the line ‚Äúthis is hurting me more than it‚Äôs hurting you‚Äù?

15 strength 
---
and good luck i am lvl 270 have dones over 400 of these on this list if not more and yet to get one single piece of "rare" clothing
---
I used to play fo4 with a 10mm pistol, vats build and as sneaky as possible. I tried the same in fo76 but till now it hasn#t felt the same as in fo4.  Compared to my handmade rifle the 10mm pistol seems much weaker. And most of the must-have perks are located in the agility tree. Sneak-perks, white knight, pistol perks. I am using unyielding combar armor and love the endless action points, high luck and perception. I never have more than 30-40% health so my initial sneak attack must be deadly on any normal enemy. The handmade does the job, the 10mm doesn‚Äòt. 
---
This what makes me laugh about people in this reddit.
---
I started with, Probably not. 
---
And so many people came and bitched about the idea. One really going to some length to express how bad this would be.
---
I mean, I clearly think it's not going to happen or if it does, not like next week or next patch. 
---
But lord howdy, some of you just read with selective vision. 
---
where did you get the recipie from.
---
I still play and have fun having already explored the majority. 500 hours. Fun with friends, battling for workshops, trading, finding rare legendaries, and helping new/lower ranked players. Praise Todd.
---
Their roadmap is going to 
---
* QoL updates
---
* Atom Shop Updates
---
it's pure RNG no method to it
---
Yeah, if other pistols were better build would become better on it's own. Tried leveling a crit pistol vats build, worked fine for most stuff, specially the western revolver - that one is just better than everything else. 
---
Fun is fun, right? I had fun for about 100 hours. No one can take that away from me. But slogging through another 100 hours because of "time invested" doesn't make those first 100 hours more fun.  Time is a sunk cost you can never get back. Making the decision to play a game that's no longer fun for you because of the time you invested in it is a bit silly.  
---
But again, here's hoping the new content comes so we can continue to have fun.
---
Agree for the most part. I am still in the process of building mine but it's basically a VATs crit fisher build. The 2 main issue I have are (1) No viable non revolver pistol and (2) acquiring armor penetration.
---
Having a lower damage pistol like the deliverer would give us another play style that focuses more on multiple crits rather than higher end damage per round.
---
As far as the second point goes, I made the mistake of getting the summerset too early. I really wish I could have a lvl 50 version of that pistol for the 50% armor ignore.
---
Wear power armour so that if you fall off, as I kept doing about halfway across, the long fall won‚Äôt harm you.
---
Do you mean ultracite ammo? Cause isn't that one 1:1 scale for ammo types? 
---
And you can't display any unique stuff you come across.
---
If it's any consolation, that 3* legendary alpha mongrel would have had junk loot anyway.
---
Happens from time to time yes. Someone else was there recently and farmed the place. Not me because I never kill the robots. 
---
Really late reply, but I was on a scrapping frenzy yesterday (hit the 600lb stash limit) and inadvertently scrapped the wrong one - had deployed them all and one returned to my inventory right as I was about to scrap the other. Frame was scrapped, but all the equipped armor was dropped into my inventory. So it's less costly than you might think to scrap the wrong one.
---
I disagree with you on some math-related observations but I'd still vote on you, mr. F76 President 
---
We are brothers in arms! Even though I'm a few years older, that could be written by me... I feel you bro. And I hope you'll find something good to do while waiting!

Have mount and blade.  Probably put in a lot of hours but that's been over like five years or so.

You‚Äôre gonna get a melee weapon pretty early. Don‚Äôt ignore it. Ammo is hard to come by at first and melee is currently stupid good anyways. You can collect dirty water from any source, but it will give you a less-than-healthy dose of radiation. Make sure you have rad-away to deal with it, but then you can boil the water down for drinking at any cooking station with some wood. I found the luck perk Can Do! Fed me for the whole game so far with only 1 level in it. If you prefer something a little more fresh (and mutated), you can run to that town with the Responders church and there are always some Brahmin running around there. Good for leather too! Any questions you may have, feel free to message me on here! I‚Äôm on Xbox too, if you ever need a wild man swinging an axe to help you out!

I played Everquest for 4 years, and WoW for over 10, so played thousands of hours in both of those. Played almost every season of diablo 3, well over 1k there as well. Warcraft 2 I had tons of hours, and all of the elder scrolls games between daggerfall and skyrim. 
---
yes pure RNG
---
I can trim that armor for you when you get a new set, hit me up.
---
4 or 5 logins yesterday and 2 today and they were exactly the same. The 2 grafton vendors weren't identical, but their inventory was unchanged. 
---
I think it has got to be related to the last patch. 
---
Honestly i have no idea from where the 20% even comes from then, cause numbers should be different with what works for crafting elsewhere. 
---
Can you please make an easy way to download my photos from console to share publicly? It would be great if I could simply log-in to my Bethesda account online and find my pictures there. Taking a screenshot of my photo and uploading it to Onedrive is not working.
---
Can you please load more of the game before I enter the world? I'm tired of running around for 5 minutes being attacked by invisible enemies without being able to do anything about it.
---
Can you please make it so we can store more stuff at our camp even if it's not available everywhere like the stash? In a game that is all about collecting, it's frustrating that I can't horde everything that I collect.
---
Please consider the following improvements to the UI to help with inventory management:
---
\- show the weight of each tab in the stash menu and inventory menu
---
\- show the total weight of each stack in addition to individual item weight
---
\- give us the ability to rename all items, even if it's only seen by me, and include an option to reset the name to default
---
\- either make the quantity slider stop when I hit 1 item, or allow it to wrap around on both sides. It currently only wraps around when I hit left, but stops at maximum when I hit right.
---
The actual launch tube is about a mile away each in an unmarked location from each silo. 
---
I'm pretty sure I ran across one, but it was not marked on the map (not a discoverable location). All I remember is that is was east of The Top of The World location.
---
Do you also not have a friend?
---
Hunt down mole miners for screws and go to Grafton highschool for rubber. There's a pile of kickballs and basketballs 
---
Thanks for all the input.  I am hoping the next patch adds some clarity. 
---
My best guess from what we've observed about the loot generation is that all of this loot activity is done with Papyrus script.
---
In previous games (not sure how 76 handles it), each frame had a specific amount of time dedicated just to running Papyrus script. If a script didn't finish within that amount of time, it was deferred to the next frame. In vanilla Fallout 4 and Skyrim, this generally wasn't a huge issue, but when you throw mods and/or a large number of Fallout 4 settlements into the mix, it was possible that some scripts could get delayed instead of executing when they need to, which can manifest in all kinds of weird problems (if you've ever had the Vault 111 door get stuck when playing the Start Me Up mod, this is what happened).
---
Fallout 4 (and by extension, 76) relies on scripts heavily for many things, the loot system apparently being one of these. But instead of just one player character there are now up to 24, and all 24 of these players are constantly firing off Papyrus scripts in various ways: maybe there's a team of players doing an event somewhere, another player is trying to build a CAMP, another is using a scripted legendary weapon like a Furious-prefixed weapon, maybe one or two players are in Whitespring farming ghouls, and then you've got 10 or so players in the SBQ fight which is constantly generating trash mobs and meat piles, which have to have their loot tables calculated for any player nearby, while at the same time maybe someone is clearing out another silo (which is also a very script-heavy area) in preparation for launching the next nuke at the prime site.
---
All of these scripts are trying to compete for that small time window that the server allocates to Papyrus scripting each frame. We don't know what the tick rate is for Fallout 76, but regardless the server is bogged down with trying to run as many scripts as it can per tick. This is why loot will show the spinning arrow - it wants to show you the loot YOU have earned from this enemy - and you alone, because loot is instanced, it has to generate this loot for every player trying to get at it, and then generate the legendary/nuke loot if these apply to the situation as well. The game is trying to run this script but can't, because all the other scripts trying to run have piled up on top of it, and you basically have to wait for "your turn" for your script to run, which will then generate your loot and let you pick it up.
---
Generally, servers will recover from this - after the queen fight is over (and assuming there's not another nuke on the way), players start clearing out eventually, and the number of scripts that have to run is reduced, allowing more players to get their loot and clear out, etc. In theory, once the Papyrus script engine has had time to "catch up", things will return to normal.
---
Of course, if the queen bugs out and vanishes entirely then no amount of waiting will allow you to loot her &gt;:(
---
in short, yes!
---
The actual number doesn't matter...its obviously not enough. A multi-Billion dollar company can afford to make this game a masterpiece.
---
BGS makes games to make money. They have a game here with great potential, and they are delivering updates that fix bugs.  So, more devs could work on actual content.  look how long GTA5 has been going.  They can do that in FA76 with more work, or smarter work.  I think FA76 is very special in its potential.
---
Thanks for the info. I'll get back to hunting
---
They do exist, but they aren't marked on the map.
---
So true!
---
Sadly the Summerset caps at 45 like all ".44 Revolvers" only the "Western Revolvers" go to 50 (I have a 45 Summerset Special)
---
I know the silos do have nuke exit tubes.  I've seen videos of players standing next to one while the nuke launches.
---
Where the tubes are, I'm not 100% sure.  I believe they're fenced in, and have a large metal cylinder cap on top of a concrete surrounding.
---
You've missed the whole point. So nevermind. Have fun. 
---
It might be a ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time to date other people but we can still be friends‚Äù kinda break up.
---
And yes when I see you get that new ‚Äòcontent‚Äô I will be calling you again to hook up.

Like i said, i run a RP guild so half the time im running up to people on area mic telling them "my kingdom is in peril and in need of a hero. Are you the hero my kingdom needs?" Trying to get them to come to the castle so they can request an audience with the king and take some of our quests. If you try to pvp me when im with my roleplay gang you would get mobbed by 8+ people and have a bad time lol.
---
The rest of the time i pvp. I already got my "end game" gear so i dont need much from grinding anything. Basically roleplay and PvP are my all i do.
---
you have to make pvp happen. I hop servers until i find one with alot of claimed workshops. Then i go for those guys first. 
---
lol yes "mayor for a day" is one of the best side quests for QOL in watoga
---
they're keeping the easy fixes for later so they can let it look as if they're actually working on stuff
---
Apparently not at Whitesprings anymore.
---
Was there 2 hours last night.  Didn't see one 3 star weapon.  95% of the legendaries I got were 1 star trash.  Nothing even worth taking home and trading to people on the trading sub-reddits.
---
NOBODY CARES WHY YOU SHOULD KEEP PLAYING!
---
Best quitting post ever, well done sir. I agree, its more fun with a team. It's a wasteland of a game in so many ways, and surviving with friends is the best way to play. 
---
Thank you for your interest!
---
The roadmap will be addressed in a future patch!
---
Does it hold it's own at that level? I figure the 50% armor ignore would make it better than the western for more DR heavy targets.
---
right after the TSE change before the hotfix, you'd join a well populated world in the evening and within an hour only 1-2 people would be still be online. several times i got the server is shutting down in 5 minutes warning, checked the map and I was the only person online.
---
You fell for a scam that's straight out of Runescape circa 2005. 
---
This game is ass man, I'm sick of it 
---
Any ideas where I might find one?    
---
At least I know what I'm looking for now
---
Not everyone is a scammer, but I'm surprised some people are so trusting. Someone gave me some good 3 star pieces of armor to mod. I put the BoS and Dense on them for free and gave them back. I doubt there are many honest people in the world, and being too trusting is going to end up like what happened to you more often than not.
---
Yeah, but did you do your homework?
---
If you finished it earlier than level 50, you just fucked yourself out of the best 2 h melee weapon in the game.
---
That shit doesn‚Äôt upgrade, so lower= lower level all rise, and that sucks.
---
I‚Äôd rather wait myself.  Hell, it‚Äôs not that hard to just round up the bots in front and then run to the vendor for protection.  Takes an extra 3 minutes and it‚Äôs safe as fuck- bots knows how to build a bot.
---
Would love to play with a team but thanks to the "Fallout is bad" Meme thats going around no one I know will touch it or has quit. Saying "ITS BAD LOOK AT THIS GUYS YOUTUBE REVIEW!"
---
Any idea where I can look, roughly?
---
I thought you could bypass all this if you grab the hand scanner thing...
---
You have done bunker buster already, right?
---
Yeah I can deal with this kinda stuff but as said above there are alot of other bugs that need fixed faster then this issue. 
---
I think whitespring was meant to be a hub but it's just a game where people congregating doesn't have much benefit so they go elsewhere. I'm fine with that.
---
I found one  done by the south side of the map and slightly west of the r&amp;g station (east of the east of Lewisburg station approximately).  Although I haven't seen one launched from there yet 
---
Silly Chad
---
Not OP, but it's very possible it isn't being reported much because it can be hard to notice. I had my ritual mask go missing from my inventory, but had no idea when it happened because I hadn't worn it in weeks. I am confident I neither dropped nor sold it, because I am particularly careful with both. It was just gone. It was never a duped item because I picked it up from it's spawn myself. 
---
I can definitely see how other items could go missing and never be noticed at all, or at least not to the point to be worth mentioning. I just went and picked up a new ritual mask, no big deal. Non legendaries vanishing are easy enough to replace too. Junk or aid, I'd never notice at all. 
---
In my opinion, lack of reporting does not equal lack of a problem. I'd say the amount it has been reported, as shown by OP, shows that's quite a real issue.
---
that place gave the fucking chills dude
---
He was a trustworthy dude 
---
I seem to only find them on event bosses or world spawn bosses. Never anything good though. 
---
That sucks man.
---
I was going to say the cores went into the fissure with your hardened mass, but cores are ammo and shouldn't drop.
---
Legendary weapons shouldn't delete themselves for any reason.
---
This is why I want the ability to LOCK items in our inventory so they can't be dropped, scrapped, traded, or sold until they're UNLOCKED.  Not saying you accidentally dropped yours, but a lot of people have.  This would at least eliminate ONE of the disappearing items problems.  Then they could go find other reasons it happens.
---
Yeah you just need to find the senator's bunker right?
---
You can level SPECIAL and pick perks separately. Tab through the filter to look through all perks available at your level.
---
If you want to use weapons with high ammo consumption, consider moving to the ash heap south by Hornwright site #3 and complete the Excavator power armor quest. This armor quadruples the yield from ore deposits. You will need acid though to smelt. Hemlock Holes Maintenance workshop about 14 caps north of Vault 76 can give you about 60 acid or more per hour. Beware of people looking to PVP though.
---
Pacifist mode stops you from hurting other players. Other players can still hurt or kill you. So beware.
---
Grab a hazmat suit when you find one. If someone nukes whitesprings, wear it and tag enemies with gunfire to get easy experience when higher levels kill things. Just make sure there is something nearby to climb on top of if you get aggro from ghouls.
---
If you have any specific questions or have a specific build you want to try, we can give better advice for you.
---
To be fair those stats you listed don‚Äôt include digital or pc sales
---
AWOL Armaments. 
---
May be a dumb question but, do you mean a Silo Run? Or an actual mission called Bunker Buster?    
---
I'm still pretty new so I haven't done everything yet
---
lol what ? there is no 4th star for armor that's on you man maybe do some research beforehand
---
And sinking the barrels at the Grafton Dam.
---
See thats the problem, I found fallout super easy to master. then they patch, introduce game breaking bugs, nerf the shit out of stuff like pipe weapons, dont buff energy weapons, dont nerf melee weapons which are just as broke as TSE. its a mess atm I'm taking a long break until the shit storm settles cause this crap is irritating, (I have 300+ hours)
---
Two things would help with making Whitesprings into a better player hub:
---
\- Free fast travel.
---
\- The fast travel and spawn points are *inside the building* to avoid nukes.
---
If they varied the inventories of the vendors a bit, it would help, but as it is, things are pretty decent, especially with how much traffic it gets due to the nukes.
---
Looks like it's a bonus from intelligence which maxes at 20 for 120% cores. 
---
It's only a couple of plans that change, but they do change. Look for sturdy armor as an example. It's not always there but it does pop up.
---
Wasn't really needed, we already have in game straightjackets if your character has a mental illness.
---
This is why r/Market76 has a karma system and middlemen. 
---
I'd like to play as a team. Unfortunately r/gamerpals has been crickets when it comes to 76...
---
All Rise is decent, but 2* and 3* Legardaries can outclass it.
---
 No I don't care. The whole legendary thing leaves me cold. I won't be standing still anywhere, and that one always amused me.
---
 I sell stuff like that for 20 caps to Phoenix or Wallace. Make sure you visit them. ;)
---
I can double check one of my Gatlings, but I think it's also Furious + Firing Speed and, as mentioned, with Martial Arts. That thing is rock solid and lasts faaaaaaaaaaar longer than a Plasma or Laser Gatling against the queen. I don't even use Luck of the Draw.
---
Curious why the experience is so different.
---
How many points do you have in Luck? 
---
I know there should be, but after the first hour of gameplay that machanic stopped working, all map markers dont appear until I re-log, and thus server hop from my drop 
---
10 months from now? Probably. Ya drama queens. 
---
Are you on PS4? I'll team up with you üòä
---
I knew something was making me feel like fallout was there somewhere! That's exactly it honestly, all the stuff that happened before us would have made a pretty decent fallout story if we were actually there instead of what we got.
---
Ok now I just think you're trolling
---
Something like the tesla cannon or even a heavy laser rifle would work. 
---
Will add that Sugar Grove has a ton of springs too (battered clipboards &lt;3), as well as a legendary (mostly, sometimes it's just a crown) at the end.
---
Yeah, theoretically if you could survive the trip you could head to the abandoned waste dump as soon as you leave vault 76. In practicality there is very little chance you‚Äôd get that far without dying repeatedly.
---
I put stuff in the Overseer's Cache in Flatwoods at least once or twice a day.
---
Don't enjoy the game? Don't play. Play something else and wait. If nothing changes, then you have to admit, that it was an error to buy/preorder the game and wait longer next time. Read and watch videos that are positiv and negativ about the game. 
---
What? Really?? And where might one find a shitload of fire extinguishers plix?
---
Yeah me too, My guess is Bethesda is messing with the weights of different items and looks like somethings have become heavier .. might be a reporting glitch and not accurate ..
---
Found a Mr. Veterinary that had a line of cats following it the other day just north of Flatwoods right by Slocum Joes. Didn‚Äôt give me a quest or anything but it was pretty rad. 
---
Yeah, white springs got fucked from a 3 star perspective but exp is still insane.
---
Gotta hand it to these devs.  They cannot figure out how to bug fix, or even implement basic good game design for the life of them, but they sure as hell know how to jump up and nerf the fuck out of anything we find to enjoy in this tire fire.
---
Into longer suspect fallout 76 was done poorly on purpose ( I mean, even complete failures can get something right) , I know for certain now.
---
Not sure as to why yet, but damn.
---
Whoops, I was at work and glossed over the link since I can't open it. Just took a look on my phone... yea, I think we're actually currently at the same height. I used a 5x5 as the first tier up and then extended stairs down from there, I just didn't build the full 7x7 lower level. 
---
Sweet! So I set up a discord server called (inscrutably enough) FO76 Archaeological Society (FAS). Uncertain about posting the link here but I've sent it to everyone who commented, and the OP u/33Games.
---
If you want to buy things from randoms in-game with caps, go ahead.  Beware you can't see 1 perk on 3 star items.
---
If you're doing risky trades (item for item, drop to upgrade) with randoms in-game FULL STOP.  Do NOT do that....lol
---
Go to FO76 Market and do that stuff there.  Don't do risky trades with anyone less than 40-50 karma.  If they scam you, they can get banned off the subreddit and lose all of their karma.  I have 300+ trades done there and haven't been scammed once.  It helps that once you get to 100+ karma you can say "you trade first".
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/new/)
---
p.s.  There is no way to upgrade armor to 4-5 stars right now.
---
I've reported this myself, twice. but you've missed my posts.
---
first it was a legendary chameleon wood chest piece about 2 months ago, vanished as I spawned in the world after logging in. then a resistant harness couple weeks ago on fast travel. neither were favorited. also a full set of T51b a few days ago, although I suspect this one is unrelated.
---
I've reported it to Bethesda after a CM here said they'd pass the issue along but I fear nothing will be done due to the obscure nature of the bug, doesn't seem easy to replicate. I don't play with my main anymore because of this.
---
like you said, the issue never seems to gain traction. it's absurd that one of the core mechanics is so fundamentally flawed. we shouldn't be under a constant threat of losing legendaries we farmed so long for. if they can't fix it, at least put a system in place to restore deleted items. literally every other online game has one.
---
Nothing quite like making pulse or nuka explosives and trading them to friends with low level characters
---
Glad I am not the only 40+ Playing Member of this game
---
Awesome literally the reply I wanted not that the others weren't helpful so having this armor with these effects will be better to use than power armor correct 
---
Nope. All public. They made a damage control letter before Beta 
---
Take your time and read everything. If all you do is try to level and grind gear, you‚Äôll get bored quickly of the lack of endgame. The early and midgame is great if you give it a chance. 
---
only 5 but I seriously don't think that helps with that
---
I think there's one just south of Yellow Sandy Still.
---
Option C? Killing shit having the spin, it stops and there is no loot.  Not even 1 cap.  I guess the satisfaction of the kill itself is it‚Äôs own reward :)
---
 They are hardly killer robots. Well the Assultrons maybe.
---
 My first in that part of the world got to be Major and they did not attack her. My second, my plan whore was running around Watoga at level 13 and after a bit of reflection I decided he did not need to be Major. Its really not very dangerous there. ;)
---
Without the mission your kind of pissing in the wind.
---
Every time I play, fissure site prime or Whitespring appear to be the player hub...
---
I want to say that for silo Charlie it is southwest if you follow the train tracks shown on three map. Been awhile since I played honestly, but I remember it being not far from the buildings. Maybe less the a mile. 
---
Man I suck. I‚Äôve got a job and kids and I have had it since BETA and I‚Äôm only lvl 30.   It‚Äôd probably take me 5 years to put 500 hours into this game. 
---
not sure what your point is so agreed. you too.
---
NOBODY CARES ABOUT GIRAFFE PILOTS, HOW CAN GIRAFFES EVEN PILOT AIRCRAFT
---
 I go right by one on my way to The Whitespring almost everyday.
---
 No fast traveling is just great. ;)
---
And which one would I want for a mid range rifle build ( I'm not a sniper) and I assume u want marine armor or is this impossible to get hold of? 
---
I'm about 148 on Xbox and I find the claw mod rarely at Watoga station but very often at the BoS vendor. Deathclaw Gauntlet is one of my main weapons so I always keep a few extra in case I get a Legendary claw drop i want to mod.   
---
To clarify this is Mod not Plans.
---
You can actually build a bunker. Just look for the caves or tunnels and cross your fingers that they are not camped already.
---
I thought one of them did, Luck or Charisma but I'm not sure lol 
---
WE ONLY REALLY HAVE TROUBLE WITH HELICOPTERS ...... PLANES HAVE WINDOWS WE STICK OUT HEADS OUT OF!
---
Save your ammo. Start out with melee. Avoid the Scorch Beast and Scorch Beast Queen if you're not level 60+ with a great long ranged weapon.
---
Mole men are the best to kill. They drop fair amounts of shotgun ammo and rare junk/scrappables
---
I'm semi-retired.   Your day will come sir, keep mashing that x button, you'll get there.  
---
Yes, currently with Assassin / Sentinel (standing still) and Assassin / Cavalier (sprinting) you can achieve over 100% damage reduction.
---
There is no power armor that can even reach 100% damage reduction.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
No, it was just people not understanding the wonky trade interface.
---
r/iamveryrandom

Since Star Wars Galaxies I have suspected some games intentionally try to selfsabotage because it's not profitable. I don't know enough for sure about costs of running servers and support and development etc. But I have play a lot of MMOs and MMO lite type games, and I have seen a lot of them pretty much self-sabotage themselves that could only be purposeful intent.
---
I honestly don't know. Gave up pistols before I finished perking out the build as my freinds were focusing pistols and we all try to run diffrent builds.
---

---
Ouch.. Trust no one in fo76 unless theyre your actual crew
---
Nevermind, they were in my stash, since there classified as junk and I stored all scrap. Should I scrap them to turn them from stable to pure? whats the difference?
---
My AAE .50 cal disappeared from my inventory so don‚Äôt feel bad.
---
I must have put in close to a thousand hours now and it "only" happened twice. so it's pretty rare.
---
but even one instance in the entirety of the game would be far too many.
---
You'll be back. I'm same age and same story. You cant put it down. STOP LYING!
---
Odds are he gave you the illusion of trust in order for you to let your guard down. He's obviously not trustworthy if he stole your armor and caps. 
---
No would be under junk if it is pure
---
&gt; I should have stopped playing like my friends did 2 months ago. 
---
I say this every time I play this game.
---
There are also legendary type that increase damage resistance by 15% if you're standing still.
---
&gt;  I've played Elite Dangerous just fine for years while dropping 10 or 20 bucks every few months to pimp my rides.
---
And how does the game compare to FO76?  How much more content is there?  How about the end game?  How about stability?  How about inventory management?  You're seriously popping off here about a game that has been out for years now.  If, after years of playing, you start plunking money down, then more power to you.  As it stands, this game has been out for a few months, and is BOMBING.   Hard.   $20 skins are NOT the answer here.    If you want this game to survive, you should be arguing for lower prices too.  Not have the mindset of "I paid $20 for the skin, so you should have to as well," because that's exactly how you are coming off right now.    
---
Seriously, who complains about paying less for something?  You do, evidently.   
---
And it's not even like these skins are fucking hard to make, so don't even try to sell me on that dogshit.  Most of these skins are re-used FO4 assets, that have ZERO place being in the fucking store to begin with.  
---
It's not. Its basically a shitty buggy broken multiplayer fallout4 with no real depth.
---
Oh.... I need to know the answer to this. Someone please test and confirm, lmao.
---
Yeah man answered all the questions I needed answering thank u very much üëç 
---
Yeah, the RNG in the legendary system isn't ideal for me either.
---
It would be nice if you could SCRAP legendary items for a 5% chance to pull a legendary mod off for a 1 time use attachment to other armors (like X01 jetpack mods).
---
Then you could get your Heavy Combat Armor AND add whatever legendary effects you wanted.  Maybe you don't like sentinel and you concentrate on AP refresh or +1 Strength mods instead.  It would allow you to customize your armor how you wanted.
---
That would be some grind I would LOVE to do :)
---
Brilliance.
---
Agree. You should be able to at least pop a stealth boy and be able to FT in these situations. I tried doing this over the weekend and was still in \[danger\]...
---
This. I dumped 13 1* weapons and 4 1* armor into the suitcase outside of the whitesprings station vendor last night, so I could fast travel to the SBQ fight, just to get a 3* f'ing cavalry sword. Well worth the 1200+ 5.56 rounds...
---
Ditto!
---
I found that sneaking in power armor tends to produce the \[danger\] message. 
---
As well as a cross server Auction House of some sort. I get the idea of the soon to be launched vending machines would it require you to be logged in in order to sell anything and would you sell much with the limited amount of players on each server? We'll have to wait and see I guess. 
---
Three of us started FO76 together and it was wonderful. Bugs or not, running with your friends, building houses and getting yourselves killed in new and unique ways makes for a ton of fun.
---
Things becoming even heavier and taking up more stash - finally, this is exactly what the community asked for 
---
Hopefully a glitch.  No one asked for things to be made heavier.
---
Vendor terminals? Sounds Boring. how about rentable storefronts that you can decorate? like the whitesprings stores.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt have passed this game entirely to a B-team. 
---
Shouldn‚Äôt have spurned all the modders that could fix the bugs and improve features. 
---
Shouldn‚Äôt have been way smaller than any previous fallout game in terms of quests and story. 
---
 I have Enclave underarmor and its Strength oriented. I just have to generate some flux and I'll have 3 Strength. ;)
---
Or they need to update and sanitize it.  If they put the wrong thing on the road map then Yongyea will have a vid up within the hour. 
---
Charisma have wroten in pipboy that it increases reward for group quests, but we are probably talking about amound of caps you get.
---
Expect to be frustrated... a lot 
---
They still refused to give companions a vacuum equivalent for so long‚Äîliterally years of people bitching and so few people using them outside of Kuva farming and a few other very specific tasks.
---
It‚Äôs all broken as fuck.

Don‚Äôt even bother trying to hoard anything, as every 15-60 minutes you‚Äôll get killed and drop everything in your junk tab (read all building mats for everything), and then next death, next server crash, next bug, you lose it all.  So, basically you will almost always lose what you carry, because it‚Äôs going to happen constantly.
---
Also, they implemented this awesome game design feature where mobs spawn in an area based off a nearby characters level, then they persist near indefinitely.
---
That means, 1 high level dude passing through any low area randomly will leave Uber mobs behind for you to stumble over.  That‚Äôs any and everywhere.
---
Does it block quests? Yep.  
---
Get you killed in lowbie towns to where you have to log off and lose all progression on a quest your on, which then usually bugs your quest and fucks you anyways?  Yep.
---
Cause you to want to rage quit constantly when you have to walk through or near a popular quest/farm area because you have to get somewhere and you can‚Äôt fast travel because you haven‚Äôt been there?
---
Fuck yeah.
---
It‚Äôs so not worth it.  It really isn‚Äôt.
---
I‚Äôve been a fan since Troika did it right in fo 1, and I literally adore the ips background world, but after 2 weeks of trying to muddle through this shit, I‚Äôve not really enjoyed more than a few minutes here ir there and it‚Äôs been nothing but a frustrating cluster fuck that‚Äôs made me angry.
---
Do you relax by getting angry and irritated?  I don‚Äôt.  Games just fucked.
---
Sorry you bought in.
---
Armor type is really a secondary concern.
---
Sentinel "whatever" is your best bet.  That's 15% off damage for each piece, and it stacks.  So a full set of random leather, trapper, combat, marine..........that is all sentinel............gets you 75% total damage reduction BEFORE taking the armor's damage reduction into play.
---
All you need to do is stand still.  If you're getting rushed / pressured, run away and stand still somewhere else.
---
In an ideal world you would want heavy combat armor and marine armor pieces that are sentinel, but those are hard to trade for.  In the meantime just go for "any sentinel" pieces.
---
I believe this is correct, the prime receivers have generally a higher base damage then the others, and then the ultracite ammo gives you another 10(30?)% boost when dealing with scorched mobs (ultracite powered is the actual hook I think)
---
To drop PA permanentl, remove the fusion core then drop the PA from your inventory.
---
Happened to me last night too, playing on xbone. I find it helps if you just let the game load an extra minute before going to your pipboy. Not that this should be a solution, a bug is a bug, but it's helped me.
---
I know how it goes my man, I never went to combat but I was in the Army for 11 years and was also an artilleryman of sorts for eight of them. If you're on Xbox Live add me.
---
TEH RED ZMAN
---
I have gone over if I was near full and scrapped a bunch of stuff in build mode at my camp.
---
Did i say mine did captain fucknut?
---
Stable and Pure are the same thing.
---
Raw Flux is from radiation zone plants and decomposes very quickly.  Takes a lot to make one Stable (Pure) from the Raw.
---
Arn't things you have built and scrapped added to your stash?
---
"Skyrim series" hmmmmmmm
---
I would literally come back to this game if they just stabilized it and fixed the glitches around the stuff that was already there.  
---
I don't need new content because I haven't even played \*what is already there\*...
---
I've noticed something strange. I've had legendary weapons/armor appear in non-legendary enemies' corpses. My theory is that the game tracks how many legendary enemies you kill and how many legendary items you pick up. So if you kill a legendary and the loot doesn't spawn, you might find a legendary item on another enemy at a later time. 
---
Has anyone else noticed this?
---
Yup. Happened serveral times after the patch. Ive dropped at least 300-400 ultracite ammo per run for no loot.
---
You left out a comma and I would appreciate if you correctly capitalized Captain Fucknut.
---
Captain Fucknet is telling you to move along now, intellectual giant.
---
the bonus is not additive. it procs one after the other, so for assassin it'd look like 100 \* 8% = 92 \* 8% = 84,64, etc.
---
What are the most common armor type to have it? 
---
Can't do the simple math to see hours spent for money paid, and calls the Elder Scrolls, Skyrim, seems this is definitely the right game for you. 
---
MMOs will definitely get you there, especially back in the FFXI/Everquest days!
---
I had 2400+ hours on my first FFXI character, and never even made it to max level with any job.
---
Or even unofficially. I can't find anything
---
One of the best, if not the best, endgame weapons for a rifle/criticals build (there's also The Dragon if you don't mind the insane reload time).
---
When you come out of the escape hatch after launching (if you don't just fast travel out) you exit through a porta-john at the scenic overlook to the south-south-west along the ridge.  Would assume the actual silo cap is somewhere near there.
---
I joined up with some people on a Fallout discord and having a community to play with makes it a lot more enjoyable. 
---
That they have, and they‚Äôve done it damn well
---
Fair enough, except the last couple of times I‚Äôve played (a few weeks back)  there were two of us in a server for about 4 hours or so. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd wait that long before kicking us out 
---
Barron Harkonnen would be proud!
---
I'm not even sure about mods. Maybe they can't be scrapped, but i had two go missing last night.   
---
I had five mods in my inventory. I can't remember what they all were, but i found an assault rifle suppressor. I got excited to try it out, so i went to my bench to craft the AR. And the suppressor simply wasn't there. Backed out of the bench menu, and i only had three mods in inventory.
---
I've had stuff go missing from time to time, but i just chalked it up to making a mistake and accidentally selling or dropping a thing. But i'm sure none of that happened here.   
---
For me, when she disappears, her loot is still in a meat pile. The only times I haven't been able to loot her was from getting DC'd. Granted, maybe there's an additional bug I haven't encountered that you have. Maybe I've just been lucky that the spinning inventory has always resolved, with a bit of patience.
---
This was the first time from server hopping.  First one was when i fixed a leg. pipe bolt action sniper rifle i was using a few months ago.  Fixed it and never saw it again.  Wasnt special, so it was not missed.  Around chrismas, was the second time, lost a 40% faster swinging  junkie pipe wrench when trying to fix it.  Third time was about 2 weeks ago, lost a lvl 20 explosive western revolver that i put in my stash, saw go into my stash, and then vanish from my stash.  No bag on the ground, was not back in my inventory, just plain vanished.  
---
If I had to guess, it doesn't matter the order.
---
Then again I don't own the game, so don't take my word for it! 
---
look for the meat pile. the last 2 times i killed her her corpse dissapeared as well. But there was a meat pile. look around for it. it is there.
---
I like the dedicated loot server concept, not sure if
---
It'a that or something else, ironically I posted a "architecture" thread yesterday..  See if any of it clicks.
---
[I've got a new theory regarding the Servers and stability](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apb0pn/ive_got_a_new_theory_regarding_the_servers_and/)
---
fixed it..happy?
---
Troll Bethesda: shut off the servers so nobody can play the game thus making it a self-fulfilling promise.
---
I've tried countless times, finally got one yesterday morning in the bunker. Couldn't believe it! Now I need one more...
---
Mine was over by 4 lbs, and I noticed that some things moved from my inventory to stash automatically when I logged off.. I was like, WTF? The main thing I noticed, were my mods
---
Wow, this came up for me as an issue this weekend, i did the same thing, and later that night a friend of mine starts ranting about- guess what? THIS!
---
it seems we all lost alot of plastic this weekend
---
I know I‚Äôm late to the party on this thread but I just had to google it because it happened to me.  This is dumb.  I‚Äôm ok getting the bounty if I‚Äôm doing something wrong, but the stupid game gave me a temporary quest on the side of my screen to retrieve the supply drop!  C‚Äômon Bethesda!
---
 He has taken Black Powder Pistols from both my chars. Apart from that he has left me alone. ;)
---
Thought kne of the recent patches fixed that?
---
Yeah I have gotten them that way aswell, I always though it was just an rng thing though, but yeah, anything is possible. I also wondered if somehow it was being team looted like when I see an item disappear maybe my team and I are sharing the loot based upon things they hit and I didn't or vise versa 
---
SMH - The Overseer called us the best and the brightest, and yet we're not working together. We can't join our camps together to form Voltron, we can't sell our stuff to each other. I really want to understand what Vault Tec's plan really was when everyone crawls out of Vault 76.  Were we supposed to be contacted by a government official? Shouldn't we have been assigned to teams or areas of expertise?
---
Nope! - Just everybody go out individually and make the world a better place, on your own. Wut?!?
---
I tell my wife the same thing all the time, I understand. 
---
to be fair, thats part of the issue.
---
Fallout has always been about player agency. a fallout game without player agency feels..wrong.
---
Ouch...
---
Sad part is he apparently played long enough to get a full set of 3* Heavy Combat Armor with BOS Mods, but believed a person who said they had a Plan that could add a 4th Legendary Modification to their armor and proceeded to trade them caps and their entire armor set?
---
I hope not.
---
Omg this would be great! Kind of like how call of duty ww2 has headquarters. That would really be great because I usually end up just dropping things me or my friends don‚Äôt need because you can‚Äôt sell some things to vendors and it would really be great to have a place to go to sell your things to others or like you said just hang out. Fallout better see this that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying. 
---
this is the oldest trick in the book my guy
---
16.8cents per hour if you payed $80 for it on release 
---
.28 cents per minute so roughly every 4 minutes it cost you 1 cent. 
---
Yeah, if it is a supply drop someone put in a request for, then it is for them and stealing from it will cause a bounty. If it is a general random supply drop or one that is shot down you wont get a bounty.
---
I always put stuff in a suitcase or lunchpail nearest the train vendor.
---
Trimming bronze armor 25k
---
It's funny because that doesn't exist. 
---
I lost my deathclaw gauntlet. Decided to make a new character to not risk anything on my main or alt 
---
If anyone is interested in teaming up and exploring this stuff in game I've created a discord server to that end called FO76 Archaeological Society. There aren't many of us, but if you'd like to join up sometime and check some of this stuff out in game send me a message and I will send you the link to the server.
---
Oh wow.
---
I love my 3* instigating/25% faster firerate/250 defense when reloading gausse. I am still working on getting all the mods for it, but it is satisfying. It is also pretty effective to fire without charging,because ammo is dirt cheap and the gausse is pretty durable. It pairs well with my tesla rifle. If only I could find an executioner's tesla, they would be the perfect combo.
---
Ya me and other ppl do the same thing, my last Scorchbeast Queen kill we looked for her meat pile for 30min before ppl finally gave up and left the nuke zone. I‚Äôm on PC so idk if it‚Äôs just a PC thing or not.
---
right? lol
---
I also did some testing and you can get 3 free agility perks if you don't take action boy. Rejuvenated and action boy stack but it's almost worthless. 
---
I drained my ap to 0 and timed it several times until it filled. My adverage results were: 
---
5.23 secs to filled with action boy 3
---
5.30 sec with rejuvenated 2
---
5.14 secs with both
---
In conclusion on a pistol build which is very agi heavy take rejuvenated and free up some more perks for pistols.
---
I've had this happen with 100 bulk screws. The worst 
---
The problem is they're having extreme difficulty with server performance, camp budgets, and stash size currently.  Adding in more things like rented storefronts with 50-100 camp like decorations is going to add more strain on the servers.
---
They're already going to have to accept a small dent in performance for 24 vendor terminals in one location.  The servers can probably handle that.  Adding 1,200 to 2,400 camp items on top of 24 vendor terminals to that one area would probably cause most people to crash out immediately.
---
If the game was more stable, optimized, and could handle it.............I'd love to see those custom stores :) 
---
Unfortunately it's not  :(
---
Rifles / weapons are more complicated than just a buff.  
---
They need a full balance overhaul, honestly.  
---
From base weapon weight and what happens when you mod the weapons (weight wise) to changing the damage to based on caliber and barrel length (which would also effect accuracy).  
---
Guns should be a pain to maintain, ammo should be heavy, but that should also pack a punch.. It shouldn't take 5 salvos with a shotgun at point blank range to kill "trash mobs"
---
The three Ws of legendary farming, Whitesprings, Watoga, West-Tek
---
I had a squeaker follow me across the wasteland with a hotmic on begging for me to trade with him, he kept letting me know he wouldnt attack me as he was about 50 levels higher than me, but I ignored him, he just kept asking over and over and over
---
 I was overencumbered so I couldnt just run away or fast travel
---
finally i got to the train station i was trying to get to, and as i was selling stuff he just kept over and over asking me to trade with him **PLEEEEASE!**
---
finally I could hear his mom saying "well maybe he doesnt want to trade with you"
---
then I could heat the kid ask his mom if she would watch him play for a while, she gave a  pretty mean reply back that she would NOT watch him play.
---
So, after all that, i felt bad for the kid as i was ignoring him and his own mom was ignoring him, so finally i accepted a pretty meaninless trade just to make him happy.
---
To further prove your point Tylor09, next week we're getting another version of Skyrim! No i'm kidding. At least I hope I am. In the last few years with making mods paid for, Skyrim spam, 76... It's looking like the finance department is running the show.
---
Anthem will murder fo76
---
I found them on responder vendors 
---
there is a great cave underneath a road near Harper's Ferry.  It spawns with a med kit and an ammo box.  
---
No way they say that? They'd be literally lying 
---
why do you have to come and shit on a game in a post where someone is just trying to share some of the fun they've had? not sayin' you can't hate it, just that this probably isn't the right venue, y'know?
---
Pretty sure the Children of Atom won't exist for another 100-150 years based on the 76 setting. With that being said, they are a North-East faction(cult) and probably wouldn't appear in West Virginia regardless of time-frame. 
---
AND your meth's worth
---
Best advice is to just try playing the game, tbh. That wasn't a facetious comment at all. Please consider some other points of view:
---
There are optimised builds out there (I made a few), and....you don't need them. The game is easy, and you can do well picking perks and items you like.
---
There are optimal leveling paths, but wow...what a way to ruin this game. It's fine to level an alt. You first toon should take it slower, explore, listen to the holos, read the notes, and enjoy the jumpscares. It's FAR more fun.
---
Power armour is probably going to be your friend. If you're not a fan, that's OK, but unfortunately some engine issues (hidden damage resistance and radiation resistance on power armor) make running "normal" armour a bit harder. Not much, so you might enjoy the challenge. Make that "probably" a "maybe". Both are fun to try out.
---
Yes, there are "best" weapons. Some combinations of modifiers along with perks/armor/playstyle are very powerful but....it's just not needed. I run the laziest damn build in the game (which took me quite some time to figure out, actually), use a decent rifle I found early, and never run into anything I can't kill.
---
Pick up whatever looks interesting. Junk, weapons, holos, armour, notes, booze, food, recipes, plans....whatever. Take some time to check it all out, and just chill a bit.
---
Caps are worth....bus tickets. They're travel money. You will never buy food, drink or ammo from a vendor. If you engage with the trading community (outside game, on other subs, unfortunately) you may see them in a different light. You might also develop plan-collecting addiction, which many of us have. Otherwise though....caps are not a thing :)
---
Dying is OK. Seriously. You'll drop your junk, so try not to carry 1000 springs, but most stuff is either recoverable or easily abandonable. PvP deaths might cost you a few caps if you're wanted, but unless you manage to become The Psycho Of The Wastelands, it's not a big amount, and can be another route to fun :)
---
Grouping is awesome. People talk! They really do!! But you might have to go first :) Figure out where push-to-talk is on your controller/keyboard and try it sometimes. The reactions can be amazing, and in my experience at least 1 in 2 will speak back. The in-game mechanisms (if you use them you can get a little more XP, maybe some of someone else's skill or mutation, some healing perhaps?) are very nice, but I wouldn't stress about those either. Nice if they happen, otherwise just have fun.
---
Honestly? It's a good game. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it (hopefully) has potential, and the atmosphere is great if you give it a chance. The storytelling is really not bad at all, and there are some genuinely emotional moments. Those are worth finding, and absorbing. But give it a fair chance.
---
Anyhow. Hope to see you in the Wasteland :)
---
Istaria
---
Alright alright alright...thanks my man.  Wow...I did get a deal.
---
I don't "kind of" miss them...I've primarily gone back to fallout 4. I'm actually doing a raider playthrough with KingGath's latest mod. And that's fine, because I'm killing \_NPC's\_. I log into 76 for like half an hour, get disconnected two or three times, have every fucking mob in the zone load in and murder me before the graphics are fully rendered, or get murdered by some pathetic fucking sociopath, and call it a day.   
---
These player raiders are sociopathic assholes who get their fun from intentionally making the game \_less\_ fun for other people. The fact that \_you\_ enjoyed this interaction is an aberration...good for you, but these \_sacks of shit\_ are the biggest reason, beyond the buggy nature of the game, It's getting less and less fun to play for a lot of us.   
---
There's no rational defense for those assholes, in my mind. 
---
What's with the open signs 
---
That‚Äôs when you dis-own this shitty buggy kid, and adopt the cool black kid Anthem
---
Do still need this done?
---
It would be really awesome if they added a way to level up legendary items. I get way too many low level items. 
---
Not every hater now was a hater 2-3 months ago, friend.
---
That's like 11+ hours a day *every day* since the game came out. You must really want those 20 atoms for 7600 hours.
---
Yessir. As long as you have ordnance express it literally works like a more fun more powerful pre Nerf TSE 
---
‚ÄúHa, just kidding guys, that wasn‚Äôt the game. No no, THIS is the real game. The one with all the features and stuff. So we‚Äôre uh, just gonna need a liiiiiiittle bit more money...‚Äù
---
It sure as shit ain‚Äôt the creative side running the show. 
---
Of course, this always comes back to the [interview clip by Steve Jobs](https://youtu.be/-AxZofbMGpM)  that sums up the current state of Bethesda succinctly. 
---
The two easiest places I have found a Raider power armor are.. 
---
Just east of Vault 76 there is a workshop called Gorge junkyard. There is a trailer in there with a 3-star lock on it and inside of that spawns a random suit of raider power armor.
---
There is also a raider Camp North of Clancy Manor at the northwest corner of the map. One also spawns here and is relatively easy to get. This Camp is called the Crosshair.
---
It would be same garbage or even more garbage, because F76 problem is that no one has bothered actually design online game. They took F4, threw server behind it, stripped some features and called a day. They didn't bother actually design mechanics how PVP should work or how endgame should work. All they did is they took monster from single player game, ramped up its HP so that monster would take some time to be killed, but they never bothered actually design mechanics for groups to play with. They even didn't understand how their weapon effects works. 3 months later- ohh yeah TSE is too OP.
---
Trading glitch was real. Just patched. Wasn't a fake bug. 
---
If he was from one of the trading/crafting subreddits or discords then report his name. Can't get your stuff back but you can smear people enough so no one worthwhile will trade with them. We don't want people like that in the market servers anyway
---
Actually, we can...I spend less and less time in this game every day, because of shit like this, and the fucking sociopathic griefers that bethesda is doing NOTHING to prevent from ruining their core audience's gameplay.   
---
Because this shit isn't ok. "Oh, you have to grind for LITERAL HOURS to do this shit, and you get...five bullets?" there's no argument where that's acceptable. 
---
Nah, they haven't even became a thing yet
---
I have a level 35 two shot version of one, and before I got my hands a TSE lever action, it was my go to gun.
---
Yep I'm on right. Don't like using the hunting rifle. 
---
The multiplier IS 25%...
---
I find them all over the place. They aren't red like the one's you're used to seeing, they're gray. 
---
That's not necessarily true, though... Lower player count means fewer people who might buy their insanely over-priced cosmetic "dlc" shit. 
---
That locked cabana at Whitesprings will be 400 square feet of ***^(AWESOME)*** ***^(!)***. 
---
heheheh i like your thinking
---
Hmm.  I've been playing for a couple months now and never seen it at all.  Does it even have a use?
---
First couple of days after the patch I noticed it a lot - always in Caution, sometimes in Danger with no enemies in site. This weekend I played quite a bit on Friday Night, Saturday and Sunday and did not notice it. One thing I did do, before I got started was remove all my perk cards and reset them and I have not had any issues since I did that.
---
***SLOTH-ZILLA!***
---
Username is DARKVAMPIREKING 
---
It gets way worse, the effect gets passed to other players (grouped or not).  Targeting HUDs are the real scourge of Appalachia.   I removed mine and 90% of my CTDs went away.  Now when I see the targeting effect I know a crash is not too far off.
---
They desperately need to add a glowing highlight to the corpse/pile. It‚Äôs especially frustrating in the cranberry bog where everything is a red tint. 
---
Why do you want it? You can't make mods for the thing. 
---
Something similar happened to me. Spawned after death to near the sons of Dane compound (somewhere I have not been yet) When the screen finally loaded I was facing a mountain with a cliff about 100 feet ahead. I all of a sudden was dehydrated, 95%rads with a sliver of health left...was getting the heartbeat sound with extremely slow motion. Right under the cliff was a round UFO half embedded in the ground...at least 3 aliens were shooting their blasters walking toward me. Obviously  it took like 2 shots and I was dead again. Spawned at the compound this time into a hoard of legendary radrats, ghouls and wendigos. All legendary.....and I was in god mode. It was the weirdest thing for me yet
---
Wear something cool and rare like a Mr Fuzzy suit and watch them hump your leg for it.
---
Ive been throwing mine out ... 
---
I kind of thought they were going to update us more with what was going on but it appears that is no longer the case I guess. 
---
Watoga Station is generally where I off load stuff.  Sometimes whitesprings.
---
I use the brown bag next to the tinkerer station at Whitesprings station, and the blue lunch pale at watoga station.
---
Sorry I missed your post; gave myself 30 minutes on Saturday to parse based on keywords. The traction concern is I think due to what gets the most noise:  Problems that affect a large audience such as disconnects causing frustration (quest resets, launching nukes and dc/ing, downing SBQ and dc'ing etc.,.). Our problem \*seems\* to be widespread but does not affect everyone, nor can we quantify the frequency or what widespread means. Add doubters to the mix and we complete the circle, back to square 1.  
---
Marry that man!

Water filters and scaly skin serum

I agree. playing by myself is meh. Playing with my friends is fantastic. we do so much dumb shit
---
mg42 can be bought from the vendors in the lewisburg station
---
yeah its a pita, the pile sometimes is in different spots than where she was killed. also different spots for different players. fix this shit bethesda.
---
There's a couple deposits in twin lakes
---
I was going to chime in that white springs is already somewhat of a hub or meeting grounds, usually the most populated place in the map. I always camp the fairway behind pro shop 
---
Any armor.  I've seen Assassin Sentinel Leather, Raider, Marine, Combat, Trapper, etc.  It's RNG if the drop has it.
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.
---
Some of those pieces get traded for caps, other pieces you have to have an item they want.
---
Because it's so rare I have been collecting it. I don't know what it's for but in over 400 hours I think I have about 20.
---
I am not paying over 3K of caps for a plan.....
---
eh, if you want to play then play, if you want to play something else, play something else. It really is that simple. I had some shit happen to me a few weeks ago in this game and I took a break. I naturally came back because I have fun when I play. Play what you like, but Todd isn't going to show up at your front door to beg you to stay over a reddit post.
---
Same here. I've never got anything but 3 tokens and whatever else the extra crap is.
---
They do have a pet vacuum now though and are even redoing Chesa Fetch due to the addition.
---
I'm pretty sure I pick these up because steel, but I never noticed they salvaged into rubber.....
---
Something tells me its going to be really vague and end up being super inaccurate 
---
just take a break and do something else, no big deal. I'm working on some Fallout 4 mods for a spell, wait until there's more shit added and that PvP mode.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
This Reddit has so much misinformation, it hurts. The DR values are multiplicative not additive. Nothing can actually reach 100% damage reduction. 
---
Noice, I had an Assaultron Helmet with my Marine Armor that looked good when it was closed, goofy as hell when it was open. Bad thing was it got rid of my Veil of Secrets mask so I got rid of it, and am back to my dirty army helmet. I'll have to hunt down a BoS lid. 
---
Have Fun.
---
Its men at best
---
There are a couple of veins around, I know Gauly mine has a vein, it's hard to find in there, but it is there, 3 areas you can pull from. Just hit the various deposits or put your camp next one to farm if you don't have a permanent home. Pretty sure one of the workshops would hopefully have one to farm as well.
---
True but it‚Äôs still more communication than what Beth has given us...besides the ‚Äúwe will pass this one to the developing team‚Äù
---
Almost seems like the fallout dev‚Äôs have just fallen out
---
*mic drop*
---
The more the better 
---
I like to ask all the people who demonstrably quit how much time they spent on the game.  
---
Invariably it's near-100 hours and they're level 80+.  If it's so bad, why'd you keep playing?
---
That many people don't keep playing because "I thought it would get better."  You play because you're getting something out of it.
---
I know I have.  I only have 170 hours in, but I definitely got my money's worth if I quit today/
---
\^ THIS. Everything else is ignorant guesswork. I still spawn them at level 160-something, but ONLY if you are the first one to spawn them after a refresh. I've had them spawn with appropriate attire at the clubhouse, the little houses next to the pool, and the greens to the north-west of the clubhouse but still south of the NW entrance where that pit is.
---
Not sure what's causing it, but it doesn't affect Melee weapons, as I have been using my Death Tambo a lot lately and haven't repaired it in weeks.
---
A friend has a Ghoul Slayers, Exp. Handmade, that doesn't seem affected, but his TSE SG, lasts no time at all (He is not using "Luck of the Draw"), I literally broke 4 weapons (From 200% repaired) on a single SBQ battle yesterday.
---
Search spreadsheet in the fo76 search bar...
---
You'll find tons
---
The idiotic decision to spend so many resources on PVP destroyed any chance of this being fallout 5.
---
Had my base down near a coal deposit with an extractor down on it best way to get some.
---
I tell myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never preorder again‚Äù but here I am preordered fallout 76...guess my blind faith in Bethesda got the best of me.... I am a HUGEEEEE TES fan...and it sucks to say but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get it.
---
I suspect you're right. So unfortunate.
---
I'd just like a terminal at the Military camps (McClintock, etc.) where you could "Turn In" griefers to the "Military Police" and have the MPs "hunt them down".  Nobody gets the bounty, and a swarm of Military Robots are sent after them, and if those bots are defeated, it orbital strikes the bountied player.  When the "AWOL" soldier is "taken into custody" they get put in a cell (that only has the cell as a fast-travel point) and doesn't allow 'escape' for a period of time.  Even changing servers/logging off won't change their position.
---
Of course, such a system would be potentially exploitable as well.
---
And the people claiming 'realism' don't seem to realize the only living humans in Appalachia in FO76 are the ones from Vault 76.  Everyone else is either a feral ghoul, Scorched, mutated by FEV into super mutants, or dead.  The raiders aren't coming here.  They tried, everyone died or turned into scorched.  The place is a huge graveyard that the survivors of Vault 76 got released into.
---
The few raiders that got out?  Probably killed off by their clans the moment they revealed the scorched plague, for fear they were infected or contagious.  And they weren't going to send any more into the area.  Not as long as their scouts continue to see Scorchbeasts flying in the area from a distance.
---
So anyone claiming to be roleplaying a "raider" isn't really following the lore.
---
Anyone playing in a non-cooperative fashion is going against Vault 76 supposedly being "...only for the best and brightest."  The survivors wouldn't suddenly go batshit crazy and start trying to kill each other.  They'd been working together in the vault for years.  And as a control vault, no funky experimentation is a valid excuse.  And you certainly wouldn't have teams of such psychotics working together to try to kill the rest of the survivors......
---
I just see those claiming it as using it as bad excuse for crummy anti-social behavior online.
---
Do a bloodied build... I‚Äôm pushing 200 damage with Adrenal reaction+strange in numbers, nerd rage, only 3x1* gladiator perks, bloody mess, and that‚Äôs in power armor so no crazy Unyielding strength numbers, and also without any other buffs (no adrenaline stacks, for instance)
---
I just run around in camo T-45 (with emergency protocols chest, for survivability at low health) and an extended blade 1* bloody ripper. Why? Because it‚Äôs awesome.
---
they dont have to be fat, ive notice most griefers are preteens who seem to be nihilistic as nothing really matters to them besides getting "lulz"
---
Well, the bow has shattered off of the ship's frame. They could at least tell us time left until both halves of the ship hit the bottom of the sea.
---
I suppose that's possible, but it shouldn't take weeks on end to adjust a roadmap, but it does take weeks to draft one from the ground up.
---
I use to get 3 tokens for just doing the 3 targets, I don't know if a recent update broke it.
---
Dude...
---
Fallout 76 is pretty far and ahead the buggiest AAA title I have seen in the past decade, possibly ever.
---
That's not hyperbole, at all.
---
I really tried (150+ hours) to like this game.
---
It's performance and stability are absolutely *atrocious.*
---
Would be interested in knowing how many of these were accidental deletions during a scrap or a vendor sale, since we can't LOCK OUR MATERIALS, BETHESDA!!!
---
This one is pretty easy to get you just have to keep turning in technical documents.
---
I KNEW I WASNT CRAZY AND MY ITEMS WERE MISSING
---
Ah don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre gunna get a *sweet* Vault to explore at some point. 
---
I bet it will satisfy everyone in the sub who still enjoys the game. 
---
Stole my thunder.  It's enough that they shoehorned the brotherhood in 
---
Given their track record with this release, if they actually show a road map, it will almost certainly contain the wrong things.
---
You forgot made up controversy every 5 minutes.
---
E.g. trade glitch, no encryption so we're all going to be 'hacked' and be killed from accross the map, have our characters deleted, leaked credit card details... none of that's true. There's at least 3 more I'm forgetting as well. Anybody remember more?
---
Its suppose to be 3 tokens, guess I'll hit all tires now if I get it.
---
Personally, I'd prefer if it just used ultracite instead of nuked flora to craft.  The receivers are difficult to get as is... they limit the ammo type you can fire out of it, and then they are only used for one purpose.  Why not make it easier to craft and give us a reason to use the receivers in the first place?
---
That being said... where's the melee equivalent? 
---
1. Use this map to locate a coal extractor spot that you want to place your camp at:  [https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png](https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png)
---
2. Drop your camp and setup the coal extractor (with power).
---
3. Remove the coal ore from the extractor frequently as it maxes out at 10 ore (not sure how long 10 ore takes).
---
4. When crafting use both CHEMIST and SUPER DUPER perks (for more coal generation).
---
5. If you find yourself running low on acid to smelt the coal, go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar and buy acid from other players for 1 cap each.
---
If you're using it for limited use like Serums, 100+ coal would get you 33 crafts.
---
If you're trying to build water purifiers, that's a complete waste.  CAMP purifiers are basically unlimited purified water.
---
Hopefully you are planning some strange Scaly Skin Serum factory and not expending that much effort on Water Filters for Purified Water.  :)
---
I love that you and your family played together- a family that games together, stays together! 
---
Well considering the Brotherhood is in this game, might as well add the Children of Atom. While they are at it, bring in The Railroad :/
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

Achievement for weapon plans, maybe
---
I see the Flatwoods monster near my camp around the Hunterville ? area, just waste of WhiteSpring Resort, in my opinion too often, but he pops up now and then in the mountains.  One time he showed right at my camp and started destroying it .. he is. bit of a pain to kill with regular weapons, but throwing grenades at him non stop or with a TSE is quite doable.
---
Well thats why I'm wondering if its broken yesterday servers were really laggy. Still don't get why one day I got 0 tokens for doing it correctly and yesterday only 1, usually 1 token means you participated but failed 0 haven't seen that before. I wish we could just do all 3 a day so messing up wouldn't hurt so much.
---
Go back in time to before Bethesda destroyed the legendary system, like they're slowly doing to every fun thing about this fucking sinking ship of a game. I haven't found a \_single\_ non-shit weapon in hundreds of hours of gameplay. 
---
No kidding. I easily spend 8 hours on a multiplayer game, and I always set my single player to lower speeds 
---
Dude!!! Just tried this, got about 210 raw violet flux. If I do this again I'll probably drop it a little to the west of exactly in between hemlock holes and the water slide and I might hit 250 like you said. 
---
Very awesome advice buddy, thank you very much!!!
---
&gt;&gt; to include PvP AT ALL
---
..ftfy.
---
I think I have at least 1,000 hours in that game lol
---
Oof. FO76 has been my latest learning experience unfortunately. I've enjoyed hundreds of hours of it, but my hope has been worn out pretty much completely. Not preordering ever may be the lesson I learn. Maybe.
---
The problem is that it has gotten worse over time, more so recently. Now it's simply unbearable. 
---
Not mine.  Every time I build/scrap the scrapped junk piles up in my inventory and I have to go deposit it all again.
---
My go to for scorchbeasts is a Gauss with a recon scope. Crit shots melt them.
---
the npcs are necessary! I hate talking to a computer, or listening to a voice that supposes I do something 
---
can not be compared to fallout 4, even with fallout new vegas in the sense of the npcs and all their lines of voices 
---
Ahh good call thanks
---
It could be spoiled meat, vegetables, or raw flux.
---
Raw flux spoils pretty quickly into INERT FLUX and goes from like 0.1 to 1.0 pounds.
---
Check your Aid tab for Inert Flux and Spoiled Meat / Vegetables.
---
yeh i agree they would have to pick and choose what they read i guess as there would be a ton of feedback not all of it is positive or good.
---
Lol yep
---
I tried it too (xbox) no reward also
---
Seems like we are :)
---
41 and feel the same, i will play for the next week until far cry is out then jump onto that, might still take 10min to do cap runs and build up my caps for when the game is updated with content. Im level 170
---
It‚Äôs entirely why I am upset about the game. 
---
But the important thing I‚Äôve come to accept is that for there to be a successful Co-op/MMO version of Fallout they need to completely go back to the drawing board and get a more talented team (or more resources, not sure which). 
---
They can‚Äôt just use assets and combat gameplay mechanics that were designed for an RPG where you can freeze time and choose body parts to shoot at now that they are always in real time. 
---
The enemy AI was not play tested and crafted with 100% FPS shooting only combat mechanics. 
---
It‚Äôs no fun backpedaling with a pistol down a road for 100 yards while trying to take out dogs. That is not a fun gameplay moment. 
---
The AI simply is not crafted for this game. 
---
If you store raw flux, it decays into inert and gets 10x as heavy.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I loved fo76, until I got to the ‚Äúend game‚Äù then it just became tedious maintaining with very little reward for the risks
---
Maybe that's the one I'm thinking of? I might be confusing the two
---
Yeah, the fact that they made a disclaimer out of it makes me assume that real, interactable npcs, were removed for server stability reasons, and not for the better of the story. 
---
For fuck sake stop overblowing the Atom Shop updates.  There's a reason that shit gets released on such a consistent schedule and it's NOT because they have their entire team working on it instead of actual content.  It's almost all old Fallout 4 assets and reskins, that's the kind of shit they finished months ago all at once and now just have releasing on a set schedule.  Even then whatever design people they do have working on new assets aren't the same people who would be working on code for patches.  
---
üòÇ we‚Äôre lucky to already play call of duty together.  She‚Äôs hardcore into shooters and I‚Äôve been trying to get her into RPGs with hybrids like fallout on my end and her getting into the division more on the shooter end.  Fallout 76 could have won us over BIGTIME, but didn‚Äôt.
---
Just saw them the other day. Watched for a while wondering if I should join in at some point. LOL
---
There‚Äôs a wrecked train in the savage divide, that has coal. Like on the ground and such. I believe it‚Äôs just south of Top of the World.
---
There‚Äôs like several structures. Some prewar, some raider fortifications. The train goes between two cliffs. 
---
Sorry I can‚Äôt give more information.
---
"where you could "Turn In" griefers": That wouldn't be exploitable if only the ones who were attacked (or had their camps attacked) were able to turn them in.  Also, it would be good if low level bounties (like 5-10 caps) could be "paid to the magistrate" by the wanted person - it's too easy to accidentally damage a camp.  In the real world, low level offenders would be given a chance to "come along peacefully" before the guns are drawn.
---
As far as: "So anyone claiming to be roleplaying a "raider" isn't really following the lore." I disagree with you.  I remember a few vault dwellers that emerged and decided to become raiders.  I can't remember the specifics, but I think there were a couple in F3, and there was someone who sold out his whole clan to the Legion.  But I agree that they are rare.
---
God himself could come down from heaven to present the most perfect roadmap ever conceived and youtubers would still shit on it because that's what gets them views.
---
I have items repeatedly disappear - tactical gauss rifle, all technical documents, bulk springs for example - and also appear in my inventory. Most notably a full set of lvl 15 raider power armour and the daisycutter which both appeared suddenly while I was at the big Red Rocket, putting me well over weight limit.  Yesterday  following a server disconnect I was given a lvl 50 combat shotgun with a long recon scope (!) .  Lvl57, XBOX. 
---
My condolences to you bud, You are more than welcome at /r/fo76filthycasuals,  we're mostly friendly over there and more than happy to squad up with you when you are up for playing again. 
---
I find about 1 good thing every couple days. I still have yet to find a tse in the wild or any cavalier/sentinel piece. 
---
The BOS present is lore-bending but not impossible. One could argue that they left their bunker before previously documented. Having the RR or Children of Atom would be lore-breaking entirely. 
---
It's in the process of being finalized, I'm really hoping to share it soon. We want to be detailed without giving away too many spoilers on what's to come. I've previously mentioned before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajp8a5/please_release_a_planned_roadmap/eeymseh) that taking care of known issues and user reports have delayed us locking down specific dates for content drops, which contributed to a delay in the roadmap releasing. 
---

" Due to tool limitations, we are unable to restore items or characters. This does mean we are unable to restore your missing items from your stash box. However, we would be more than happy to provide troubleshooting steps to help prevent this from happening again  "  
---
So basically yeah, because I know for a fact you could spawn items in other Fallout games via console, and this is basically Fallout 4 with multiplayer crowbar'd(poorly) into it.
---
Plus, who ever heard of making a \[censored\] MMO without any way to restore items?
---
What is coal even used for?
---
I mean, not to take away from your post but, pretty much any online game can be fun when playing with others. For example, we were playing L4D2 with some friends, and despite having played it plenty of times and not having any novelty factor, we still laughed our asses off 24/7 with it. Hell, we even played extremely buggy games in the last and still had plenty of fun.
---
So yeah, again, that a game is enjoyable with friends doesn't means the game itself is good, it usually means the company is good more than anything. 
---
I console myself with the assumption that Bethesda Austin is incompetent, rather than predatory and unethical.
---
We need perk freedom!
---
True for stats, but the accumulated gear and perk selection makes a big difference. Level 250 is somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 times the hours on a character (not counting pre-patch exploits). That's a lot of choosing from legendary items, grinding for PA upgrades and dialing in of perk trees. 
---
Then again, there is also a big difference between someone's "first" level 50 and someone's 2nd or 3rd... 
---
A first time level 50 is a patchwork of random level up choices and "oh, we should take gun perks? I took Scrapper and all the endurance food stuff" mess. Very different from a person's 5th character and accompanying spreadsheet-referenced pre-planned level ups with full map knowledge and daily lead farming/vendor routes... ;)  
---
And then there are all those super high level perks that can't be maxed before L 50 (Master Heavy Gunner, Adrenaline et al). Some VERY nasty effects hiding in the post-50 perk selection.  ;)  
---
Id love to see those.
---
I havent seen one yet, im thinking that those dataminers wouldve put one out by now if they could pull it from the game files, which leads me to believe all of that is determined server side (would make sense considering how long some loot takes to load). They probably dont have the tools to datamine the servers, and if they do, they probably wouldnt risk getting a ban.
---
I have one just outside my base. I will only be able to provide a screen shot of the location around Saturday evening GMT. They are in the general vicinity of the silo entrance. A huge metal done, looks kinda like a 1950's UFO. 
---
This is not what the game needs right now. It needs content. There needs to be a reason to grind for all this shit besides killing the SBQ for the bazzillionth time. 
---
I spent so many hours just turning off Radios in Nuka World... 
---
Or you can sit on top and do something off screen on a laptop etc. When was working from home once I did this, amassed loads 
---
 They have said there were no npcs long before release nor have they even hinted at adding npcs in at all let alone anytime soon.
---
So exactly what are they supposed to answer?
---
Rose? Are we thinking about the same game? The Forest by Endnight Games? https://endnightgames.com it's on steam
---
They announced there wouldn't be human NPCs when they showed the game at E3, so I don't think they'll be adding them. Even if they introduced them, without the conversation dialogue they'll feel empty like all the unnamed NPCs from 3, 4, and NV. SEVERAL REPEATED LINES LIKE "Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter" or "Ad Victoriam, Soldier. You know what that means?" Or "Those Degenerates belong on a cross"
---
Are you saying if my girlfriend and I get married, we'll stop playing games together? (We play everything together. MMORPGs, shooters, etc...)
---
This! 100 times better than trading subs and camp shops. 
---
Obviously not.
---
Sorry, were too busy adding a polka dot ratty skirt to the atomic shop. It will take our dev team about 2 weeks to make it so that it doesn‚Äôt ruin the game, then another 2 weeks for our marketing guys to determine a fair price of 1200 atomic point. So yeah, we‚Äôre totally tapped until like... early March. At least.  -legitimately Bethesda 
---
While we have confirmed player vending is coming, there are some really awesome ideas in this thread on that. Thanks so much guys!
---
They'll have to actually release it first.
---
It's happy to see you. 
---
I doubt you would see human NPCs any time soon, after all how would Bethesda hire for something like that?
---
Make that two, there is also a raid on a camp where you get a pop-up with perception at 2 or more. . . o.O
---
Oh i saw your first post about it. I really enjoy reading those, they look amazing. 
---
I‚Äôm not using strange in numbers 
---
The closest we‚Äôve gotten to an NPC was in the Dev room. I‚Äôm pretty sure one was found in there with an odd name.
---
collect weights at gym... then walk (slowly) to one of many workbenches 68.5 yards south and immediately scrap them... #adaptimproviseovercome
---
What what? His post explains it perfectly. I made a post about it recently too, nothing changes. You can't go Enclave or BoS. You can't go Legion or NCR. You can't go Railroad or Institute. The storyline is exactly the same every time you play.
---
Repeating things for repeating sake is a grind and not replay - ability.  Even drastically changing up your play style won't change the game very much. 
---
Learn to type. 
---
One other note - the stronger pistols don‚Äôt have suppressor options either.  There‚Äôs so little to work with and this makes it even worse.
---
My rubber demand may not be as high as others but between those and plungers my stash was loaded with rubber.
---
It's funny because they aren't the extinguishers with a hose attached.
---
Thanks, they were fun to do. I'd keep doing this if I had the time.
---
Hey don't downvote u/CritzD for this... It's a legitimate concern... It really shouldn't be for children of that age but mine have been exposed to it and snuck out of their room at night to hide beside the couch and watch Attack on Titan... They're already probably fucked up so I'm gonna teach em how to play.. 
---
I wonder how many hours I have in Mount and Blade... still waiting for Bannerlord
---
Got it, I've got 36 SoJs and some chipped gems.
---
Since the topic is on diseases i figured i would share a funny story me and a friend had in Fallout 76.   We were at the Pleasant Valley Cabins and we were clearing out the super mutants and we found a sleeping bag.   He was low on health and said i'm gonna take a quick nap on the sleeping bag to get some health back.   As he is laying there i'm in the room beside it looking for junk and other collectable's and i hear him yell out over the comms "thing just gave me goddamn swamp itch!"  "Nasty ass super mutants" we laughed for a good couple hours on how he got a disease from a sleeping bag.   
---
creating enough room in a frequntly nuked area for 24 players to have a shop seems like it would be more trouble than it is worth.
---
I would still prefer vendor plans so you can build them at your camp/workshop 
---
Found a r/thedonald subscriber
---
Yeah, same, ammo is more a pain in the ass to get, but same prime receiver is better than same non prime receiver. 
---
Whoosh 
---
Maybe it's the little tiny seal around the neck?
---
I dunno, but I'll be happy to pick them up in the future :P
---
Maybe he or she had a stroke?
---
Maybe, we have changed our opinion. We will listen to our users or not  but I would prefer an answer rather than a silence or a suggestion that you visit your store 
---
It feels like Bethesda heard everyone saying "FO4 but other players can visit our settlements" and came up with... horribly limited campsites :\
---
I almost never get 3* weapons from 3* enemies except the queen. I got a full 3* armor tho. All my main weapons are traded with players or just standard weapons. Idk how so many people get so many 3* weapons.
---
3* enemies should only drop 3* gear. Nuff said. 
---
I imagine we will. 
---
The impact of Vaults opening and NPC's coming out would be lessened if NPC's were already in the game. Having no NPC's means the first NPC's will be a big deal. Way I see it, we'll probably be able to recruit people for our camps like FO4. Say, another vault opens and us "vets" take these fledgling vault dwellers under our wing. 
---
Don't let the Appalachian door hit you on the ass on the way out. 
---
I typ fine!
---
Ur amercian ass. wid planes like tse. dat go...
---
.....WOOSH
---
To be clear I was playing before, just saw a lot of bad feedback on the last patch and figured I would skip the aggravation 
---
I think it's bad/unfunny sarcasm....
---
I have no idea what‚Äôs happening right now. 
---
Dps isn't particularly important.
---
Per shot damage determines how much damage you lose to armor, lower damage means armor hurts more.
---
The best dps in the game is meaningless because the weapon suffers a &gt;80% reduction in damage against everything. The gauss rifle is one of the few weapons that can get into the 250+ range fairly easily. If you are getting vats crit headshots you can make slightly less potent guns work, but it takes a lot of effort.
---
The problem is they're having extreme difficulty with server performance, camp budgets, and stash size currently. Adding in more things like rented storefronts with 50-100 camp like decorations is going to add more strain on the servers.
---
They're already going to have to accept a small dent in performance for 24 vendor terminals in one location. The servers can probably handle that. Adding 1,200 to 2,400 camp items on top of 24 vendor terminals to that one area would probably cause most people to crash out immediately.
---
If the game was more stable, optimized, and could handle it.............I'd love to see those custom stores :)
---
Unfortunately it's not :(
---
We're currently aware of and investigating and addressing issues with this quest.
---
Given the content of the game I just don‚Äôt think it would be best to show a child that. I have 9 year old cousins who get nightmares from much less than what‚Äôs in the forest, so I bet a 5 year old kid will be scared after seeing a mutated cannibalistic monster comprised of 3 writhing bodies.
---
apparently all the shelters are dead, by people who have entered by mistake 
---
I think it's bad/unfunny sarcasm
---
Hey bro.   
---
I have family who work in VAC, I can point you in some right directions.   
---
Are you on PC by any chance? 
---
Combat heavy for best protection but marine for some rad resist.  Honestly I prefer marine myself but either one works.
---
Hey, not only do you not have to repair melee weapons for weeks, but you also get a damage boost from Weapon Artisan that you don't get with ranged and they're trivial to repair. :\
---
I generally always break at least 2 weapons against the queen.... the life of a heavy gunner.
---
You should have added a /s at the end or somethin
---
Ohhhh yeah. I would be very careful. 
---
It‚Äôs nowhere near as buggy as New Vegas was at launch. 
---
Scorched beasts have 185+ armor, so you need a weapon that deals 280+ damage per shot, a gauss rifle is one of the few not melee weapons that can get close to those type of numbers.
---
It's pretty good.
---
My Ancestor's Are Smiling at me imperials! can you say the same!?

That's some Creepy shit.

Door ROOLS in valut 76, not swing.
---
lolroflamao.

There wouldn‚Äôt have to be 24, though. It we put a cap barrier on buying a shop, only some of the people on a given server will have a shop.
---
I have gig fiber and get disconnected all the time, I play other online games and never get disconnected, so, its not just you friend
---
Would have helped if you gave the platform in which you played and saw them, but not by much. Some people play as Raiders. Not my cup of tea but I'm not going to knock someone's Fallout playstyle. Just pick up the pieces and move on tbh. 
---
How much are you paying to figure out what game system they're on?
---
Honestly they should remove the ability to nuke white springs and just make other areas worth nuking.
---
What you need to do it press the select button on console island what on pc when the pipboy works it brings up a simple pipboy screen that loads much faster than the normal one
---
As I said above.  I did all 3 yesterday, so I don't believe it was broken yesterday.  Could have been server lag. There are tons of things that could be the cause. Some not BGS fault 
---
The sad thing is, there are better, available, \_fallout games\_. The multi-player in this game doesn't make up for the piss-poor gameplay for bethesda's core audience... Right now, middle of the day in America, 15K people are playing fallout 4, On steam alone. 3k are playing new vegas. 300 people are playing fallout 3, for fucks sake.   
---
That's nearly 20k people who are plyaing fallout games, who \_love\_ fallout games, who \_aren't playing 76\_. On steam alone. Let alone people who own it through other computer platforms, console players... There are reasons for that. A big one is mods...fallout new vegas just got new california. Which is a massive DLC sized mod...fuck, i'd say "full game" sized mod. Fallout 4 is getting great new mod content on a daily basis.   
---
I have zero real reason to log into 76 today. I'm not excited to do it. I probably will, for a while, because grinding for legendary gear is kinda a sick compulsion.  300 odd hours into this game and I'm "grinding for legendarily"  But that's it. There isn't a corner of the map with a quest I haven't found yet, because there aren't any quests at all anywhere ever, worth mentioning.   
---
There isn't an NPC to help. There isn't a NPC to con out of their caps, either.   
---
I have more than a thousand hours in fallout 4...and a currently running game, which gets significantly more of my weekly available playtime than 76 is getting. Primarily because i'm exploring a new quest line, from a mod, which changes everything. (kinggaths Raider settlement thing. So far I'm really enjoying it).   
---
You want to talk PVP Shooter games? I used to be a hardcore tf2 junky....that game has 50k current players. That game is HOW old? And it still has that kind of following. I still go back from time to time.   
---
There's one in the main quest, when you visit the town where a lot of the trouble started, and there's either a perception or int (I forget) check to spot a booby trapped body.
---
Felt really out of place, like someone totally random wrote that particular episode and wasn't involved with the rest.
---
Acts the same as RadAway. As long as you have Starched Genes 2 equipped, you're safe. 
---
Same. I built my place outside of whitesprings, far enough that if someone nuked whitesprings center mass, I'd still be about 200 meters outside of the last radius. But on three occasions people have plopped their nuke down super off center and destroyed my home. Once, the edge of the destructive radius was the exact center of my house, and so i had exactly half of it destroyed. Really weird to see. Also worth noting, the destructive radius is slightly larger than the radiation radius,  so only the edge of my property was hot.
---
Will you pay me to explain how to read the sub rules?
---
It's a game.. 
---
Fo76 is a completely new type of Fallout. Holding it to single player standards will always leave you disappointed. I'm just happy they maintained their lore for the most part. 
---
Stema wont giv back moeny i spend in legit cdkey shop wedefinitelydidntstealsomething.ru.cn.trump and they say to mnay minuts but not giev monye back. so Beth owe me $399 plus taxse
---
That isn't what my white mage ex wife thought &gt;.&gt;??
---
I created a second one just for pvp not for fun 
---
They were at first but now they're like burn it! I kinda wanna get a VR set to put them really into it..  they love jump scares now and it's definitely something that will build some confidence since they don't perceive that world as just fake and make believe... Plus we get to record it for them to see themselves later... It's definitely bad parenting but I'll be there with em every step of the way

Id love to go shopping in a mall and just browsing, see if i can find something useful. 
---
I've enjoyed 76 and don't regret getting it, but I was really hoping Bethesda would step up their game and fix the bugs and add some fresh content faster so that the many gamer friends I know would also buy the game. Instead I keep hearing that German retailers are giving copies away, Walmart is discounting the 76 XB bundle, etc. And people who have never played it are still staying away, convinced it's not worth it.
---
tl;dr: Agree with you on all counts. The lack of follow up is a missed opportunity. 
---
What did Bethesda support say when you submitted a ticket?
---
I didnt ask HOW they would answer I am asking what they would answer?
---
you act like there is something hinting there might be human npcs on the horizon and you want bethesda to address a rumor, when in reality you want them to give in to your complaint. if they answer "no" (which from launch to now have been the case, no npcs) its not an answer because it is not what you want to hear.
---
Could they add them in some future  DLC? sure, and probably as often as WoW added new land masses. but until they announce that sort of DLC there are not going to be npcs.
---

It'd be a bit silly talking about your plans for extending your home while it's in the middle of burning to the ground.

White Springs and Watoga aren't worth the effort, far too many low level 3\* can occur that drop level 20-35 garbage.
---
West-Tek, the two 3\* that might spawn, could spawn anywhere, requiring you to clear the whole place. if you're a sneak/crit/vats player that can one shot everything its only 5 minutes to clear the place. Most of the time you'll only get the crowned super mutant in the control room.
---
personally I've been server hoping in the Bog/Mire at a couple locations where a super mutant group with a level 2-3\* level 95 behemoth can spawn, where a 2-3\* level 9x death claw can spawn, doing AWOL and bog/mire bot stop events since they'll generate a guaranteed max level 3 star in the last wave.

guess I'm an eccentric person. I don't play many games, just keep up with the news. but when I do, I clock the fuck out of them.
---
have at least 3 times that on Dark Souls.
---
Agreed 100% with all of this. Dunno why you're downvoted. 
---
On PC. The value of the items is not much. Its the principle of the matter. The principalities!
---
Exactly this there are lots of NPCs in the game whether they're human or not really doesn't matter. what most people were complaining there are no NPCs are really complaining about is the conversation options. 
---
maybe Bethesda would be better at giving you people what you want if you actually ask for what you're looking for NPCs with conversation options.
---
Just üòÇ 
---
Where do you find that menu about achievements I can‚Äôt find it on Xbox 
---
Poorly written, and some of the voice acting is terrible. Except Rose. Rose is awesome.
---
They're over there, quick. 
---
well sorry my english is not good \^\^ 
---
I think they should clean up the 2nd floor of top of the world a make it a player lounge. No pvp. Fast travel location. And put in 24 stalls with bots inside. 
---
Bots can be tied to your pip boy allowing you to take out caps, add items, remove items etc.
---
Everytime you hit a new server your bot spawns in an open stall along with everyone elses. This would also be a great spot to just trade with people.
---
I love that I only ever see this bot post in patch threads or positive threads.
---
No, wait, love isnt the right word... hold on, itll come to me.
---
laff at me fucker beth person give back dollar
---
This guy was the kid in your kindergarten class that ate glue. Loves to beat a dead horse. Play it and make your own decisions.
---
After you start passing level 20 enemy armor starts to get really dumb, and the only realistic way to deal consistent damage is with real heavy hitters, by level 40 the combat diversity goes out the window. The game degenerates into people hitting things with big hammers or sniper cannons, with random people forcing lesser guns to work by firing thousands of bullets at every single enemy. Enjoy low levels when you can actually use more than 5 weapons.
---
Therein lies the problem. Some people are having a relatively bug free experience. Others have a bug ridden horror show that slowly drives them crazy. I had over 700 hours in this game, but it has become unplayable. Caution just doesn't work as a mechanic any more effectively rendering stealth useless, mutations are bugged to all hell, server stability is at an all time low, blue--screens are rampant.
---
But a handful of people come on here and report that the game works fine for them, so nothing gets done about it. Even though there are plenty of people experiencing a whole host of problems on a daily basis and these problems are not getting fixed. 
---
They broke stealth, for a LOT of people, in the last patch, didn't address it in the hotfix and still I am yet to see a single word from the official Bethesda side of things about it.
---
If the problem were acknowledged, if they just bloody communicated like any other good developer out there, maybe people wouldn't give up. 
---
I had so much hope for this game, put so much time into it, just to be repeatedly slapped in the face by the indifference of Bethesda to their own shortcomings.
---
There should always have been updates and patches coming out weekly. Always striving to improve the condition of the game. Instead they sporadically do huge updates which fix some things, break others, improve some things, ruin others.
---
Have a good look throigh this sub-reddit and the bethesda forums, see how many people started reporting issues after the last patch, make a lost of all those issues that get repeated numerous times, then compare that list to all the things addressed in the last ITV. Oh yeah, not a word on any of the issues, just forging on ahead and letting the game get more and more broken.
---
I finally managed to get out of the abusive relationship that is '76. You guys need to do the same. Just step away for a while, let bethesda realise that what they are doing is wrong and that they need to do better, for themselves and their customers. The time will come, the game will finally break you, the fun will go and you'll realise that bethesda doesn;t really care about you, they just want you for your money and now they are just trying to push you away, you just don't see it yet, you're still blinded by the beauty and ignoring the flaws. 
---
You know about this thing called food?
---
&gt; They still refused to give companions a vacuum equivalent for so long‚Äîliterally years 
---
I clearly wasn't talking as if it was still an ongoing issue.
---
I had an issue where I had an old Bethesda account associated with my PS4 that I had used for a demo. Bethesda actually has the process online and they're FAQ you submit a ticket with the information and they'll remove it. It took about 24 hours for the ticket to be resolved this was during the Fallout 76 beta.
---
if you've been having this problem since the beginning and only submitted a support ticket now well you'll just have to wait for support to respond to you. Not sure how long it's taking these days I think it depends on the issue.
---
This is really awesome!!!!!!! To tell you the truth, I don't even know how to use Discord (damn kids and their new things), but I love the idea of teaming up to discover things!!! Actually, this will fit greatly with my next post tomorrow... I'm trying to catalogue all locations with the faces in F4 and F76, and maybe later catalogue all shrines locations in F76. I think together we can find a lot of stuff and left no stone unturned! =\]\]\]\]\]

---
Debatable but NV actually had content, no MTX, and was very well written. Was a true callback to 1 and 2, too! 
---
ofc dont drink bong watr u idhit that is wat u feed 2 dog!!

ffs
---
No I‚Äôve got enough trouble finding them myself
---
Thanks thats helpful ill look
---
And no infinite stash and absurd item durability.
---
Sounds like fun, I wish my family was interested in games so they could do stuff like that with my brother and my little cousins. Have fun dude. 
---
Trade glitch was real. Just blew up after it was already patched
---
It's not the single player standard that i miss or am comparing it to, it's the story and having options in the story that effects the outcome and if the outcome isn't what you expected,  create another character and change the outcome.  That can be done in any game.......except f076 sadly. 
---
Seriously not being sarcastic or anything here, but I've always wondered why so many people ask for this - doesn't The Whitespring resort provide the ideal platform for this? It sure seems like that's what it was intended for, I know it gets nuked (a lot) but inside is perfectly safe.
---
thank you for that, i never experienced something so backwards from a AAA game.  
---
i will wait and hopefully it gets figured out soon
---
There is a mod for that, at least with favorited items. 
---
yes k!
---
dis man understnad!
---

I think its kind of the point with nukes. you are ment to nuke fissure prime to end the threat of the scorched, but now you have access, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. I wonder if vault 76 was actually a control vault, and not an experiment on how ego maniacs ("best and brights" in lore and players are self-important in game) react to having control....
---
frankly I think bethesda knew how players would react and you cant nuke flatwoods to avoid griefing new players otherwise it would be fair game too.
---
90% of the time this happens to me, to the point i don't even fast travel there anymore
---
That would me greatly appreciated. Thanks
---
That's just crazy talk...God quit playing after Patch 1 put a dead end sign on that particular road...

Yor cante blck mu, I knorred wherun ya lived!
---
Their point was buggiest, nothing about content. NV is an all time great game but it was a mess on release 
---
I really appreciate everyone's feedback/stories/experiences. I'm not getting any amount of hopes up about a fix or patch or Bethesda even mentioning it has been issue. I knew I wasn't alone in having this problem, just glad we all had a chance to vent about it. 
---
Ah I didn't realize english wasn't your first language or I wouldnt have be as much of an ass. Sorry about that.
---
Expecting a one-hour response time for a support ticket with any major game studio is not reasonable.
---
As far as the Bethesda account requirement, that isn't specific to Fallout 76.
---
I don't see anything in your post that is Bethesda's problem, there are a lot of things we can blame them for but this isn't really one of them.
---
Just happened to me right after reading all these. My entire Xbox shut off. 
---
 I like Wallace a lot more than Arturo. I really don't understand this nonsense.
---
The constant flak this game gets, from my point of view, is unjustified. I say that because I‚Äôve had a few crashes. One or two that made me literally angry, but overall I thoroughly am enjoying this game. I‚Äôm taking my time checking out every little nook and cranny, reading all the computers entries, listening to all the holotapes etc. and I‚Äôve gotta say I still get the ‚ÄúRUN‚Äù when I see some creature I haven‚Äôt experienced before or a crazy level 71 chameleon deathclaw. I just wanted to say I‚Äôm enjoying the heck out of this game. More so then a lot of the other games that have come out recently. Flaws and all it‚Äôs a good game and I‚Äôll be happy in the future when the vaults open. 
---
With the state of the game I think spoiling content should be the least of your worries. You've gotta wrangle the community back with total transparency, not bait and switches.
---
Well, since I‚Äôm enjoying it, I‚Äôm glad they went for it, and damn the gatekeepers. 
---
You enjoyed a co-op experience, not the Fallout 76 experience.
---
Can you show it marked on a map? Please and thank you!

---
Same for me with the x-01. Also the bright headlamp. Very confusing since it was bought I game. Glad to see it's happened across the board at least. One thing I would like to see is the ability to assign a "name" to power armor chassis in workbench mode so we can tell which set of armor we are putting down. It's not really a big deal for the most part, but I have a tendency to collect a set of level 15 and/or 25 armor to give to lower level players who find their way to nuke zones. The problem is that I have to set all sets down as them pick up only the one I want to give so I can "drop" the correct frame. I feel like I come across to people as showing off what I have, but that's really not the case at all, and being lower level characters they really wouldn't know that yet. Simply applying a name too a chassis would remedy this. The same would go for someone trying to sell a full set. At least fix the menu so it shows what armor pieces are equipped on the frame. Would make things so much more user friendly.
---
What they really need is to rebalance enemies.
---
they have too high resistances, for no reason. There should be enemies with no armor but a lot of health, but no, all armor, all the time, so anything less than a super sledge is useless.
---
This game never had anything close to an actual pvp, just some poorly thought out half mechanic that the solo players that make up almost the entirety of the game complain about
---
They care even less about the game then they did 3 months ago and people still drinking the kool aid
---
Possibly the easiest is the New River Gorge Bridge - West.  Just underneath the end near the CowSpots Creamery is a key locked doorway.  If you actually go to the OTHER end, the door there gives clues through the terminal to where to find the key to the door.  It's at Camden Park, on the roller coaster, next to a skeleton.  Once you have the key, you can go through the door anytime.  Check it regularly, it's always Raider power armor, usually with 2-4 pieces on it.
---
Log in, fast travel to the location, take out the few feral ghouls along the path, go in the door.  But you need the key first.  And as you can't use the raider pieces until lvl 15, you should by then be able handle Camden Park anyway.  You can stealth most of the way to the key, if careful.
---
I was watching the background images on the atom shop last night. It shows a lot of atom shop items used as decoration including a magazine rack with magazines displayed. Maybe an upcoming item? (It also shows VT lunch boxes in a box though so ....)
---
I think you are big winner. Seems I now have 112 Inert Flux!
---
I like your style, if you're still around when I start playing again I may consider it.
---
Not true, I assure you I didn't spend 400+ hours playing on a team.  I visited every location, listened to every holo tape, read every letter...etc..I really enjoyed it for what it is.  Sorry if you didn't.
---
It's a guaranteed spawn, but the location is often frequented by higher-level players, resulting in spawns nearby that are deadly to someone wanting Raider Power Armor pieces.  So be cautious going to this location if you are low level.
---
I hate the ‚Äúget friends and it‚Äôll be fun‚Äù you can do that with literally almost every game out there and they will be fine because almost everything will be fun with friends. Can we please find another reason for this game to be fun other than that argument. 
---
given location they would be better off adapting DLC from fallout 3 based in Maryland and Pennsylvania. If not epanding the map to add something on the otherside of the ohio river.
---
after all and cant (or rather shouldnt) copy paste fallout 4's map if for no other reason than we are still 200 years off. some things might not be broken or rebuilt.
---
&gt; if they just bloody communicated like any other good developer out there
---
I always considered that the foundation of any player-developer relationship.
---
I always thought a "good" dev wouldn't be one that has communication, it would be one that excels at it. Like the guys from GGG, Larian, Digital Extremes etc.
---
Fo76 has been my first expidition into AAA gaming for years and it's probably my last for another 10 years to come.
---
I don't have time for this bullshit, there are too many good games and devs out there that don't treat you like cattle.
---
46 Years Old\*
---
They'd have to remove the Children of Atom, RR and BOS from Boston as well as the human NPC's. Then add robotic NPC's as vendors. Even then, the Institute would be locked because those synths and projects wouldn't create themselves without humans underground to make them. The only plausible way to accomplish this is to destroy the game lore and leave the factions alone. It would be a shit-show. 
---
Yup, had the same problem often too 
---
well I agree, tbh. The PvP feels like a tacked on thing.
---
"Hey, let's do networked play!"
---
"Holy shit, Todd, you mean..."
---
*room-wide gasp*
---
..."an MMO??"
---
"Indeed, and put PvP in."
---
*Picard wave*
---
....on the other hand, I am hoping you are wrong with the "dont care" stuff :/ I like the game, and I want them to care :/
---
Rekt\*
---
They are one of the best weapons as like, a normal weapon. Everything in this game is pretty much using glitched out interaction between mutations, perks and legendary effects. Something just being good normally isn't really important. Like there is no perk/mutation/legendary effect that gets it to 5000 damage like some other weapons so why would you ever use it over those?
---
The Gorge Junkyard location is pretty much inaccessible to someone who wants Raider PA pieces, as they are likely too low of a level to have the ability to lockpick a 3-star lock.  But the Crosshair camp is pretty accessible.
---
On paper, they're the highest per-shot long range rifle you can use.  The fire rate (with fully charged shots), mag capacity and reload is comparable to the bolt action rifles, and it can be pressed into a somewhat rapid fire mode by opting not to charge the shot.
---
I've been playing a sniper build since Fallout 3, and I've never really liked the Gauss rifle.  The damage is tremendous, but I dislike it for three reasons.  One, it's huge and silly looking with a suppressor.  Two, the charge build up seems to reduce my accuracy.  I use the sniping method called "trapping", where you put your reticule ahead of the target and let it walk into your crosshairs, and for some reason I have a difficult time staying accurate with my finger holding down the charge.  Three, the recoil is so heavy that I have no idea if I hit what I was aiming for.
---
If they changed the Gauss to the much less bulky version they were selling in Fo4's Creation Club and the rifle operated on a cranked charge, like the F04 Laser Musket, that would be much better.
---
I use a TSE pipe bolt action that does way less damage but just feels more comfortable.  The lever gun is my favorite for sniping, but I haven't found a two shot or explosive version yet.
---
The good thing about history is what is around. The brotherhood of steel, the supermutantes, the scorcheds ... Listening to the holotapes of how the brotherhood of steel was formed and listening to Roger Maxson, made my hair stand on end. The world of Fallout 76 seems very good for me to be able to continue in a future single-player game. (or cooperative)
---
Can the system handle having the entire FO4 map entirely loaded at all times for all players on the map?
---
Its a fun game, except some glitching here and there, you can solo no problem unless you need to explore an area where there are other online players that are high level because they spawn high level enemies. At that point either level up or try to team up.
---
FINALLY!
---
Oh man I thought that was just me
---
I enjoyed my time I had with it. I just hate that too many people on this sub bring up getting friends to play with you. A game shouldn‚Äôt need that to be fun most of the time. 
---
Yeah just in case you're using a mouse for highlighting stuff, don't.  The mouse integration is so messed up it lags out and selects something else..
---
Arrows and enter key = best, from my experience in almost loosing stuff.
---
They broke MODUS with the last patch. As part of eliminating the duping bug, they somehow made it so all the MODUS are constantly grinning like psychos *and* only one of each kind of MODUS terminal can be used, instead of all of them. The rest just say that it is busy.
---
Excellent work, and well done for being so committed!
---
Most excellent! Looking forward to your next post! I think that's where something like FAS can help - there are a few of us willing to do the legwork to go find these places and document them by taking pictures, and transcribing holos, terminal entries, and notes to be stored on the server. Teamed up (on multiple platforms) we can cover a lot of ground ...
---
sry ur unfunny/bad.
---
i hop you fin gud asrcasm sune.
---
I play about 70% single player and 30% with randoms I meet or a friend. I'm almost at level 150. I honestly like trading with random people I meet then playing with them for a couple hours. Just depends on how quickly you get bored and what you are looking to get out of the game. What platform are you on btw? 
---
...is snd my mny made.
---
No happy!
---
It would really make sense to reopen Vault 76. It doesn't make much sense to have a super technological safe place and just seal it away the day you set foot outside for the first time.
---
Edit: saw you are on xb1.
---
nothing is every locked in a safe or opened by hacking. Unlike other games where you see a lock and think "I bet they put something good behind that!" this game does the opposite and makes sure there is never ever ever anything good in anything locked. 
---
I can absolutely see Vault 76 coming with instructions/VR training to use power armor, in order to prepare the dwellers for any eventually. Likewise,  not all the raiders were spoiled rich shits, a lot were people who lived in the mountains or decided fuck the system. You could easily have had ex-military who decided to use their skills for profit, and then taught their underlings how to use other sets that were scavenged. The game is set early enough that there were plenty of people from pre-war, look at the Responders.
---
In the end, we arent exactly tripping over raiders running around in power armor, they all died like the rest.
---
You guys should just give up. This game is dead and you know it.
---
Spent my weekend doing the 3 Ws and asides from when I hit a couple of dry spots when I hopped the same spot over and over single-mindedly it was a really good haul. Will have to add all the bot stops to that list, thanks.
---
So many stat nerfs :(
---
Unfortunately, Vault 101 wasn't exactly a "control vault" and some of the residents weren't the most "stable".  So there was a precedence in FO3, but it isn't exactly the same situation.
---
Of course, one could argue that Vault-Tec is simply calling some vaults "Control Vaults" as a form of propaganda, and that these simply had more subtle psychological experiments going on in them.
---
But the known lore concerning FO76, is that there aren't any existing living raider clans operating in Appalachia. And that the Vault 76 dwellers were the "best and brightest" for rebuilding, and that doesn't strike me as the description of people who'd sell out and turn 'raider' that easily.  YMMV.
---
Were you a black mage? That can be a problem. Healers hate us. 
---
Did you harvest them recently? Sometimes it shows as I can pick them up but I can't when I know I recently collected some. 
---
checkd wit doc.
---
sais "cannot be confirmed"
---
i fele fine tbh.
---
I \*think\* they are two Turing-test algorithms (like Eliza) talking to each other.
---
Running into Frank's bar. He had his camp set up outside Whitespring railroad. His camp was set up inside one if the railcars. He did a nice job with it. There were 4 other people the gabbing and trading. Felt really natural. Only knew it was there cause of all the area chatter on the mic. Nice job Frank! (PS4)
---
I have new players come ask me for Power Armor all the time and I take them over there and unlock that for them.
---
I did all the quests and listened to all the tapes. What I'm saying is, given the game's mechanics, is that nukes are scary but can't destroy buildings and all the radiation and ill effects are over after 2 hours.
---
If that's how the original creators saw nukes, then there would be no nuclear apocalypse. Just hunker down in your house for a few hours and everything will be fine.
---
Hasn't harvested them in a day
---
its boring af though. there is no story or rewarding quests (both in terms of loot or feels).  i have yet to do something that feels rewarding or meangingful and quit
---
I tried so hard to get into the game but after several weeks it never quite met my expectations. It's sad as you can see the greatness that could of potentially been there. My hope is that they take a page from FF14 and come back with changes to revitalize the game. 
---
you're the one that sounds hurt 
---
476 hours?
---
Fallout 76 has been out since November 14, which was 58 days ago, which means the game was released 1,392 hours ago. You might have a problem.
---
There actually is a lore-based reason for this. They didn't want the residents to just fall back into the comforts of the vault. They wanted to force them to go out into the world by locking the door behind them. I think there was a terminal entry on the security terminal near the vault door that had that info. BUT, I get what you're saying.
---
They do. Typing up some testing later today.
---
Glow Sight is the damage vs Glowing.
---
Jesus, got enough active quests?
---
Well the official line is "best and brightest" but as we know, Vault-Tec isn't known for being the most truthful...
---
Ay lad, can you tell us when is the new proper content coming? Im thirsty for information.
---
Also that you can't stack stair+floor assemblies.
---
but I have no friends
---
i think its all flora in general..it doesnt let me pick up certain things..they are doing wierd stuff recently i noticed this with junk items too
---
I am, truly. Please hold me.
---
Just finished reading them all...kinda like how I read all the notes in the game :)
---
You did some amazing work, well done.
---
I occasionally find a plant I can't harvest. My guess is someone already harvested them and the client's out of sync with the server.
---
I would love to bite my tongue but enough things have piled up, even trying to pass off plastic bags for the canvas bags, shows where there mindset is and all the gaping problems
---
Om my.  Woopsies.  I'm a Luck-heavy character, so I hope never to catch this.
---
Shhhh.
---
Honest question, are you ever been compelled to play a game you don‚Äôt completely enjoy?
---
I have been - not often than god. 
---
If it was often, that‚Äôd be the day I quit gaming. 
---
look for me, my gamertag on ps4 is the same as this
---
This game can played pretty much by yourself. I dont have any froends who play this with me. Moat things you can do yourself, of course you will provably end up finding people to play with. Almost all of my encounters with other players have been good ones.
---
Play with friends or by yourself. Its a lot of fun exploring appalachia
---
That's awful automated support. They probably took the most frequently asked question or concern and used that answer for everyone. 
---
This! No one cares about ‚Äúspoiler alerts‚Äù we just want to know WHAT content is going to be added! At this point I‚Äôm sure others feel like nothing but bugs are going to be our new content

Yeah, I usually buy games on specials and gift them on Steam to get my brothers playing in a team (we are 4) and that usually works great (TD1, ESO) and then F2P type games. No investment from their side and they enjoy the first 10-15h of the games.
---
I have an extra copy of FO76 for them to join in but they are not survival players, so looking for food, water and junk just to craft stuff is not for them.
---
My two girls on the other hand are really big fans of Roblox &amp; Minecraft so as soon as they are a little older I will see if they enjoy the whole gathering resources to build stuff  but by that time we will either have Fallout 77 or no Fallout Multiplayer Survival at all. I am hoping for Fallout 77 myself but I am in the minority on this sub.
---
Ninja Main. Let's just say that she had high end clients that frequented her business. I just was over hearing about it nonstop and never spent time with her due to our schedules and all that
---
alright, thank you :)
---
I had an issue where someone gooified her while she was flying leaving her goo pile hovering about 10 feet in the air. The main issue is there is no texture to the underside of the goo pile so we had to jump around like crazy to find it.
---
Weapon Artisan works on all my weapons.
---
Yeah but Vault 8, another control Vault in Nevada wasn't abandoned. When the Chosen One visits it it's still the core of Vault City, even though they set up well with GECKs and after more than 150 years after the bombs they didn't need to live inside it so it was used as warehouse, but they did have access to it granted the authorization of the First Citizen.
---
This is one of the best ideas that I've heard.
---
Indeed. Trollin‚Äô the threads of resentfuls digs up interesting stuff. Lots of people who struggle to come to terms with there being audiences not like them, or game philosophies different to the one they want. 
---
In a game whose story is about power sharing, ironically. 
---
And, you know, I should probably tone down the condescending ageism, it wouldn‚Äôt be helping either :)
---
From one Redleg to another, I'm sorry for your loss, brother. 
---
Why do you say that? You don't actually think the game is not being developed any further right? You can't believe the made up garbage this sub is filled with most of the time. 
---
Well, currently, by my math, you're gaming over 8 and a half hours a day. Assuming that you get some healthy sleep, and you get three squares and you still take shits and piss, you have about 4 hours a day of free time.
---
there should be mercs/bounty hunters/responders to counterbalance raider play... I would do it, but I'm not great at solo vs group pvp
---
U/armyballer can I join your group it sounds lit!
---
How do you not know you can't sell ammo in this game? Have you even played FO76?
---
If you get a tse gause with full rifle perks its good
---
No, that is people farming nuke zones. 
---
Yeah, I hope to expand the way Events work to allow temp team-ups similar to how TD1 does it. Go to an Event and then decide to I want to ask people to join me and wait for people to join before the Event starts or do I want to start the Event solo.
---
After the Event the team automatically breaks up or you leave (TD1 you have to leave or be kicked by the leader). 
---
Maybe they can introduce a new radio station similar to Hunter / Hunted. Anyhow that is my wish-list item.
---
New content coming in 5 years ,can't wait !
---
The small water purifier comes from claiming your first workshop
---
Moving items to the stash was a lot of work though. Unless you played a strength build. 
---
Nope, still working.
---
Tldr: a pvp zone on the map
---
Sorry but F4 is miles beyond 76 ... This feels like freetoplaykiddiegrind F4 which worse everything..
---
I read further down that you're canadian. I'm curious - did you do training at Ft Sill? I seem to remember a lot of Europeans training with us but don't remember if any were from Canada.
---
Your math is off...try again... I think its closer to 80ish days.
---
Bethesda has only managed to put out an early alpha build of Fallout 76...  
---
......your point being?
---
The reason it worked when everyone left is because someone had an extremely over the limit number of stored items. 
---
Don't remove the ability to nuke white springs. Just remove the ghouls from the golf shop. People will stop nuking it all on their own when they can't farm legendaries so easily there.
---
Too late now but Apex Legends has a good approach. I am hoping more games get the Apex Legends Ping treatment going forward.
---
"top 10" LOL
---
Fair enough. I was expecting a game-related reason. 
---
Well we have terminals that confirm FEV was happening before the war, now about exact time to become a behemoth, I think it is still up in the air same as when do ghouls turn feral. 
---
fallout 4 is better on every aspect
---
hahah, "g'damn I gots that itch again!"
---
Nope.  I don't have the time to play games I don't enjoy.  And that means games I paid for or that were free.
---
I paid full price for God of War this past year, and one day just didn't want to play it any more.  I paid for Prey, hated the mechanics and just didn't load it, again.  Ever.
---
This past weekend I downloaded Apex: Legends, which is totally F2P.  Played a few games, didn't enjoy it, stopped.
---
YMMV.
---
I think it'd be better to open up those locked rooms on the upper floors in white springs as player shops. Then it won't matter if someone nukes it, the player shops would be as safe as the white springs shops downstairs.
---
It‚Äôs fun
---
not quite sure on xbox, but if it's something similar to pc it's when you are looking at the map, on pc we just press Z and the menu pops up whether to exit game, enter social-tab, photo-mode, and all that jazz :)
---
The spoiler is that we are actually playing in a dev/beta instance while they finish the actual game, which launches later this year. They will announce a new DLC, we will install it and upon loading in, wake up in vault 76. It's reclamation day, and the overseer is there to greet us, before we exit the vault to a world populated with NPCs. 
---
We are currently playing a simulation of what could happen if the Scorched aren't dealt with. We are sent out to reclaim the silos and fight back the Scorched before Appalachia is lost for good. 
---
I played 100% solo and just dropped in on people occasionally
---
Cause it's fun?
---
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.
---
Hi everyone, 
---
Thank you for the detailed round-up of posts on this topic. We‚Äôre aware of the reports players have been sharing about this and we‚Äôre actively looking into it. This is a complex issue that‚Äôs going to take time and deep investigation to get to the root of what may be going on here. Additionally, if you are able to share some account details so that we can investigate specific cases, please send me a PM with the following info: 
---
* Your Bethesda.net account name
---
* The email address associated with your Bethesda.net account
---
* Character name that lost an item
---
* Date and approximate time the item was lost
---
* What item was lost, and what were you doing when it happened?
---
 I know it‚Äôs frustrating to lose items, but please keep sharing your reports about this issue with us as we work to address it. Thank you very much!
---
Oh cool
---
Map button then LB should take you there
---
ZegramZombie is my GT, level 41 but on mostly friday/Saturday nights 
---
There are human raiders and traders in the game: they are just other players
---
At this stage I don't see the harm. Heck, the modder's might turn the game into everything we ever wanted.
---
That makes zero sense, man. Of course they have some sort of plan. You can't actually expect them to share their 2 year plan with the community do you. Especially a spoiled angry community like this one? People would TEAR IT APART!
---
They are sharing only what is pertinent now because they don't need the dicks in here and on YouTube speculating bullshit and passing it off as fact.
---
Individual players spouting off like they owe us complete transparency and our money back and this and that are so far up their own asses it's not even funny. 
---
They owe us fixes and content. That's it. 
---
Fix the broken (but still functional and fun) game, and tease some new content. (We already know about survival  (boo) and the vaults, and Atom Shop has been datamined). That's it. 
---
The only place on the planet that this game has failed so epically is in these subreddits. 
---
Most people are just playing away, happy whenever changes came.
---
Because in the end, it's just a video game.  
---
I want to try this game as a team, but my friends list of 20 is virtually always empty because everyone left me and this disaster.
---
I'm up to level 23 so far entirely solo (although I've pseudo-teamed - found a guy doing an event at the prison so I helped him clear the yard so I could get to the power armor). Lots of fun.   
---
The only time I kind of resented playing around level 100+ people was when I was still level 15 and needed a quest item where they were hanging out, making level 68+ ghouls spawn in packs. I think one of them took pity on me seeing me die repeatedly and cleared the area around the item I needed.   
---
Can't speak to the XBox experience, but on PC I've never had any problems with higher level players being dicks. I'm just happily plugging along grinding my way up while they stomp past me in their size 200 shoes.
---
I‚Äôm exactly the same. I don‚Äôt want to team up just because I know I can‚Äôt trust someone messing around with my stuff and very tidy house
---
I worked for a gaming company for 12 years. Trust me on this: no game company is ~ever~ satisfied with the amount they make on a game. Any revenue stream is valued. Doesn‚Äôt matter which game they work on, employees need to be paid, overhead is high, etc. The only way they will abandon this game is if they reach a point of diminishing returns. Server costs outweigh revenue, that kind of thing. The fact that they are still putting resources toward this property indicates to me that despite all the bad press, they still see it as a viable title.
---
Just out of curiosity, which lore has been shat on?
---
You'd gain experience faster with friends, merely by being able to complete higher level content faster, provided you tag enemies before they die. Having high level players around you will also cause higher level enemies to spawn in some areas.
---
I probably play 99% alone. If you're just completing main quests the difficulty might go up steeply when you're around level 15-20, as it starts sending you East of the divide where suddenly everything's 50 levels above you. But it gets easier from then on.
---
I agree with most of this other than some points. For me a lack of vision, while it is a problem, is not the biggest crime here. The game bugs are for me, above and beyond what I would expect from a Bethesda games (namely, a lot of bugs - so that is saying something). Also the lack of NPCs for me is not an issue, and I do recognise that this is a minority viewpoint. Great post!
---
A hot, sandy mess. 
---
If they made it 1,000 caps, everyone could afford it.
---
If they made that cap 25,000 caps very few players could afford it.
---
No matter what the cost, want to bet how many complaints you'd see in here about people not being able to setup a shop?  A ton.  A constant stream of "quit nerfing new content, player shops suck, I hate Bethesda".
---
If they make it simple terminals, it'll be in quicker, easy to use, and will be available to everyone.  They have the existing vendor code they can use.  All they have to do is allow players to insert / remove items, set prices, and withdraw caps.
---
I get that you want decorations, but in the 3 months of this game being live there have been exactly ZERO camp budget size increases despite it being asked for all the time.  There have been 20x the number of "increase camp budget" requests compared to "player shop decoration" requests.  Still not 1 camp budget increase.
---
I'd love to see decorated shops, but you have to work with the game engine and the development team you have, not the one you wish you had :)
---
You are assuming that slap damage is a zone based flag and not a server level hardcode
---
Well everyone raises their kids their way, so no judgement from me.
---
My girls are 10 &amp; 7 and I will wait a little still personally before I try and get them into FO76 or FO77, whatever is out then.
---
My 10 year old liked playing my Witcher character every now and again fighting the Nekkers though :). She only likes the fighting, I had to do the questing, no interest in that.
---
We played a little Fortnite as well but they quickly got bored of dying all the time :)
---
They do play Roblox PvP already though, so not a big jump from their to PvP FO77 one day. ([https://www.roblox.com/games/2048122246/Granny](https://www.roblox.com/games/2048122246/Granny))
---
What are you three?
---
We're actively investigating reports of infinite loot loading. Thank you for your patience as we work on a solution for this!
---
Cringe level 100
---
I don't think that it was intended to be fo5
---
Yeah, it's actually pretty disappointing for me because my wife and I love to play the fallout games side by side and I was looking forward to actually playing with her.
---
Instead I get bullet sponge and inventory management online with Fallout paint slapped on.
---
It was the story and the feel of the Fallout franchise I loved. The map is pretty but very little of it has that post-apocalyptic feel. That plus the "everyone's dead" thing they've got going is shooting themselves in the foot.
---
Add me on PS4: PSN: R-C-MAN
---
The atom store helps finance the repairs to the game. 
---
A ghoul, IIRC, *can* turn feral right away. 
---
I suppose nothing sets a lower limit on Behemoths, but  even in "later" fallout games, it's mention they take a *long* time.  
---
I suppose just under 3 decades would work, still seems too short to me.
---
No problem :)
---
Flux spoils really fast, it seems to spoil even faster outside of nuke zones.
---
Either create stable flux with it immediately, sell it to vendors (it sells for GOOD caps), or dump it.
---
You have no idea the scope of the road map and what they can share or why. I love these armchair developers active like you know how to manage a million dollar piece of media.  Do you say what a director should have done or who you would have had to draft up a storyboard for a movie you don't like?
---
Yikes, why would you want to give Polygon site traffic? Would be better to just state what they said. Wouldn't want to give them any clicks, ha
---
It‚Äôs quite annoying.
---
That should definitely not be the case. 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and none of my friends play. I‚Äôm reluctant to team up with people because most of the time I like to play alone anyway, and I don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings. My job involves talking to people all day, and while I love it, I‚Äôm also an introvert at heart and sometimes just run out of energy to socialize at the end of the day.
---
It would be nice to have some people who I can team up with every so often, but without ‚Äúpressure‚Äù. If one of us wants to team up but the other wants to play alone, or if one feels like going solo after a while, there‚Äôs no hurt feelings.
---
It all depends on your setup. I get vats headshots frequently, even without crits it‚Äôs a oneshot. And against big enemies like the queens, where it‚Äôs not a oneshot kill, DPS is what matters. Naturally you have to take in damage AFTER armor reduction when you are making those calculations; dps after all other factors is the ultimate number against multi-shot enemies.
---
People have been saying this since it came out, not sure if it will happen
---
That they'll actually have to release it first.
---
Haven't found Bravo's yet, but! Alpha's is just a bit south of Yellow Sandy's Still, and Charlie's is viewable from Scenic Overlook.
---
I love watching missiles launch, I've gotten some snazzy pictures üòÅ
---
I hope it was one of my many bags of ammo you picked up, and helped make your day. I had to dump like 15 missiles, 100's of .44's, plasma cartridges, bolts, and so much more because we still can't fucking bulk ammo to sell or break it down to make ammo we need.
---
The problem is it doesn't cover un-favorited weapons and any of your armor.
---
If there was a simple "Press L to Lock / Unlock Item" added to the UI, you could lock or unlock anything.  Any weapon, any armor, any med, any crafting material.
---
Hmm, well I guess that‚Äôs where the timeline actually does work in our favor... children of atom, well that could be our decedents...  RR..  doesn‚Äôt exist yet, BOS, doesn‚Äôt exist yet in Boston.  Hancock May be around but good neighbor wouldn‚Äôt.  Fenway would be unsettled.  And robots, well FO4 has a whole DLC about that...  sanctuary would have to be locked down, we wouldn‚Äôt want to screw with Codsworths story. 
---
I think if you go over to the challenge, and select it, it will tell you which ones. But maybe you knew that. I certainly don't fault anyone for figuring things out for themselves.
---
Quest rewards are balanced to your current level, so you might want to hold off on some quests to ensure you get them at their most powerful (there's only one or two where this really matters).
---
Ballistic fiber, springs and screws are some of the most sought after junk, so make sure you hold on to them. Your inventory is quite limited so don't expect to hold on to everything. In fact, don't bother keeping armor or weapons that you can't yet use, and just try to replace equipment as you go.
---
What about repairs?
---
If they paid their employees with the proceeds from the game sale only then the profits from the game sales would dry up quickly leaving no money to pay programmers etc which would lead to no more repairs etc. You can't produce something from nothing right?
---
I love how you played into the cesspool of hate with your title. Great job posting something wholesome, I appreciate it!
---
If you're on PC and want some company for you run, let me know! :D
---
I thought he only smiled when there was an active nuke
---
Mothman museum, the asylum, and a church.
---
Noooooooooooo. 
---
The stuff in the Atomic Shop that gets added, has been stuff they set up a while ago. Most of it's just preprogrammed to update automatically. 
---
Also, a lot of people like the Atomic Shop and what you can get from it. Why take that away. Why take something that isn't hurting you, but others like. 
---
me too man. It was so cool.
---
At least it was easy to tell the link wasn't worth a click because there is zero chance there is anything new, interesting, relevant or accurate in the "article".
---
So kind of like the dark zone in the divison 
---
Thank you!! I never knew this.
---
:: watches from the bushes::
---
Paper bags are gifts.  If a high level player appears, and checks their pip-boy, theres a pretty solid chance they are gonna drop you something you might find useful.  Don't run away.  Take what you want, and give a thumbs up emote to say thanks.  
---
Also, I echo the comments about using melee.  It does require you to build up your armor (which you'll want to do anyway), but it saves on ammo, which is quite scarce in the early stages.  Also, you may find that instead of repairing armor, its cheaper in materials to re-craft armor if you cant find the right piece in the world.  Otherwise you'll be pulling your hair out trying to find that damn ballistic fiber.  Enjoy the game =)
---
43, 2 copies of the game on PC. 1 for my primary and one for a stable of Alts I use to hold various categories of loot. (spare weapons, ammo, crafting materials and chems, mostly)
---
Yes let's all gather in one spot so we can try to communicate using 6 emotes. 
---
Your missing Helvetia and harpers ferry.  Both are towns so go there and take a pic
---
&gt; Just add the ability for players to add / remove / set prices on items..........and withdraw caps.
---
Just make sure there isn't a bug that lets you remove other people's items.
---
I like PvP but I think the PvP in FO76 in its current state is not working. I get they wanted to try something new with the way it works but that experiment failed so hopefully in March they go back to the way other games do it. 
---
PvP servers or regions separate from PvE servers or regions. I really enjoy the way TD1 does it but FO76 is different so 2 server modes would probably work best.
---
Anyhow, only a few weeks away now so will see.
---

I don‚Äôt see it being more than a bug, I‚Äôve been through the ws arches many times and have kept my mutations every time
---
Glad I could help!
---
How does the atom shop hurt anyone? All the stuff were already made and they just have to push a button to add it
---
Keep hiding in the bunker, I'm sure that it will work one of these days
---
The downside of the lever vs most of its competitors is that it cannot be made armor penetrating through mods. Gauss is high damage and can be made High armor penetrating thus providing superiority in all aspects. 
---
Yes please. I don't want to use them, because I don't want my build reliant on a temporary buff, but I do want to collect them. Why? I have no idea.
---
I know that but the achievement menu is what I don‚Äôt know how to get to
---
im at work so i have time to wait  
---
Fallout 76 is the only game that has ever been this cryptic for me simply to sign in and play  
---
If its because my PSN is linked to my [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) then simply unlinking me would fix everything, hopefully they can do 
---
I guess the only real lore data we have is that one doc in fallout3(if i remember right), and there is no confirmation about straight away and two decades later for example.
---
Behemoths have even less lore aside being the uber mutant, so maybe it will get a good explanation some day. 
---
I think it'd be nice to have a faction system where completing quests earns points and levels you up within your chosen faction. With faction-specific weapon, armour, and apparel rewards. You could get repurposed tools from the fire-breathers, or mutations from the enclave and amour mods from the BOS. It would give each character a specialization. And players could barter for the items their faction lacks.
---
41 yrs old here and I have to agree with you. Only lvl 160 so far but I enjoy helping newer people out with everything from leveling to base building. It's in my top 10 as well. Right up there with Civilization, Red Alert, Age of Empires, Guild Wars, Dragon Age etc. It's definitely a lot of fun to play with friends but it's been a struggle keeping the same friends with so many dropping out of playing.  But it has allowed me to make more friends. I even enjoy playing alone. Rebuilding my base, emptying locations of anything not bolted down, dropping baggies of mats for randoms I come across building their own base. The game has so much to offer and though it's not easy to fight through the bugs and glitches at times, it's worth it. I can't wait to see where it goes from here! 
---
The atom store is what will be shown to shareholders so that they understand why FO76 is worth keeping the lights on for. Just like how they saw profits from the Crown store of ESO and was like "whoa let's not put this dumpster fire out yet." And they never did!
---
What perks are for the Gauss, energy weapons?  rifles?
---
Bulk item issue aside (probably a side effect of the auto scrapping bulk item bugs).
---
&gt;Also discovered that if I empty my junk tab into a paper bag too quickly, random things in my inventory disappear into the bag. I‚Äôve lost a couple of guns and holotapes this way.
---
This is because the game will momentarily highlight other items while moving to the next in your list.  It's a problem in all inventory / container screens.  Once the item you select moves location, the cursor will shift, but sometimes shifts just for a moment to another item.
---
Very noticeable when you reach the end of a certain tab, like MISC, NOTES, or HOLO, and the cursor instead of being on nothing will be on an item in your Apparel tab instead.
---
Only real solution until Beth does something is to slow down when transferring large amounts of items.
---
I seriously hoped this happened and it isn't a cry for attention/ attempt to get free gear from other players. 
---
If there is only one certain way to fix things, then "stealing" the labour is inevitable. Unless you suggest that Bethesda is honourable enough to have a bug persist in their official builds because someone else already fixed it. That'd be propesterous. And stupid. And in no way how things are right now. Absolutely not.
---
[PC Player] I've played solo pretty much 99% of the time since day 1 of the B.E.T.A. and I've loved every bit of it (despite bugs).
---
It didn't strike me as difficult until I reached the level and areas where scorchbeasts began paying attention to me. As for being around higher-level players (and as a result, stronger enemies), you can always keep an eye on where they are and stick to the left side of the map where there's more of a cap on the levels enemies will spawn at. But even then, with some decent gear you can usually take down enemies that are a few levels above you without much trouble. 
---
General advice would be to scrap everything you don't need, bulk junk to sell for caps, and don't get too attached to a particular item or location as you'll be moving around a lot. Just enjoy the journey. Listen to all the tapes, read all the terminals and notes, and follow train tracks if you're lookin' for a Train Station Trader Bot. Pay attention to what all you're carrying so you don't find yourself overencumbered. Also if you want to add undiscovered locations to your map you can climb the lookout towers and "search the area" or activate the pins on the maps located in the Train Stations (and a few other locations). Additionally, if you need caps, each faction has a 200 cap limit (you'll figure out the factions as you go). 
---
I played with a team. It is fun, however my real friends stopped playing and I don‚Äôt trust other players much after all the stories of grieving and such. With a team is really fun though. 
---
I don't even play fallout 76, I'm here just for Billy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtYdDK1uTDI
---
Thank you, Valseek. I'll PM in a bit. One thing to consider as a partial solution - and this assumes the problem is a blend of UI and server stability:  Allow us to lock items so they cannot be dropped, sold, scrapped or traded. That would eliminate part of this, or so it seems to this layman.
---
Nope. It's both but I think the farming one is with Luck.
---
Only over the last week or so and only when I have Hard Bargain equipped. For instance, last night I tried to sell something for 11 caps when it said the vendor had 10 caps...and it worked, and he had 1 cap left.
---
But doesn‚Äôt he mention in the opening scenes that the people in concord have only shot at him a few times?
---
Who cares? Basically, it's just a different game solo vs teamed. Solo it's you and the occasional rando maybe against everything that wants to kill you.   
---
Teamed, you have people going after the same goals together.  
---
Some of the higher level endgame stuff and some of the events are NOT solo capable.  
---
Just remember, it's not your sparkling personality people want you for, it's your contribution to the common goals.   
---
Some people are loud and funny. Great! Some people are quiet and never say anything Great! We need everyone's guns for the endgame Nuke Launch and Scorchbeast Queen runs.   
---
Or we the extra hands powering up the power plants.  
---
Or we just want to have a blast smacking the crap out of the guy with the mask at Watoga High School.  
---
It's a different game in teams.
---
No one cares you mental midget.
---
But you can build one that does more damage
---
The damage on laser rifles made me so sad when I started playing 76. I loved laser and plasma weapons in 4 and the fact that I can hit someone with a sword made from a guitar and cause 1000+ damage because I am almost dead makes me even sadder.
---
I play both solo and co-op and both are fun in different ways.
---
I haven't even found anything great like a tse just a few mediocre legendaries that I use fairly regularly that were very hard earned. As soon as I heard this was happening I quit logging on and definitely will not untill it's a confirmed fix. I'm barely hanging on as it is, if I lost some of my favorite/best loot I would uninstall immediately.
---
That's right, thanks!
---
I've switched to using the "developer feedback" category when I submit a bug report, allegedly bypassing support. They don't respond, and it's probably healthier that way.
---
If they can do a Final Fantasy 14 and revitalize the game then maybe it can be saved. Sadly I genuinely think adding PvP content first over PvE content was a bad idea. Most people I talk to are at end game and are killing for some new PvE content. I personally was hoping they would add some compelling content to bring me back but a tagged on PvP mode is not that I'm afraid :/.
---
The Children of Atom didn't exist for 100-150 years after 76's setting. They were regular people that worshipped the undetonated bomb in Megaton. They began with the construction around Megaton in around 2241. It's not plausible. 
---
That's not even remotely true. Things like chests have *timers*, where they can only be looted once a day or once every few hours depending on the chest, but *everything* that isn't a quest that can only be completed once respawns.
---
If you're on PC I'm willing to help run you through quests and map areas. I work long hours too sometimes so I get ti. Game is still a blast, though.
---
So is the meat hook, which is also considered a one-handed so it gets benefits from unarmed and one-handed effects.
---
Hmmm... they should buff guns to melee's level. Oh sorry I meant Nerf melee 
---
No no, they want to SAVE people who think that they are having fun but really aren't! Stop drinking the CoolAid!
---
I was thinking about that yesterday, that there are no Prime attachments for melee...and I'm ok with that. I use melee for normal running around killing stuff and only break out the Prime ranged weapons and power armor for the Queen. It's a nice balance. Melee is optimal for just bashing monsters, but melee vs a scorch beast, let alone the queen...yeah right. You need ranged to be viable against the queen. So ultimately you need both, and when you're high level you can skill up for both.
---
Naughty Vaultboys and Vaultgirls.
---
I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs pretty impressive
---
How about nuka quantum granade a joke as well 
---
So, I doubt the limited population of the servers (24 max) really suits a player hub area. I would definitely be on board for some sort of "Auction House" or "Broker" set up. I played EQ2 for a long time and their Broker was great. Put up an item with a listed price and anyone on the server could see it. For something like that to work in FO76, it would have to be cross server and preferably persistent so things could sell while you are offline. Otherwise limiting your client base to just those on your current server would probably mean things dont sell as fast as folks would expect.
---
This is the kind of quality content I love to see! Amazing!!
---
Yeah, but even then, there's not much they can do given that it's an online game. Unlike the previous Fallout games, they can't create new lands, or add any new additional content. Fallout New Vegas wasn't really that great at launch, but because of mods it was able to be heavily fixed. Not really much you can do on a multiplayer game
---
Thanx, picked up some stuff to plant today, didnt realize you could get adhesives from them. Also got a power armor frame from the Trainyyard. Had fun exploring the mine today but I mined the coal or ore whatever it was yet the mission is still open on my screen saying mine ore at the mine lol I only found 2 spots, maybe i missed some?
---
So what's it going to take for you to trade me a Vault 63 Jumpsuit????
---
I know man. 
---
Yeah, they'd have to test it pretty extensively.
---
I haven't had any problems with people getting into my stash, so I think they have the "check player ownership lock" pretty well done.  So you and your friends see different stashes when they access the same point.
---
Just make that the way terminals work too.  You access your terminal, you see the "stash inventory interface".  Other people access your terminal, they see the "vendor for caps interface".
---
That would suck though if they got it wrong.  You load up all your goodies to sell only to come back to an empty vending machine and 0 caps........lol
---
Every patch I‚Äôve encountered an incriming number of dead NPCs some look fresh , some look a little more decomposed.... and stuff 
---
The same way they go to work for that long. It's not like he said 12 hours. Six isn't bad on a day off, especially this time of year.
---
I've run a gunslinger all the way into the Cranberry Bog and I've yet to find an enemy my six-shooter couldn't put down. Trust me it works. Like the other's have said, though, you need some VATS and CRIT perks to buff total damage output. 
---
Both happened to me yesterday.  I‚Äôll take the points but dammit the loot should make it worth your while.  To get nothing is a swift kick in the nuts. 
---
Was it confirmed PvP would be the only focus of the patch or is that the only thing they announced?
---
no your not...this has been happening since BETA....your just ignoring it like every other broken thing in this game
---
Bakelite?
---
Contrary to popular belief, People DO enjoy the game for what it is. 
---
P.S it‚Äôs spelled KoolAid. 
---
Hi, I know this is late (it might help someone). But if you are using the Turtle Beach controller adapter, remove it. Restart the console with the mic plugged directly into the controller, go to audio settings and toggle the 'mic' on/off option to on then plug the adapter back in then your mic should work. This worked for me. 
---
It's not that the game forces you to be social, it's just that the socialized events and Endgame content are not solo capable, so it'd be easier to experience with a social group. But randos drop in on Scorchbeast Queen runs every time.
---
If they paid employees from the proceeds from the game sale then how did they pay salaries before Fallout 76 was on the shelves?
---
Pretty sure you can get a full refund at Gamestop if you return it within a week of purchase.  You can exchange it for a game of equal value within 30 days of the price you paid for it. Playing a game for months and running out of things to do doesn't qualify as a reason for a refund. 
---
Look specifically at the damage of the melee weapons.
---
They have the mothman cultist somewhere I hope 
---
My math was off. I completely skipped December.
---
Don't know what to tell you. I haven't lived in England since 2002.
---
It's sarcasm, sorry if it failed...
---
I love me some fo76, Koolaid too (thnx)
---
Is that what your parents tell you? Poor thing. No wonder you're on reddit trying to get attention from strangers.
---
It'll be okay, little one.
---
I like battle royale and I am over 40. Not really good at it but I still enjoy it. I even include my birth year in my username to make it clear I am older and probably not as good as you hope in Apex Legends so fellow team members know upfront not to expect too much and also not to go nuts on their mics with the insults.
---
I play as team support medic in most games anyway so it isn't like I am taking  all the best gear.
---
Lol if you wanted people to see you were being sarcastic just use /s
---
 I think it deserves it's current 50% meta-critic review score. One of the worst "AAA" games I think I've ever played. If not THE worst.
---
I'll add you. I don't have any friends who play.
---
Don‚Äôt destroy my water purification plant by death claw island
---
I'll defend that statement.
---
I believe it stems from how many interior spaces are part of the overworld and don't require a separate load, despite being densely detailed.
---
You are the epitome of r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Colonial marines rest in peace 
---
Pretty sure he was being sardonic and mocking people who think they're "saving" others with what he was saying. You're right though. It is spelled Kool-aid
---
Whether people think the lore was shat on or handled well, the most controversial retcon to the Fallout lore in this game was the appearance of the Brotherhood of Steel in Appalachia when up until this game they‚Äôve only been known to be in the Lost Hills bunker in California and weren‚Äôt able to physically reach that far East by the time of this game.
---
You can go pretty extreme, but you can't do things like remove your nose and ears.
---
But why log roughly 28 days of playing time on a game you don't like?
---
I would pay with friends but something about them "Refusing to play such a flaming piece of garbage."
---
Prepare for DLC:
---
Improve the quality of all your gear.
---
Mod out your PA.
---
Stockpile ammo
---
Finally build a respectable camp 
---
Complete  challenges for atoms 
---
I just bought the game like 3 hours ago, and been playing for 25 minutes, literally no idea what you on about loool 
---
I started playing January 11th and bought the game for $30.   
---
One of the best Survival, MMO, Fallout themed game's I've even played with friends on my GTX 1080TI.   
---
That sucks that it sucks for you.
---
There was a pretty good vid of an irate customer destroying (well he knocked over a few things) over FO76 during release week because he couldn't get a refund
---
How many caps do you have?
---
üòÇ
---
Yea it had a horrible launch and that launch earned them that score.   
---
I think it would have a higher score if it launched today. 
---
I'd also like a way to "ultracite up" some already made / looted ammo.
---
Best all-round defense is a mix of heavy leather and heavy metal limbs with a heavy combat torso. The queen always seems to drop combat armor though, so it's easier to get the legendaries.
---
I think it's a cascading effect of the games industry being in such a bad place and it just makes people less and less tolerant of bullshit. I don't think FO76 would be treated nearly as bad if gamers just hadn't been through Bungie half-assing everything with Destiny, No Man's Sky and Sea of Thieves launching with no content, both Battlefront games being disasters, and the list goes on and on. The industry brings it upon itself by building hype culture. 
---
Then Bethesda comes along and goes "Hey guys check out this multiplayer spin-off we made, now we know it's a meme that our games are buggy and the game might be a little rough at launch and-" \*Internet jumps all over Bethesda, but Bethesda keeps making it worse with more blunders\*
---
I know griefing is a thing in PvP but to date I haven't had too many issues in other PvP games with griefing. I would almost say the opposite, I had more positive experiences in PvP than negative.
---
I saw that lol. I returned BF Hardline 5 days after I bought it and got the full $60 refund at the time. If you act like a total asshole towards customer service associates they have a right to refuse service to you, which I feel is the case with that irate customer. 
---
I'd say run to a location that makes it difficult for that enemy to get to you.
---
Up stairs, through doorways, in corners with a lot of static items stacked around.
---
If you use the terrain, it's not terribly hard to get the AI to do things you want it to.  
---
Example:  I completed the Sons of Dane fist-fight the windingo challenge without power armor on a ranged character with no melee buffs.  Just ran up the stairs, out the window,  and the windigo got stuck.  Still had to deal with the ghouls, but the windigo wasn't a problem after that.
---
You sound very early into it. I‚Äôm guessing sub level 30
---
Trading in FO76 really adds another layer to it, too. It's my favorite game economy now, they just need to tweak it a bit
---
It tends to remember the things attached to foundations.  Standalone things like Water Purifiers are separate. 
---
You can move your whole CAMP to some extent, but you'll have best results if you build it on relatively flat land.  There is always a possibility that it won't reconstruct properly.
---
All aspects? If I‚Äôm one-shotting mobs, that‚Äôs the pinnacle of single target damage. You can‚Äôt do better than that. If I‚Äôm one-shotting 5 mobs in 5 seconds when it takes a gauss 7 to do the same, that‚Äôs superior.
---
I‚Äôll give you the high damage and armor penetration might actually be superior against SB/SBQ, I haven‚Äôt even tried to do the math on that one. I have a gauss, in storage, with the intent of using it on queen fights, but it‚Äôs just such an annoying gun with such heavy ammo that I stick with my LA most of the time. I‚Äôve got a 2-shot VATS accuracy VATS crit rate one, and an AA one. 
---
That's it. Had to look it up to make sure.
---
There‚Äôs **nothing wrong** with liking any game at any age. 
---
My commentary, where I said fallout 76 is frequented by several tribes of players (and pointed out which one I‚Äôm in), who enjoy it very differently, tends to make people on the disgruntled threads very upset.
---
Same for similar commentary about game philosophy and tents of one type of game versus another. 
---
I‚Äôve had people tell me on numerous occasions either that their audience is supreme, ornthat their game philosophy and its tenet is supreme. 
---
I haven‚Äôt made a claim on such supremacy. 
---
It‚Äôs this claim supremacy, and not which tribe (age wise or genre wise) that usually indicates the people you‚Äôre taking to (and upsetting) are essentially kids, sometimes in very me-and-only-me world view if not in actual age. 
---
Read it all. Look at the scenery. The stories and NPCs are there but there are no haloed or exclamation pointed people telling you to do things. 
---
enough to move it. I set up camp, built a wooden floor thing and then went and moved it, but the wooden floor wasnt there. 
---
Heavy weapons and energy guns are why all the Brotherhood people died.
---
They didn't read the reddit before they chose their weapons :)
---
Bethesda, remember small nerfs and buffs to things over time.  That's the best way to achieve balance.  Not nuke nerfing things and insane boosting others (although I haven't seen a single nuke buff yet....lol)
---
This does not happen to me on Xbox. 
---
Ur not the only that loves the game here. But haters out weigh fans it seems
---
I‚Äôm still checking stoves for pilot lights 
---
so I log in, set up camp, tidy it up a bit, and then play? 
---
I only have problems during nukes at whitesprings and fissure prime. Sometimes I come back and find loot after leaving the area and coming back.
---
As a fellow 46yr old it's just amazing to have personally witnessed the gaming evolution. We take so much for granted. My wife and I love that Bethesda made this game. Not perfect but still enjoyable with a team.
---
game is definitely fun
---
The per-level STASH boost is actually a pretty great idea... It rewards people who continue to play, it provides a real reason to continue to level, play.  I'm not sure about the vendor thing. Bethesda flat out won't go for \_anything\_ that makes caps easier to get. They've shown repeatedly that they want to make them HARDER to get, if anything. So good idea, but not workable with their current MO.   
---
I think the biggest buff they need when it comes to armor is simply increasing the spawn of ballistic fiber, and making it something that can be obtained from scrapping armor. It's a fucking \_joke\_ that every high level armor NEEDS it for repair, but NEVER produces it on scrap? That's just bad game design.   
---
The loot thing though...they need to completely re-move that early game nerf that drastically reduced the number of 3 star legendaries. The RNG system means that most legendary drops  are garbage anyway. I'm 300ish hours in, and I've never found a \_single\_ non shit weapon. They continually make this \_worse\_ not better.   
---
Also, remove fucking drills from the legendary loot pool. What the fuck is with that? 
---
I agree with you, I read comments from people who turn off the ability to be seen online so effectively they're now single player and they liked it much better. They commented that it made for a far more desolate world.
---
&gt;That said, why does it still get so much flak even after a majority of game breaking bugs have been fixed?
---
Because they haven't? Server stability is still in the shitter.
---
Also pretty funny to be calling out the media for creating controversy in the name of profit, meanwhile Bethesda create mediocrity in the name of profit.
---
&gt;It's Bethesda's first early access game
---
Absolute shit. A prerelease tech demo is not an early access game. Players weren't let loose in it until it was ready for shipping anyway, they were never let into it while it was under development. This is a live, standard release, AAA game.
---
&gt;Fallout 76 defeinitely had controversies and deserved a lot of the flack, but when we start seeing game's media companies and online entities doing nothing but reporting on controversy we have a problem.
---
Yes, the problem is that there is always another thing to talk about. 
---
&gt;If you keep up with Youtube and Journalists, you'll see that a lot of their content about this game is simply referring to the game's controversies at launch. 
---
Nope, it refers to each latest and greatest. The shaky launch. The botched collectors edition. The gamebreaking bugs. The lack of content. The untested patching. The 'fresh and fun' new PvP mode. The complete lack of PvE additions. The list goes on.
---
&gt;I don't know if you've noticed, but a lot of gaming media websites and youtubers simply report on each other's content or reddit posts; the point is reddit is often the source of information for these journalists. The problem with this is that reddit caters to hardcore fans and I don't know if you've look around this sub, but there's definitely more hardcore players than not. That's why when PC Gamer uses this subreddit as a place to find content, they're finding it in a place that doesn't represent the average gamer. What I'm trying to say is that this sub is pretty much filled with people who are angry at a game and haven't played in a while, or people angry with the game and have over 500 invested. Not a good source in my opinion.
---
Get on the phone to Bethesda then and tell their community managers to stop wasting their time with collecting feedback and interacting with this hardcore, angry, minority subreddit. We don't represent the average gamer so why should they care about how we want the game changed?
---
Why I love it. Spend almost half an hour going through Poseidon to power it up on a low level alt with like 5 health and 98% rad damage and no RadAway, everything going well, about to restart the reactor it after completing everything else, and then get stuck in an infinite load screen. It's the best experience. 10/10.
---
Welcome to Game! PM if you have any questions, I play on PC. The item that didn‚Äôt get moved, should be in the stored section of the build menu
---
I mean if you want to run around with non-legendary weapons? 
---
Dang sorry I messed up lol, my phone glitches and this was meant for another post. But no when you move your camp it gets put in your inventory. Put it in a useful hidden location or just move it everywhere.
---
Lmao yeah this was not advertised or sold as early access. It was sold as a full $60 AAA title. But it somehow managed to be worse than F2P Korean cashgrabs.
---
Fair.
---
Unfortunately Bethesda didn't provide enough staff for "lost items returns" as part of their customer service.
---
Some other games like Ark did (yes, I have seen missing dinosaurs returned).  So it is possible.  
---
Not sure if Bethesda will change that policy though.
---
There's some cool additions and improvements that could/should be added over the coming months.  Here's hoping they do so.
---
It's a good level to finally turn on the fuckers, yes :)
---
Sounds like you had fun!
---
Do you mean Whitesprings?
---
i play at nights but im right around same level...56 and my alt is 19..i play late tho..like after 11pm EST lol
---
I have a blodied .50 with 50% limb damage.  Level 45.
---
I was letting it run its course.  I don't have many cures. 
---

Hope, rekindled!
---
The wife &amp; I are both early 40s &amp; game, side by side. We are both over 500 hrs each &amp; have plenty of endgame left.  We enjoy the journey just wandering together.  We have gained several friends through our playstyle. Just chilling by the wasteland. 
---
Eh, there's nothing lore breaking there that I can see (though I may be wrong). The BoS in Appalachia were just soldiers there, who got in contact with soldiers from out west. I don't think they ever met, only satellite transmissions. 
---
The White Knight nerf is fine. Armor repair goes from a negligible expense to a very minor one.
---
Fundamental problems are untouched. Network performance is still bad unless there's hardly anyone on your server, and there's not much to do in endgame.
---
Well, they did a complete overhaul of the mining/smithing system lately which I think brought some fun back. 
---
I had an Idea, that should simplify things a bit, and not create additional server stress;
---
Create a "For Sale Box" Camp Item, that shares your current Stash Limit, Items placed in the Box could have an adjustable price, all current "For Sale" items (for that server only) show up in machines accessible in Vendor locations like the Med/Ammo machines currently in the game. They could probably replace the current Med vending machines that no one uses.
---
LOL Guess I'll just do it while I'm eating dinner and hope for the best! :p
---
I am genuinely disappointed to tell you I couldn't even snag a suit for myself :P I really wanted one!
---
Bethesda? Pls?
---
This comment wins. 
---
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing recently how this game should have something akin to Runescape's Grand Exchange. 
---
which platform? 
---
How does anyone play 430 hours of any game in 87 days? 
---
Sorry, but that would be a HUGE expansion of the game, not a cheap fix.
---
You're talking hundreds of locations, new quests, new enemies, removing items that wouldn't fit with FO76, and hoping that the two code bases didn't have ANY conflicts.......lol
---
I'd love to see it, but the chances of this happening are about 0.00000000000000001%
---
In the meantime they could create more fun things to do super easy:
---
Have AWOL Armaments Event have a random chance to spawn SUPER AWOL Armaments.  SUPER has 2x enemy health, damage, and number of waves.  Make it have GUARANTEED 3 Star Rewards.  That's changing a few variables that are already in the code.
---
**Enemy Health:** ~~100~~  **200**
---
**Enemy Damage:** ~~50~~  **100**
---
**Enemy Reward Pool:**  ~~Garbage~~   **Good 3 Star Items**
---
There are smaller things like this they could do to add content.  A whole new world is not one of them :)
---
Why doesn't it make sense?
---
Play for 5 hours - 'You haven't really played the game enough to enjoy it yet'
---
Play for 50 hours - 'Why play for that long if you don't enjoy it?'
---
Play for 500 hours - 'Of course you'll be bored of it after playing for that long. You got your money's worth anyway'
---
The perfect trio of defences for why everyone either loves the game, doesn't 'get' it, or is in denial about loving the game.
---
this is mindboggling. you literally just have to say one thing. 
---
&gt;we will be adding NPCs and populated vaults/settlements with quests and storylines. 
---
done. fans will line up in droves, bugs or no. 
---
why is it so difficult to commit to this??
---
They have to have something to keep you waiting for nothing
---
No offense, but how did it take this long to get a response to this issue. There have been posts since nearly beta, and u/ix1805 posted this same information two months ago. These are highly sought after plans in certain portions of the community. If it is really just a issue with the single lines of code, how much QA testing is required.
---
What a dogshit response. 
---
If you were actually allowed to take one for yourself as a thanks for alerting them to the glitch then man Bethesda would quickly redeem themselves
---
üôÑ
---
They benefit from Rifleman perks.
---
IM NOT?
---
As Jim Sterling succinctly put it: "game publishers are never content with just some of the money, they want ALL of the money."
---
Stupidly, no. 
---
If you're on PS4 I'm always happy to trade and hang out
---
they are so annoying
---
Never happens to me but take an upvote for the effort
---
No need to spread hate like that man, if you have an issue with the game keep it to yourself no need to scream and shout because you don‚Äôt like it
---
I love this idea.  I run in T60 PA and literally have all the mods available but the jet pack.  It hasn‚Äôt shown up yet for purchase at a train station vendor that I am aware of, and even if it did it would probably cost a fortune.  Keep in mind a lot of players hate trading either because they don‚Äôt understand how or they can‚Äôt agree to the terms - assuming they have the proper items in the first place. 
---
I bought it twice... PC for me and Xbox for my daughter.
---
My daughter hasn't even played it but I can't return it because I opened it to preinstall for her.
---
Sucks.
---
Tons of fun! He dropped a lvl 30 plasma gatling so it was definitely worth the stimpacks!
---
Spread hate? You mean an honest description of what I just encountered. Yeah sure. Keep spreading BS hoping to get more suckers to buy this broken piece of shit.
---
sorry its too late already. we want it to work but their lack of meaningful progress has already made many people searching for the next game
---
Victoriaiscool - down to play always after 830p... I‚Äôm level 22. 
---
I know. Wasted opportunity.
---
"You....want me to SCREAM AT YOU?!" 
---
love you, 3000?
---
How to reduce griefing.   
---
Drop this fucking \_stupid\_ PVP server idea. Just get rid of it completely, no one fucking asked for it.   
---
Make a PVE server instead, that completely removes all PVP game mechanics entirely.   
---
Let the PVP griefer asshats hang out on the current servers. Give us a new PVE server, problem fucking solved. 
---
you do your business out in the danger of the open like a real man. or go play the Sims
---
I dump a lot of stuff inside the train station bins and cig dispensers and suitcases.  I also like to buy certain ammo off players but most players don‚Äôt like trading. 
---
Except it isn't and you know it. 
---
I know, higher the condition = Higher Damage
---
Xbox - hold a
---
Playstation - hold x
---
PC- (I dont know)
---
And move the item where you want it while getting ready to place it. 
---
Seriously. It boggles my mind that people complain about their friends deciding not to play etc saying they have no-one to  play with any more.
---
I started off playing 76 with one friend who stopped playing after just a few weeks due to hitting lvl 100 so quick and burning out.
---
Since then, I‚Äôve made several new friends BECAUSE of 76. My friends list on xbox has tripled thanks to this game.
---
Well now I‚Äôm not sure. lol sorry 
---
Honestly, if they got 343 to come in and home the gunplay the fun would skyrocket. A lot of destiny was pretty bland, but they made firing that gun feel great. Not to mention it worked good with aiming and everything.
---
 Why I love it. Spend almost half an hour going through Poseidon to power it up on a low level alt with like 5 health and 98% rad damage and no RadAway, everything going well, about to restart the reactor after completing everything else, 100% optional to top it off, and then get stuck in an infinite load screen. It's the best experience. 10/10. 
---
Not just because of the potential, but because of all the money behind it.  
---
There is nothing about Fallout 76 that says to a customer "We cared about the game we created." except the bloody Atom Shop.
---
2nd floot of the too of the world ski resort is the perfect spot. It already looks like it.
---
Lol. I haven‚Äôt gotten many drills but I have a forest of wood armor. 
---
Why are you assuming I'm a young battle Royale kid? 
---
I completely agree!
---
But I think they have to fix the gunplay AND the enemy AI. 
---
You can‚Äôt just have every enemy run straight at you all the time. That is no fun. 
---
Stop being an apologist for a developer that fucked up in just about every way possible.
---
Too little too late and I'll believe it when I see it.
---
Agreed on the spoilers comment. Not buying it, no reason not to release a roadmap. It launched Nov 14. It's 3 months later. If they had a damn road map they would've released it. It didn't exist at launch because they likely didn't have one. 
---
Try it before you splash out on a legendary. I couldn't get on with the Gauss because the aimpoint for the reflex sight moves substantially upwards when charged. Apparently there's also some weirdness when shooting past cover.
---
NV's bugs don't even come close to the ones in Fallout 76.
---
At least wood spawns with legendary affects. Drills don't. 
---
Man I wish bethesda would really fix this game and it's issues and stop going backwards with patches because i love the game and reading a story like this makes me laugh out loud cause it's funny as hell and I can only image if you were able to witness that first hand. But the way everything has been handled overshadows the ups and positives of the game.
---
I don't like to generalize about japanese work ethics and video game development but there is a great deal of honor involved in upholding the Final Fantasy name to its standards. Much more so than in western development. When the public perception of the original FF14 was that it was a terrible game, it gave an unprecedented shame to those involved and also with the higher ups with how the game turned out. A new director was appointed to undo FF14 and years of hard work was put in to redesign everything. It's just unprecedented on how far Square Enix was willing to go to reboot the game with the same name no less. That one blemish was potentially seen as their downfall and they quickly took action.  
---
The poor director went on stage and not only did he apologize for the mess of his predecessor, he cried on stage, very rare for a japanese person to show emotion at all, just cried out of sheer frustration and unwarranted flak he got in the years he had to set things right. These japanese developers put their heart and soul into these games, unlike Bethesda who only can do asset flips. When is the last time you saw any of Bethesda publicly apologize for the mess they created? When is the last time they acknowledge that their game is bad? They lack the self-reflection to improve upon one's self. They might have behind closed doors, one would hope, but it is not communicated to their fans and customers. Yet they manage to keep the Atom Shop in tip and tidy shape.  
---
Final Fantasy 14: A Real Reborn was special in a way that almost no one remembers (or cares) how bad the original Final Fantasy 14. They did such a great job that all was forgiven and deliver a good game instead. Fallout 76 is the final nail in the coffin for Fallout unless that Howard guy comes clean and acknowledges he fucked up. That's all people want, some kind of self-reflection. Some kind of assurance that this will not happen with Starfield and the next Scrolls.   
---
Because strap yourselves in boys and hold on tight, their next games is also developed on this same engine.  
---
Here's my advice based on a whopping one week of ownership: If you're playing solo, try to stay in [areas appropriate to your level](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-fallout-76-map-level-zones-5076). I got into the Rose quests too early and had swarms of level 50+ ghouls overrunning my base in the Savage Divide regularly due to the higher level players stomping through in their size 100+ shoes. Kept getting killed on my way to quests; decided to move up to the Toxic Valley and the game became manageable (and fun) again. Moving down to the Ash Heap tonight to grind Mole Miners in preparation for making my Excavator Armor.
---
This isn't Fallout 4: don't hoard weapons that you can't use. Your stash limit makes saving that T-51 power armor you found at level 12 really dumb because you can't use it until level 45. If you can't use it now, scrap it or sell it. Oh, and since vendors have  a 200 cap/faction/day limit don't think you can sell everything off either. Early game grab and scrap everything for building materials. Start a garden to grow Tatos, Corn, and Mutfruit and get a water purifier so you can have an infinite supply of adhesives. Once you've built a base you like, start being pickier about the things you grab because you'll run out of storage space. Grab lots of guns though, because scrapping them teaches you plans for mods and you can always bundle and sell the steel.
---
Everything has weight. No more zero weight ammo/meds/bobby pins. Don't carry ammo/meds you won't use. 
---
Oh, and if you don't care about immersion, look into [indoor/rooftop gardening](https://youtu.be/TfWrX1FS7dc). Animals will wreck your garden regardless of defenses (and turrets eat into your C.A.M.P. budget) unless they can't path to them. Until Bethesda fixes it, you can place plants and the small water purifier on campfires (in the build menu under "Lights"). You can fit 4 tater plants on a single campfire if you're careful; best I've ever done with corn and mutfruit is one apiece. I've got a 3x3 base built on a single foundation modified from [this guy's design](https://youtu.be/Vd8RF0K2Jz0) with a half dozen each tater, corn, and mutfruit plants next to the water purifier on the roof. Plenty of adhesive, juice, purified water, and corn soup. 
---
I would agree I don‚Äôt find it lore breaking but I don‚Äôt think the argument is that it‚Äôs breaking the lore just that it‚Äôs either inappropriate or unnecessary for the BoS to be in Appalachia at this time.
---
Even if I didn't get a suit right now, I'd love the chance to get a suit for every vault when they open them for DLC. Maybe as a quest reward for first time completion of the vault. I'd estimate at least 30% of my stash is filled with costumes and outfits and I'd love to add some vault suits to it!
---
I've had a blast playing. I play with some regular friends and we just can play for 8-14 hours straight sometimes. 
---
After over 1000hrs between the wife &amp; I, welcome to what can be a fun game with interesting unexpected side effects from what seems to be a giant social experiment.  
---
Why would anyone want that 
---
I've noticed the only way to complete it and get rewards is to let the 1st wave reach the island, which spawns a Queen and after killing her you will complete the event and get rewards.
---
One of the most satisfying moments for me was when i could finally take down Scorchbeasts without much trouble. It gets easier with the levels and right perks thankfully. 
---
I‚Äôm going to guess you‚Äôre on PC and have a dual Hard Drive set up? Are they both installed on the same hard drive?
---
my kind of guy lol. Ace on raider
---
I quit the game a week ago, I'm a Fallout fan since first fallout came in 1996, but this experiment its so boring. No new content, few minnor fixes from time to time, nothing to do. I'm agree with you, just killed 20 or 21 guys in PVP just to get achievements, but nothing more
---
You can set PA to favorites and access it by pressing Up on the D-Pad without bringing up your Pipboy. At least I think you can. 
---
Isn't shilling deceptive marketing. Anti-consumer? I'm sure it must be illegal. Especially with the absolute mess this game is in.
---
&gt; One of the best Survival, MMO, Fallout themed game's
---
First in a one-horse race.
---
Luck -2
---
I thought that this made you crap your pants.
---
Definitely, but even just fixing that would improve the game a lot, and I feel like less people would be worried about relying on the VATS, when it hardly works as is.
---
Honestly, 343 could probably have really helped on the areas Bethesda is really lacking in 76. They've got basic fighting down (except for things like making bosses big bullet sponges). And Bethesda has storytelling going...okay...for an mmo.
---
But the majority of people upset with 76 are, I suspect, just rabid fanatics. I suspect this because many people in net gaming places I'm in were stating nonsense shit about 76 months before the game ever launched. xD  
---
Can you be straight up with us? Is it realistic to ask for big features like this when the game still has infinite loading bugs?
---
can anyone walk into my camp? 
---
No, the worst is when you click the build button about 10 times in various places only to discover that you now have 10 power armour stations on the roof.
---
Your camp will restore itself upon log in if you already have it placed, as long as no one else is camped nearby on the server you are joining.
---
If you built a camp and moved it, you SHOULD still have the stuff you built in the ‚Äústored‚Äù tab, it might be in a ‚Äútemplate‚Äù though. I also have had it not show in ‚Äústored‚Äù until a bit later- I thought I lost almost a whole base but the template stuff I either didn‚Äôt notice or didn‚Äôt appear until I checked again a bit later, and then I saw the two templates with everything else. 
---
Happened to me yesterday. Went legendary farming at Whitesprings and couldn't load a single corpse.
---
its a copy paste of it without NPCs and multiplayer, lol.  
---
explain your points then.
---
riflemen perks work for gauss. there is a perk to make the ammo lighter &lt;batteries included, i think&gt;. the ammo is like .1 per round. 
---
I‚Äôll free with you there. Better gameplay would have helped my moment to moment experience immensely. 
---
Hell I remember when I was playing in December my .308 rifle kept acting real weird and not working half the time. I cant remember if it wouldn‚Äôt release zoom after I let go of LT
---
If you like it and are looking for a non negative place to enjoy it visit us at r/fo76filthycasuals
---
That would be a good idea. For my clan, we just load up extra stuff on our Alts and do a new player giveaway every so often. Free arms/armor, meds, ammo, whatever. Wish there was a way we could get the word out to more people. 
---
This fucking guy, it‚Äôs our fault they rushed out dogshit.
---
I worded myself badly. 
---
Short answer: I‚Äôm not. 
---
See my response to sister comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apb9sm/comment/eg99t2g?st=JS0VI9O9&amp;sh=5c1c6b1f
---
Its sad that pistols lack variety. My Fo4 survival Pistol build was very strong. 
---
Wait Bethesda is gonna read this?
---
No?
---
Dear diary...
---
I honestly think the best choice for a hub would be back to 76. A common ground for all the players (originally 76ers) to lay down their arms, meet on a neutral and friendly ground. 
---
Maybe somehow in a dlc patch, the Overseer returns "home" and broadcasts a signal and it is now furnished with vendor bots, 0PvP, maybe a map akin to train station maps but this displays daily quests or timers on events that are about to start. 
---
Salty_1976 im on now.
---
What i fail to understand is how Bethesda could have screwed the pooch so badly with PVP.  It's like they drank the Kool-Aid and now think the entire planet wants to roam around shooting each other.  
---
I'd be willing to wager that the VAST MAJORITY of players \*HATE\* FO76 pvp system and whats more i'd also wager there's a nice audience out there who never bought the game specifically because some 11 yr old child with 'Live 2 Tr0ll' painted on their face wants to run around and kill their toon while they're out doing some quality crawling REGARDLESS OF THE PLAYERS INTENTION TO NOT PVP.
---
What makes it worse is the fix is so mind-numbingly simple as to force speculation about why they haven't made this alteration already?  The posts are raging about how terrible this system is and the ONLY PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT FO76 PVP are those very same 11 yr olds i mentioned previously.
---
My speculation?  Simple.  Someone, somewhere dumped a lot of cash into the PVP development and its total garbage.  Instead of dumping that turd they continue to try and force-feed the audience as though 'they know better.'  This is called 'Throwing good money after bad' and game companies do it all the time.
---
I have news for you Bethesda:  Your player-base knows better.  Send out an email to everyone that bought the game with one question: "If you had the chance to turn off PVP and the ability to turn it back on again, would you?"
---
Unless i miss my guess PVP would vanish from FO76 within weeks.
---
It was a joke, I feel like people are constantly trying to tell me that I am not having fun playing 76, but I love it!
---
As a suggestion for future videos, show it from further away once it is done. It's cool that you figured it out, but do I want to spend my time trying to set this up when I might not like how it looks?
---
Even the reddit threads about dissapearing gear, keep dissapearing? Fallout 76 is leaking to the real world!
---
Where would the money come from for ongoing support?
---
Surely you don't think they'll operate this game at a loss...
---
Nice :)
---
Yes 
---
"..aww shoot, not in-game too!" :P
---
I‚Äôve also just placed a regular lightbulb.  
---
I want Survival mode to be brutal. 
---
I want the enemies to deal lots of damage while we too deal lots of damage; everyone become more glass-cannons than bullet-sponges. I want healing to be slower, I want greater consequences to disease, starvation/dehydration, high rads, use of drugs, use of radaway, etc. I want ammo to be rarer. I want safe, radfree food and water to be rarer. I want to have to make deals with other (or their vendor-bots) in order to get what I need. I want to be terrified of the dark. I want an excursion to be tough. I want an excursion out of the Forest to be terrifying. I want the environmental hazards to genuinely be hazardous, even if prepared.
---
I want the game to kick my ass, to make it a real challenge to survive and thrive, and then tell me, "so, you think you can stop the plague? Please!"
---
Go for Starched Genes 2 at lvl 30 and try to get the Marsupial mutation. It makes exploring much more enjoyable. 
---
Workshops are the only fair ground of pvp in the game that isn't stupidly one sided.
---
The thing is, if I shoot someone and wait for him to hit back to approve the pvp, I would most likely get one shotted, cuz the approval would be followed with a clean opening shot.
---
At least with work shops, no one gets an opening shot until the actual pvp engagement. 
---
Look in the stored part of the menu, it may be in there
---
If the land isn‚Äôt right for your base, it stores it, and u select it and it lays it out for u to replace it
---
'actually had content'
---
This game is full of content. It has a bigger world and more locations than NV. It's just not story-centric content. 
---
There are players, even vocally critical and angry players, who have level 200+ characters and hundreds of hours played. Did they just jerk off to get those levels? No, they explored and cleared places and killed things and all that stuff is 'content'. 
---
You might as well claim every ARPG ever made has no content. It's exactly the same situation, design environments, populate with enemies, done. That IS content, whether you like it or not. 
---
The dude talking about hyperbole is right, too. Critics and dumb haters didn't cause this mess, but they certainly contributed to it and so are you when you write such oblivious comments. xD
---
Amen!
---
I had a friend ( Deo ) many years ago now, we would game alot, i had known him since School days ( 90's)  he sadly took his own life back in 2011 as he had Demons and he was broken,,, it does get easier but it bounces up occasionally when a new game like GTAV when that came out i was sad because i couldn't have the exited GTAV conversation when you both have played the game for the first time.
---
I had truely failed him in life... however my belief in the Force and Music and loved ones and the Superhero MMO guild i was in had helped me cope along the way..
---
You must always remember Ben will want you to live out the rest of your days happily, when you think of him have joy remembering the fun you both had, not sorrow. 
---
Im sorry for your loss i hope you find your spark again, take your time and make sure you look after yourself, eat well...  
---
May the force be with you.
---
I've had several Items simply disappear, 1st was a TSE The Dragon, shortly after looting it, decided to try it out, but when I equipped it, Poof! it was gone.
---
Next, I suddenly realized while looking at my character in 3rd person view, that most of my Armor was gone, Had all 3\* Combat equipped, and lost all but Right Arm, so I checked my Stash, not there either, so I decided to switch over to my Heavy Metal set, only to find most of it was also gone.
---
Last night after fast travelling back to my CAMP in my Excavator (Fully loaded level 45) PA, My Hemet and both Arms were no longer equipped, when I went to re-equip them, I discovered that all I had were un-modded level 25 Helmet &amp; Arms, I considered submitting a ticket to Bethesda, but I'm afraid I might get banned for Duping level 25 PA parts.
---
I can tell in 10 hours or less whether I enjoy a game or not. Example - I put 19 days of playing time in FO4 because I loved it. I put 7 hours into BF Hardline and returned it for a refund because I hated it. You either want to continue playing or move on to something else. It doesn't make sense because you can usually return a game for a full refund within 7 days of purchase. Forcing yourself to play a game you dislike past that point is just foolish. 
---
The ‚Äûgetting their shit together‚Äú would cost money. And I fear they ran out of it. That is what why we don‚Äôt see any progress 
---
I didn't say anything about "fault".  What i said is that we will never know what this could have been or what the full extent of what they planned for it. 
---
 That has happened for various reasons, certainly first and foremost being the state of the game as released... but the exaggeration of how bad it is along with the mob mentality has certainly killed off any real chance of a recovery.
---
I must have been the luckiest SOB alive because I've been playing NV since release and I had very few issues. Not saying there wasn't issues across the board, I just got lucky and missed most of them.
---
FO76 on the other hand... I wish I could say the same
---
Is that some sort of set-in-stone rule? No, it's just your method. But would you go up to someone with 11 hours on a game and say 'Well obviously you like it, or you are a fool'?
---
The problem is that you have a terrible and misleading title.
---
ppl love to downvote. Even if it‚Äôs a good comment. You got to take it with a grain of salt and stand by your choices / your opinion. 
---
Least we actually get to see what they're working on.
---
Sometimes 
---
I have never done the event,  is it worth it?  Good rewards?
---
You can‚Äôt add more stars to a weapon
---
Agreed
---
That's why this game needs more remote C4.
---
I quit about a week ago too, because I have done almost everything in game between two characters.
---
I‚Äôve regularly had items added or subtracted from my favorites wheel. At one point I had two handmades favorited to the same location on the wheel. One was a non legendary with a long scope and the other was a TS with a reflex. Sometimes picking that slot on the wheel pulled one, sometimes the other. I scrapped the scoped and my TS was fine. I took screenshots of it, shoulda grabbed video. PC. 
---
You don't speak on behalf of the community. Ever. Nobody does. This community is so varied in its reactions and desires and opinions that anyone claiming to speak for the community is being a dillhole. 
---
Stop trying to bolster your personal beliefs by claiming support that doesn't exist. xD
---
Thanks for posting this.
---
I don't have F76, but with all the news, I am genuinely curious as to what people DOD enjoy with the game.
---
I'm seriously interested to read from people who like it, as so much of the negative stuff seems exaggerated.
---
yeah, all of these FOOLS who only THINK that they are having fun! /s
---
When I first heard of a modern FO game that‚Äôs online. I was ready to take a week off from work. What I got was a shitfest if bugs, disconnects and lots of frustration. After you finish the story and explain everything. There really isn‚Äôt a whole lot to do. The average person isn‚Äôt going to read every terminal and holo tape. There‚Äôs 0 end game. Every update I actually dread. Since it usually breaks something else. The entire being 1 shot cause someone stacked bobble heads ruined PVP. 
---
PA and the Fireproof perk make their attacks to fuck all damage.
---
The screech is explosive damage, so any mods that reduce that also work.
---
Since others have stated that the built items are in the Stored tab, I'll just add this. After moving camps several times, I don't bother with making blueprints anymore.  You'll find that some c.a.m.p builds won't fit everywhere. I even try to build mine differently to see what I can make, given the space available.  But that's my opinion.  
---
Me! 
---
The game engine is so old by now that the ones still knowing how to use GameBryo are ancient as well. Those old people don't play the hottest new games, the newest Battle Royales and whathaveyou. They're just working 12 hours a day, coding and chipping away at an engine so dilapidated, it was marked for demolition and was subsequently squatted by homeless people that lived long enough to see the polar caps melt. Those people just go home and tend to their families and recount how they fought in the Gulf War to their grandchildren. Nothing of your fancy, smanchy console stuff. Some of them even got Pong for their bar mitswa.
---
No I mean the real shills. The people paid to pretend to be regular folks just posting on this subreddit. I'm pretty sure that is breaking some laws or regulations. Most definitely. 
---
Yeah for about two weeks. Never sold my ammo to vendors during that time..... so 
---
I know it was a joke. I was playing along. 76 has been my favorite game since beta
---
Please see my update
---
Hey dude, if my post doesn't make you happy, you can "pack your shit and go find a post that makes you happy"
---
I use the "Search" function of boxes to try and determine server health, if it comes back immediately, it's a good server, if it takes a long time, I don't do intense things like nukes or crafting on that server.
---
I know that's one of my favorite things in Fallout, I got to every vault and look for a suit, it's like collectibles, honestly I collect them more than bobbleheads
---
Come on down then well be here.
---
Opening up with ridiculous hyperbole makes it difficult to read the body of your post. No Man's Sky is only a couple years old. It was hot garbage without even basic game play loops at launch. And that isn't even counting the missing features or the way they lied about players being able to meet each other
---
so like how long does it take to kill a lvl 80 scorchbeast with plague walker once you have all these lol?
---
Oh you got me there, I don't know anything about that. Are you are accusing this person of being a shill?
---
Will do when I get home.
---
They died because they realized they were in West Virginia, so they logically killed themselves?
---
huh, The Duster i bought in the Atom store can magically appear in my crafting station but a lost legendary item cant appear in my stash? Seems legit.
---
Fanatics tend to be loud... it's usually the only thing they have going for them. :P
---
But yea, if you count all the people who hate the game and have never played it (which I imagine counts for most of them), then people who enjoy it are outnumbered. Still, I'd rather be the dude having fun than the dude who's full of hate because another dude is having fun, or because some game exists that I don't approve of. xD
---
Some gamers are just whiny emo kids. It seems to be getting worse.  
---
I just had my bloodied Tesla disappear the other day. I heard the stories but didnt think much about it until it happened to me. Sucks. 
---
To the best of my knowledge, damage scaling has been in from the beginning. In the December 4 patch, an issue with damage scaling was addressed. https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/yzCWHFufFm0iUEyc4UWgA/upcoming-fallout-76-patch-notes-december-4-2018
---
Sure. What system?
---
Follow him a good ways, run ahead, place your camp, surround him in walls, go from there. 
---
Yeah! Hidden collectables. My house in Fo4 was stuffed to the brim with mannequins and vault suits got pride of place. I do hope they continue the trend.
---
"uh ac kshually its not an mmo lite because mmo means massively multiplayer"
---
- everyone on this sub 4 months ago
---
I‚Äôm only level 99 been playing since beta added tons of new friends now I get on my whole friends list is dark maybe 1or 2 at most. Only time I pvp is defending workshops I‚Äôve got I‚Äôll go back and forth a couple times I die they die but not really what I play for. But I do hate when I‚Äôve had enough and leave and then all of a sudden the workshop is unowned again because they never wanted it. Just wanted the pvp
---
There's a challenge to contract all 22 diseases once for 80 atoms
---
Exactly
---
What can i say lol. Damn young millianials lol. Everytime i defend the game i just get almost verbial abused lol
---
I love D2 as well! But I‚Äôve literally done everything I can at this point, so I‚Äôm just waiting for Joker‚Äôs Wild to release hopefully that‚Äôll hook me again 
---
Gotta specify which system. But I'm down on PC.
---
I blueprinted mine in segments (I also built one based off of his design). Did the foundation, all floors, and turrets in one blueprint, then the walls, door, and roof in another. I figure any decorative items and crafting stations I can toss out later individually once the other bits have been reassembled.
---
You are one delusional personüòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah, let's remove the the only form of revenue Bethesda has to incentivise them to continue working on the game. 
---
Original cost of the game = paid for initial game development and marketing. 
---
Atom Store= pay for staff to keep working n the game
---
this means i probably should aim for a modest build right? otherwise it will be tiresome doing that everytime I log in. 
---
It's all over but the crying at this point.
---
I had the exact same thing happen... I said fuck it and quit the server knowing if I died I'd lose my loot. 2/10\* Would not recommend. 
---
I love it too! I really like that you build your s.p.e.c.i.a.l. stats and perks as you go... your character grows and takes form over time! 
---
And sadly Fo5 wont be coming out for a very long time now that they spent time and money on Fo76 which is pretty much a flop.  
---
There is an atom challenge to acquire all 22 types of disease in the game. Woopsies has proven to be the most elusive for many people
---
My friends and I play grenade ball. Build a basketball hoop and throw grenades. You'll love it.
---
476?......you need a gf üòù
---
If you are Xbox, add me, I play too much and am always down to team up. Got a 55 Vats Rifleman and a 82 Heavy Gunner.
---
(This applies to anyone who reads this!)
---
GT: SilverReaperxXx
---
No it should come up as one piece and u place it and ur base is just how u left it. 
---
I literally just did this a second ago. I moved my camp, then goto the machine and hit a to build. Then move to your right one click under stored and it should be there, just place it where it fits 
---
That's not how paid-for model works. Income from a store like the atom store that exclusively pays for content is how a free-2-play model works.
---
As far as i'm aware two shot still fires two projectiles?
---
It really is! I think I‚Äôve used that analogy a few times myself.
---
In theory it could work.  You'd probably be waiting forever though and miss him.  His pathing does allow him to move around objects to try to get back to his ideal path.  I'm not sure how far off the path his AI will let him go, but probably further than your camp area in most locations.
---
First possible way you could do it:
---
Someone mapped out all of his possible travel locations on a map.  Don't remember where I saw it.
---
Now if you could find a spot on ONE of those paths where he can't avoid that wall without a massive pathing re-calculation........you might have a shot.  Some area where he can't get left or right of that wall you're putting down.  Like a ravine, or edge of the map, or somewhere the left and right sides of the path are impossible to get by.
---
Second possible way you could do it:
---
Wait to see a post in this reddit, FO76 Market, or FO76 Bazzar of someone saying that they "have ghram, and want you to join them".  It's more rare now that his plans aren't randomized and people don't farm him.  But if you DO find one of those posts, have the person hold him still while you build your camp around him and box him in.
---
Why is everyone commenting about the amount of drops they are getting? Keep damn quiet before Beth nerf the hell out of it!
---
As a side note, please tell me which RNG god i need to pray to as i never seem to get so lucky.
---
Using the map or events start when u go places
---
agreed, but if we at least had some sort of choice in the quests that are available in Fo76 it would be a little better. and my other point that they can stick to their "no human NPC" thing with introducing non-human NPCs that we can actually have dialog interaction. 
---
Here's an example of why I think pulling from the wrong menu still occurs:  3 days ago I was dropping scrap I don't need. I was in a hurry (nuke launched) so it was bambambambambambam. Wait, what's that? A very brief notice appeared in the upper left, and it said:  You may not drop keys. I was in the Junk tab, no keys there. 
---
Another example from before I learned to slow down:  Dropping junk again. Got done. For no reason in particular I hit 3rd person view and I see my armor, but I should see my equipped outfit. Checked the bag and there's the outfit. Never touched the apparel tab.
---
It's a relatively new area of anti-consumer practice. Attempting to silence paying customers by downvoting them en masse. Upvoting shilling or positive posts to create false impressions and deceptive marketing. I'm sure if some were paid more than they are already being paid they would come clean with the information. Maybe some large media outlet would be interested in the story.
---
I want towns. A small city where you own your own plot of land and it travels with you to each server. Everyone can own a piece of property in the town or ‚Äúhub‚Äù
---
Yes and no.  Us players have an idea what we want, Devs have an idea what they want, and somewhere in between is the right thing.  
---
I grab everything all the time. I am a scavy, what can I say? Anyhow, good to know that in busy server my habit helps things.
---
Right now, all what we need are private servers with mods support
---
Im in the same boat now too. Went through all the trouble of incorporating into my camp and now they won't work anywhere. Def seems like a bug :/
---
Im guessing when the game feels he got stuck, it will teleport him back on his path
---
See second video link. I did exactly that 
---
This. For example, Battle Bot in Ass Heap only triggers when you wander by the trainyard. If none are available, hop around servers!
---
Maybe in a different vault or something. 
---
My mistake. It seems most times I do go to an area I have previously been the loot I do get is useless or there is none at all. 
---
Have you tried Fallout 2?
---
Run somewhere safe to put it on. This isn‚Äôt ironman‚Äôs nano suit, hell, be glad you can even carry it and it only weighs 10lbs. Remember FO4?
---
interesting idea, but why? he would only be there for your duration on that server. as soon as you go to another server he will be gone. and its not like his inventory will change while you have him captive. 
---
Just quit please. You guys are terrible and it's obvious you've given up
---
The reality is, like all things, it is what you make of it. My style of play isn't what a lot of folks seem to like. I follow the story lines, run the quests, explore the map. Is that not what the designers intended? For me, the ROI has been very high. I spent 60 bucks, put in 250 hours (so far) and enjoyed it totally. 
---
Have there been some issue? sure. IMHO, nothing that has eroded the game to warrant all the stuff on here.
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
Play on.....or not.
---
Spoiler alert: everyone is dead
---
No. The game was (and still is) installed on my external hard dive (I:) but when ever I try to update the game it just downloads it onto external hard drive (H:). Is there a settings I can change to chose where Bethesda Launcher detects a game like in Steam?
---
it's bugged it does work like 1 outta 4 times for me whats supposed to happen as soon as you click that button a SB will show up and instantly land and you just kill it .
---
Hey look 7 upvotes, and it's lower than 2 posts with 4 upvotes. Anyone noticing the vote manipulation?
---
Half right. It's dying but it can still be brought back. They just need to listen to the players about what's wrong with it, people have literally came up with fixes and Bethesda needs to listen to these people as well as themselves in order to stop this game from dying. Whether that happens or not we'll see in the next few months.
---
This is not Fallout 5. It was never going to be Fallout 5. It will never be Fallout 5. Stop wanting it to be Fallout 5.
---
Blackwater mine has a bunch of veins just inside the mine itself. In the 2nd room with all the mole rata or wolves is a bunch of veins on the walls. 
---
Well, let's agree to disagree. I've still got plenty of stuff to see and do in the game after about 100 hours, and I'm looking forward to it. 
---
Problem is that some of the problems the game has don't stem so much from game development as they do from the engine development (including server-side components). Those are long to fix and I don't even see Bethesda talking about it, seems like they are busy plugging holes rather than fixing the whole hull to me. And it makes me sad.
---
World building. Large world, diverse zones, interesting environments, good balance of overgrowth and devastation. Great art direction. Fantastic OST and sounds. Crafting is a bit deeper with more options, too (though camps are pretty much just nerfed settlements).
---
As far as criticism of the game, world building aspects have always been key parts of the Fallout franchise, and so it's easy for me personally to enjoy the way 76 handles them. But I think a lot of people just get miffed because story and characterization were basically the other things that made Fallout great, and they feel that every Fallout should have all the things that make it great and they can't handle anything less. And then there are the fanatics who think that RPGs are only about story and any RPG that isn't super story-centric is inherently bad. Those people tend to annoy me the most because they completely lack understanding of RPG mechanics and the range of the genre, and overvalue their limited view to the point of being self-important blowhards. xD
---
If you're an easy going person who enjoys the idea of roaming a wasteland, try it out. But if you're a person who demands 9/10 games, or have ideological views about what makes an RPG/Fallout game, maybe give it a pass.
---
I want to correct his spelling of immense so bad but the post is so sad and I don't want to be that one grammar nazi
---
Pipboys have a kind of video game
---
Is this just a general question, or an invitation? 
---
Lol hour and a half 
---
Press X to doubt.
---
Most times, yes,  the whole thing has to be rebuilt.  Oh you move it around until it turns green, which is supposed to indicate that you can put it down. Then you go to put it down and it tells you that you can't.
---
PC.
---
To my knowledge that‚Äôs all they announced but I‚Äôm happy to be proved wrong:
---
I guess I mean dead as in Bethesda has most likely canned the project and is only doing minimal maintenance updates.
---
I‚Äôm weirdly addicted to this game, can‚Äôt explain why because I *know* how shitty it can be.  Part of me wants to stop, and I did for RDR2, but even with all its flaws I‚Äôm still having fun. Bugs are annoying, but nothing game breaking for me yet. Content is sparse, but it‚Äôs still better than a lot of other games.
---
Anthem might take over based on what I experienced in the demo, but RDR2 online seems more empty to me than this game. The pvp is just as bad, if not worse, the story can be blown through in a couple hours, and the side quests are super repetitive. Plus, once you buy cool weapons and horses, there‚Äôs no goals to keep me interested.
---
I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôve pretty much given up on this game though, or at least diverted a large chunk of its resources to other projects. 
---
Sounded like that would happen. really felt irritated when nothing happened though.
---
Luckily I use a PC.
---
oh how I would love to find out! :P However I think I've only had 4 or 5 diseases at once, I think there may be a hidden cooldown on how frequent you can acquire diseases or something (unconfirmed, though) :P
---
It is definitely an invitation. 
---
My bet based on prior behavior is that Bethesda has mostly moved on and is only doing minimal maintenance 
---
I did this event today too. The event was in the cranberry bog, after 5 min i searched for the landed scorched beast and i found it outside the event. I ran to it and then it started to move inside the event location.
---
We don't necessarily need specific dates for stuff. Just an idea in general what y'all are working on. I get bug fixes are priority and they should be. But when the 7ths inside the vault only mentions 2 or 3 things that's pretty discomforting in terms of what everyone is working on. Scorchbeast blasts are annoying but certain ranged weapons are nerfed too much, loading screens are still infinite and now the he is occasionally locking up. The scorchbeast is the least of the worries
---
Not to my knowledge. Sorry, wish I could be more help
---
Taking a workshop also flags you entire team for pvp on the player who currently owns it.  Oh yeah, it will flag that players team if he's/she's in one.
---
You still need someone to mod your Perfect Storm?
---
I'll be on for a couple hours tonight, my username is the same as my Reddit username if you want to add me.

At 73 years old I'm probably the oldest player here. Between all the Fallout games I've spent over 3000 hours. I've also spent massive time in Skyrim, Oblivion, all the Far cry's, Assassin's Creeds, mostly RPGs. 76 was very rough to start with but does much better now. I don't have the twitch reflex's to play online FPS. I hope to keep playing for many more years.

*Woah!* It's your **5th Cakeday** antigravityy! ^(hug)
---
Every Bethesda game released bad, buggy, and been embellished with what was going to be in the game at release. This is why Todd Howard is associated with the meme "Do not believe his lies." We'll do the same thing with Starfield and ES6 don't worry
---
Ok. I shall.
---
This is really non specific. Can you please give us your definition of soon? Approximately a week, a month? 
---
Also if you have an approximate ETA of when the first DLC will be released, it'll help deal with a lot of the problems from impatient people. 
---
Many thanks :)
---
I'm not sure what you mean, isn't the definition of a MMO still the same? What changed?
---
Eh, there are like 5 major bugs that absolutely must be squashed, and then content needs added. It's actually pretty simple.
---
I don't read reddit posts to be happy, if I did I wouldn't be surfing Fallout 76 media. ;)
---
But games are about fun, so go have fun. Complaining about not having fun is not a good way to get fun into your life!
---
You shouldn't. I've stopped and plan on coming back much later when this stuff is just a bad memory. I'm still hopeful they're going to turn it around like FFIV did, even if it requires a relaunch.
---
Player hub with auction house
---
uh, there were def people around this area at the time, is there even lore for that time period in that region?
---
I'd like to think it was just bad luck, but I can't help but wonder if it has something to do with the queen not being worth the time and resources. Don't really need another legendary wood left arm :)
---
Got a screenshot of it before posting, because they always manipulate it a little more to "fix" it when it's pointed out.
---

---
I would hope you avoid getting banned. I've had PA reproduce on its own  twice when the game launched (3rd or 4th week). I did nothing to cause it and quickly dropped or scrapped the extra.
---
I honestly don't know why they didn't just let you re enter Vault 76 and have this as a hub to look for new team mates and trading
---
You should just out the FO76 Filithy Casuals subreddit. It is strictly for people who love the game, warts and all.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/ 
---
Nice work. I can‚Äôt do it yet. Just hit level 37. 
---
Try to join a server with more people.  There's a good chance you only had 10 or so people in the server.  It's hard to count all the dots (especially when 2 ppl stand close together).
---
Every time I see a nuke at prime I go.  I know it will probably give me crap loot but there's a small chance it will be something worthwhile.  Plus you get prime plans and a chance at rare ultracite PA mod plans.
---
Fo76 can be  lot of fun, sorry if that is not your experience

Im usually a huge grammar nazi so i get it didnt really think about grammar until later.
---
We know most of you will. It's like every major gaming news outlet has the curse of Cassandra.
---
Any chance it's the Targeting HUD issue?  I haven't seen whether or not that's been fixed.  But everyone commenting saying it's only in PA (and certain types) with calibrated shocks.  What mod do you have on your helmet?
---
I was crashing every time I hit Grafton (even just walking in).  After some research I took the HUD off my primary PA and haven't had the issue any more.  I suspect it had something to do with all the mutants behind and in buildings the HUD was trying to highlight even while out of LoS.  Harpers Ferry has a similar density near the fast travel point.
---
Of course I had put HUD on all my PA so between that and carry weight I'm basically stuck with my Excavator until it's fixed.
---
lol i felt like an idiot for waiting 10 minutes, expecting a fight. When event failed, i could imagine a giant fart rip in the sky.
---
Sometimes the scorchbeast gets stuck outside the event location.
---
For the one in Cranberry Bog by Watoga, it sometimes get stuck in the Train Repair Spot to the NorthWest.
---
They really should have this event moved near rifts, and the scorchbeast spawn out of the rift.  That way it doesn't have a way to get bugged outside the event zone.
---
\&gt;  Doubtful he even had the plans unlocked. 
---
oh lawd.
---
Its on Facebook . Fallout76 group:)
---
I honestly don't think we will get much more support for this game for PVE honestly. The game is already under $15 for PC and they don't stand to make much more money. Unfortunately they are going the route of "Fortnite herp derp microtransactions".
---
Yes it was in patch notes to prevent server cap farming.
---
If you're having problems finding events, hop servers.  
---
Each new server will have different events up.  Some servers may have a few or none, some servers may have a lot.
---
Im game.  Ill jump on at 6pm pst.  Please message me your psn ID
---
Use the discord to announce your nuke if you are going to go after the sbq.
---
Just going to add this bug hit me the other day, (Sunday morning CT) and made my complete set of t45 short an arm piece. I picked up some mods vendor hopping the previous session, and pulled that set of PA from my stash... dropped it, and the arm was gone.  Should be fun tracking down another one of those.
---
Though it's not totally relevant to this thread, the pipboy loadin bug got me this morning.  Made the rookie move of quitting in the enclave bunker without any PA on... then loaded into a post nuke white springs.  I totally forgot about the bug in my rush to enable some PA, disabled my client and heard my death as I tried to quit.  I only lost several 1000 caps worth of junk I couldn't store or sell.... and picked up some cool new mutations,  so I got that going for me.  Hope they fix that one too.
---

---
I stopped going to them for that reason
---
If the only joy you can find in the game is bringing misery to someone else, it might be time to go play something else. 
---
Understanding rage quitting is different from actually doing it. I'm sticking with you, but, in terms of debugging triage, please push it up the list. Thanks :)
---
I have an instigating Gauss rifle with 268 damage. Works well, the 5 round magazine is annoying. Constantly reloading....
---
Queen of the Hunt.  Same issue for me on both quests.  I swear I did each more than once ( I know Queen of the Hunt I did a couple of times) now they have both stopped.  I did see someone posted that to Bethesda with their ticket info and got a response saying it was being looked at.  So my guess is they are meant to be repeated and something is stopping it.
---
Can we really trust anything you say anymore.
---
If you are on PC, i highly recommend downloading [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151), just announce it on Global channel, and you'll have players joining your server and you'll clear queen in a matter of seconds. 
---
This is an amazing idea! The only critique I have is maybe lower it to 2.5% chance, with a possible perk card to make it 3% or 4%. Crafting legendary mods would be awesome, but the duper‚Äôs with 500+ TSE handmades that do bla bla bla extra stuff, would just start scraping their inventory and duping the mods they now possess. 
---
was going to say the same thing, it seems that everyone loves this game at one point, and then it slowly but surely you start running in circles and the things that seems fun at once are an annoying chore
---
Jesus Christ why are people acting like getting into the vaults is newsworthy OR something that's going to get them banned?  People already went into all three of the vaults MONTHS ago using the power armor glitch and NOTHING happened.
---
Stop being a fucking drama queen, you're not special and you're not getting banned.
---
A player hub would be amazing. Just imagining the last populated city in the area where the remaining survivors (npcs) choose to make their last stand. Much like The City in Destiny. I'm not asking for full AI schedules for these NPC's just to people to talk to and get daily quests and event from. They dont have to be as fleshed out as previous games. They dont have to be fully scripted and not all have to be approachable. Just random people walking about and then you have the players going from shop to shop and chatting about trying to find groups. I think it would be awesome. It doesnt really have to even exist in the open world. It could be it's own little space you load into separate from the gameworld. Kinda how cities were handled in past games. I dunno. Theres so much we can all imagine and think up thats missing in the game but at the end of the day I just loose hope because I dont think we will ever have that. I hope we do, but I dont expect it 
---
Pretty much my thinking
---
That's unfair. Many of the broken things have been fixed, and this has only become a big problem since the last patch &amp; hotfix. There's a patch coming this week or next and there's a good chance it'll be included
---
Kaiju Gurl and I'm usually on in evening.  Level 41 and taking it slow. 
---
Wish I could run across someone like you when I'm not on playing with my bf. I'm a bit shy and really new to gaming though, so I kind of avoid. (This especially because someone slashed me to death while I was in my camp alone, in the menu changing some of my features. Can't say that didn't spook me. My bf wasn't playing at the time. So I'm always nervous when I'm alone.)
---
I'm only level 20 (he's about 16 levels higher usually). When I'm by myself I'm usually harvesting, collecting wood, crafting, rebuilding my camp, looting and sneaking around trying not to get myself killed. Ha. Especially when I try to take on a super mutant mob in a house or farm. I end up killing a couple and then running away, while the remaining super mutants read me for filth. Lol. But I can kill a rabid wolf pack and other animals like a mofo with my melee weapon. :-)
---
Thanks. Do you know when it is refilled? 
---
it really doesnt need all that effort. Just find the one thing that could make any griefer ache. Their decon arch. Break it. Done.
---
If they do not have one, just kite a scorth beast to their base. 
---
If that isn't an option, u could always count on the mole rat. Find one and keep running towards the base. move in from where there is no turrets. Lose the enemy and let it do its work. lol
---
Any enemy can do the works of justice to a griefer if properly guided. best part is, ur said griefer isn't warned and u r not wanted.
---
enjoy
---
What‚Äôs the issue with Polygon?
---
24 hour timer
---
Still love this game
---
And teddy bears. There's no point having such a variety of them if we can't collect them. All and decorate our camps with them.
---
As long as someone else on your server hasn‚Äôt taken your spot, your camp will be right where you left it each time you log in. If someone IS in your spot, you‚Äôll be given the option to either move your camp or try a different server. My camp has been in the same spot for two months and I‚Äôve only had one time where someone was in my spot. You will find that as you get into more high level things you want to pack up and move for your own convenience. 
---
You always get free fast-travel to Vault 76 and your camp. When you team up with people you are then able to fast travel to their camps as well. 
---
Find/buy/beg for plans that are good for your health in camp: a bed and workbenches for starters. Farm crops and replant at home. Boil water, make soup. Manage your inventory, fix your crap. Rinse and repeat.  Happy trails. For all the bugs I do love this game. 
---
That is probably what happened.
---
because you have only been playing since "the other day"
---
It's dumb and makes zero sense to me since you drop your junk, i understand it to stop fast travelling whilst encumbered but i swear 80% of the time i have to leave the world because i can't spawn full stop, i have zero map markers when i do over-encumbered. I lose my junk unless a friend is online, since everyone has their xbox profile on private and upon game restarting there's nobody in the in game social feed
---
Have they fixed the loot bug yet.  Last 2 times i killed her just got spinning arrows untol she despawned.  All 10 of us got no loot from her.
---
joke_over_head.gif
---
idk but this is maybe the best fucking facts than others useless suggestions etc.
---
i really, really hope that 76 will ressurect from the current state, and rise as the REAL game after all shit came down.
---
god bless.
---
Thank you very much for adding silencers to my brother and I's lever action rifles last night! 2 more very happy customers!
---
Weird brag.
---
Oh no, I got the attempt at a joke.
---
It was just a terribly bad one.
---
Yeah, I mean, thousands of hours in a game doesn't really make me bat an eye. But 1000 hours in 89 days is kind of a lot.
---
Why are you trying to contact customer support over a lost item?  Even IF you got connected to a human being there would be absolutely nothing they could do to help you, customer support agents never have that kind of power.  Even if they could have gotten you connected to someone who could help you even the most successful and well staffed MMOs have severe restrictions on restoring lost items, often limiting you to one chance EVER.  If you really think something bugged out and you lost something you shouldn't have then submit a bug ticket.
---
shit hey? didn't even realise it was a thing. 
---
Or better yet, OP, maybe create some sort of multi-server Auction House so people list their stuff. 
---
Probably the best thing that you'll ever see drop from one.
---
Choose your beginning - Exit Vault 63 to escape the plants, Get kicked out of Whitespring by the Robots, March into town with Taggerdy's Thunder... or just have the hiss of your Polaski's shelter opening... (Who knew they were all cryo freezers? )   
---
Choose which faction/factions to join, decide to blow up the Charleston Dam or not, accidentally release the Scorched Plague on Appalachia, take the power plant, fight the first super mutants, accidentally wipe out the first non-feral ghouls, or help them escape to the Commonwealth... Teach the Responders to boil water...   
---
And finally, hotwire a vertibot to take your Enclave/BOS/Responder/Raider ass out of there when you fail the final "wipe out the scorchbeast" quest.... watch as your vertibot crashes into the mountains somewhere in the mojave desert, sending a shockwave through the ground, which triggers a microfailure in the water chip of someone's vault...   
---
Yeah. 
---
Oh did you write this? I figured it must have been a shill but for it to be the writer is a big deal wow thanks for coming by
---
Scrapping at 5% should be a legitimate way to get a mod, but perhaps we could have a 100% manner as well. Perhaps make it cost 1 or 2 of all 5 stable flux to separate the legendary mod?
---
Then the question is: Are each * of a legendary a separate mod, or would they stay together?
---
Took her out in just over 2 mins

Yeah I got hit twice by one 30 lvl kids war drum while trading before breaking off and turning toward him with my TSE and he jumped back while his stupid buddies watched on. I never fired yet he got the picture. Thankfully also I was at full strength before going in so no stims needed. The idiot was jumping around like a kangaroo on crack. Anyway I quickly finished my trade and left. I‚Äôve learned to look close know before ever entering any station both for multiple players and just a quick pop inside if I see none to verify they are not in a stealth squat waiting.
---
some people were trying to be really pedantic by pretending that 76 isnt an mmolite because it doesnt have a large amount of players per sever
---
I had read someone tried putting up a roadblock/ funnel for grahm, but it didnt work. Not really sure what their set up was, but from what they said grahm broke off the path and went pretty far out of the way to avoid his camp.
---
He might be programmed to go around the perimeter of a camp.
---
If hes not, then maybe the player built his trap in such a way that there was no way for grahm to pass through it.
---
If the latter scenario is true, then It would be funny to build a trap room that has two garage doors, and a tripwire in the middle. the doors would be wired to close when the tripwire is triggered. My thinking is that if the doors are open when grahm approaches, his pathfinding will think there is a clear path to the other side.
---
So much this. 
---
Gone back to SWBF2 and they've added so much. 
---
Did give me a *tiny* ray of hope for fo76 seeing how far BF2 has come... That said BGS arnt responsible for the major downvoted comment on Reddit. ^^^^^yet
---
Wasn't created for PVE replayability its was created for PvP
---
Yeah, I've been running like a chicken to put the PA on before going back to rumble. Seems like this is the only way
---
Given that the Overseer's mission is to secure the nuke silos for Vault Tec - even if that means taking them away from any remnant government - I doubt they intended us to be contacted by a government official. 
---
IM LEVEL 200 AND ILL NEVER COMPLETE MAYOR FOR A DAY. ROBOTS ARE MY ENEMY!

Andromeda was without a doubt the "buggiest" ever with Fallout 76 coming hot in the number 2 spot firmly. Guess how they "fixed" Andromeda? They didn't, they cut their losses and litterally cancelled all DLC. I'm very skeptical about fo76's future since its either go all in or cut and run at this point. To me they have always been leaning towards cut and run. Either way I have got my money's worth of entertainment out of 76 the same can not be said with Andromeda.
---
Because even if they don't fight back, and don't agree to pvp, they can still be killed and loose their loot. So there's no real way to opt out of pvp-- you just opt out of defending yourself. 
---
You can be shot or slashed to death, or whatever. I play pacifist mode. That's what's happened to me. In my own camp and in Camp McClintock, where I was just trying to do the mission there and was going to talk to the colonel. Killed me on the upper balcony and kept stabbing me after I was dead. I was probably under level 10. I know it's a game, and that's probably all RP, but that's still disturbing.
---
I... don‚Äôt even know how to respond to this. You are defining your armor as ‚Äú3*‚Äù and only care that it‚Äôs upgraded to ‚Äú4*‚Äù? 
---
This smells like bullshit, or you are REALLY clueless and naive. If so, I‚Äôm sorry for you. 
---
i completely believe you
---
You cannot. The option to favorite it is greyed out and it doesn't show up on the add favorite list
---
\- I agree with others advising to remove the ceiling above before placing. Or use the camp fire method and place it wherever. 
---
I had to wait for about 10 min before scorchbeast queen loot finally dropped. Had the spinning wheel the entire fight with all of the enemy‚Äôs. After queen dropped,, I waited around. Then, out of the blue, the quest completed and gave me the rewards. Then, I was able to pick up loot from everything including the queen. 
---
All they'd have to do to get the community on their side is fix every single bug at once, never have another single glitch and provide a constant and steady stream of content so no one ever gets bored ever.
---
Their concept of "private servers" was never what people thought Bethesda was promising.
---
What they're planning is a service that Bethesda themselves will host, not a binary you can download and put your own hardware
---
Trending alert. "[Removed]". GG, Reddit app. GG.
---
Just took down a SBQ and got some nice armor, 2x ultracite plans and the decontamination shower plans. Good session all round.

Absolutely feel free to get into contact with any additional questions. I have nothing to hide.  The vault was a pretty cool place and I'm looking forward to seeing the end result!
---
Skip it wait for 6 MONTHS then check-in
---
I've got a wife and 3kids that all play as well.
---
Those players aren‚Äôt going to be the ones to bail. The players who are having all the heartache with the game aren‚Äôt the ones spending all their mats on astroturfed floors and succulents. 
---
The Minecraft kids who talked their parents into blindly buying them an M rated game are the ones spending real dough in the atom shop.  Look at which bugs HAVE actually been getting addressed and fixed... Bethesda added bulldozing and fixed all sorts of workshop and CAMP bugs, but won‚Äôt balance energy weapon damage or make three star legendary enemies drop anything besides one star shit ass wooden armor or ghoul slayer light melee weapons that I can‚Äôt scrap. 
---
Once all the lvl150+ grinders uninstall the game, all those 14 year olds will have no issue farming all the mats they need, in order to build their sweet ass little domains, which they‚Äôll take pictures of in photo mode and post to their social media accounts. 
---
They should have just called the game Fallout: Craft. 
---
Hmm maybe with a few tweaks they could reopen the white springs and make it a player hub.
---
I took the whole thing. I just made my cement base high of the ground and even and it‚Äôs easy to move
---
This game has no joy, so any he can find is amazing
---
Gunslinger builds work, but not as well as other builds. I can do the same work, better, with a Rifleman build. Too many useful perks in Agility for gunslingers; if you move all your direct-damage perks to Perception-rifles/commando, you can actually take all those useful perks like adrenaline, gun-fu, sneak, escape artist, covert operative, mister sandman, action boy/girl...
---
You know, there was a time in history when video games didn't have in app purchases or pay DLC or anything like that and the developers and studios got a long just fine with their retail sales. But you can't be a millionaire working at a billion dollar corporation if you don't get greedy. In the end, Bethesda shot callers would rather have a pay check than a happy customer.
---
They never announced what people think they announced in regards to "private servers"
---
The only thing they've ever said they're going to offer is a service that Bethesda themselves will host. Everyone assumed "private server" meant they could download it and run it on their own server, and that's NOT what's coming.
---
https://twitter.com/DCDeacon/status/1034123132284624896
---
&gt; **Question**: When you say "could," do you mean we have the option to host a server ourselves or did you mean if we wanted our own private server, we would have to use your services?
---
&gt; **Pete Hines**: if you want a private server it would be through us.
---
I have that
---
Oh wow now that's a nuclear family lol! I assumed you were some guy in grandma's basement lol I'm sorry üòÖ
---
Well i need it and nobody nukes sbq anymore lol
---
I thought about other percentages too, but then I realized how hard it will get.
---
Let's say you want a Bloody, Swing Speed, 90% Reduced Weight super sledge.  Bloody is a primary perk so you'd get lots of those from scrapping.  2nd Tier Swing speed is only present on about 25% of legendary drops.  3rd Tier Reduced Weight is only on about 5% of drops.
---
So you'd still have to grind a long long time to get all 3 tiers of the right perk.
---
5% would probably be too low for armor, since there is 3 tiers x 5 arm, leg, chest slots.
---
BONUS:
---
Now that people can get the legendary mods, you might be able to make some deals to get the ones you want.  Say someone is desperate for 3rd Tier +1 Strength, and you have that but want 3rd Tier Weight Reduction, trades will happen.  More interaction, more trading, more content :)

Every fucking time. But it's not just the queen it's almost any area where there are 2+ players and a few enemies. White springs is also shit house for this. And then after the wait we are left disappointed with the loot anyway.
---
How in the hell.....
---
Why do you keep putting an apostrophe in the word *games*?
---
I tried to lure the other radscorps over but they didn't get under the floor. Was hard to shut off the game with it still unreachable. I will be more careful. 
---
I hit whitesprings a couple of times yesterday.  I got two legendaries - a bloodied 10mm pistol (lv35) and some legendary piece of leather armor.  
---
For the rest of us to assess the credibility of the opinion you've expressed here, BenMelville34, it would help if you'd share with the number of characters you've made, their respective levels, and the total number of hours you've spent playing them.
---
Many of us once would have agreed with you ‚Äî when our investments in time and effort were still quite small, and when we'd only been playing since "the other day" (i.e., for a few days total).
---
And if you're say, a player with one character who's managed to make it to level 18 with a correspondingly modest number of hours played, we can take that into account in assessing your opinion, and whether we wish to discuss your opinion or our own different ones with you.
---
Can we all collectively dump stuff at Whitespring Trainstation?  I know a lot of people dump steel and other junk in the green box by the weapons workbench after Uranium Fever.....
---
Game needs to be x10 bigger thou. 
---
Why post anything at all if you are going to be a dick
---
A Pokemon go version for fallout with the option to challenge other players.
---
Xbox1/piallator.
---
I play by myself, but if I see a low level near me I always make a point to drop something useful to him/ her. 
---
If you joined and I'm on,  I will be happy to build a set of armor and some guns for you. 
---
Increase legendary drop rate. Focus on fun unique pop battles to use new legendaries while balancing. Profit. (Think wintergrasp from war craft, multiple ways to help besides pure pvp)
---
Lol I've more or less done the same to a shishkebab, so I can extinguish my foe like Beric Dondarrion. 
---
Considering most dedicated Melee builds will 2 shot normal SBs and the Queen is short work as well, I don‚Äôt see where you think you ‚Äúneed‚Äù range to be viable against the Queen. Ultimately, if you use both, you‚Äôre only watering yourself down and doing half of what a dedicated ranged or melee build would be doing. 
---
Lol, ur just too funny to not to laugh about ü§£ü§£
---
a place near white springs 
---
1/3 times I tried taking her down we were successful. The two other times she was glitched but man was it fun regardless. Most of us had mics and it was a blast! I wish I had more people to nuke with a Fissure Prime. I‚Äôd say 90% of nukes I‚Äôve experienced are at Whitespring. Personally I find it boring at this point. 
---
I think they'd be hard pressed to give us 5%.  Games like this live or die on grind.  Right now it's the only thing that has me even remotely interested in the game............despite that grind making me angry at the same time......lol
---
I'd just like to be able to have a "chance" for all that random garbage I get from drops to be useful.  I'd drag home garbo 2-3 star items just to see what I can pull off of them, even just for trading purposes.
---
Each legendary mod would be a separate item, like a X01 Jet Pack Mod.  So you could have a Bloody Mod, a Swing Speed Mod, and a Reduced Weight Mod...........but as 3 separate items...........that can all be applied to a single super sledge.  Side benefit, you could craft your own super sledge and apply them...........which would lead to more people doing things to boost intelligence or find high intelligence people to trade with (more durability bar).
---
I agree totally that the lever is superior for farming lower level mobs. I was going more for sbq fight and higher tier enemies with the comments about the gauss. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6jnpr/damage_reduction_needs_to_be_overhauled_or_why/) post here gives a nice overview of how armor penetration works. If you would like I can calculate it out for my bloodied gauss and lever to show you what a discrepancy it is when fighting more endgame loot pinatas. 
---
Mutations have been super buggy since the last patch. They don‚Äôt seem to be permanently lost but some combination of perks, mutations, chems, and maybe diseases (rad worms)... seems to be making them super glitchy and sometimes they vanish from your pip-boy/don‚Äôt work... but relogging USUALLY fixes it (in the case of rad-worms, wait until its run its course/you  cure it)
---
Are you on now? I‚Äôd be happy to buy 3 mutations from you 
---
Just walk into a town. Or some other locations. This will normally start an event. Not all locations will have events but many do.
---
It's hilarious how so many people here keep saying the game was rushed and released too fast, and now they are pestering *daily* for updates on new content and talking about how it has to be rushed out.
---
Y'all need to chill the F out and just see where it goes.  Go play other games if you want.  Nobody is tied to FO76, it has no monthly sub, you can uninstall and come back in 6 months.
---
Not unless they make them do a respectable amount of damage. The Alien Pistol is a joke, and even worse if you convert it to use cells.
---
any costume piece you can just find laying around like that isn't worth much if maybe you had the whole set might be worth something
---
If only I could *find* a 2 or 3 \* legendary...  I'm still using All Rise.
---
Ima not going to Nuke prime these days, cause of these bugs. Maybe after the patch. Rather going to nuke Morgantown for some Flux.
---
It costs ammunition after all and I want something in return 
---
And I'm sure they made it even more unnecessarily complex. Much like EoC did combat which is when it first started going downhill in my eyes. 
---
True but we would need to bring this to the attention of Bethesda 
---
I was 45 and died once :/
---
Because the games have ownership
---
I'll build you one, my psn is Rocketshots
---
Btw they manage to bring  new atom shop shit out like every week but no Hotfix 
---
I feel the damage is done in terms of player view on the game. They could do a no mans sky and pull it back. But by then people will be too past it to care.
---
A delayed game is eventually good, a bad game is bad forever.
---
Shigeru Miyamoto
---
The institute scientists underground were around and the vault-dwellers. The rest died or were mutated, either slightly or drastically. I'm only going off of info from FO4 vault/institute terminals and stories from the sane ghouls. 
---
You think they don't know? Come on.
---
The games gonna die if Bethesda keeps undoing bug fixes and not adding content 
---
I mean bringing the alien rifle to their attention 
---
I'm pretty tired of all the Chicken Little armchair developers here.  Always talking about how terrible Bethesda is, and how they can't get anything right, and how everything they do will surely fail.
---
Get over yourself.  If you feel this way, please just leave and never buy another Bethesda game again.  This toxic nonsense is pointless, but I bet it makes you feel good to flex!
---
Saw a post before about someone who tried it and he both went around one camp setup and the other he teleported through once he got caught in it
---
At the 11 hour mark, how do you not know whether you enjoy the game you're playing or not? It's either fun to you or it isn't.
---
I can‚Äôt really argue with you there. Very different cultural sentiments. I can‚Äôt imagine Todd Howard crying on stage for our benefit. I‚Äôm not very hopeful they will do the fans justice and make it a solid entry in the Fallout franchise. Fanboys argue and argue about how great a game it is and that it‚Äôs all a hate train (well maybe a little). One guy even told me it was a great game because it had ‚Äúfoliage, props and interactables‚Äù *shakes head*. It‚Äôs sadly an asset flip of Fallout 4 no matter how much ‚Äúfoliage‚Äù you put in it. That‚Äôs not to say they can‚Äôt make the game more fun but it‚Äôs lost an awful lot of people. It may not get them back and a lame PvP mode hardly anyone asked for is not the way forward :/.
---
I was thinking the other day about the game world they created, which they clearly sunk a lot into.  If the MP game didn't do well, they could turn the whole thing into a killer single-player spin-off with the assets.
---
I know about sunk cost fallacies, but there is definitely a lot of money on the table here.  They aren't going to leave it.
---
Reading the pinned comment, player vendors will do nothing with out a hub, you need an area players can safely gather and that has a reason to gather.  
---
We need a location that has no hostiles, you can't PvP in, and has some reason to be there that will drive players to it. 
---
Get jebaited nerd
---
Nice thanks
---
That‚Äôs what I did, submit a bug ticket, not bug customer service.  It was a very exacting condition of an item there at logoff and missing at logon.   They have gotten back with me and requested more information.    I‚Äôll update the post as more information is given.   I seriously doubt I would get the item back but I‚Äôm hopeful that maybe this information will help in preventing it happening again in an update.  
---
At the 9 hour mark, how do you not know whether you enjoy the game you're playing or not? It's either fun to you or it isn't.
---
I don't know you, and frankly don't care.  I don't want to play Apex or Overwatch, I've played FO4 to death over 1200 hours, and am enjoying FO76 quite a bit.  That is why I play FO76.
---
Guess what?  It's OK if you don't like FO76 and don't want to play it.
---
Make it so that whitesprings becomes a free to travel to area after completing a new mission. Open up part of the closed upper floors to player vending machines, make it easy to find your own or add items to it. Have everone else's lined up there too. 
---
No more perk cards please. If anything they need to reduce the number of cards used for specs like Rifleman and commando, etc. 9 points to max out 1 type of spec is crazy. The max for anything should be 5 points. Maybe make some perks have prerequisites in use to be equipped.
---
Did he drop any good loot?
---
I‚Äôll look for you
---
I was wondering about that. Made myself a pipe revolver, put a rifle stock on it, but wasn't sure if my rifle perks would count with it
---
Not really, no.
---
&gt;Early Access game's are notorious 
---
What does "game" own in that sentence?
---
&gt;Youtube and Twitch are putting game's industry websites
---
Far Cry New Dawn also comes out Friday. I'll wait for reviews, but I hope it's good.
---
They have an internal roadmap.  You're a moron if you think they don't.  They are not going to publish internal design docs or project plans.
---
No matter what they do, people like you will crucify them for it because you are chomping at the bit to attack them.
---
I do know. My original reply to you summed it up perfectly and you reply with nothing but semantics twice now. " I put 19 days of playing time in FO4 because I loved it. I put 7 hours into BF Hardline and returned it for a refund because I hated it." I realized within 10 hours that I loved FO4. I realized within 10 hours that I hated BF Hardline. It really isn't that complicated nor is it worth explaining 3 times. 
---
Player vendors aren't going to do jack unless we have a place to set them up in. Just having them in our camps is silly. I've found maybe...seven other players camps in total and I've been playing since BETA. And for me at least, I hide my camps. I assume others do as well.
---
I have a mic, but if I'm in the game with my bf, we're in PS party chat, prioritizing that so our convo isn't disturbing everyone. I try to fumble changing to prioritize game chat. Then sometimes I have to fiddle around with game chat. Then the moment is over.
---
I've also been having trouble accepting request for trade. A cool 200+ guy unlocked a door that needed a key we didn't have the other day. Then he tried to request trade with me. My button wouldn't accept. He didn't have a mic. He eventually just left. He probably thought I was stupid, but I had no way to tell him what was going on. But yeah, he should have had a mic. :-)
---
"Here's a list of the things some people want that are not on the roadmap, let's focus solely on them."
---
I lost a bloodied explosive gauss rifle last week. Was using it one second and it was gone the next. 
---
That thought didn‚Äôt occur to me about the 2-5* effects. With that in mind, I‚Äôm totally behind this notion. Having X amount of 1* mods wouldn‚Äôt really kill anything that isn‚Äôt already dead because an hour in a WS nuke would almost definitely give you a 1* mod.
---
I can‚Äôt even begin to think of how many Zelot‚Äôs pipe pistols I‚Äôve sold... 
---
Yeah, my build is so polluted by weight reduction cards it makes me sick.....lol  I wish weight cards, food cards, travel cards, crafting cards, etc were all passive.  Or you could acquire passive slots by leveling up.  Something to reduce the constant swapping.
---
Oh seriously... We're over frustrated and you have to spoil! No more secrets, lies. We're angry, for the majority the game's dead. That's enough of those teasing! 
---
Ok. At the 6 hour mark, how do you not know whether you enjoy the game you're playing or not? It's either fun to you or it isn't.
---
The point is that you are picking an arbitrary timeframe for people figuring out whether they enjoy something or not. Try this one:
---
You only played Hardline for 7 hours, that's not enough time to really get to grips with the game. It really picks up 8.5 hours in.
---
This game was sold as, first and foremost, experimental and something the team had not yet attempted.  We knew there were going to be growing pains and it was a long-term project.  You were fully informed about what you were getting into if you followed the developers.  You don't get to pretend it's anything else.
---
looking for active players in ps4. post username will add 
---
Good for you.
---
Any coloured uniform is classes as ‚Äòrare‚Äô
---
Only has any real value to collectors or people wanting that specific colour
---
I'm Jer, and I'm not Ben. I'm on PC most nights as HappyCamper781. Went  basic at Sill in '93. Branched Cavalry after though.   
---
Willing to listen and just bullshit anytime I'm on.  Friend me and the first thing we'll do is have a couple of in-game beers for Ben. He sounds like a hell of a guy. 
---
\-J
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right. I‚Äôm level 99 and have been respecing at least the last 10 levels just to get it right. All the cards are a pain in the arse. 
---
Than instead of an additional card, and using off screen dice roll using the luck stat. The ole D20 type method. 
---
I thought it was energy. Good to know.
---
ok... problem? just buy it with atoms then. 
---
Vault 76 need to be made into a Hub city
---
This is really amazing. I don't know if Fallout 76 deserves you, but maybe it one day will. 
---
This is kinda a nutty comparison to me. Minecraft has it's bugs, but it's also had constant, stable development for a very long time. 
---
If you think CAMP is even REMOTELY close to being a bug free experience, you don't spend much time using that feature. As it stands, it's a pathetically small build budget with very inconsistant building rules. 
---
And all that aside, there has to be MORE to the game and the rest of the game has to over-all WORK to get people to stick around and play it and buy into it. 
---
The irony being...the crafting system in 4 is, in every single way, better. The only upside for 76 is the placeable camps. 
---
Yeah I'm dumb enough to shill for my article, get real.
---
I feel like Whitesprings is primed to handle this. There are tons of banquet rooms that are a mystery to us, and could easily accommodate an expo vendor setup (or auction space), as well as a bellhop system and front desk where you could pick up an item.
---
Gotta turn every thread into a childish circle-jerk with shitty jokes, eh?
---
Not an mmo in any shape or form though
---
Agree and the quality of life needs to white knight and fusion core durations have just made playing feel tedious thinking of trading it in tbh after making three 60+ characters and finishing all quest lines. No one on my friends list plays anymore cos end game content is nuke fissure prime or nuke white springs and repeat 
---
The loot spinning might not get fixed any time soon. It seems like the server architecture just can't handle all the container lookups.
---
The SBQ getting stuck at the edge of the map would be fixable but I doubt they know what causes it. Only happened once to me in 30+ queen fights so it's probably not easy to reproduce.
---
Not sure you‚Äôre getting the point. All of the rest of these costumes are free, why is this one an atomic shop item when it has the same drop mechanics as the others. I‚Äôm asking if this was removed just to have more content in their shop.
---
Hahaha first day of player vending, we find out that the vendor pays YOU to buy the items
---
I don't think this game is going to be ready for even r/patientgamers
---
What about fixing the broken protective casual underarmor plan reward? (Not just in rewarding it upon completing the mission that's supposed to give it, but also to retroactively give it to players that have already completed that mission and can't go back to redo it?)
---
This is an auction house. It's been an MMO staple since WoW, ca. 2004
---
Anthem isn't being sold as an experimental game, which of course is going to have a more chaotic journey.
---
SORT OF LIKE THE GRINDER in Borderlands the Pre Sequel! When you get such a high level like me, and you have thirty one star legendaries a day to just leave laying around it would be nice to grind them all up and hope for something useful. 
---
I would totally help you get the letters mod for your CAMP so that you can put a message up in tribute to Absent Comrades. 
---
Dropping a bag for a friend is almost a 50/50 on if it will even exist.
---
My Dragon poofed to nothing this way. 
---
Someone did 2 on my server just a bit ago. I'd make sure they are a few high lvls on before launching tho 
---
Well it isn't an mmo, nothing about the game comes close to an mmo. Sure it an online multiplayer but that's it.
---
Such clingy, needy players.  Gotta have Bethesda pat you on the head regularly or else they lash out with accusations of abandonment.
---
Why do you need to be doing 3000 Damage at range? Do you not see how ludicrous that is? I agree EW need a buff, but any bloodied Weapon is going to reach great paper damage. 
---
The thing about Melee is that you will be hit, you will get diseases, you will be put in more inherent danger trying to do that damage cause you have to be close. That‚Äôs why they do so much. It‚Äôs a high risk/high reward thing. You SHOULD be one shorting things, that‚Äôs you‚Äôre reward for getting close enough to do it. 
---
I have 2 characters, my Bloodied Melee Build, and my Bloodied Range build. Melee hits for about 6k with Powerfist, cool right? I still die constantly cause it‚Äôs a WORLD OF GUNS, and you need to be close. Meanwhile, my Ranged build with a Bloodied Explosive 10mm SMG does 330 Damage a shot, and still does more damage than the Melee build. 
---
Why you ask? 
---
Cause the damage is actually applied. 
---
Cause I can stand well back and DO DAMAGE AT RANGE. I don‚Äôt have to be in danger and constantly moving to survive. 
---
This reeks of logic and good execution of a fun idea.  
---
We don't want people to feel compelled to go there to make caps/find useful things.  Instead we are going to make the enemies more spongy.  And ammo more junk intensive to promote a Feeling of pride and accomplishment.
---
That's right Bethesda I am lumping you right alongside EA
---
They broke my heart &lt;/3
---
Seems like if there are 24 player slots on every server then 24 player vending machines would be the thing. All in one spot, free to travel to. 
---
Considering fallout lore, i dont think anyone would know what soccer is. If you played fallout 4 there is a location called Diamond City that is a city formed inside a baseball stadium and no one knew what it was. Also they didnt know what a bat was, they just knew you could kill something with it calling it a "swatter". 
---
Is... Is this a joke? And was it made by you, or the devs?
---
We need more players as well 
---
Such a nice, easy prediction to make.  You get to sound all smug and superior, and nobody will remember this when you turn out to be wrong.
---
It's not my fault that you don't know which games you enjoy or dislike. You missed the point entirely and I'm once again replying to your semantics. Take care and have fun questioning the meaningless aspects of a comment while completely ignoring the actual point. Not sure what you get out of it, but I get nothing out of explaining it to you multiple times. It's just not working out lol 
---
What are you stats, level and what perks are you using?  
---
Me and my all rise hitting for \~180 damage and i'm level 56
---
Try to be more thoughtful and check the server first. If you see a bunch of low levels, server hop until you see a server with more capable players. Don't expect a warp gate to open and unleash loads of high level players. Furthermore, it isn't a call of duty for everyone to jump in the fight. So, you can't really blame the others on the server or even bethesda, eventhough the SBQ is bugged af.
---
If people don't want to do it, then they just don't want to do it.
---
I've been looking for the handmade assault rifle plans and apparently it only spawns at the venders when you are a certain level, no higher than 44...... Well, since i'm 64, I guess that boat has come and gone. If anyone has an extra schematic for the handmade assault rifle, i'm willing to trade. I have a lot of materials for crafting I'd be happy to get rid of, its literally weighing me down. GT :RufMARINE
---
Definitely shilling for someone's article, ha
---
Same, it is by far the quickest and easiest chance at one of the Mire outfits but I've only ever been able to do it twice.
---
I can corroborate this.  Early on I got like 6/10 and I was finally able to finish it around level 40 something.
---
Yeah, I'd be down for grinding as well.  They'd have to tell us what the percentages were though.  Like is it going to drop legendary mods, or legendary weapons?  If you do 8 x one star items and 2 x two star items is that a 20% chance for a 2 star item?  Would it just be better to grind up 2 x two star items alone for a 100% chance?  Lots of balancing needed to make sure the grinding felt rewarding :)
---
I hate aggressive, antagonistic idiots.  It's a bad mix of personality traits.
---
THANK YOU for compiling this!! As well as posting ‚ÄúMy Stash...is gone‚Äù post. 
---
I feel like nothing is more important than fixing the issues with items disappearing at random. Especially from our stashes (my entire stash disappeared). Every time I log in now I am like, is my stash and hours of collecting going to be gone?
---
My stash is a strategic plan to map out how I will survive, complete quests, and move forward in the game. Every item is a hard decision. 
---
Random tabula rasa ruins the game in so many ways. 
---
This fix needs to be a TOP priority! Thank you!
---
Yea, I agree.
---
WoW auction house was the first thing that came to mind for me too when I read this.
---
I would love to see the Top of the World become a hub with npc vendors, it's the perfect location for it. 
---
Twisted Muscles, Adrenal Reaction, and Radicool will pump those numbers up super fast. 
---
Even if they are, they should have item restoration tools.
---
They are in the files, but not currently available for us to buy in game. I spent some time looking for this as well as it super useful. 
---
Still some cool Power Armor related Mods/Paints/Linings that are in the files and some even mentioned in the strategy guide that we don‚Äôt have acccess to yet. Maybe they will give us more in depth customization system for Power Armor in a future update.
---
They are free to choose what they want to put in or out of the game.
---
It's been in the atom shop since day 1, and it was never obtainable through the game. They gave us 2 of the halloween costumes, so what if they kept one behind atoms?
---
in 1 hr yesterday i got disconnected 5 times. i believe your number.
---
Uh, wow, I've never seen that paint job. If anyone on PC has it, please let me know! I've got no shortage of caps.
---
People like to gamble. I love grinding crap in BLTPS, even if I don't know the exact recipes. You just never know ! Right now I'm leaving one and two star legendaries in cash registers all over the map. If there were a grinder at every train station, Voil√†! Bethesda would have what they wanted: people staying on the servers longer. Player vending machines and a grinder would keep people hopping around selling, buying and grinding. Some of us love that shit. A lot of us I'd wager. Fight the queen or the ghouls, or hopefully in the future run a vault, and come out with a bunch of crap to grind. I dunno, it's better than what we have now
---
I know what your saying friend, and I agree. My point was the huge blitz to energy weapons is disproportionate and they are pretty pointless, I'm not saying make them overpowering but at least make it so an explosive gatling plasma can do more than like 70 dmg or so. 
---
I wonder what's going to break when they roll that out. Maybe all venders share caps or the price of everything gets an extra zero at the end of the price.
---
I've never had it work while a weapon is in an overrepaired state.  Once it drops below 100%, though, I have had it pop for me.  I get it often when using my shotgun.  I only get it occasionally when using my All Rise (super sledge).  But it's speed isn't the fastest, so not as many chances for it to work.
---
Give your stuff to a trusted friend.  Relog with the new character and collect. 
---
Its a pita but all we can do at this point 
---
Dump your junk into your stash as often as possible. Especially if you‚Äôre going in or near an area with lots of people. Like a nuke zone.
---
I like your idea just because i miss the left side of the map. Shame those mobs don't scale to your level after you're too big for them.
---
Thanks for the reply. Thought maybe i was just unlucky. Just not too fond of any of the helm PA mods at least that one seems useful somewhat
---
I think the expression you‚Äôre looking for is ‚Äúwhoopsie‚Äù
---
Your semantic argument is completely flawed and leads nowhere so it wouldn't matter how many times you 'explain' it.
---
What if you play a game for 30 minutes, decide you hate it, refund it, then find out from reviews that 1 hour in it becomes the best game ever. What if a game takes ~~1~~ ~~2~~ ~~3~~ ~~4~~ ~~5~~ 6 hours to get going? Why would you refund Hardline just when you were getting to the good part?
---
Going back to my original point, defenders of this game have the perfect circular reasoning for this game always being amazing. If someone doesn't like it they have either:
---
a) Not played it long enough to form the correct opinion
---
b) Played it for so long that clearly they actually do like it
---
Therefore everyone likes the game or hasn't given it a fair chance yet, because if they gave it a chance they would like the game.
---
Thank you for making this! Helps every time with this stupid daily lol 
---
&gt;  You can even server hop to see everyone's shop in that new server.  Super easy, fast, fun trades.
---
Honestly, I think this game should absolutely not add anything that encourages server hopping. I like the idea, but people in end game are just going to sit there server hopping to give the best deal. Which probably won't be great for server stability
---
Every time I play I leave hundreds of caps worth of crap in train stations, overseers chests, you name it. You gotta check every container near a vendor. I scrap my junk and leave what ever I don't use in containers all around scrapping benches. 
---
Exactly my thoughts. Requesting and offering necessities in the field to and from players is a great feature whilst in combat heavy areas. Meds and ammo running out for instance that would otherwise mean either game over or less opportunity to make the most of an area. Quite an immersive feature 
---
oh and your screen shot is part of a quest. It's not the first time a game puts NPC designs through payment walls.
---
You are misguiding information like a dry youtuber. It was never obtainable to begin with, only through atoms. 
---
Yeah if they cleaned it up a tad and made it so you could fast travel directly to it; lower levels would have a bit of a hard time getting to the mezzanine from the ground below what with the enemies there
---
In cannon, the brotherhood melee weapons are the ripper and super sledge, as they are given to the player in fallout 1.
---
IMAGINE if we had a little robot we could call when we're done fighting the queen and have like 5 legenaries we want to sell but we're overencumbered and have to choose between raw crimson flux and that two star combat armor arm
---
Lead belly perk card does this when maxed 
---
Your so cool
---
Idk about that. It was rough but least there was a interactive story and characters to invest in. Not true btw. They had a big pve zone called craglorn released prior for free and were inproving animations and lighting including a update to facial animations ect in the same year as well as the justice system. Alot happened before even the first dlc!
---
I don't think that's being really pedantic, though. But thanks for answering mate.
---
I thoroughly enjoyed the whole tale. Damn fine artwork, and some good writing too.
---
You need to have 15 strength, max out all 3 gladiator/slugger/iron fist (whichever weapon you're using), get insisor, get bloody mess, get some Unyielding armor (which I don't have), get below 20% for +strength, get radicool, get nerd rage, get adrenal reaction, get solar powered (+ strength), get twisted muscles, get enclave shielded under armor (+3 strength), get fury, get deathclaw wellington (+2 strength), get mole rat chunks (+1 strength), get glowing meat steak (+10% melee damage), GET ADRENALINE PERK! if maxed out it does mental damage per kill per couple of minutes which good for melee, if out of power armor get ninja (and stealth stuff) it does mental damage.
---
Strength is key.
---
I didnt understand why you couldnt go INSIDE Vault 76 after leaving. Lore wise it would make sense that some people would use it as a shelter, or just be scared to leave, or since everyone knows where it is it'd be a good meet up place.
---
Plus its 0 caps to travel there.
---
&gt;In practicality there is very little chance you‚Äôd get that far without dying repeatedly.
---
My group ran this quest several times, my camp was right next to it so all you have to do is fast travel to your teammates and have them kill an entire cavern of Deathclaws and walk you through that terribly set up elevator quest.
---
I don't get your meaning. If there was a reason to go to WS people would go there. If there were more than 200 caps there I'd be there way more often
---
It's not. It's a different type of alien. I blasted off the chest piece and it exposed his feet controlling the jets. His real height is half his own size.
---
Oof, uh, that may need adjusted lol. Sure energy weapons do as well but "bloodied" is out of control.
---
You'd never get into that server I'd wager
---
I wonder if there are paid shills talking the game down in an attempt to short bathesda stock. Equally as plausible. 
---
Eh 3s a crowd.. lolz
---
We are desperate to know, is anything new coming anytime soon? My friends are dropping out of the game. I don't want to, but we really want to know if anything is coming within the next few weeks! 
---
I had the same problem the past couple of days.  I found I was being stalked but a vengeful mothman.  Once I killed it the danger went away.  I think that I was being stalked because I took all of the eggs I could from the statue and ate them.
---
Bird bones and speed demon work well with this as well 
---
Just look in all the menu items on the left bumper from the map its next to the atomic shop
---
I said as soon as you leave vault 76 not at level 14
---
Got all my mutations (10+) from the toxic water at black hole mine next to Whitesprings.  Server hop after each rad exposure as you can only get one mutation per session.
---
Polygon, Kotaku or Forbes should start looking into the shilling and vote manipulation on this sub by marketing/PR agency or Bethesda/Zenimax themselves. Look at the downvotes on this post simply sharing an article. This needs to be investigated and exposed.
---
Don't knock it 'till you try it! On second thought, maybe catch it once for the trophies hope you never find it again.
---
Yeah i used that perk at low levels but I don't really feel like using up perk points on it. Not like rads arent manageable it just seems more useful than the other PA helm mods. Only thing in use Excavator for is hauling stuff and maybe in nukesprings so im not always overencumbered. 
---
Random.
---
I sat and collected dirty water near Poseidon and cycled through 2 before I randomly got marsupial. Lots of radaway, but worth it. 
---
My mom told me not to talk to strangers.
---
Playing this game during the BETA with my friends has legit been one of the best MP experiences of my life. It's just a shame none of us have had any drive to play since mid December on account of awful server stability and balance.
---
I see so much fucking gold in this game but all the potential is getting wasted for nothing.
---
and it seems to me like an internal cell within the Whitesprings main building would be perfect for a player vendor location. Like isn't one of the floors entirely closed off right now? Just add a cell in there maybe.
---
The flatwoods monster isn't Zetan but might be a new alien.

Communication is sure a bugaboo in this game. Area chat doesn't always work! Even if everyone had a mic we couldn't communicate half the time. Text chat would solve so many problems with that. IT"S SO FRUSTRATING when you want to talk to someone but you simply can't. They have their mic on area, you have your mic on area, but nothing is getting through. WHY? who knows.
---
Nice!  Not all my advice is nonsense (like the poor guy I told to farm shopping baskets for aluminum)
---
So the same sub that constantly cries about PvP being developed in fear of griefing approves a Level 250 sitting outside the Vault to fuck with low level players? Lol k.
---
There are supposedly two spots. This is one.
---
That‚Äôs the test for self aware?
---
There's no green box there I don't think. There's a canvas bag by the green tinker's bench, is that what you mean? Or do you mean the suitcase? at any rate, I put stuff in all those containers but usually just the canvas bag
---
"I hate so much about the things you choose to be"
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
i hoped u were on ps4. 
---
Tried just a couple of times and just got flap limbs and others. Mirelurk already give feverclaw but it could be a regional thing. Anyway you got it like this so i guess i just have to keep trying.
---
This is really the best idea of all. I mean, I want WS to be the place but Top of the World is really ideally the best choice
---
It looked like 2 high school kids stumbling through a date.. lolz
---
Left them to their questions.. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
what lvl is the gatling?
---
Im on PS4 too
---
I complain because y'all won't shut the fuck about this dumb bullshit and keep spamming the EXACT SAME retard-tier talking points on this motherfucking Fallout forum. Y'all did the same thing with Elite for YEARS and all it did was make you all look like a bunch of douchebags. Everyone is laughing at you. Just stop, bro.
---
Lmao how hard do you think it is to carry a level 1 compared to a level 14
---
Pedantic 
---
Seriously dude? WTF is wrong with you?
---
Nah, reality dictates reality. You didn't even know about Survival mode being a thing. Your ignorance is legion, bro.
---
A player hub is something I have been really wanting for a while, and these are just my thoughts on it. 
---
First it needs to be free to travel to just like 76 and friendly camps 
---
Second it needs a security force, something to keep players peaceful to each other, nothing unstoppable just hard to kill, fast to re-spawn, and in rewarding to kill (ie a sentry bot that will at max drop one lead). Also as a possibility maybe they attack/claim bounty‚Äôs so wanted players cannot access the hub without paying their due 
---
Third: player vending it can be as easy as renting a shop, for a set time when it‚Äôs up its returned to the player (ie like an event reward) 
---
And finally four: player quest, so this is kinda Sketchy but hear me out, this game is heavily biased on RNG so Let‚Äôs say you post a quest to make/find an item and when you turn it in it disappears, the caps that the quest giver(QG) has put up up front would be paid out to the quest taker (QT) and then the quest would Be failed by everyone had accepted it, 
---
And of course all of these are just my thoughts. üòä
---
This is what the person looked like who slashed me to death in my camp while I was in the main menu.
---
But there is a giant catalog of games that *might* be fun. Why keep playing if you don't like it? 
---
A player hub would be an amazing addition to the game. Would help a lot for people who are over encumbered (had to get rid of so much ammo and armor) 
---
How much ammo did you burn through? I just hit level 36 and still stray from a solo fight. I've lured them to Whitesprings or somewhere with high level scorch for some AI help, but haven't gone toe to toe, er, wing yet. 
---
Heard a Youtuber bring up a similar point. How you spent the past 25 years in a vault with these same people and everyone should share a common goal. To rebuild their civilization.  But the game has little motivation to work together. What if your goal would to build cities or towns?
---
Except they don't have public stock. So no not really plausible at all. Every piece of negativity is well deserved for the game being rushed out in a broken mess and waging war on the very customers who paid from $60 to over $100 by attempting to silence them through their shady marketing practices is an even worse betrayal. I won't be silenced. Ever. [I will get louder and louder.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CevxZvSJLk8)
---
Right - but I take a "player hub" to mean "reason I go to mainly because there are other people there" (so that you can do things like trading or teaming up with them). Lifting the cap limit would certainly result in people going to Whitesprings more often, but even then I don't think it would reach that critical mass required to be a place to go to for some reason other than trading with the robot vendors.
---
My headcanon is the reason for the so many different methods of repopulation among the control vaults is Vault-Tec scientists probably didn't agree what the best method would be so they diversified them. There was probably a group of scientists that wanted vaults to become new population centers, but then other scientists probably feared that people would become too dependant and could all die if something like the water system fails.
---
So I think it makes sense that something like Vault 76 forces itself to shut down while other vaults can still be used for much longer.
---
Well no shit any level can do it if you get carried, Sherlock. At that point you‚Äôre not doing any of the work which is what I‚Äôm talking about. Go troll somewhere else.
---
Circus people
---
Very welcome. There are those who doubt this though, and I get why. But to doubt all the people having the problem (for whatever reason - they're haters, they lie, they are pushing the wrong keys) kinda underscores there is a problem(s). 
---
In your case I read your thread and thought, oh no, the answer is they can't restore your stash. And your update confirmed it. Was really bummed to see that. If you're on PC and need junk let me know, got tons of gears, screws and springs. No charge.
---
You can buy the plan the T60 jet pack at the BoS vendor in Watoga. 
---
i personally would also like to see the "Plasma Infused" prefix come back from fallout 4, adds 15% energy damage and makes bullets impact a tiny gooey sploosh on walls
---
I think I replied on the wrong line but naught an excuse to be rude.
---
This only makes sense after all prewar humans died off. The vault dwellers who were alive before the war would obviously know what soccer and baseball were. 
---
You know, I noticed they maniacle looking grin, but with the way in which Modus talks, I just figured it was meant to look creepy
---
Ya but I don't count the last ten being inactive
---
Awesome write up!! I wondered how all the aa effects,perks,etc. All stacked up. 
---
Definitely looking forward to more tests. Thanks!
---
Say what?
---
the pip boy can play a selection of holo tape games, 1 of them you can get from fallout 76 in your room's terminal. 
---
I ran into it 2 times in daylight
---
Because I still have hope for this game. I'm now a 1200+ cap pinata running around West Virginia naked holding a chainsaw. Somebody needs to take me out and end this purgatory!
---
What platform are you on? PC, PS4, Xbox?
---
why is that stupidly?
---
Sure. Got pics?
---
Ah yeah Runescape grand exchange i remember it well, I reackon a central neutral zone hang out would go a long way to increase players interaction in the game. No one wants to stop and talk when their grinding away or on a quest thats for sure.
---
Make the % of pulling the legendary modifier a card. Each level of the card makes that % go up a bit. 
---
No. Not at all.
---
Given the friends lists going dark...
---
Yeah, people are actually quitting and moving on to better games.
---
great damage.. but its basically the blast radius of a loud fart. Nuka Nades are infinitely better. 
---
I wonder if Fallout 76 was just a vault experiment for adding multiplayer to the next Elder Scrolls game. 
---
Get with a team
---
I'm really not 
---
For real. Add hops plants and a still and people might actually use the meriad of booze perks
---
np!
---
I don't hang on to weapons especially if they are higher level than me and won't reach that level for a while.
---
Also i haven't played sense they messed with everything and that may well be a great time now and i was only joking 
---
I ran through about 65 .308 rounds and 16 .50 ball rounds. I got 3 reg. grenades and a few smacks with black diamond on him when he grounded. (Black diamond didn't even tickle him?)  I feel like I got lucky somehow.
---
about 20 hours from now. i usually do my runs every day about the same time. 
---
Level 40
---
Yes. Google Eliza for info on it. It was the first chatterbot 
---
I was expecting more than that. Time to suit up and head out! 
---
Happened to me the other day.
---
Paid another player 400 caps for a TS lever action rifle. 
---
Not ten minutes later noticed it wasn‚Äôt in my inventory any more or my stash.
---
Keep only the weapons you use.  Keep only the ammo for those weapons.
---
Set a hard limit of each junk you pick up.  Say... over 100 and you dispose of it.  
---
Honestly I was just dissapointed Roger was all the way over in the west coast preventing me from shooting the fuck. Or at the very least stopping him from making the BoS, he seemed like a guy with good intentions but his PTSD and hatemongering only lead to the creation of one of the most powerful group of zealots on the planet.
---
So it's pretty clear that in the early days of this forum- when it was mostly fawning praise- the people praising this game ***hadn't actually got out there and played it.***    
---
This is a problem that has been around since Beta and yet this is the first time I have seen anyone post about it. 
---
And bulk everything, atleast that way you can sell it to vendors, if youre a horder and love grabbing everythig you see then its amart to bulk and sell, you can make 1200 a day in about an hour 
---
"You say potato, I say trade-o!" Can Graham and Charley the MooMoo be there as well.  I want other NPC's. NPC robots just aren't fun enough. :)
---
Woopsie 
---
cooked food as well as soups spoil over time
---
400 hours in the game buddy. I just never bothered with events. Aside from uranium fever and the night one with the wendigo. Most events take up too much time for little to no worthful rewards, aside from plans, which I am in no hurry to collect.
---
I now started to do the other events and unfortunately this happened lol. It was irritating to wait 10 minutes to fail, while expecting something to happen.
---
Yeah, it's hit or miss. For one Queen kill yesterday I got loot and for the 2nd I didn't get anything.
---
I found references to that. Though they were saying late Q4 2019. 
---
Whatever floats your boat
---
Wayyyy better 
---
I love melee but This is why melee is going to get a huge nerf. 
---
My wife and I were running a silo. She DC's rejoins me and can't get back into the silo. She had to restart the whole thing... we just logged of first time we were motivated to play in a couple of weeks. It's 2019... this shit isn't that hard. 
---
Getting the game in a few days but I don't think I want any help(May seem weird). I want to find and earn everything I get because it seems like it would get boring with a head start. But then again I'll be playing as a lone survivalist that occasionally sees other people around so it fits the build mold. 
---
Yes sorry I for some reason related the crypod with the government since I was unable to remember what the terminal said for such bunker lol
---
Yeah the loot she drops is shit.  I wanted the plans for Ultracite Calibrated shocks, but she only drops explosive vents and rusty knuckles. I got a Kinetic dynamo once.   I killed and looted her 10 times.  After that I lost count. 
---
I simply gave up in disgust. Nowadays if someone nukes fissure site prime I don't bother. 
---
If perception or intelligence gave a bonus to guns we would all be even. 
---
I fully had expectations for something not perfect, it was their first attempt at this type of game. Not sure how it excludes you from building a roadmap for the game. 
---
I must be doing something wrong.   
---
All sluggers maxed, gladiators maxed, insisor maxed.   
---
13 strength. I can't remember what else exactly but i've leaned pretty heavily towards strength
---
Looking for it, but till I can pull that source, just consider my comment there to be hearsay. Sorry for confusion.
