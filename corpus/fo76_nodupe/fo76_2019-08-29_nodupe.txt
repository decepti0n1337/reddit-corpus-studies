I'd like to point out a bug that I would like to be fixed. The scattershot perk for shotguns requires me to reinstall it when entering or exiting power armor. It is kinda tedious especially when in the heat of a fight.
---
---
---
Haha thanks man!
---
I'll max STR and AGI right away and my build and gear will be able to get a good boost in both damage,survivability and quality of life. Then i'll also max the stealth damage perk because why not, I got coins and am not bloodied. The last 3 slots will be for poison resistance,radiation and either anmo crafting or hacking/picking.
---
this definitely happened
---
Same lol. My first spot was the Flatwoods bridge, but that was an awful idea since everybody walks through there. Now it overlooks the robot city (forget name) on a mountain near the radio tower. It’s on top of a mini pond
---

---
(Good idea as well since I completed the quest making the robots friendly)
---
First thing that came to my mind! Have an upvote sir.
---
RIP Desmond!

All over the place.
---
Thank you!
---
I identify as a meat popsicle.
---
Where is the funny part
---
If that information was released, it would be on the website
---
Whats your GT? I'll come build you one. Also you get a plan free when you do scorched earth. 
---
This is a limited time offer as i was just about to go to bed.
---
Are you sure? I learned an Elder one i got through trade and i haven't seen another one yet. But ive got 4 copies of the Knight CPT paints.
---
Nah, dont think so. Theres a fallout 4 mod that lets you dual wield, and that doesent change the engine
---
My thought exactly. I already have a ammo mule.Specializing it into ammo crafting seems the most logical choice.
---
I should also max 3 right away,but it's gonna be tough levelling the other 3.
---
Keep it
---
Flux.nukes 2 locations on the map alot latley. Use that flora perk card to get double yield and kill enemies in the nuke zone for radiation fluid you need 10 raw flux and radiation fluid per each stable .super duper helps alot also.or try that trading reddit.alot sale for caps there
---
Holy crap!! It's Seven Gun quota .....thank you!!!
---
I have 3 don’t know if they’re or not
---
It's "magic" it does more damage than it should due to damage calculation bugs.  Don't worry, it's fixed in the next update.  :)
---
Seems that others have the same problem with no common fixes. These are:
---
Verify the game through launcher
---
Set windows display size to 100% through settings
---
Updating drivers
---
Uninstalling teamviewer if you have it installed
---
Reinstalling the game
---
Not using a separate monitor
---
Alt+tab out the game at launch, then open the game again
---
Switch to windowed, then back to Fullscreen
---
Disable Fullscreen optimization through right clicking .exe launcher
---
Setting in-game and monitor resolutions to same size
---
If those don’t work, a common comment that I see is that old hardware is to blame, though that can just be an excuse for all I know.
---
Nice. GT JaggersLips13
---
That's some healthy shit, gimme a shout, I'm about to strap my Pip - Boy on. Xx GT JaggersLips13
---
where is your camp?
---
They don't do any damage at all until both parties are flagged for pvp, Bethesda removed the slap damage long ago and keeps patching exploits that bypass the pvp/pacifist mechanics.  The only semi free for all pvp area in adventure is workshops so if you don't want to chance pvp avoid those.
---
Not rare.
---
I was thinking that some perks that encourage you to use pistols as an off-hand weapon would be cool.
---
Like doubling pistol damage for five seconds after a weapon swap, but only if swapping from a non-offhand weapon. Could also to the same thing with one handed and fist weapons.
---
Nope, I have a nice camp and I like to set it in places easy for newbies who may not have purified water, all the crops/ work benches, things like that.
---
No it has a static spawn
---
It used to be a common spawn in the antique store in the cranberry bog, but not sure if it still spawns
---
On PS4
---
Salame
---
So not actually "pepperoni" lol.
---
Not really. I set up my camp as a bed and breakfast/workshop with a bar in the train cart over. I just pretend that I'm busy scrapping and repairing stuff.
---
I follow them around with a pair of binoculars. If they stand still, I make sure to get in their face as close as possible and zoom in with my binocs.
---
I just go and get killed. I feel they have spent hours working at a private server and it is OK if they want to take my abraxo cleaner and some clipboards.
---
Its slightly rare, but fairly easy to find so most would say not rare.
---
This is enough..mom buying one
---
Ooh I see, Atomic shop said it was a skin but didn’t say for what weapon. Interesting...
---
After accidently soloing Earl, I decided to take in a couple of lv 20 players to show them a good time and help level them up in the next one, they are now a proud owners of lv 20 cursed weapons!
---
Is it? I haven't seen that. Unless you just mean the big nerf.
---
Happnin?! I'm UK, gimme a shout, I'll be on all Weekend. GT JaggersLips13
---
I have seen one poster suggest legacy explosives do full splash damage on queen but have not noticed this myself..  the explosive radius is pretty small so I'm skeptical about the claim as well.
---
You sure it’s the same server and you not just having a super common spot? Also do you have fo 1st by any chance?
---
Hunters is good for the queen.
---
What platform? I just got a max level, Furious / Faster Fire Flamer last week on PS4... I was going to recycle it but said “Nah, somebody probably wants that”...
---
Paul Daniels.
---
Maybe a TSE Gatling Plasma with beam splitter does the job. What you say?
---
Carry tons of stimpacks and play the medic, sharing survival perks like the mysterious stranger, faster stimpacks, etc. People die a lot. Keeping a lvl 429 heavy gunner in the fight is usually a good investment.
---
I’m not sure the direction... but when you drop down the shaft facing forward I think the exit is to your left.
---
PS4 What is your PS Username?
---
I figured it probably wasn’t. Didn’t ever see it on any rare lists but thought I’d ask.
---
Furious ffr or anti armour ffr would probably serve you quite well. You get a free AAffr 250 .50 cal from the Beckett quest line. Explosive is often a very desirable secondary trait. Faster reload may be ideal for heavys as a third trait.
---
I would also pick up a plasma caster for those times you want to 1 hit things. Instigating would be the pick for that. I have one and it hits 600 to 800+ torso shots with prime ammo. Vats accuracy is very high even with low perception
---
west of Lewisburg is Rollins work camp?...there is an npc there named beckett. finish his questline for a good heavy weapon...50 cal
---
[removed]
---
It's marked removed and people are talking about gulper food. What was originally here?
---
Thank you for having a level head and posting this. 
---
People get so obsessed with damage numbers and dont look at the total situation.
---
They also fail to see that this is just the first step of the balance pass. With the game being smoother and more consistent like you said, tuning  and adjustments will be much easier to do.
---
It shares a spawn with other BOS items. I remember finding some under armor there.
---
I might for now. But good to know I can ditch it without worry.
---
Recently, I had a owner follow me around with a pistol draw saying nothing but staring intending at me while I look at vendor
---
Yeah I saw most of them I think. I did everything apart from reinstalling and nothing worked so I gave it a shot and made my own post about it. I'll do it again just to make sure but I guess I can't avoid it any further and will delete it and download again. My hardware is like 3-4 years old, I'm not sure now so that shouldn't be an issue. Thanks for your time man
---
Ohh I want to know the results of this. Haha.
---
I used a splitbeam JE auto laser rifle and it didn't seem to work, but then I have ammo capacity issues gatling plas does not
---
Indeed! If only it had a power feed so I didn't have to build a fusion generator to power all the extractors and a few turrets.
---

---
Bud Light presents, real men of genius.
---
To be fair, the Imposter Sheepsquash's loot pool is identical to any Legendary Assultron, the only decent reward is the event completion that every participant get!
---
If you've only done the Raider side then the Gauss Minigun. If both then the Gauss Shotgun,. Then T-65 pieces, then SS armor parts from Rex.
---
But what about the easy access to Brahmin milk? Now I have to fast travel about to make my pepperoni rolls
---
I *just* launched a nuke in the pts right now.  I stood right in front of the sbq and pounded her in the mouth.  Based off of previous experiences with pounding her in the face, she's given in much quicker.
---
TL;DR magic is definitely fixed in pts.  When will it come out to live servers?  Idk, but soon probably
---
EDIT: before I played pts today, that was a small update, so they very well could have fixed it JUST today, so it may be a really new thing.
---
The downside is most junk spots are pretty popular.
---
YES!!!!
---
Technically you are a cosplaying nerd
---
I'll try to get her tonight. I'll let you know the results.
---
The SBQ actually does drop unique loot with plans from the corpse!
---
the Collosus the only fun loot from the body is his balls to show off your kill in a display case!
---
We are getting the nerf at the same time we are getting legendary perks so the damage drop off isn't as bad when you include "take one for the team" or "follow through". Additionally whats the difference between dealing 2k headshot damage vs 800 headshot damage to a scorched? Its dead no matter what. This an indirect buff to sbq/earle/endgame content. Which imo is alot better than, "here sbq have some double health".
---
Vampire gauss minigun rocks
---
They flopped because ppl cried that u couldn’t just shoot your way through. U needed a team. With purpose and planning. Or you needed to be good, with practice and hard work. And you couldn’t just show up and get rewards for being there.
---
This is peak 8 year old mentality
---
I remember one specific point, due to how I frequent the WS area.  The entrance to the Blackwater Mine (that mine where Uranium Fever occurs) has a bobblehead spawn on the roof of the mine entrance, on some weird pillar/smokestack thing.
---
Just plans. You can get treasury notes(which you can turn into the press machines at both foundation and crater, max 20 notes a day for 200 gold) from doing event, dailies, and such. You can also buy a set amount of gold with caps weekly at the wayward I believe. As for spending gold, both foundation and crater have npc's that sell plans that unlock as you gain reputation. You can also of course go back to the secret service to buy plans from them as well.
---
I used to hate on low level players for showing up in events like this. But shit like this is EXACTLY what made me start to love them. 
---
Some still don’t do much, of course. But they can be So Very Helpful.
---
Yep, I just did too.  I think they may have fixed it since the last time I played.  Definitely does NOT work
---
still there smh
---
You and me both, I’m only like 35% through neighborly, it’s taking -forever-
---
I’m guilty of being that low level player in the event at 42 currently but I’ve been giving the group at least 6 buffs at the beginning with lunchboxes and spend most of my time trying to revive as many players as possible being a medic build. I can’t do much to Earle but I can at least help out with the wendigo spawns. Thanks for all you high level players not bashing me too hard. I know I shouldn’t be there. I just want the rewards, caps, legendaries, and to level up as much as I can. I unfortunately don’t get to play as much as I’d like to.
---
Any weapon is still viable. I run a bloodied 50 cal but overall play at full health; the bloodied is for when I'm in a pickle.
---
I found a canary cage. So many little details. You can tell they put a lot of effort in to making the area. Shame you don’t really get a chance carefully examine it
---
Most likely duped. You won't he banned though so work away.
---
Update, magic is DEFINITELY FIXED in pts.
---
Farm the events where enemies carry shells. Uranium Fever, Line in the Sand, etc.
---
Also, if you are willing to trade repair kits for shells, join a Colossal Problem. The wendigos you kill will drop ammo from the weapon you are using. To give an example, I entered the event carrying 400 shells and walked out with over 600, having killed an army of wendigos. 
---
I oneshoot most of them, and some can drop 30 shells. Some, nothing. Still, you collect. And selling the junk can give you caps to buy shells for 1 cap at vending machines.
---
You dont get banned.
---
I thought I was seeing other people be banned for using duped items?
---
I agree with ya cuz I'm only like 60ish% through neighborly but if they took away that rank it would make the effort the people who already grinded it pointless
---
I just go about my business.  If they wave or do some other emote I'll respond but for the most part I leave them be, do what I came back to camp to do and then head back into the world.
---
Na - its just nonsense. 
---
Imagine I came across you in game and dropped you 5 stimpacks.
---
You use them.
---
Turns out, i duped them.
---
Would it be reasonable to ban you? How could you have known?
---
You can jump through most windows due to the lack of glass.

quick and easy to check
---
I totally agree with you, but after looking it up it sounds like that's exactly what happened to people. Given, it was a post from a year ago.
---
Cool... I can’t think of anything I need, so i’ll take a few caps or fusion cells... how’s 1,776 sound?
---
My PSN is ”DexteraDominiDei”.
---
I believe the BOS fatigues, medical helmet, welding helmet, and flight helmet also have a chance to spawn there.
---
Sounds good to me.
---
Just give caps or something I’m around 50% ish I just want my. Gauss Mini gun
---
I have a be plasma and against earle the splash did like 6 damage
---
I don't even lock my extractors or purifiers, by the time I return to my camp it will have completely filled up again!
---
no
---
The bathroom bundle: clean toilet, functional shower, bathroom mirror stash box. Ceramic floor tile pattern for flooring. And a sign/billboard that says “working toilet plus toilet paper!” (Shower requires rad arch plan and removes rads) coming soon to the atom store! 
---
(Guess which item is exclusive to the bundle)
---
Was it hard to install?
---
Myah
---
My opinion is go vampire's at 20% health with all the bloodied things except actually bloodied.  It's really really hard to die.
---
What does survival shortcut give you exactly?
---
I 100% judge people by their names. It helps weed out the truly unbalanced individuals.
---
That makes so much more sense! It must be a recent defect.
---
Honestly with the amount of time spent trying to find 5% xp bobbleheads you may just be better off grinding slightly less xp.
---
That may be true but as a boxers man I can't deal with the briefs, ruins the immersion
---
Or a hulk mutation that’s +6 Str +6 End, and -3 to all other stats
---
How about anti vats nade perks for nuclear winter
---
Using vats fixes this issue for me
---
For sure! Well, stay frosty with the nukes- if you see 'em coming you gotta decide if what you are doing is worth the scrap!
---
Alright... I’ll be on in about 10 minutes, but I will need a few minutes to locate it, because my alts aren’t very organized and I can’t recall which one has it.
---
Like most bugs then?
---
The most colossal problem I face is getting blown up in nuclear winter by a vats grenade
---
Are they tradable? You may be able to trade them for some of the other event loot (although I think harpoon guns are the most common drop)
---
I can hear every bloodied unarmed build just intensifying from the mere proposal of that haha
---
Northern Savage Divide unite! Well, I mean if you are right next to the mine, you are probably hosed unless the people dropping them are kind. Kind with their thermonuclear warheads. Sounds stupid when I say it like that lol
---
The entire thing is a mcguffin for game play purposes only.
---
I think Bethesda should remove vats  grenades from nuclear winter
---
Raiders 4 lyfe. Got Ace too lol and built my raider themed camp around some raider NPCs
---
Anti vats nade? Forgive me but I don't play much nuclear winter, what would that do?
---
How about defense against explosives in nuclear winter

Meanwhile there's me, 200+, who will show up and do the same, but in just a hazmat suit.
---
That would have made more sense as beckets reward
---
I feel bad for heavy weapons users in nuclear winter
---
They will be the only viable weapons left
---
You know the Croc backpack? It looks the same, but instead of the Crocolossus Plushie, it's a cute little Gorilla Plushie (also wearing a Safari hat).
---
I wasn’t ready for the plot twist
---
I want it for by two handed build. No bloodied, just extra damage
---
I agree, it won't let me place my camp blueprint in nuclear winter half the time.  Wtf
---
Oh my god, really? What about direct hit?
---
You were put in a seperate instance. You were most likely the 9th person there.
---
I forgot all about the motherload fast travel things.... where are the again?
---
Sorry, but I don't remember, tbh.  I strongly recommend a gauss minigun
---
That makes 2 of us then. Fantastic!!
---
Are you on pc?
---
I agree it's pretty sad you have to play nuclear winter with an sad to spawn in at a decent time as other players in nuclear winter
---
Nuclear winter was fun but the hacks and cheats have ruined it. I made it to level 50 before finally having enough. One out of every three games im killed by a flying dude, or rapid fire punched to death with no one anywhere near me, or like you massive turret spawns. Im over it.
---
Bethesda refuses to implement anti cheat as this game really was just supposed to be a quick cash grab. Not saying that to be mean, It is what it is. Ubisoft did the same thing with Far Cry New Dawn. Just a quick easy cash grab reusing assets from a previous game.
---
The only thing doing too much damage is people who use explosives in nuclear winter
---
Agree with you entirely.  I have no issues with what happened to Bloodied and that is my main weapon.  What will run me off the game is being forced to abandon my slow firing weapons and switch to Commando for everything.  Bad enough I have to do it for pvp but if they don't even want us using those for pve then they just need to take them out of the game.
---
Because the meta of it *all* is that West Virginia is the home ground of vault-Tec experiments and manipulation.
---
We nuke because we have been taught to nuke, and we, as *survivors* have no consequences.
---
“No” consequences.
---
They can just glitch thru the door or run in while its spawning in.
---
I don’t think it will be a great challenge. Depends on environment aswrll
---
But if I win I shall be suprised :)
---
Pvp wouldn't be a problem if they roof fix nuclear winter bugs and add a new map
---
Also worth mentioning:
---
&gt; the damage Calc changes are a new platform for them to actually begin tweaking values without run off effects. This means they will be buffing things to get some of your old numbers back.
---
And what exactly is unique in SBQ?
---
\- Prime mods can be unlocked faster by scrapping the weapon (that's how I got it for the handmade, for instance)  
---
\- plans for the ultracite armor are unlocked by doing the main quest  
---
... and every SBQ mod for the ultracite armor/primes can also be found in normal scorchbeasts  
---
I would wish for something unique in the sbq item pool (even something like a specific junk item (like the wendigo balls))
---
Yeah it’s a bit excessive. I thought that too. Honestly I think the mine should be worse off after a nuke in all honesty
---
Idk but they should fix the bugs in nuclear winter and add a new map
---
"Old World Gourmet" as a Mutation. Meat and Plant meals offer no Food, but Canned/Boxed Old World items have tripled Bonuses.
---
Well I have over 2500 treasury notes. I might have a problem. 🤔😅
---
Bloodied builds are fine, it's everyone else who's going to have a problem, with every weapon doing so much less damage, people need to stock up on more ammo and repair their weapons much more often!
---
They are nerfing every legendary effect, every damage perk, every weapon mod, every buff food/chem/drink.
---
Probably not.  I play on consoles so I can't try out the PTS myself but I've watched 2 different videos testing the nerfs and both came to the conclusion that the damage nerfs don't really change much.
---
Thanks, I tried using vats but I still got the same result.
---
Cool opinion bro. But it would be cooler if they would fix the glitches in nuclear winter and add a new map
---
Oh! Was kinda hoping things would be harder, but in a way that's good that its fixed
---
With strange in numbers and class freak, that's way way way too strong.
---
You experienced a glitch, prime mods aren't supposed to be unlocked by scrapping. Ultracite power armor mod plans are unique to Scorch Beasts but are only guaranteed drops from the Queen. I've been playing since beta and I've still not seen Ultracite Calibrated Shocks yet.
---
What if this was the one legendary that defied ~ 1/250000 odds and did drop the B2525 handmade?
---
lol people are really struggling to admit the days of free atoms are ovah and dunzo..
---
In some ways I'm sad to see it go, but at the same time I'll be making 6 times as much ammo and am invincible so why should I care?
---
One wasteland will add several more problems than the one it fixes though. I’m gonna have to use my best gun and best ammo everywhere I go which means more ammo farming, my base will constantly be attacked by level 100 mobs and the turrets will still be a clunky POS that takes up way too much space and still does nothing, all my secondary weapons I carry with throwaway ammo for low level areas will become useless... A damage nerf on top of all this? The list goes on.
---
One wasteland should be an option you can turn off and on. As a level 400 I’m not looking for the fight of my life with every common enemy being level 100.
---
Man I feel so lucky, 6 attempts, 6 successes, have never needed to respawn, always 7/8 are 100+ and people aren’t stingy with ammo.
---
I really hate this routine where everyone waits for someone to start unleashing before they will
---
No I was the 7th
---
I agree score is a waste of time, nuclear winter is more fun.  Especially if they would fix the bugs that have been there since day one beta
---
True, maybe a bigger negative?
---
Yeah lol
---
Nothing since vats doesn't work on other players in NW.
---
Dang! I'll get that from becket. Does SBQ and Earl technically have armor?
---
I JUST bought the caster plan
---
Nah.  They sshould spend more time fixing nuclear winter
---
And that's exactly what the "adjustment" will force. DPS will be the meta. It's akin to the damage cap that essentially destroyed survival. I will say it again, the TSE change devastated my friend group. Looking at your pipboy and seeing lower numbers will result in the same. People don't care how it's calculated,  they care that their perceived damage output is reduced. That's a nerf.
---
A perk to reduce the weight of rifles would be nice. Not sure why heavy weapons, pistols and melee get perks like that but not rifles.
---
While you have it active the max any other stat can be is 12 instead of 15?  You lose out on perk cards too.  Maybe even 4.  Class freak is just so so strong.
---
How about instead of getting no food from it, you'd get like disentary or something instead just to spice things up 😂
---
I always just wave and go about my business, I only get uncomfortable when people want to trade, I have 4 really killer prime gatling plasma’s, and lasers I carry around, and inevitably it just becomes a “wtf, you won’t sell just one!?”. I don’t need anything, and I don’t know the best emoji to use that says “Thank You, but no thank you.. “ 😞
---
I joined a guy in a Collosal Problem today myself, the event icon had vanished and I had joined him though the public team. He was standing and waiting for a squad who would never arrive. 
---
I waited with him for 2 minutes before deciding to take on the boss myself, I nearly soloed Earl before he realised I was wreaking shit by myself jumping down to aid my battle after Earl mutated!
---
It's interesting to see that Earl's health bar and resistances scale by the amount of players like the SBQ does.
---
That's what I thought haha I am confusion
---
I’m a PA heavy weapon guy lvl 268 I did it with plenty of time left with another guy I think lvl 90 PA dude.
---
Ultracite PA mod plans, some of which are extremely rare.  There’s a tiny chance you can get them off a standard Scorchbeast, but the queen drops a mod plan every time.
---
The entire reputation system is trash. You don’t really unlock anything until max rep that’s not how that’s supposed to work.
---
*all* ammo except Ultracite ammo is *one* or you can say goodbye to your workshops.
---
That's a good idea that I never thought of. Maybe add an additional buff to like pistols get faster holster time and rifles get fast aiming?
---
Started opening them. Sure as shit my town had an internet outage right after. My heart dropped when it said could not connect to Bethesda servers. Thought I was banned lmao.
---
That's a lot of text just to say "it's not a Bloodied nerf, it's an everything nerf."
---
Agree its a bit refreshing with all these perfect fairytale endings. This ending is more realistic.
---
I completely understand and agree with everything you’ve said. I’ve put my quad Tesla down for a bit when it comes to this event specifically. Then I get to thinking “isn’t it’s utterly ridiculous that I can’t use a weapon that’s useful and that I want to use because an EIGHT player INSTANCED boss fight can’t handle it!” It’s beyond a joke but I guess that’s the hand we’ve been dealt with this game.
---
Survival Shortcut could be interesting unless they follow through on removing thirst and hunger.  I don't care about  the well fed/hydrated bonuses otherwise.  If they abandon removing thirst/hunger it's one I might consider just so I never have to touch food and water ever again which frees up carry weight and lets me ditch Thru Hiker and use those perk points elsewhere.
---
With the changes to the damage formula Follow Through could be a good bonus for stealth builds if you're not killing everything in one shot any more and is more worth considering than I used to think from before they started messing with the formula.  This is more "wait and see" since I'm not on the PTS and I don't know how much the damage changes are going to affect my build.
---
Ammo Factory would be a great choice if we're all going to be using more ammo with the damage changes, but this is another "wait and see" to determine how much extra ammo is being used and if it's not already compensated for by the ammo machine and the new system where some enemies drop the ammo you're using.
---
But the real winners are absolutely the SPECIAL perks because there's just so much value in being able to cram in even more regular perks.  Especially if you don't give a shit about any other legendary perks and just equip and rank up as many as possible.
---
Honestly, neither was I
---
Experienced this jumping from Xbox to pc ssd. It’s like two completely different games. It’s a travesty what the consoles are dealing with
---
So you are telling me a computer can't handle doing multiplication instead of addition?  It's not an abacus.
---
Pistol perks need moving to perception, the agility perks are really needed for the build, but cannot be used if you have pistol damage perks.
---
You went to the bathroom together?
---
Why? The board was meant to take time. You finished. You are done. Enjoy the time between now and the next season. Explore Appalachia, take a break from the game, help out lower level players, do something you haven’t done before. Next season take more time.
---
What are magic weapons if you don't mind me asking?
---
I always kill cows when they refuse to be milked. Then I usually repair it if the camp has razorgrain.
---
#Not a chance.

If you're concerned about dr, I would honestly go with power armor because of the 42% dr

Exactly, people get pissed at others for making Queen fights last so short, but I say that just saves me ammo and aggravation of waiting for her to land. The Queen, Earl, and the Imposter Sheepsquach, none are guaranteed to drop a 3* legendary, so the actual real rewards from those events are the ones you get for the event completing.
---
The most colossal problem I have ever felt is explosives being over powered in nuclear winter.  Thank you for this post
---
After looking at multiple player vendors everyday for the past 4 months you will absolutely not get banned.
---
Well regardless, you were put in a seperate instance. Its not a bug afaik. I've noticed it starts to split them after 5-6 people join the first one.
---
That’s awesome. Any chance you could link me to where you’re seeing this??
---
Damn! I couldn't have said it better myself! These aren't WOW style raids so the sooner/quicker they're beat the better.
---
You're right,  they need to fix the bugs from nuclear winter so we can pvp for real
---
You can post on the market sub that shall not be named for someone with high karma to mod it for you. Essentially they prove their trustworthiness. i have the deathclaw "mod" itself but not the mole miner. GL.
---
I don’t know what to tell you, only that it would probably drive me mad to try and figure out what’s in the secret sauce recipe you have inadvertently stumbled upon.
---
You can kill SBQ without broken weapons ya know.
---
What about the fact the main quest lines are completely broken and unfinishable because of the ounce of prevention bug
---
Yea exactly my point lol
---
Remove every legendary capability that causes it, deal with the... fallout
---
He hates you. Sorry bro.
---
I think he means sbq events and the such where you are still wiping the spawns after.
---
I personally have only had issues with PvP maybe twice in a couple hundred hours of play, I also dump junk regularly and won’t enter a PvP area with junk on me. 
---
My only competent PvP build involves ammo I’d rather reserve for farming bosses.
---
Hahaha I bet!
---
Bethesda gave dupers their accounts back why would they even bother with magic weapons 😂
---
That would be sweet, like Something Wicked This Way Comes.
---
I just finished Wastelanders, could definitely use a ton of treasury notes!
---
Sarcastic?...tbh...I don’t even bother  going to one if its claimed already.
---
Wait a minute why is this NSFW?
---
The ammo crafting perk for my commando and heavy gunner.
---
Exploding palm for my unarmed girl to make up for the fact she's being nerfed into oblivion.
---
you can, kinda. but ultimately it's irrelevant as you can still grind rep with both factions for their respective rewards.
---
Bolstering is trash,  play nuclear winter bro
---
Yes that is what I am talking about
---
Oh I know but we could go on for literal days about bugs tbh
---
Not really I just keep doing whatever I was in the camp doing, decorating building adding vending items crafting gathering or sleeping to get lovers embrace. I wave if they wave back but I do have a commercial themed camp people come to shop a lot
---
I have a character with 4 unyielding pieces and 1 bolstering.  A buddy of mine runs 3 UNY and 2 Bol.  
---
If you're going full health, I would suggest either vanguards or power armor.
---
It was good to get rid of cork since I use power armor. Yeah I can sell it but like those little boxes look cool.
---
You are obviously a stakeholder. I will never join you in cheering for less. I fight for the little guy you commie.
---
my post, a suggestion to Bethesda, raised an objection from a youngster.  i replied.  this raised further questions
---
you assertion about shooting "stuff", as i prefer to call it, is accurate.  still, should i find myself in a position to help someone understand the world a little better, i will always try to make time for them
---
sorry, but I must away ... green people need to be killed !
---
I prefer not to be at my camp when other people are xD I do feel awkward. But I constantly run around other people’s camps and even send a messages if I think it’s particularly nice, so idk why I feel weird.
---
I always assume they have glitched ammo collectors somewhere. Can’t help but check
---
Tbh it would be cool if you could play nuclear winter without getting blown up by a vats grenade I agree bro
---
Lol really? That's kinda silly, thought my choices would actually matter
---
Thanks so much for the info and recommendations! Already happy with this community ;) Giving it a try today
---
I would go Anti Armor
---
So just open em all up?
---
They kill the queen in 5 to 10 seconds. It's like an infinite furious effect that cause exponential damage
---
There is more than one Motherlode.
---
If you’re on pc, download the image and then drop it into the images folder in your fo76 folder. It should have your in-game photomode pictures in there as well, so you can make sure it’s the right folder before dropping it in
---
Yeah but that doesn't mean I won't fight. I refuse to lay down and die like you.
---
Lol.  That happened to me the first time I was on a team that beat it.  I still haven’t been able to loot him even though I put a TON of ammo into his undercarriage.  One day I guess....the only problem is that the fight burns up so many resources for me (mainly stims) that I need to recoup before I can attempt it again.
---
I will if they ever fix the Tesla issue
---
VATS nade. You throw a grenade and aim at it with VATS and shoot it. Makes it insta down people.
---
...what?
---
Master Infiltrator so I can take off those perk cars and use those points for other cards.
---
It looks cool as fuck though
---
How do you even one shot it. It’s stupid tanky
---
So you guys know what the cost of said mask Is?
---
I haven’t checked the marketplace,figured I’d just ask here...
---
Also how did you kill them
---
Idk who Graham  is but if you're ever on nuclear winter.  Hmu. Gt slickcolt76  I will help you kill him and his team
---
whatever it takes to get ya through the day yo...
---
Personally i think Earl is a significantly better end game event. I am sick of waiting for the SBQ to land. At least this one I can endlessly dump my rounds into it. LOVE the mechanics for fear &amp; cryptid spawns. Much more engaging. 
---
They need to add repair kits. Id also say they should modify the "cursed" tag. And Earle should dropped "cursed" roles of those 3 weapons. Than other endgame bosses can handle rolls of other sets of cursed weapons. 
---
Also vote for other endgame cryptid bosses in similar styles. I Want to nuke a spaceship for a endgame Flatwoods alien fight....
---
This happens because of the 8 person per instance, and how quickly the event icon vanishes from the map, unless you happen to already be in a team with someone who is doing the event nobody can join by that point.
---
you're mean and made me feel bad...
---
I believe this is my favorite.  Being on the stage left oil barrel, keeping the groove going while folks run around like chickens with their heads cut off for 5 minutes is just...really fun.
---
Pretty decent tips although besides the first one none of them would help in finding my trap camp
---
Are you going to make a NW comment in each thread?  Give it a rest.
---
Again - this event isn't in the forest.  I would guess the minimum level would still be 50 or so on the adds ?
---
The 8th of dec.
---
They patched the photomode glitch.
---
There are two different Colonel tapes. The young kid version and the adult version. Did you get both?
---
If you’ve only gotten the first one, the second one will make you feel a whole lot better about what that poor kid went through. 
---
If Colonel’s dad was a non-essential NPC in the game, he’d get a shotgun blast to the face on every playthrough.
---
Not really, I followed this guide sony made it really easy to do. However I think its quite expensive if you don't have an external HDD. I already have a external HDD so I moved all my games from system storage to there, instead of backing up my games up to save time. 
---
Then I had to purchase 1 64gb 3.0 Flash drive, for backing up my remaining ps4 data, which is the gallery and user data like trophies and game saves. Instead of a fresh new external hd that the video uses for backing up. The 3.0 part might be important because the USB ports on the ps4 are 3.0 might make this process faster took me 3 hours even with no games. 
---
Then I already had a cheapy 4gb flash drive that I used for downloading the reinstallation of the ps4 software to put on the SSD. I don't know if you can do this part with a flash drive that has data already on it. Didn't wanna chance it so I just formatted before the process to the necessary fat32. 
---
If you uncapped fast internet then, you might not need the a external either. Because you can re-download games pretty fast. 
---
https://youtu.be/JIdQw_K-ArY
---
No, just save up modules for Unyielding Secret Service.
---
Forgot to mention, next time it happens, try to fast travel to a teammate, if they're in a different instance and there is space, it should put you inside with them. You may need to exit the current event though, not sure.
---
It's Bethesda, what do you expect.  If you want your choices to matter, play the witcher series.
---
Try wearing a piece of armor that has 15% less damage taken while blocking on it.
---
Big f. Just go to their windows and look for a crafting bench or anything that gives you a prompt. Just click it theen boom your in. Just fast travel out. And if that fails big f. People just dont want you in their homes
---
Sorry, but ya gotta grind it like the rest of us did.
---
I've had her glitch out in the Vault raid too. Not opening the final door to meet with the secret service.
---
Yeah bro,  Bethesda should fix the game. Especially nuclear winter.
---
Turrets can glitch and fire at friendlies ruining everything. I thankfully have not had my camp shoot at him or Athena
---
?
---
this site features a block function you might enjoy
---
I answered your question.
---
Yea but I’d still like to get my hands on few to maximize xp gain when i need to, not gonna stress about it tho 😄
---
The worst is when you spawn inside the locked part after fast traveling to use their vendor. One time I got trapped in someone’s generator room. All I could do was ‘scared’ emote lol
---
Stop spamming the same message in multiple threads.
---
Yeah but why the 8th?
---
Thank you I’ll check it out
---
Hang on.... I just made. A post about this....there is a way we can make it so we never are able to shoot another player and initiate “attacking”
---
Keep in mind all of the other more efficient ways to get xp as well, but whatever suits you, have fun.
---
So ridiculous.
---
I actually really enjoy the score system but have come to not enjoy nuclear winter at all. Bethesda was smart grabbing people from all angles. At least we can all come together in our disappointment my friend.
---
Thank you for the reply. I’m going to look into it. Much appreciated.
---
Copypasta?
---
The next patch after 22.
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/425816/treasure-hunter-rewards/21?language%5B%5D=en&amp;page=2](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/425816/treasure-hunter-rewards/21?language%5B%5D=en&amp;page=2)
---
First post on the Second Page has a picture of it. The First page has pictures of the other rewards.
---
Bloodied commando too!
---
Oh really! I have never looked there, thank you 😁
---
they do. on top of a flat damage reduction effect.
---
frankly I don't see why you wouldn't want junkie's, it's essentially a free +50% damage. but furious, vampire's and AA (after the nerf) are all good choices. two shot too, kinda.
---
there's also magic weapons if you're not above abusing glitches.
---
Thank you very much!
---
I’m lucky and only went through maybe 70 .45 for the small guys and 400 5.56 on the main. Bloody stealth has its perks but damn I can’t stop thinking that if I had more than 24 health I’d be alive
---
I despise cancel culture. You are free to say what you want even if it makes me feel bad. Just know that I'm very sad.
---
I feel this, but pacifist solves it.
---
I've tried it repeatedly many ways, unfortunately. On two different characters. Shits fucked.
---
Was anyone using teslas
---
After soloing Earl, I actively take low levels in with me to net them so neat level appropriate cursed weapons, and some power levelling.
---
chickens are cool
---
Is it always one of the weapons...I didn’t get a cursed. I looted a 2* blood die power fist from body, and then got 3* robot left arm.....
---
You got it to work simply by server hopping?
---
They do kind of matter. Raiders in the wild don’t shoot at me anymore. And the more I’m aligned with them, the more often they’re giving me things.
---
Even the one that tells me I ain’t shit has started to change his tune.
---
I mainly Don’t want people in my house if I have vendors up I make them accessible but if I don’t no one gets in
---
I love her, she isn't anywhere near as bad as people say if you do her quest line and pick the luck option at the end.
---
In the last 4 minutes? Because I just did for the 3d time today.
---
Pistols for sure has one, I got it in a perk pack
---
When it happened to me someone was going nuts with a tesla rifle. Only time it has happened that badly. But I'm not sure if they are related.
---
Make you self comfortable next to this warm fire. Dinner is in an hour and I want to keep you nice and warm...
---
Huh, I heard reports on them patching that method, my crew always uses the power armor method.
---
Have two, one vampires
---
Yes! There is a great post in here for xp boosts that I always check👍🏼 cheers 😄
---
I have 3 doors, but I'm sick of people leaving them open so I locked 2 of them that way only one is left open. When I return to base.
---
Your choices don’t really matter at all, just the final decision effects how long your grind will be to get bullion items from each faction
---
Vats works great on commando, not so much on other weapons alas.
---
It’s easy enough to get if you pass through the antique store but even at 200 caps it will move decently quick through your store, still easier to farm 200 caps then that specific item
---
None of your choices matter in the end. Just do all the missions you can until you have to side with one of them
---
Well with my be plasma I can get 100+splash damage on her it's pretty nice
---
that's because they're no longer hostile. raiders start off at hostile. but doing literally anything involving the raiders should put you at least at neutral.
---
Who didn’t help meat week? You didn’t!
---
And who gonna make you pay? Grahm!
---
still here
---
I don’t understand this either. I was over encumbered one time and needed to find a workbench to scrap my shit. So I went to the nearest camp and it was locked so I jumped to the balcony, opened one of the wood windows and glitched my way into their house from an armor workbench. After that I decided to have a look around. Low and behold, not 30 seconds later guess who walked through the front door with a surprise on their face 🤪
---
Join a public team and most of the time the group will follow you into the event
---
Right. But my point was that there is a progressive scale on how they’re reacting to me.
---
I only kill the cow if the prices in the vendor are crazy..
---
How about a new NW map?
---
I’m confused... was this image before the new SSD or after? Are you saying console players should buy one or shouldn’t?
---
I just went in as a level 42 pistol wielder and while everyone was working over the adds or dying right and left I carefully aimed my shots (explosive western revolver), did my damage as good as my level 200 would or better, and kept my agro down so I wouldn’t waste the teams time and effort with a low level glass cannon. We killed earl with ten minutes to go and I would have made it out without dying had it not been for becoming over encumbered with grabbing all earls loot and being caught in a cave in by a staggering spawn at the wrong moment. I fought for my right and claimed my prize.....
---
Another cursed harpoon gun. My seventh one.... uh hey Bethesda there are other rewards right?  Can I please get something else... Please????
---
PS4 player here, I've never had fps drops with Ash and goo piles, but I do seem to when wandering the world randomly.
---
Another foolish dreamer… You kids are so cute
---
Haha I helped.....just because he didn't like the quality of my meat, I guess it wasn't Prime enough.
---
He knows you were afk during meat week.
---
If you turn your stims to diluted stims the chemist perk gives you 4 diluted for every regular you use in crafting
---
How do you know you have one? Or are they no longer in the game
---
And sometimes the event completion glitches out and gives you nothing from that either!
---
I suppose. but even if you 'betray' any of them, you can still grind rep to achieve the same results. you'll probably have to either way.
---
so bottom line is that there's no way but up. you can't really get on either faction's bad side.
---
I have a SSD and its awesome especially for nw in which you spawn in 15 to 30 seconds before everyone else. it is also real easy to upgrade yourself.
---
RNG gods do not like me when it comes to secret service armor. That’s for sure
---
The return of Broad Daylight from New vegas. It would provide a sneak bonus to off set your pip boy light allowing you to have it on and sneak
---
Has happened to 6 of my friends too.
---
Joining them and inviting them to my team seems to break the team system entirely for a session.
---
I'm somewhat reminded of how in 4 the dedicated sniper rifle was outclassed by the Combat Rifle in every way on equivalent gun nut ranks.
---
Antivenom at lv 1, STR/LCK, Ammo Factory.
---
super simple to install
---
Yeah you have to actually work in life.
---
Why would you put crafting stations where they are not accessible? Why is it funny to try and wound people who came to your camp to trade? Are you perchance a member of the National Socialist Party?
---
I’ll come fight, I can’t be on for maybe an hour/hour and a half
---
&gt; I don't see why climbing into the frame really negates this.
---
Tony Stark has not figured out how to wear his backpack under his armors and he is a playboy, billionaire, genius.
---
I have several "magic" shotguns, but they don't seem to be magic at all. They oneshoot most enemies, but I take maybe a millimeter from Earl with each shot. 
---
And I tried a bloodied + limb damage + a piece of magic armor too. 
---
I have performed way better with my bloodied melee Unstoppable Monster again the Queen. 
---
My bloodied lever says I hit Earl for 300, but his health doesn't reflect it. 
---
I'm confused and about to try an executioner 50 cal.
---
I haven't failed one yet and have done around 10. I think I must have been really lucky with teams. I'm always in a full public event team and make sure there are other public event teams with 100+ level players in the server. The hardest one I've done was with 8 players, the frame rate was terrible on Xbox one, 3-5 decentish players seems optimum.
---
Because Christmas always happens around September.
---
Yeah I don't understand why people think it got nerfed my bloodied gatling laser actually increased in damage by 10 whole points
---
I'm trying to imagine what a cowlossus would look like and now its burned into my memory. dozens of udders spraying irradiated acid for example...
---
Thanks.  Didn’t think of that.
---
No doubt AFUSMC.
---
My alt’s stash is bugged AGAIN, and I can’t see it to pull it out... I apologize.
---
Yes both would be awesome!!  I have dreads in real life but its hard to find that style in games!! And Day of the Dead facepaint would be great.
---
No problem
---
Thanks, I’m going to try again soon.
---
It’s all good. Just let me know when it pops up.
---
Holy shit, now I wan't glass sliding doors that open when you get close!
---
I will need to look for that, so if thats on when I accidentally shoot someone it will not list me as “attacking” ?
---
Oh yeah. I guess I did kind of lose focus on the original point of the thread. Oops.
---
Or bethesda could implement a minor mechanic for those who are done so everyone can still benefit from doing dailies. Especially since theyve taken away my means of earning atoms. I have no incentive to play except for the slim chance i might come across 1 of the like 5 plans i need in a vendor or that a quest might actually drop me a cool outfit. So basically nothing, unless i find some people or buddies to run stuff with. Before the legendary run i used to at least be able to knock out a few dailies and earn some atoms.
---
As a junkies shotgunner who tested out my damage on the PTS, it's nice to not need vats to do a good amount of damage.
---
Natural selection.
---
You stop doing damage to other people.  You can't take damage from other players unless you damage them too, outside of a workshop, which is the only place you need to be worried about people killing you.
---
Yeah I've been playing since May and I have not seen a single change in the styles category at all.  Maybe they should just leave the styles in there and not retire them or vault them the way they do with other things, just make a new style and make it permanent so new players can have things that were released before they started playing.
---
I'm on PS4, so beyond that I have no idea.
---
It's confirmed to be added during that patch?
---
Something that's like serendipity for full health builds. Maybe not quite as powerful, but say 25% to avoid incoming damage if your health is above 80%.
---
Also, it's not a perk, but I'd love a system like they have in Outer Worlds where you can load 3 things into a custom stim of sorts. Allow us to mix &amp; match and create a custom buff using up to 3 chems/booze/stim which can be activated with 1 button. For example, melee builds could load the device with psychobuff, whiskey, and glowing meat steak. Press a button and all 3 trigger at once instead of eating time using the wheel to activate each one individually.
---
Is there a certain amount of damage needed to be done like the SBQ or will a simple tag do?
---
Earls just got a SHIT ton of health IIRC
---
Wait seriously?! It works?
---
I know someone who has about 100k of them...not banned
---
Duped by the millions
---
I have a TSE gatling gun which is good for crowds of stuff like bugs or mole rats, but I can't hit individual enemies with it to save my life. It's like a shitty shotgun spread effect.
---
it simply does the math faster this way
---
I have an underground camp.  I have a locked door with the junk collector behind it.  The floor is missing in front of it.  So if you pick the lock and are not paying attention you fall through the map.
---
The thing is if it was a problem with the console itself then this would be happening to all games (I know because I went through that hell before)and it only does this with 76.
---
Ah yes, classic Bethesda writing: the way to close a breach is to blow the hole up. The way to open a mine that has collapsed is to blow it up.
---
I often see camps that use this on purpose. The camp would be underground or inside a pre-built house that had no entrance, and you have to use the crafting station to get inside.
---
I have a vampires prime LMG for heals
---
Junkyard workshop has 3 junk extractors! usually the defends go mostly right too.. unless its those dang mole rats
---
I feel bad for them doing the Wastelanders main quest. I just went back to my old heavy weapons character and figured I'd burn through Duchess' quests and see what free 2 star legendary I could get. Imagine my surprise when there is no option for a heavy weapon once you get the token. What the hell.
---
Just pick a side once both factions are at the decision point. It only really matters in the way the story plays out and not in the end result. Then at the end take the selfish option because you like neither.
---
Not one bit. I'm super hyped whenever someone who shows up and doesnt immediately go to the vendors, but takes the time to find all the little details like my two secret rooms or my specially crafted Deathclaw doghouse.
---
A shame it's impossible to say about dev intent, as much as has to  gone over in a serious balance look, it's difficult to tell the difference between oversights and things that were intentional(hello 10mm SMG Reflex Sight). There's probably several weird oddities where even if the people responsible for the decisions are still on the dev team, they may have forgotten why. This seems like standard operating procedure for Bethesda games tho, from Morrowind to today they're all incohesive AF messes. FUN incohesive messes. The seemingly random and arbitrary decisions in development are impossible for me to distinguish from planned things, like the Secret Service armor severely lacking in mods.
---
Are you referring to Shadowed or the Improved Sneaking legendary stacking?
---
I've collected decent rolls on every semiautomatic rifle, the only situation I've found they shine in is Encryptid(bit of a jerk move but that's neither here nor there). Otherwise I find them powerful beyond utility for common enemies but too slow for the queen. I'll confess I haven't personally tried a semiauto setup against Earle yet, but I am skeptical that it will be worth the effort to swap perks. I don't feel that it is for worth it on the queen, I can't imagine why it would feel like it for Earle.
---
Agreed on the Radium Rifle, it is pathetic as it is now. Takes twice the time if we're not doing stealth instagib numbers and ammo as a Fixer, smh. The chore of unlocking its mods is a final slap in the face. Work harder for something inferior.
---
Is your camp near the wayward?
---
I do... I hide in my room above my garage lol.  I have a main house which is like a diner with vendors on the bottom level and the top level is a museum of things I've collected, so it's cool if they come check it out. But it's super awkward for me to be there at the same time, haha
---
Nice, advocating exploit abusing with Explosive bait. 
---
Pro Tip: Don't become lowly garbage and use toxicity to get on their level.
---
Everyone will be weaker, but relative powers will stay the same.  Bloodied is still best, etc.  Just keep your build until 22 drops and if it doesn't work well after, change it.
---
Yeah, across the street from the trailer next to the wayward
---
My bad, the image is before the ssd. My opinion on it is if you're not gonna get a XSX or PS5 within a year or before their first price drop. Then maybe.
---
However something to keep in mind overall is a SSD is only takin full advantage of, if you have a X1S or PS4pro because they have sata III. Also the ps4 was made to have upgraded tech put in it. So Sony made this process really easy, idk how it works on Xbox. 
---
I'm running a original ps4 with a sata II. So power from the ssd is bottlenecked on alot of games. So in most games you will not see many improvements. But big games like fo76, the division 2, Witcher 3, anything that has alot of loading screens. Its worth it because its improving my quality of life with a possible 30% decrease in loading times and improved efficiency on textures. Same goes with a original Xbox one.
---
I got excited when you mentioned Beckett's reward, but I've already got that exact gun as my main weapon. Shreds stuff pretty well, definitely better against most enemies than the two-shot ffr faster reload .50 I got from the survival challenge whenever that was.
---
My backup gun is a TSE gatling gun, and honestly I'm not liking it anymore. It just doesn't work well against single targets, and the splash often doesn't kill even low level ghouls before they get to me and irradiate me.
---
Yeah. I saw him single handedly win guided meditation. Just ran all over the place tenderizing ghouls.
---
Yeah everyone is selling very obviously duped plans as getting 1 santa crash plan legit was almost impossible. People are selling large holiday gifts as well and have been since this started. People have ammo factories for crying out loud.
---
I just wave and play piano or rest if someone drops by to shop, standing there looking AFK works too in order to ward off the weirdness.
---
How the spitballs do u escape the mine
---
I think it's in a terminal in an office-like room. It's been a long while, but I think down the right hallway, right after you go down the stairs. A room on the left, maybe? My memory sucks though...
---
Personally, i keep everything but my collectron open. Need to get that good sleep buff? Go ahead and use the bed, it's clean. Want to use a workbench? go ahead, they are on the main house. Want some water? Pff, all my purifiers are open for the thirsty vault dwellers. Is there a door protecting anything? Just open it and enjoy.
---
Ehhhhhh yea but commando will be a straight upgrade now compared to rifleman now.
---
Only when I'm naked
---
Wow, so you feel like the way others would like the game should be completely struck from regular servers?
---
What if me and my friends want to fight each other without 40 other players? 
---
I feel like everyone that asks for PvP to be put into NW only, really just wants a sandbox option. There is absolutely no competitive side to this game what-so ever, even though a fair amount of players would and do enjoy it. 
---
I don't PvP often, but I do and taking that option away from me is unfair just because you don't like getting shot at or shooting someone by accident and a prompt appears. You don't have to retaliate and there is even a pacifist mode to prevent you from engaging hostility. They have addressed the griefing with people being able to kill you regardless, so why the hate for PvP?
---
This is an RPG, and with that I expect some people to be evil. 
---
In my opinion, if they added the old survival servers and made it so you can only engage in PvP on those ones, but they're the exact same as regular servers otherwise. It would fix everyone's bitching.
---
Just use pacifist if you don't want to aggro people after events.
---
Don't shove your playstyle down other people's throats especially when it's your own fault for leaving pacifist OFF.
---
I've had this issue too I'll activate it and it'll be awhile before it spawns in
---
Last I checked one-shotting isn't illegal.
---
Ps4. I’m ALLLLWAAAYYYYS down to go crush earl. Optimized bloody commando. We can use my private server as well
---
It’s not accidently cheating, and don’t feel bad! You can join the public teams - I’ve been on great teams with all levels. Most people are totally fine with any level players.
---
Imagine you played the game during the first major ban wave for duping. You picked up a brown paper bag on the ground full of tons of nukas and weapons. 
---
The next week you were banned for being a duper.
---
Not saying you will get banned. Just saying it’s dumb to pretend you know how Beth will react or when.
---
My CAMP is built at the Whitesprings because I wanted pretty grass, so I get the  “Your CAMP could not be placed” pretty much daily too. I usually snoop around briefly, check their vending machines if they have any and then switch worlds so I can place my own CAMP. I don't get why anyone would be angry at someone for taking "their" spot when it's so easy to fix.
---
I had this in the past, I thought it hadn't worked so I went and activated another it didn't appear then 20 mins later I had 2 on the map
---
Can we get Grahm to have a 10% chance of arriving at players camps, wearing full Vegas drag, with Chally carrying a generator to Grahm can play an epic Dragonforce guitar solo for us as we shop?
---
private?
---
Honestly i do my whole,"welcome to easy yee's discount bourgeoisie!  ..." and list off my hot sells and any legendary stuff i got. I tell stories too those who listen and sometimes tell players stories about my fallout comic. I had one peraon come by and not buy anything but listened to me for over an hour. Sat with me and emoted responses. Was a highlight of mine. I make it a point to try to bring something unique to a randoms game experience. Its fun for me and makes it less awkward when i force myself out of that comfort zone. I typically play by myself so when i have those interactions with other players im out to make them mean something in terms of roleplay/lore. I dont see many people in the mire and add into that. Basically living out an npc fantasy. Ill say random stuff about what they're buying and offer to " let them see the good stuff" and ill tell them about the stuff i trade in the communities on ps4. It makes it something else besides running into another player or someone buying cheap ammo. Its fun... lol idk im a fucking weirdo any damn way.
---
Can it handle it?  Sure.  However, addition is a lot faster, although on modern architectures the difference is quite a bit less than it used to be.  The rule of thumb though is that multiplication is more expensive than addition, and division is much more expensive.
---
Your profile name is cancer
---
Both shadowed and improved sneak legendary effect should stack, and do seem to from my experience. Im not sure but it certainly seems like they do to me.
---
I cant really speak for semi autos, i was more just comparing snipers (mainly gauss and lever) to auto fixers. The fixer def will do a lot more dps but the sniper is still very good. Being able to 1 shot scorchbeasts and the wendigos at earl is super nice, and honestly the gauss rifles fire rate really isnt that bad. 
---
I just like hitting big damage numbers in single hits though, and dont rly like melee so I might be overestimating how good they are, but if i had to guess id say gauss rifles probably do about 3x the damage per shot of an auto fixer rn, but do probably half the dps overall, maybe a bit less bcs reloads are kind of slow.
---
I want to agree with you, but after constantly needing screws, I can't keep myself from hoarding. Moar Screws!
---
Because there are horrible people who leave big piles of bloody body parts and fertilizer on other people’s beds.  It’s me.  I’m those horrible people.
---
Lol @ wendibro
---
I could be wrong side I neither work at BGS not have experience at any game development studio, but from what I've read they often have different teams working on developing new content versus debugging.
---
I'd love to see all the game's bugs fixed ASAP too, don't get me wrong. But if literally out every FO76 programmer doing nothing but debugging... we'd never see new content because this is a Bethesda product.
---
I dont think every prefix will be nerfed, i mean how can Instigating be nerfed anyway? Unless they change all the algorythim to 1 and half instead of double damage which is very unlikely. Just.my two cents here. Idk.
---
I love melee vats when I’m using my sneak / combat knife setup but not so much with 2-handers 
---
Jump vats is always fun tho
---
Correct.  Only damage effects
---
I’m not cheering for less. You get things from he legendary run. I am saying we don’t deserve more for simply finishing the thing. And yes, I completed the run today and no I don’t think I deserve anything extra. Period.
---
Killed Earle over 100 times, the magic of server hopping or double dipping the event on one nuke...love it😍
---
This sometimes doesnt work for me when I tag it. And I have asshats like that come and just one shot when I hit all the pylons
---
Mr. Low-Level-Colossal-Problem plAAAYEEYEEYER!!!
---
OOOOOOHHHHHH That noob gonna get SQWAAA-AAASHED!!!
---
Thankyou Mr. Low-Level-Colossal-Problem playyyyeeeyeeee-eeeeeerrrrrrrr.
---
I go with plasma caster and vats for single targets, it's a compromise due to low ap though - works as long as it's only a few targets at a time.  Free aim accuracy and fire rate is decent with it.
---
I would agree with almost everything you said. As I have now found out there is the pacifist which I did not know about.  In regards to the topics you said,I have played other mmorpgs where there were servers made just for people to pvp on. I will def look into the settings that I missed some how. And yes to your last point, I was not playing at that point, but if they had a “survival” mode that was meant as a pvepvp then that should be where you and your friends go when you would like to fight each other.
---
I'm doing the Ammo Factory immediately. Ammo is one thing that consumes a lot of my time in the game. Farming for steel / lead / acid and flux is annoying at this point. I have limited time to play and I am just tired of ammo grinds. Then I'll see what else is there.
---
The Enclave part of me says just enslave some mole miners and dig our way in.
---
&gt;I genuinely can’t understand people who have locked rooms.
---
I used to leave my camp wide open but since none of you assholes can CLOSE THE DOOR AFTER YOU LEAVE it now stays locked. It's like all y'all were born in a barn... or a vault with automatic doors.
---
Prime mods aren't learned from scrapping, they're plan only, and the SBQ also has a decent amount of Ultracite on her corpse. Every little bit counts when crafting ammo.
---
equip the percepti-bobble perk if you have it - you'll find that Appalachia is brimming with bobbleheads...
---
I dont even bother nuking for earle anymore. I just stick to the queen on account of low levels hogging instanced space, earle glitching out, and people being absolutely useless in the fight
---
I know I’m late but where is your camp on the map
---
Well nobody said anything about the forest, but when a Dev says it's will help, I'm more inclined to believe it more than your baseless conjecture.
---
i found here quests to be nothing more than repetitive fetch quests
---
This seems like a recent issue maybe? My camp is at Whitesprings so I've loaded into a nuke zone twice in the past couple months since I returned to the game. Both times I selected the "Try Another World" option and my CAMP wasn't destroyed when the new world loaded. It kind of makes sense that choosing to stay would destroy the CAMP but hopefully the destruction when switching worlds is an unintended bug.
---
Number 0: don't carry junk while shopping and stop worrying about it at all
---
Okay, or, go with me on this, a pneumatic tube!
---
I've heard that you supposedly can't get the Fixer plan as a drop unless you've actually completed the quest line related to Encryptid. Not sure if it's true, but I haven't yet completed it on my character and I've never gotten a Fixer plan dropped (did get lucky and find it for cheap in vendor). Could just be bad luck, though, and I haven't done it a huge amount of times.
---
Three tries, three times blowing through tons of ammo and 30-40 stims, three times the game crashes about 20 minutes in and I get squat.  Fuck this event.  From now on I’m just  killing wendigos and looting screws at least I’ll have something to show for my time.
---
I feel the game belongs in the hands of Obsidian, it would be loved and treated better. Bethesda gave this game to their weakest Devs, I will not give credit for that, ever...
---
And this is why you have a build that is capable of soloing Earle. I mean, why the fuck not? If you’re so whiny about low level hogging, this is a good time to show them how it’s done. Then they’ll be useful later.
---
Lol I’m not shoveling anything down anyone’s throat. As it said in the topic and question...”now maybe I am missing a settings function that we can turn on or off that I have missed somehow”...obviously I have since acknowledged this from other comments that have since explained it.
---
Not sure but this is what most high levels are doing.bloody builds with heavy guns.
---
I'm on the other side of the situation, but this happens to me a lot now because I'm searching a lot of camps hoping to find my last unyielding+ap regen armor piece. When I lock eyes with the camp owner, I try to find a pole to hide behind. If I can't see you, you can't see me.
---
Can you please teach me this one?
---
I bet if they add another map to nuclear winter it would probably clear up most of these issues in adventure mode
---
!THIS, THIS, and also THIS!
---
thank you
---
Xbox. I have a B ffr fr gauss minigun, it's amazing, but I recently got this BE gatling plasma and I wanna try it out on bosses.
---
Do you get loot bugs?
---
Like enemies have no loot or legendaries turning into normal enemies upon death?
---
Maybe it was because of gunfu?
---
Strangely I love the dilapidated wasteland look, but want my CAMP to be pristine. I'm weird.
---
Wow, that's awesome man.
---
Seems as though bloody build with 3 star heavy guns is what players are using.
---
Yes Bandolier and the ammo weight reduction on the armor stack. The first piece is highly desirable. Congratulations on it. Junk weight reduction is alright, but honestly weapon or ammo reduction is more useful IMO. It will stack with the junk reduction perk. Yes, when you craft a piece of SS armor it can be 1, 2 or 3 stars. You got extremely lucky with that Unyielding chest. I highly recommend you go buy a lottery ticket immediately.
---
Edit: Also you are correct, you cannot trade, drop or sell SSA piece's. You either have to destroy them or put them in the scrip machine.
---
I'd like a clean toilet, but what I what most is just a ceramic tile floor. Small tiles, I don't even care if they're clean.
---
That’s where I put my vendors when I’m max caps.  I don’t want to fill them up again so I just move them where no one can get them.
---
It's like there's a remote terminal high in the trees that randomly opens and closes them.
---
your Brahmin is trying to tell you something if it is doing that
---
Sort of my experiences so far as well.  I've run it 3 times but all three times we had 5+ people all over 100 level and all participating fully.  Succeeded all 3 times, no glitches, bugs or dying.  I have to admit that I'm just waiting for it to happen though, based on all the stories I'm hearing.
---
Ammo factory and Antivenom for sure
---
Yeah that happens to me too and also sometimes it seems like his A.I is off
---
I'm not going to be able to one shot the strangler hart anymore though
---
All of my locked doors in all of 5 of my character’s camps are just to hide weird structural issues or give the illusion that there’s more to the build. Of course that space would be utilized if I had a little bit more budget though. 😅
---
I give tours! My base is a giant Arktos Pharma laboratory with a forest 'biome' inside. Usually have a Deathclaw housed inside, so when people are shopping, the noises usually draw a lot of attention. I tend to dress up in my Arktos gear and walk them through it, pointing out cool minor details like the DC's feeding area, the autopsy table and the serum sub-lab.
---
You won’t get banned. So about 4 months or so ago. I was playing like I normally do and I noticed a whole bunch of ppl at whitesprings station. But I kept going about my business, then when I finally went there to scrip weapons and do my normal run through the golf club I saw there was a bunch of bags on the ground. I looked through them and there was around 500 large gifts. I didn’t play during that event last year as that was when I was taking my 6 month break from the game. I never was on fallout Reddit and never watched YouTube videos on it. I thought I got so lucky, until about two months ago when I started watching the videos and coming onto this reddit is when I realized stuff was duped and there was a lot of different dupes over the years. I never got banned and never worried about it. You’re fine
---
Pro Tip: Hide your cow in a locked greenhouse dome to tempt and tease the cow killers.
---
Nope
---
All the weight reduction perks and legendary effects are capped at 90% and they do technically stack but only if you have the 1 star bandolier card. Ammo that shows its 0 weight with bandolier perk isn't actually weightless. Their weight is just so small that is shows 0 but if you drop it, like 20k 5mm, you'll lose a few lbs. 
---
SS armor is a random 1-3 star roll. Vault 94 scout armor is a guaranteed 3 star roll with a set effect. Difference is vault 94 needs both vault steel and legendary module to craft and SS armor has no set effect.
---
Also yes, they cannot be traded or sold to a vendor. Only scripped.
---
What weapons were you using?
---
“For 500 atoms you can have one new lip shape or different eyebrows”
---
We get bored of a lot of things in this game. For me I'm mainly bored of seeing explosives dominate in Nuclear Winter.
---
Not gonna lie, you had me in the first half
---
Follow through, survival shortcut, funky duds, the fire resist one also, and probably just 2 random special ones
---
Is there a mod for Xbox that shuts up the milk drinkers who can’t take a good beating when they assault my workshops?
---
Ghoul and super mutant mutation. Ghoul : immune to rads, immune to diseases, doesn’t need to eat or drink, but no rested bonuses from sleeping, -### of damage resist and energy resist (fire and cold resist after the update too.) idk how much you’d have to lose of your resistances to make it balanced, probably 100-200. Also -5 charisma
---
Super mutant: rad immune, disease immune, +5 str and +5 end, can only wear PA pieces (without a chassis), +100 energy and damage resist, but 2x slower swing speed with melee and only half the accuracy with guns, very hard to sneak.
---
There could be more/less buffs and debuffs with these, I’m not a game designer so idk how balanced they would be. I just think the concept is cool
---
*Strangely Mysterious*: The Mysterious Stranger gets off his ass and gets shit done! He replaces that worthless toy gun with an LMG, and if you're running Mysterious Savior he actually rezzes you instead of practicing his horrible aim while you bleed out.
---
I've seen enemy heath regen like that with my .50 cal as well if I hold the trigger down and hit them with a bunch of bullets.  Firing in bursts seems to help solve that issue.  Not sure if it's a related damage bug or not though.
---
Make sure the server is active. By this I mean multiple teams half full or full. I make sure there's enough high level players as in 50+ but the higher the more likely they are to join and that you are to succeed. It helps if a lot of people are event hopping. Its a good way to judge how likely it is for people to show up. Also, go to event the moment its triggered. Don't wait. I've only played seven times all successes, most full teams but one with only two other players. 
---
Personally I think its important to figure out how best to use your build. I bring a medic shotty for healing self and team mates on crits which I get a lot of and focus on keeping people alive and crowd control. Gotta let those heavy gunners go crazy.
---
power armor glitch to go though doors
---
It happens when you die with full Unyielding and, while you're on the map choosing your respawn location, close the game. Don't log out through the game itself, just shut the game off via the OS or through your console.
---
It'll always work. It completely doubles the effects of Unyielding. (+30 instead of +15 to all stats).
---
Although it usually goes away after you die.
---
I like the pvp sometimes it keeps the game interesting you never know what can happen you could make a friend or an enemy just becarefull who you fight and where you fight plus I was almost baited by a like level 60 player who kept trying to fight me but I ignored him for as long as I could and so I take something I can’t remember the name of it right now but after I take it I could see he wasn’t alone there was like 4 pink blurs they were up high waiting for me to fight I got out of that world
---
I go invisible and stalk them from afar.
---
I just do what I'm already doing then I'll drop trash I don't want, plans I already know, excess junk, excess food, ect
---
In sugar grove, go through the main office area with all the clipboards, past the meeting rooms with the long tables/globes and down the stairs on the left.  Turn right at the bottom of the stairs and go to the second room on the left.  The Analyst's terminal is in the back right corner of that room.
---
i wish they were more useful for higher level players tbh
---
Probably just awful luck. I’m 4 for 4 on kills, zero issues. The average is probably somewhere in between both of us.
---
I honestly wish Beth would Thanos snap them like they did in the past with other duped items. These presents are used to generate lots of caps to clear out vending machines so that they can then clean out a players stash with a glitch.
---
Instigating doesnt double the damage on pts, it adds +100% damage (doubles base damage, not damage inc all the perks and everything)
---
It's not too hard to kill him, I don't think
---
Scrip, they're essentially worthless. Vendor shop maybe
---
Does that work with laser grids cause there are no doors
---
No idea. I am 1/1
---
Well i hope the next time I go in I hope I'm with you...because so far I'm just dumping ammo and watching people bail This last one i dump 9 Ultracite Plasma cores and 1000 5.56. smdh!
---
Will the SPECIAL cap still be 15 each? Like, I'm already running at 15 Strength. The legendary cards won't let me bump up to 20 Strength and utilize another 5 ranks of whatever perk cards, right?
---
They arent the same. Bloodied will still be best, but its hit harder than others since one of the reasons its so strong is it stacks more multipliers than other builds, which now wont multiply, so you lose a higher % of damage than other builds.
---
Also any sort of non auto rifle build is completely fucked since they lose such a large amount of damage. My gunslinger's pipe revolver went from 3400 per shot to 600 per shot on the pts. Thats a pretty big nerf.
---
If I’m being honest the only thing I think I want from this list is the Deathclaw hunter outfit and hat, and the plushie. Everything else is kinda meh. 
---
(Now the Deathclaw hunter outfit and hat are plans or just outfits? I’d love for them to be plans like the treasure hunter outfit and insurgent outfit, those two outfits and hats sell for 500 each in my vendors.
---
It took me 6 times doing the event before I finally got a group that was able to kill him
---
It just depends what you roll.  I roll gauss mini and it's fine on pts.
---
Yeah most of the items are underwhelming. I’m still down to collect them. Did you see the backpack though? It’s on the second page of that post
---
Ah I was just about to ask how to get to the second page? Didn’t see it.
---
&gt; Well nobody said anything about the forest
---
The Devs had - though.  I don't have the info in front of me - but I believe they've stated that based on the region, there would be minimum levels.  So the SBQ for example is not going to scale down to level 1.  A deathclaw in the mire is not going to scale to level 1.
---
&gt;  but when a Dev says it's will help, 
---
No dev has said it will help.  A PR person from Bethesda did.  They could just as likely be using common sense / logic to answer this - vs. knowing a fact.  I don't mean this as an insult - it is just a fairly common situation in software development.  Someone in marketing  hears you have XYZ, and they make assumptions.  
---
&gt; I'm more inclined to believe it more than your baseless conjecture.
---
Which was my whole point in replying to the Bethesda employee responding - to drive clarification to it, and hopefully get a follow up reply.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Just scroll to the bottom of the forum and it’s at the bottom right. I hope there will be more rewards like that one, that haven’t been datamined yet.
---
I have been picking them up cheap from folks for easy scrip =)
---
 https://imgur.com/Q5vYRCc
---
because they aren't useful. it would be a lot better to have 7 other people actually doing damage, or covering me with killing the wendigos, or doing anything that isn't shooting potshots at earle with a level 15 hunting rifle. 
---
a full team of 8 high levels can kill earle in no time, but having 4 people under level 50 is literally useless, they just take up space that could be occupied by a high level who can actually do something.
---
Just awful luck and food builds. I've killed him 22 times with no fails.
---
As i said, bloodied is still best but its nerfed harder than other builds, since you use adrenal and nerd rage, which most others dont (at least for adrenal, not as low hp as bloodied), so them not multiplying means you lose a higher % of damage than others. Explosive weapons are hurt a lot less, since the explosion still does 20% of the damage, so its basically 20% multiplicative damage, and gauss weapons have a gauss explosion, which to me seems more like 40% or so damage, so they probably arent too badly affected yeah.
---
How is junkies free ?
---
Lol Graham!
---
PS4...going back in now for some reason. Guess I like dumping ammo. PSN is smutty72
---
Yeah I was having this problem then I just put on power armor makes it so you can use stimpaks instantly and my bloodied guns still work fine.the nuke zone for the Queen has killed me a lot as a bloodied but I don’t like to use power armor in that fight so it might be my own fault
---
Ooh I see... Yeah it would be neat to get that one too. I wasn’t that big a fan of the croc one but I like monkeys. 
---
Hopefully I can trade in some treasure hunter Fasnacht and meat week plans I have stashed away for some of these.
---
I roll bloodied/vampire low health.  It's really fun
---
So I guess I'm going to buy a ps4...
---
yes
---
I'll try that, thank you
---
I’m 3/8.  Just launched my 8th nuke, had several public teams of 100+ level players, only 2 others showed up.  Backed out after 7 minutes.  Feel bad, but not going to waste a crap ton of ammo for nothing.
---
That’s when I say happy trails and find another server without morons like that.  I never had any experiences like that at any of the Meat Cooks this season, thankfully.
---
That’s gotten me a few times not much I can do about that. I noticed he gets low when he’s gonna scream so I pop a stim Incase I run into the rock falling or barrels
---
The game is buggy af . I have that happen while using guns too . Sometimes you have to leave for a minute and come back to the corpse
---
Scraping them so you can either build them if there’s a plan for it or find them randomly
---
Was it a level 5 BOS Rifle and a BOS armour at camp next to The Wayward? I play on PC and gave this out tonight to two strangers.
---
If your using a vamp weapon (which honestly i think is gonna be nuts post patch bcs damage stacking doesnt matter as much), yeah you wont honestly notice a huge diff, especially if its a gauss mini
---
Basically legacy lasers and explosive shotguns are getting slightly nerfed, gauss weapons are about the same as those also, normal rifles are getting hurt a lot more, but its bareable, and non auto rifles, pistols, and "explosive" weapons (fat man, missile, that stuff) get really wrecked.
---
Kill supermutants and scrap the laser rifles
---
They dont drop from scraping lasers
---
Doesn't work
---
You buy that one from your console marketplace.
---
That’s probably why I like him more it’s a smaller closed in area just feels like less waiting
---
Going to continue to drop everyday
---
They might be cheap...or will be soon.
---
That’s strange they should if not try looking threw vendors
---
I don't think rifles are too bad, what makes you say that?
---
It's right next door
---
Sorry I can't help you kill earle :(
---
Hello, have you still got spare fixer plans?
---
No it was two level 10 Bos recon rifles 2 space suits a handmade and alot of ammo for both
---
Damn near everyone is a bloodied commando/heavy weapons user, this won't change that. All we have now is *everyone* doing significantly less damage in the hopes that it will make it easier for Bethesda to FINALLY balance the game. When will that be? Who knows. But enjoy doing less damage in the meantime. Been playing for years and have accumulated a [metric shit ton](https://www.reddit.com/user/RadioactiveSince1990/comments/gmqua9/trade_list/) of all kinds of high end gear but this combined with One Generic Wasteland has made me lose almost all interest in this game.
---
They must have I’ve seen 15-20 of those fuckers chasing people before
---
You mean the ultracite version? Just learning the plan, craft and scrap, no mob drops them. Take berry mentats before scrapping, high Inteligence increase the mod learning rate
---
* sharp intake of breath at the thought of that gun *
---
Maybe someone was able to proc a sneak attack? I remember entering a solo ACP and to my surprise, my magic shotgun was able to finish him off with 3 shots to his head.
---
Basically i cant 1 shot super mutants on the pts with my rifleman any more, so it ends up just being a worse commando. The only real benefit of rifleman normally is 1 shotting, at the cost of much lower dps. If it doesnt 1 shot but a commando can 3-4 shot it takes longer for a rifleman to kill a target than a commando, which basically means theyre useless at that point, given how theyre basically otherwise identical
---
Oh yeah it is ultracite hah that helps know where the plan is?
---
I meant ultracite laser i didn't even know that oops
---
I try to give back to the community that helped me. That's awesome you were able to experience.
---
Maybe. And geez on that shotty kill lol. What gun were  you using?
---
Yeah. The last one I showed up at only six showed up. This one i didn't get there in time because I was busy crafting 21 Ultracite Plasma cores so I could leave them in the mine! Almost glad I didn't make it. Of course this time was probably my TSE handmade i just missed out on! 😁
---
It’s all cool I still think you should be able to get it from scraping from what I remember but it’s really hard getting the mods from what somebody told me
---
You realize with one wasteland there won't be any more level 1 radroaches... right?
---
I won't lie, I was one of the haters towards a lvl6 who came in, naked and unarmed. Angry emotes, hatemail, the works.
---
That bastard is the only reason we didn't wipe at one point, being the final person alive, and scooping two others back up, before Earle sent him flying.
---
He got immediate apologies, an invite, and showered with presents.
---
May we all raise a toast, to the lowbies we never thought we needed! Y'all are the real MVPs sometimes 👍
---
Shhh. It's a secret.
---
Anyome  who locks waters I breakinto them
---
Whitespring or watoga shopping iirc
---
Wait, really?  Was I that distracted that I didn’t see it come up every hour like that?  I mean Prime Cuts seemed like it was always happening somewhere, but the Meat Cook seemed like it was every 3 hours.
---
That's true.  I legit hadn't thought of that.  I think bashing should 1 shot low level enemies, but not much else.
---
I use automated doors via plates
---
Was using a bloodied combat shotgun. Silenced so that I can utilize that mister sandman perk
---
Eh.  Semi auto rifle was kinda always bad.
---
Only if they fix all of the other latency based damage bugs
---
I second this.
---
Dude!!! A end game flatwoods monster would be sick. I agree repair kits or something would be nice they probably think if you want them buy them or do the Queen. What if you had the chance to get a stack of 100 gold B or something instead of a plan or weapon
---
Find a bloodied one put a rifle stock on it and be amazed.350 damage plus easy.ugly as hell though
---
Im more talking about the non auto, not the semi. The semis are kinda ok bcs they have decent fire rate and mag size, the non autos just feel so slow in the pts.
---
Its the build i enjoy playing the most and it just sucks to have it pretty much stop working
---
The brotherhood vendor bot
---
I would like to thank everyone who commented in the discussions. After google it how to...I have now seen that I have been playing with pacifist off. Thank you to all who explained this to me.
---
I just use repair packs
---
True
---
Meanwhile it’s worse off than low level pipe weapons in adventure
---
Since my best weapon for commando is a Quad Combat Rifle, I just tag the boss and spend the rest of the fight killing Spawns.
---
Yeah.  I think the one which you use in the Settler's quest is the one you repair at Hornwright when you first go there.  Hence why it appears to have a connection/liking to you.
---
Try a Fixer with a hardened or hair trigger receiver and you'll wonder why you ever bothered with guns that are locked in semiauto. The per shot damage is obviously quite lower, but it retains a huge edge due to fire rate.
---
I really want to like these semiauto rifles, especially the Gauss. I just find their lack of utility frustrating. Gauss holds even more frustration for me because it basically has to be charged to bother with because half power means dealing less than half damage, fast firing means much more frequent reloads, and the fact that since Wastelanders the suppressor makes it non-explosive, it's just a very frustrating weapon for me. I hate seeing it underperform when I enjoy its style.
---
The big numbers aren't enough for me. I want everything to be enjoyable. Even if it's just something like transmogs.
---
Semi auto is non auto.  Do you mean bolt action and muzzle loading?
---
Yes I do
---
Surprise-Chimichanga's Brahmin dies and spawns Bloatfly*
---
Certain amount of damage
---
It's definitely there, I pick it up all the time. It's higher than the painting, there is a chair, binoculars, a food item, some booze, and the pie is there on a box next to a plastic fork
---
It depends. If you are using weapons like grenade launcher of fatman, you don't do 25% extra damage you just do flat double damage cause double projectile, double explosion. For weapons like rifles, I really don't know. It might do better in comparison to other prefixes and even comparable to bloodied damage wise, but double projectiles on ballistic/energy weapons mean double durability loss, worse spread, double recoil, shitty vats etc etc. Since you are a fool if you aren't doing low health build even in pts, I say stick to bloodied
---
Super mutants get their laser gun and put that perk on where you get more materials and a higher chance of a mod and scrap the laser guns
---
The turrets at RR fire at each other. Must have used the code for camp turrets.
---
They aren't leaving, they die a lot and the respawn timer doesn't like that shit
---
Yep. I know I didn't get a notification every time but it's always at the top of the hour.
---
You can actually damage the SQ when it's cloaked, just not much. But enough to tag it.
---
I usually just play the piano if I’m not busy with something.  I do the same thing when I AFK, too.  Music’s right next to the vendors, so everyone has to listen to me
---
Probably would be the 0.1% since a person just needs to make about $500,000 per year to be in the 1%.  Also there is 3.5 million people in the 1%.  Having over a million people in a group is not small.
---
Although, you could make the case that being an American is being in the 1% as far as the world is concerned and being part of the 1% for Americans is being in the 1% of the 1% for the world.
---
Either way some still want to do the events. It's about respecting other players also.
---
I did not know that and I find it very funny
---
As someone on here posted once;
---
"If it's locked it belongs to me.  If it's unlocked, you may use it."
---
Yeah, that’s the method I use but it pretty much wiped me out so now I’m looking for a lot of stims to dilute so I can regroup.
---
I just want them to do something about the m79  grenade launcher
---
 and auto grenade launcher. I hate those weapons with a passion
---
Me personally I just grab pylons but that's me
---
artifacts
---
I've got a 2-shot explosive pipe pistol that does silly damage as a rifle.
---
Do Pistol perks work on it?
---
Obviously they need to do both, but there is a fix that is possible ... it would just such for other reasons.
---
Dude, it looks so very tasty. And it's super hard to get them from the machines. But don't give up! There is one on the West Tec roof but when you get it from the machine it hits different
---
Or you can quit your virgin incel bitching and solo it like a Chad.
---
I do have one, and its definately way better dps, but i just have more fun with the big damage per shot guns. If i wanted to be optimal id be using a sneaky b2525 fixer commando build (or if you want to be absolutely max you use a hacked 50cal and a heavy guns build but thats kind of a dick move, and more than a little cheaty).
---
I do have to agree the gauss is annoying as fuck though. I kind of like the no explosion bcs otherwise i end up killing myself with them a lot, but it really should have it. Also its damage is really incorrect. If i do 0 charge shots on super mutants i get like 3k or so on the damage number, and it does maybe 1/5th of the mutants health. Now i dont know about you but that seems a little off to me.
---
I dunno. Personally i think im completely fine with a best in slot weapon, but they shouldnt outclass everything by so much (which actually does seem to be what the pts is changing, which is good other than how much it seems to fuck over pistols and snipers)
---
Already answered this to another user here but no they do not use durability while jetpacking.
---
PS4, Box, or PC? Can get you a win easily if on PS4. Have a 100+ win streak going...0 losses.
---
Well at least I know I'm not the only one that it has happened to.
---
I think both work.i dont use pistol perks .the rifleman perks work on it soon as you put a rifle stock on it though. Last I heard pistol perks work as well
---
I am on PS4
---
I saw someone selling a cursed harpoon gun for 4k caps at their camp today....no thanks.
---
On PC, the only failed ACP event I joined was the very first one on the very first day as soon as it went live. After that, haven't had a failed/unfinished one since.
---
 Very True,at some point I’m sure people will just give em away...
---
I was just wonderin,cause all I really want from that event,Is the mask &amp; the plushie...
---
&amp; possibly the totem for around Halloween
---
Technically yes. You can kinda betray them both
---
110% first thing that came to mind.
---
I have several Tesla rifles and love them dearly, but I won't use them on this event. Are there other events/occasions where I should also avoid using them? I don't want to cause issues but I also don't want to stop using my Teslas completely.
---
I must have that plushie!
---
Which is odd, because having no weapon at all has animations for left hand punching
---
Nah even low levels know pipe weapons are bad. Stay away from pipe weapons. Might look okay on paper but damage plummets when you are out of range, just like shotguns
---
*  You dropped this.  :P
---
Nice, dm your ps4 info I have all weekend off and will be grinding the event
---
Always nice to have another backpack skin to add into the rotation but it just doesn't have the same charm as that adorable croc.
---
Yeah they must think it is rare.  I have been picking them up for 300 which is easy scrip.
---
I usually encounter them either right after I log on, or right after I return from adventuring.  Either time, the most time consuming thing I do is reload my vendors with all the ammo, plans, and crap I don’t want,  I hear them coming up my caboose stairs and I run out of there so they can, you know, shop in peace.
---
I have a "Magic" Two-Shot LMG.  I just use it to bring the SBQ health down to something a bit less grindy (1/2 to 1/4) and then focus on the errant mobs afterwards.  Repeat when the SBQ mutates.
---
My philosophy is sure, use "magic" weapons - but don't be a dick with them.  They're super broken (example; I was wandering around the expired nuke area around the Prime Fissure, and went into that grove of weird looking trees - and it turns out the Wendigo Colossus had spawned and no one had bothered to check, and there was no one else in the entire Cranberry Bog.  So I went and pulled out my LMG and melted it in like...five seconds.  Yes, they are absolutely stupidly broken weapons, but use them *responsibly* and I have no real issue with them).
---
ACP I just use my regular Bloodied Handmade.  More time to farm for screws.
---
I only use them when I'm at an event or overeencumbered I've got like 80 from the queen
---
I was scripping them, but after doing so many events the past few weeks I can't carry/store any more stuff or scrip them fast enough, so I've just been selling them for the default amount (few hundred caps) in my vendor to see if they went that way. People bought them all too.
---
Not having text chat was intentional, so not anything "broken".
---
  
---
The post is literally talking about how one of the most fundamental systems in the game is broken currently and getting fixed.
---
That addresses *multiple* bugs and balance issues in one go. Does it fix everything? No, but it is forward progress.
---
Sadly still caps at 15 perk cards to use but technically you could use one to get to 20 bit itd be a waste
---
This is what is happening. This is new this patch.
---
Explosives might be op on consoles but not so much on PC. Gauss shotguns are a real problem here. And hackers/aimbotters with rifles too
---
Any time :)
---
What? Reporting people in a game! How dare somebody get reported for being a bad person in a game! Most game developers should be ashamed of themselves for giving a report button to people! Imagine having the right to report people for being bullies! Am I right fellow psychopaths and bullies?
---
I would pay to see that awesomeness.
---
On PS4 the odds seem to be much better.  I’ve killed him about 20 times and have all the rewards.  I did have one truly bad experience but other than that I feel I’ve been lucky.
---
The spawn point is always to the north of your camp  module. You can control it fairly well.
---
But yes a more logical way to set the spawn points is needed.
---
No, but I'm a weird one. I built my camp into a haunted house, and whenever people drop by, I lock them in and then hop on the roof to watch their adventure through the see-through ceiling.
---
There is nothing quite like getting one shotted by a v.a.t.s grenade or a gauss shitgun in almost every game.
---
How passive aggressive can the Fallout 76 community get?  I'm seeing more and more of these dumb posts.
---
They've been pretty useless IMO, I don't bother with them.
---
I do shoot them down every time I see one though.... sorry if it was yours LOL
---
Saw in another comment that you also are on PS4.  Usually 1-4pm ET is a good time to find good groups.
---
That's cool, I will respectfully say I disagree tho. Good discussion.
---
I've been in a group where this happened and he was inside the ground, popping out for brief moments. We still managed to kill him but it wasn't as easy to land a hit.
---
I will buy any liquor from a vendor as long as it’s not above value, same with and nuka products, all of my characters are drunks with cola nut. Regular nuka cola I will always buy for crafting nuka cola darks, the bonuses from nuka dark with party boy/girl perk are awesome!
---
When someone is at my base looking in the vendors, I sit and play the tuba to make them feel like they're picking prizes on a game show.
---
Ye,I’ve read a few places the “double dip”,
---
Although I e never tested it out myself.
---
I’m sure ya could do a quick google search &amp; find shit tons of info...
---
I’ve always wondered myself if ya could make a sick ass pipe pistol/rifle build,that may keep up wit any “meta” builds
---
https://fed76.info/a/limb-damage-bug/
---
Caveats: Works best with a high fire-rate weapon (150+ seems to be the sweet spot), as well as your framerate (so staying at or above 60 is ideal).  Only works outside of VATS in the case of automatic weapons, while shotguns with "magic" effects only work inside VATS (does its full damage that's supposed to be split amongst its pellets, per pellet.  So instead of say, 200 split among 8 pellets, it's 200 per pellet).
---
Yeah fair play, good to hear other opinions on it :)
---
Even min-maxed, neither of those weapons will be viable for fighting with the boss.
---
Do not let Earle put you in [DANGER]
---
Why when hunting rifles exist and they throw them at you
---
We still got those punji board stacking idiots in-game. Imagine spawning right on top of 20 punji boards. Not fun
---
Sorry I did not see that but thank you
---
I've tried moving it but oddly enough I spawn in the same area. The module seems to sometimes spawn you in a different spot anyway, as long as it's in the general area.
---
It was there for CAMP during BETA, they removed it to prevent griefing, so players couldn't spawn in death traps.
---
🎶real men of genius🎶
---
It's so easy to get them though.  I've never run out.
---
If you're discussing it too, does that mean you're wrong too ?
---
I never got to do the Vault 94 raids. My skills aren't that good and I'm minutely partially disabled so my skills are affected.  
---
Can I use the Chemist backpack mod and Traveling Pharmacy together?  
---
Can I use the Grocer backpack mod, Perks which reduce food/drink weight, and an armor piece with that effect? If I can that's fine I just want to know for sure they stack at least.  
---
Am I right in you can't trade SS armor?
---
the downsides of addictions are negligible for the most part.
---
Take time to lessen the wendigo mob and revive people so they don’t have to wait forever to respawn. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I don't take damage from other players' punji boards, oddly enough. But spawning underneath a house is also not fun. The traps should be for those roaming super mutants that seem to kill your pets.
---
Patch 22.
---
All of the S2 content is in the PTS. They literally can't start S2 until they add in the files for it.
---
Yes I ran into someone and he liked my name because it was similar to his but he gave me 997 large handmade gifts I opened a few and I sell them but I give them away all the time atleast 800
---
Stored
---
I hate this is happening to PC players. How often do you find hackers in your game?
---
If you want choices to matter, give The Outer Worlds a try... just WOW for decision making and consequences between factions. Excellent game.
---
It was from the same team that did Fallout New Vegas... which also had excellent decision making with consequences between factions.
---
I'll add, Forceful Stock (any weapon) gives the bonuses from Aligned on top of what it claims. Including the reduced AP cost.
---
Ok thanks
---
Yo thats so cool. I wish I could grow dreads in real life but I cant and dont think I would pull the look off lol but I like the look so I give it to all my characters when I can. I love the day of the dead too. Recently ive had the idea of a Mexican Revolutionary with the day of the dead calaca face paint. I think it be cool for fallout.
---
I WISH. If I do win I'll make sure to check my messages and send you a PM. 😆  
---
Do they script for a high amount? I went to pick up 2 Legendary modules and haven't been back. The increase in damage protection overall for just the chest as is is really good for my char.  
---
If you knew all the effects on my armor you'd see why I'm hesitant to make any more.  
---
Nowhere near what a lot have but the effects are really good. If I have the time I might list them in another post. Thanks a lot for the clarification.
---
Stupid question but what is treasure hunting in this game? Is it all the weird treasure maps I’ve gotten?
---
Yo the predator mask and sholder mount would be dope. Some double mortar cannons for power armor mounted on the back would be dope too.
---
Raiders often give the best rewards. In the end we wind up playing it our way anyway so just do your thing.
---
Interesting that a couple of you mentioned teslas.. I think that's the one time my PC melted during this event, someone had a crazy purple bolt going all over the place and I was at times less than 1fps if I was facing the battle. As soon as I looked away, it was fine again. And this on a very high end gaming PC... Good to know it wasn't me.
---
u/Dukeofchaos412
---
It’s an event that is in the game like meat week, I think the next one is next month. You collect pails from treasure mole miners, or craft them yourself and when you open them, you have a chance to get goodies.
---
I dislike the gauss shotty and vats nades the most. I still believe grenade launchers should get nerfed too tho.
---
Same thing with the walls/foundation themselves I believe.  Though, I often am too slow for that.  Just need to git gud I guess.
---
You should try The Long Dark.
---
Fair point, I know that most underground camps work like this.  Pity you (as far as I know) can't make these anymore.
---
How do you double dip the event?
---
Can't believe the respawn bug is still a thing, such a joke.
---
Aimbotters 1 out of two games. Hackers 1 out of two or three. First thing I do when I join a game is to open up social menu and see if there's any cheaters in my lobby and leave if I see one. I tried reporting them, blocking them, sent a screenshot, nothing changes. I see this same hackers for like half an year and he keeps playing just fine. Fuck Bethesda and their lazy ass customer support
---
Wait, does that mean I can have a chance to loot the crates???
---
Oh yeah! It's the best feeling when you know there's nothing you could've done to prevent it.
---
You are getting more rewards in a fraction of the time. Join their group and follow them as they server hop running 15 Earles a day.
---
Could we also get tattoos for our bodies as well, not just our faces? Perhaps one displaying our vault pride on our arm or chest. Maybe another with Taggerdy's Thunder symbol on the shoulder. Hell, i'd love it if we got "skins"/ploymorphs like Elder Scrolls Online did so we could appear as a non-feral ghoul or a scorched.
---
I need to check that- iirc, I thought only the default wood wall windows were like that, not things like brick/steel/etc.
---
Dupers buy tons of burner alt accounts. They put more money in this game than anyone else.
---
I think it's more like everything else is worse, so for a lot of people playing at 19% health may not be worth it anymore.
---
the difference between even junkie's (50%) and two shot (25%) will be a lot less noticeable due to how bonuses stack now.
---
1/ add a passive capability for all one handed weapons (melee and pistols) that grants a flat dodge % to reduce or ignore damage .. possibly perk in endurance
---
2/ literally any equipable off hand item even with out animation ... just provide some benefit
---
Yes!!! Two so far. Anyone want one? I tried using one to kill a deathclaw and it took SO LONG!
---
I returned to one of my workshops to do an event a long while back. Some high level guy spawns in, shoots me, takes my stuff and leaves.
---
???!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!
---
I finally just started dumping junk more often so now I don't care if I die. It sucked but it only needed to happen once.
---
The fact this is still ongoing is unacceptable and pathetic of Bethesda! Smh.
---
Not necessarily traps, you can come up with a prison and let a visitor spawn there. People will find millions of ways to mess with other's experience
---
u/Rob1iam
---
Yes I fire up all the plants when I'm on my private server and within 2 hours I got plenty. Three per half hour generator holds a max of three so you have to collect them every 30 minutes. Just stick around each one when you first fire it up and deal with the three wavess of enemies and then you move on to the next one.
---
Ah okay thank you very much!
---
You are too far away, your Perception is too low and your gun has tiny Accuracy.
---
Edit: hmm these are literally the 3 things that affect chance to hit. Downvote away you filthy casuals
---
You know how to prevent "friendly fire" after an event ends?
---
*Turn on pacifist mode, you ding dong.*
---
LOL I'll bet that was epic to watch!
---
How about a welcome mat that is only for the C.A.M.P owner?
---
That's still anecdotal because we don't know that you put the same amount of hit markers into him each time.
---
The quick and dirty is that anything that affects you by a percent amount is getting worse, anything that doesn't is staying the same, therefore better off when compared to bloodied, junkies, etc.  How much better?  That remains to be seen.  Worth it?  That remains to be seen.
---
A modern mmo not having text chat is broken in my eyes and Bethesda should fix it.
---
Ammo factory to feed my gauss minigun
---
I love this idea. Yes please. Ad Victorium!
---
Interplay wasn't that much better pal. Nostalgia is a hell of a drug - although if you're young enough to be in school this probably doesn't apply.
---
Massive target, same health, same ammo use, equalized over several tests with multiple weapons with a large difference, (look at the second pic.)  Okay, sure.  I guess gunsmith is still broken.
---
Boy you sure are happy about that Backpack!
---
lol.. i thought this is actually real somewhere in your home.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to mention this.
---
I use a gatling gun that breaks so damn slow it's not funny and a .50cal that at a rough guess lasts about 6k shots per repair
---
Oh that sounds sick! Do these events cycle and come back often?
---
Lmao yeah i’m stoked, thanks for the link again hahah
---
I think the plans &amp; weapons fine. No need for more GB but definitely need a higher than 20 note limit. Right now we get 8 notes? For 80 gold. Close to the 100, just 2 and i am done with my limit...
---
Eh.  It's just convenient.  I don't loot anything anymore except for lead and steel for ammo
---
My friend was leveling up his alt the other day and at the time he was level 27. We went into the event and he didn’t die once, he just kinda chipped away at Earle from a distance. Granted he had a TS/FFR HM to help
---
I recall seeing the clean toilet in some datamine with the atomic shop code tagline. Would be nice to get it for the caps. Would also be nice to get the vault showers. Sure some camps are apocalyptic, but I want to have a proper little cottage sometimes. Plus with the working showers I could incorporate them into my planned "Ammo Depot" build I have planned for when the Ranger Tower and camp interior instances are added. Still hoping I can make a hammer-space tunnel system into the mountain.
---
It's a bug that's been around forever. My advice: don't top yourself off before logging out.
---
There was a redditor who mentioned to use a fletchette mod on it.. Haven't got about to do it yet.
---
It's in the game data. You can even find a Dead NPC wearing it in The Deep.
---
It's just one of those mystery items that have been in the game for months (possibly years at this point) and the Devs have failed to fully incorporate into the game, like the Lobster Trap Helmet.
---
I never said it was broken. I agree that it isn't.
---
Teammates being dragged into a PvP used to be a thing. I miss it.
---
Nah. I really don't think letting a player set a spawn point is a good idea. Idiots will stary crying when they find out they set their spawn point wrong and have to move their camp to fix it
---
Hair is really hard to do, no? That’s why we don’t have any long hair options?
---
Kinda like ladders.
---
Enough alcohol to get addicted.
---
magic weapons or hacked weapons, most likely
---
I really enjoyed the score system, but kinda agree, I liked grinding atoms every day. Now I have no purpose except what the score board gives me... most of which I don't want and would never spend atoms on to begin with :(  It would be cool maybe if they had more atoms on the score board, and then moved some of the rewards off to the atom shop so you can pick and choose what you want.  I don't really want 50 power armor cosmetics and camo gun mods. I think the idea is good, it just needs some tweaking. I really did enjoy knocking that score board out.
---
I finished a few days ago and have just been logging in to collect junk, built me a new house... looking for more ammo from vendors and that 1 in a million plan I don't have yet, etc.
---
Crowd control here
---
Fair.  I don't think it's anecdotal though.  It's about as scientific as it gets.  Now if someone said that one day of playing cause it to break 50% with gunsmith and one more day of playing causes it to break the other half without gunsmith, that would be anecdotal.
---
No Problemo. Honestly the new items as well as all of the rewards being much easier to get is going to make the next Treasure Hunt Event so much better.
---
I'm stoked for the Clown and Super Sledge skin in particular.
---
Are you on the river right by sunshine meadows?
---
I’m happy to do it. I’ve killed him a lot. You and I can duo him. Look for lockedterror145
---
Blessings of the holy flame to you, my child
---
But if it's a welcome mat, can't they just move it?
---
Not right by the bridge to Sunshine Meadows, but pretty close. Depending on who's in the server, I have a neighbor between myself and that workshop.
---
I did not know that was the timer, wow.
---
Regardless, enjoy it while it lasts, magic's days are numbered.
---
Vault steel can be bought with gold so don't worry about it and they were very hard cause of the timer to complete them. I don't know if that stacks with armor pieces or not cause I don't own them. I do know the backpack mods are not as good as the perk cards and they don't stack with them. Yes you can't trade ss armor.
---
I posted a similar issue except mine involves the audio not loading which prevents me from loading into a world. I'm starting to suspect that this is an ongoing bug introduced at some point during the latest patch or so, i feel your pain.
---
I personally wish that the secret doors were powered, so you'd need a switch to open it
---
Did they buff shotguns on the PTS? Last I heard they worked the same as before, and magic effects were still there.
---
1. I don't, but I do see some camps that are like this.  I don't know why they do, but they do and that's their business.  Yeah, it would be nice if they could keep them out for visitors to use, but it's not a requirement.
---
2. In part with the answer to 1, the crafting stations are locked per the camp owner's wishes/intentions, visitors need to weigh the risk of trespassing on a locked part of the camp vs. falling into a fairly simple trap and potentially losing your junk.  Also, if you came to the camp to trade, you do that.  You don't need to use the benches.
---
3. Just because I have a point of view you don't agree with doesn't either of us a nazi.  Makes us humans.  Go in peace, friendo.
---
I’m Shearluck
---
How else am I supposed to get in and leave a bag of salt in the middle of their house if you warn everyone of this?!?!
---
Still wanna ? My GT Is Shearluck
---
Crashing out or Alt+F4 can cause this
---
One shotting monsters is still a very gay thing to do
---
Assaultrons are assholes.
---
STASH. YOUR. JUNK.
---
Trap bases rule btw.
---
There are clothing options that leave the firearms exposed too,  some tattoos for the arms would be nice.
---
I loot everything and scrap it all and drop what I don't want to friends with FO1st
---
Try the patio if they have one?  Or at their front door either should work.
---
Blueprints don't work. They lose boards when you place a blueprinted stack. They can have a movable stack on a rug, maybe that's what youre thinking of
---
I run a Samsung Evo SSD on my Xbox, external to the USB 3.0 port. Game changer. Also have a 1tb external to the other port.
---
It'd be worth it, trust me
---
No
---
No. He's pulling info out his ass.
---
“Devon station”?
---
Sure, if there’s something that can’t be locked itself that makes sense
---
Some Blue Camo Pajamas.
---
PA requires a PA Station to make repairs/mods.  As for your Heavy armour, it is still done at the armour workbench... when you go to repair anything, at any workbench, it will tell you on the right what is required... perk card wise.
---
Treasure maps are also an excellent source of lasers.
---
Nice thanks
---
A LOT of people have moved to private worlds to do the new Colossal Problem event...
---
Not that I know of.....
---
Yep! Work at friend's camps for me!
---
I think a lot of people are taking a break after the legendary run and meat week. They'll be back, don't worry.
---
Yeah, it’s cool to see what other people have been able to do there. Mine is right on top of a Lead extractor, and has a Deathclaw spawn just around the corner of a cliff so I have a turret there to automatically murder it so I can collect the loot every time I come back to CAMP
---
Damn really?? I mean I really don’t know what that is, is it like some sort of new thing going on? I typically don’t participate in events I’m more of a lone wolf running my own missions and such.
---
Yeah I’m down, give me about ten and I’ll join you
---
I want traits to return to be a non-mutation version of similar things.  And they'd be mutually exclusive, so you can't have traits with mutations and vice versa.
---
Except instead of some of the wackier, superhuman abilities you can get with mutations, some slightly more grounded things.
---
Considering how DR/ER works, it's barely noticeable after a wearing a couple of pieces.
---
thanks.
---
when me and the guys i play with some times go to do this event on the weekends on a public server we always remind everyone to tag it before the pilons are on just in case someone wants to one shot it.
---
Alright cool, I was just curious I was like what? It felt literally dead honestly. lol
---
It stores them in complete form, as much as it's able. You should be able to place your whole house again, if there's nothing about the build that confused the system.
---
Hope so
---
Good.  
---
I know I am a low-level guy even at lvl 41, but does this mean these threads stop now lol? :) ;)
---
Forget the bobblehead grind.
---
Just make sure to get the lovers embrace (if you have a follower at your camp) for 5% XP, join a Builder's public team (2-4x XP for everything!) and do all the Feed the People events you can for those canned stews (5% XP). Open some lunch boxes if  you still have any before big events too.
---
Oh I also run Inspirational 3 since I'm in a group... 15% more XP!
---
One big XP event I like to join is Line in the Sand. Bring any explosive weapon. It seems every other time (on PC at least) the mobs spawn in a big group directly over the sonic generator (a bug I guess). a couple explosive shots into that group hits every single mob that spawns before everyone mows them down. I usually get 1000+XP per group that spawns. I've often leveled 1-2 times per Line in the Sand event. If they spawn out by the fences, do the same thing, just VATS focus until it locks on on the next incoming wave, hit it with an explosive shot and it usually tags all the rest of the mobs that spawned with it, then let everyone else mow them down, you get massive XP from this too.
---
As long as you have the 4x multiplier up on the builder's group, join every single event you can. Even the boring stuff can get you 500-1000 XP for just standing there for a few mins and shooting one thing.
---
If it's a larger event, just vats hit everything you can with a fast weapon. The object is not to kill everything, it's just to at least tag it before it dies so you get the XP for it. I use an explosive 10mm. It doesnt kill much but it tags everything around whatever I hit.
---
Do all the daily quick events too (like the amusement park, etc), I got 800 XP for eating hotdogs this evening from a 4 player builders team, and the %extra XP from my perks and stat boosts.
---
All without bobble heads.
---
I friended you
---
It's new this week. There are some videos of it on YouTube if you want to check it out.
---
BUT the person(s) launching the nuke aren’t guaranteed entrance to the event.
---
Same here.  Takes awhile to grind out the bullion I need for all that armor, you know?
---
If you see a player wearing unpainted Excavator PA while wielding an All Rise concrete super sledge, follow them around while spamming the Thumbs Down emote until they log off.
---
If another player is at a workshop, they are asking for you to come and kill them. Any Junk they are carrying is a prize for defeating them.
---
Anyone with BOS/Paladin/Knight/Scribe/Sentinel/etc in their username wants to have their camp nuked. If you nuke Scorched Beast Queen, they will stand on the bunker or fence and prevent her from landing for 25 minutes straight. If it comes to this, activate the satellite dish to play the message until the leave.
---
If you see a Cow at a camp, it is your job to milk it. If the cow does not grant milk you are required to kill it.
---
If you see a decontamination arch at a camp with Ultracite PA and Jetpack plans for 500 ea in their vendor, throw 4 Explosive Baits right next to it.
---
If a player camp has too many lights on, turn them all off.
---
It's not an MMO, and 'modern MMOs' are monitored, albeit somewhat sporadically, by GMs who can keep an eye out for problems with chat.  
---
That WILL NOT HAPPEN with 76, so any chat would generally become a complete shit show, and the more global the channel, the more likely it will happen.
---
You're going to have a hard time upsetting me, and I have no problem flat out hard ignoring trolls.  But in today's political climate unregulated, chat would become quite problematic for BGS.
---
Also for some reason my frame rates absolutely _TANK_ in the Whitespring greens, especially with CAMPs there, can’t figure it out. I’m talking 10-15fps while the rest of the game is 60 or damn near. You experience anything like that?
---
No, your not alone. However it would not really fit with the game, i would also like some different eye colors like red or vibrant blue. 
---
But glowing will probably not happen since it doesn’t really fit with fallout unless your a ghoul or something.
---
Just died to a spammed gauss shotgun again. This mode needs some rebalance and big fixes for sure
---
And cranberries for cranberry relish🙌
---
New event released... BIG BOSS Battle ... new rewards... fixed prefix (crappy) weapons ... new CAMP items ...  have to Nuke Monongah Mine to trigger event
---
I just bought one from Sunny for a few caps, then traded it for scrip.
---
Sucks that they made a new category of weapon that's so meh.
---
I am speechless that a bethesda employe replied to a post i made, it’s awesome 
---
And thanks if that’s something you can do :-)
---
Can I ask what build you tried that you didn’t like?
---
*enhance other people's experience
---
Never seen what a vualt boy lamp looks like..blue and yellow?
---
Pay 1 coin to swap
---
Full action. Have you seen the original Predator film?
---
Decon, stupid autocorrect
---
Neither of them cost you anything
---
Nice! Did you just put the ssd in a case to do that?
---
So, about that damage update...
---
Would love something like the azir ponytail mod from fall out 4
---
After tons of players and allies opening both doors of my house, I just removed the doors all together lol.
---
Armor type. This includes PA and even helmets, like the combat armor helmet.
---
&gt;calling someone a troll for wanting basic features in the game
---
SWTOR has a fucking text chat. Almost every multiplayer game has some form of text chat. Bethesda is just too damn lazy to add it in and just give people the ability to block people
---
There has to be some super strange server side thing that causes it, ive had it happen on live in one fight then not at all the next or only kinda most times.
---
Gunslinger and rifleman used to stack, haven't used it in a while but my tse pipe revolver did significant damage when I made it into a rifle.
---
It's a neon-ish green and projects an image of the vault boy giving a thumbs up.
---
That’s a classic!
---
Oh, I see. I don’t have one so is turning it off a problem because it uses resources to run or degrades over time, or is this a leaving doors open sort of situation?
---
People tell me I'm a low level on 76 is 99 low
---
Only fans maybe....
---
Vault-Tec Ag Center at Flatwoods also has a bunch of tarberry.
---
To add to the lengthy discussion: no.
---
You’ll have to add me as a friend for me to join your private world, I just added you, GT:CrumbBum3857
---
Keep that unyielding peice.once your comfortable with the game switching to bloodied you will be glad you held on to it.just search how many people roll for unyielding and never get their pieces
---
The only problem here is that this much needed weapon base damage buff most likely won't be implemented within update 22 due to time constraints and potential need of extensive testing. We have mere 2.5 weeks until the update hits live servers, even if they patch these changes in today they won't have time to get the data they need from our testing to make meaningful adjustments. And we all know that beth rarely hits the nail on its head with their initial changes to game's mechanics... (not even saying they don't have any idea on how current meta works and what people actually play with since devs don't play their own game, which would be crucial if they wanna do things right)
---
Someone didn't read the patch notes
---
Well they have Target Dummies you can put in your house in ESO so I don't see why Bethesda wouldn't try and copy what ZoS did. Unfortunately it would either be a straight up Atomic shop item or earned through Season rewards I bet if they added it.
---
I run a lot of mutations so I’m afraid I’m gonna accidentally walk into mine. I have mine on a switch But people come in use it and leave it on
---
I went from Bear Arm unarmed build to M79 grenade launcher explosives build. I knew explosives were proclaimed as bad, but holy shit. I couldnt do shit. If it took a couple hits sure. But I tried to kill a whitesprings assultron and got destroyed.
---
Sounds dope!I'll def keep a eye out
---
Nice, quality info there! Thanks!! 
---
-
---
This is the way.
---
Forceful Stock
---
Why this post was downvoted, I’ll never understand.  It proved the engine is capable of doing what we’re talking about.  Probably a bunch of console kids who never got to experience the glory of a properly modded FO4.
---
I appreciate the effort to set the record straight. However, a lot of the bloodied builds will still cry all the same.
---
It'll be the TSE nerf all over again. People will cry, will say the game is forever ruined and say that a whole bunch of players will leave and then... nothing, because it's not that big of a deal.
---
Scrap Laser Rifles/Pistols!!  
---
**Just remember** 
---
Whenever you scrap anything!! Particularly weapons and armour ... try to get your intelligence as high as possible... the smarter you are, the more likely you are to learn mods... try Brain fungus soup... or Berry Mentats  and use the Scrapper perk for extra materials.
---
Cool one minute
---
Oh ok, no I've only gotten the young one that's on the top of the church I didn't know there was two different ones thank you. I'll look around more and find the other one lol
---
Buy the plans for the main pieces of secret service base armor with it (arms, legs, chest and under armor). Once you learn them, they will start dropping as rewards and be available as random RNGs from the purveyor. The underarmor you can buy/craft first as it gives you a nice small boost.
---
The 2 backpack mods are nice too from each faction, either food or chems, whichever you carry more of. If you have weight issues, you may consider either of these mods first. (you can only use one at a time, so pick only one).
---
Who said that the damage calculation changes are prematurely going live? They shouldn't be, but I guess that's up to the devs to break the game.
---
LMG has shit magazine size compared to other options, and both LMG and Gauss Mini are a living, breathing TF2 "Meet the Heavy" meme with how much expensive ammo they burn.
---
Take your time, I’m walking my dog so I’ll be ready shorty
---
I’ve been getting a lot of those 3 star chest pieces after beating earl no unyielding but I’m rocking an assassins one with the ss under armor the grey Barrett soar vault mask and solar vault legs and arms I love the look I also have an unyielding solar armor chest piece I carry for when I’m in teams
---
Wish you had cannibal so you could add even more justice to the story after the shooting part.
---
Its 15% damage while blocking for the armor piece.
---
Cool there was one guy who said he’s done but hasn’t replied since rn looking like just us unless you have some one I’ll keep looking
---
I would love some ceiling wallpapers.
---
Popcorn ceiling, drop ceiling squares, drywall, anything.
---
My totally pimped out high detail house looks so awful when you look up.
---
Cool story, Earl is instanced so there's that and Earl can easily be defeated in less that 20 mins.
---
I fully agree, hell it's so shit I even forgot it exists. lol
---
Eat corn soup... has added benefit of food
---
I am done with the legendary run and I soloed the colossus a couple times on my private server. Sadly there's not much left for me to do until the next update or season.
---
Love the look
---
I've actually never checked my fps while playing! I haven't noticed anything drastically different while in the greens though but now I'm curious and I'll have to try and remember to check next time I play.
---
Ok thanks everyone I get it!! you guys hate women. JUST SAY ITTTTT
---
I have done it once with only three but we all have explosive gat plasmas, let me know if you get more people, I will be on all night and tomorrow daytime
---
You like the Alien films too?
---
sounds like the ops fault
---
This thread though.!.
---
Will do !
---
Oh yeah! I’m not sure if I’ve seen all of those ones tho honestly I should rewatch all of them
---
I don’t use Instagram ... but if you want to do that ... do it... lots of Freaks and Geeks out there who may enjoy it 😎👍🏼
---
At least 6 caps
---
I don't blame you. I'd milk it for all it's worth too.
---
Northern Savage Divide - between sunnytop and the fissure site. On the map it's at the top part of a drawing of rocky hills.
---
Central Savage Divide - east of ATLAS. On the map it's between the drawing of the dog's legs.
---
Southern Central Divide - West of Dent and Sons Construction. This is nearly on the border of the Ash Heap.
---
The Deep - central transit hub you have to go through to get to one of the destinations.
---
The Mire - waaaaaaay NE in the middle of bumble fuck nowhere. I think one of the Queen of the Hunt possible locations is sort of close. And the bloatfly cave that the insect part collection quest points you to is nearish, as well.
---
I wouldn't have IG on my phone..but hell if it makes you happy why not.
---
stop calling this a nerf
---
it's a framework rework of the damage calculation ;)
---
CMs need to interact more like this cause even this kind of response is rare.
---
Don't ruin the moment. Hopefully with more of this sort of interaction, we'll get more informative responses.
---
I can get upwards of 4K head damage with my instigating explosive pipe rifle.
---
Normal shots hit for a 900 to 1400 damage. 
---
Kills just about everything in the game with one shot except for bosses.
---
Don’t know if I’m the only one but I always carry a legendary reduced weight shovel on all of my characters for the burial daily and bonking low level enemies, I plan on all 5 of my characters having one. The pickaxe isn’t the best but the reduced weight makes it useful as a backup melee weapon. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Remember! A fucking is always a good chance to steal a wallet!
---
So, lactose intolerant?
---
That's a good amount, will you buy?
---
Nice - how did you get the picture to be in Post though?
---
It must of smelt like death in there.
---
I got one accidentally unlocking a regular world item in someone's claimed camp. I didn't know it would belong to them (safe or something, I forget). I then became wanted. I ran back to my house, dumped all my junk and just kept doing quests until someone finally shot me. I respawned and waved/thumbs up at them LOL. They understood.
---
This subject makes no sense and hurts my head. 100%?  
---
" **The reasons for which 100% of the people discussing bloodied nerf are wrong**"  
---
You're discussing the bloodied nerf, are you part of the 100% that's wrong?I'm now discussing it, am I wrong. Bethesda must have discussed it, they're wrong.Should we just not discuss it, to be right? I'd input into this, but so far 49 interactions on this post have been wrong, according to your title. I guess as I've mentioned it, I'm also wrong. :D
---
Not all men I love women and I’m a father of 4 girls the oldest is 16 and I’m trying to get her to play fallout 76 because I can craft so much and I tell her you’ll be a badass young player in this game
---
You're a bitch.
---
Also add fireproof and anything to prevent radiation
---
Yup. All amazon. Evo ssd and an external case. Total installation took 10 minutes the first time. Mostly packaging issues lol. Plug and play, xbox asks to format.
---
The other drive isn't ssd but its a faster drive than stock. All really really easy.
---
How do you come up with such a cool name like Deathclaw Hunter outfit and then make the actual outfit hideous?
---
https://youtu.be/z6ZrvMPrbHg
---
And if anybody know wants to know how to build a trap base
---
Apparently 5th time is a charm. Only took 5 minutes. I also found out I really like my AA1025 Ultracite Gatling Laser that I had sitting in my stash for the last two weeks. Got garbage for reward though. But a win!
---
Blue printed stacks cannot be placed, although new stacks can be made
---
https://youtu.be/e6l_zEShbH4
---
Any idea where you can get the plan?
---
From a lore perspective it definitely has a place.
---
Do Earl then SBQ. If there’s a nuke over Manogna mine from a previous CP event and someone nukes fsp , the SBQ and another CP event will start same time. If ur good u can do both in allotted time.
---
Take the beam splitter off
---
Ya know. I've been in game 1.2k hours and still have not powered up a plant lol
---
I never understood why we couldn't plant pumpkins either.  To be honest, none of the plants seem like they should be restricted in camp builds.
---
I spawned under my porch today
---
I've ran Fallout 4 on the ssd as well when i had it installed.
---
HUGE difference in draw distance and load times. I raced a friend with load screens, Sanctuary to downtown. I had less issues there and load times were halved.
---
Ssd is superior for every game. RDR2 is way faster. PUBG, the whole map loads while your in the plane, not popping up when you land. Forza Horizon 4, raced another friend from the main menu. I was in my car doing donuts while he was still in load screens.
---
I believe it was last nuked 2 mornings ago. After killing SBQ I logged to a PW to repair.
---
However I can not say for certain the specific last time I logged into an existing nukezone. Absolutely sure I have since Earle was released for PC, but maybe not in the past week.
---
I'll reply again if I get a chance to jump into another existing nukezone and see if anything gets broken.
---
I’m on Xbox, but tbh, I think I can’t go higher than 4 anyway
---
I go into stealth with my Chinese armor and sneak over and drop some stimpacks near them like some wretched sewer goblin trying to make friends and then scuttle away quickly and pretend I didn't notice them there.
---
On xBox, I have a Little Cabin in the Woods along the creek in the Savage Divide. It is nestled in a semi-secluded area but within convenient walking distance to the Top of the World and the Pleasant Valley Ski Resort and Train Station. It is fairly centrally located, with other nearby locations including Site Alpha and Big Fred's BBQ Shack to the South, and Central Mountain Lookout to the North.
---
The main building features a small sitting room with rockers to listen to the radio, a larger main room with dining area, a comfortable couch, and a cozy indoor fireplace to keep you warm. When you're feeling weary or things get extra cozy, take it to the bedroom and get a good night's rest.
---
On the rustic dirt path at the Northern Edge where you spawn in, there is a Communal Firepit. Come sit on the rustic benches and commune with your friends, your neighbors, the Travelling Merchants, and the Allies.
---
Grab a free Nuka from the machine and head into the Vendor Hut. Spacious and featuring four vending machines, including the charming Slocum's Joe Protection. Sidle up to the diner counter and finish your drink, or buy Plans, Magazines/Maps/Bobbleheads, Ammo/Guns/Weapons or Chems/General Aid. All reasonably priced and frequent price reductions and fire sales do happen!
---
Aside from Grahm's Meat Week events, the only enemy spawns seem to be the occasional Mothman and a few Radstag. Otherwise, enjoy the pleasant and peaceful moos of the nearby Brahmin herds or the sounds of frogs and crickets.
---
With all workbenches and crafting stations spread out across the sloping space between the road and the creekbed, your every need is tailored to.
---
-Need some extra scrap? Collectron's got you covered.
---
-Need some crops? I've got a little bit of everything planted, along with a Turbo-Fert station.
---
-Water Purifiers churning out free water
---
-Keg and Punchbowl filled with everything but NukaShine. (Sorry, that costs extra!)
---
-Nuka Cola machine filled with an assortment of beverages to quench your thirst.
---
-Radshower runs continuously on the porch for those who want to cleanse and easy access to the creek to re-radiate for those Bloodied builds among us.
---
-A rotating assortment of instruments is available for those who wish to add a little harmony
---
-Free Concerts performed by the Settler Wanderer herself.
---
Everything is unlocked and freely available for use by all travelers who stop by. (I do tend to lock only during the Christmas Gift event, but I have been known to dump bags of the excess scrap and junk next to it.)
---
The only problem is... I don't have any photographs of it at the moment.
---
But because I like the site for lack of enemies, central location, and because I have it built the way I want it after several remodels, I really don't want to move. Even if I have other ideas sometimes.
---
At work. 🤷‍♂️
---
No, I'm sorry but you reviving players is not you aiding the fight. This is a battle against time you see, if it didn't have a time limit no one would care too much, but game designzzzz.
---
This happens all the time when I find one. The traps always load in first and it ruins the intended effect, I think. XD
---
5 and we have a deal
---
Like 2-3 thousand caps
---
But most likely more like 500-750 caps for scrip
---
If you can don't add no armor or anything like that to increase the effect just do something to add more damage go to 5 percent health a bobble head magazine ballistic Bock what ever you can to up it more and see if it full kills.
---
I was once chilling in my treehouse camp and suddenly noticed speaking. Then I found 2 players negotiating their trade in the living room. I said hi and they just said hey and kept on talking as if I’m invisible. Soon the trade involved 3-4 people and they were just all having a chat while excluding me.
---
It felt bizarre, some dudes walk into my house and having a party without me
---
Metal you can’t, I think you can through single brick
---
How so? Does the current maps have some kind of effect on adventure mode?
---
Not really, if i need ammo i either craft it or buy from anyone that has it at 1 cap each (unless it's uncommon), still don't understand people selling .44 for more than 3 caps each... As for chems and aids i hoard a lot and prefer to sell them, 2 caps max of any type. For weapons, i don't see that many people selling guns and the ones i see usually have spare "not so good" rolls, but if i see a weapon that i can get through a bot vendor and they sell it for exaggerated prices i just skip to next player. And when it comes to me selling guns, i prefer putting for sale good rolls that aren't specific for my build, so i either use fed76 or just sell it at the value the game gives it depending on the prefix.
---
Lmao
---
Tomahawks, throwing knives, meat cleavers, etc.
---
Too funny. Although we killed her without her regenerating I'm not sure if this post was about us daff. I had 2 pylons though so it's possible the post was about our squad. Lol
---
I used the pipe revolver for a while until I got my hands on a lever-action rifle, which was up until around level 30ish or so.  I didn't use the regular pipe guns very long at all because I knew from Fallout 4 they sucked, and they still suck.  Outside the Forest, they're too weak, and the pipe bolt-action is way too slow, and far too unsatisfying to use as a weapon to even remotely justify its use.  The pipe revolver is the only half-decent one when you double dipped with rifleman and gunslinger.
---
How in the hell is this not hot-fixed yet?! This should be top priority. Magic weapons lasting more than 1 week is nuts, 9 months is just unacceptable.
---
Probably feels easier because you’re actually engaged in combat with Earle and his minions the whole time instead of watching him swoop and fly around like a dummy for 10 minutes.
---
Farm the heck out of the Uranium Fever event, go in with a fast weapon (10mm pistol or something) and shoot EVERYTHING that moves, you don't need to kill anything, just tag them all as fast as they spawn. Once the event ends, spend a few mins picking every last item off every bloody pile, there's a scrapper right outside the entrance to that room the event is in. You can usually get a few dozen gauntlets with each event to scrap.
---
If you're referring to the deathclaw gauntlet extra claw though, that's often found via a mod you can find all over the place.
---
If you were on PC, I'd mod them for you.
---
I've never bothered locking my base... I do however lock my water purifiers. Because every damn time I seem to need some purified water, somebody has taken it all
---
Un-borked shotguns?
---
It’s a long but fun quest. Poseidon has some lore about the plant, not sure about the others.
---
What? Too harsh?
---
Yup. Just converted my instigating stealth crossbowman into an Instigating stealth MG42 heavy gunner with a vampire's Explosive MG42 as a stimpack machine. Just swapped agility to strength and picked heavy gunner perks. I have no faith they will balance by buffing the weapons they gimped into oblivion.
---
You can harm others bases.  I lock my doors because leave my base alone.
---
Once one wasteland drops there is no magic
---
How tho
---
What kind of weapon do you use?
---
I've heard several hours. Something like 8-10 or possibly until a server reset.
---
I've never stayed longer than an hour or so after doing it. Just enough to get a dozen fusion cores or so.
---
It's a bug, but still
---
Yea I like leaving it open cause it can help lower level players so I like helping them out but I'm gonna get a bit conservative with it soon
---
How
---
.50 cal
---
Same, raider end quests are just little bit more fun in my opinion. 🙃
---
It's not a console only issue, it happened on my high end gaming PC too when someone had a tesla rifle in there one day, my FPS dropped to 0 if I was facing the battle. I had to just look away and shoot wendigo's the whole event until it was over.
---
This is like the third time today I've seen a post asking this same question. It's like you all went to the same camp and couldn't figure out that people probably just want their doors to stay shut. Why *else* would they be locked?
---
A quest item not intended for it.
---
I recommend power armor.  Excavator power armor with calibrated shocks for leg mods, emergency protocols for chest, no good mods for arms, and targeting hud for helmet to see enemies better, but it's not super important
---
It's sorta coming with the next scoreboard
---
You don’t need max rep for farmable tiles, I believe it’s the rank below max.
---
Oh, I didn't realize.
---
Ir's just a gramps who doesnt understand online gaming. Yes, text chat is much needed.
---
Which one
---
If you're on PC and ever see me online, stop by my vendor, I usually have a stack of them for 1cap each :)
---
Find where 2-3 are close together and just do a daily grind path between them all, even if you don't need them, You'll have a huge stack in no time.
---
It does aid in the fight. I’m a bloody melee and need to be revived from time to time so I don’t get the dreaded 60 second respawn screen. Many times I’m doing a good load of the damage(1000 plus per hit) so if I’m getting killed and timed out for 60 seconds it can keep the group from winning. Not all cases but some.
---
Try not to die, avoid AOE attacks and environmental hazards, and most importantly try to play with people who will revive you!
---
I would just back out then try another match
---
It is entirely true I just showed my husband that you can change it’s parameters because all he was getting was shit
---
Also very important to avoid being punted when ol’ Earle charges at you!
---
Because of the legacy weapons?
---
They do have a cow that you can kill... it's always my first victim when I get a new gun.
---
You need to do the Miner Miracles quest to get the PA station, then you can do PA repairs etc.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Miner_Miracles
---
I feel like you're going to use it to destroy bases
---
If it were bloodied or junkies it would be very valuable imo. Mutants is meh.  someone might pop a couple thousand on it just for funsies but if it doesn't sell in a couple days I'd just scrip it to have the stash space available.
---
Genuine question, how do u kno it’s from duping?
---
There's a cool hanging tree WAAAYYY up in the north of the map, just east of center (I don't remember where at this point). No mannequin on it, but kinda creepy nonetheless.
---
Pic I took of it the last time I was there.
---
[https://www.abandonedtravels.com/Games/Fallout76/i-58xNcQH/A](https://www.abandonedtravels.com/Games/Fallout76/i-58xNcQH/A)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
LOL just noticed the mannequin inside the house pic. super creepy!
---
So my next question, comrades, is what I am supposed to do until then? I finished the first season. The rewards were fun and all. But if I get no reward daily but gold, caps, and scrip, that I don't need, why play? Todd really screwed the collossus on this one am I right?
---
Yes sure. All fallout fans’ creations are worthy to be shown imho. I would suggest to upload content also on other places (reddit?), because not everyone has Instagram.  
---
Looking at your username though, not sure if you are a guy trolling for attention...
---
When someone does this to me my game will freeze for about 2 secs the all of a sudden i am downed.
---
Anything other than the secret service skin looks too monstrous.
---
Ok I dont plan on it but you know Google's a thing right? I just wanted to learn something quick but I can google it now. And I dont plan on it I just wanna see.
---
And how is duping the cause of this?
---
They almost never buff enough to make anything  useable. Alien laser pistol is still junk, laser weapons still suck. They need base damage increases of 300% or more for neglected weapons (pistols, semi rifles, and mele weapons).
---
Yeah true, it's the explosive bait
---
I mean how would a lock door stop them from just destroying your door if that was their intent?
---
Talk about those who completed Commander Daguerre's companion missions and are stuck with the level 20 alien blaster *before* they fixed it so you'd get a level 50 one
---
I get more out of killing dozens of wendigos spawns than I do out of completing the event or the random piece of disappointment from Earl. I can melt him down in 50 seconds (ps4) without going with full damage perks. I might burn most of his first life bar, but then I'll stop and switch to xp/acid/screws/ammo farming.
---
It wouldn't.  I mostly just don't like people being in my base
---
In my experience, any event where you need to fight in one location against waves of enemies, such as Radiation Rumble or One Violent Night (both of these are instances where I've had issues with someone using the Tesla Rifle) are where you should avoid using it.
---
I wonder if people would use them as much if we had some kind of defense from them?
---
Seriously? I have that recipe. Thanks.
---
At the very least could we get no more gender exclusive hairstyles. Females get some really nice long hair styles. While males get some ok ones. 
---
I forget what it is named in game but i would really like to put a female exclusive hairstyle on my guy character. The one that has long hair with one side of the head shaved.
---
Yeah... don't blow up people's stuff
---
The cliff and underground bases I usually get in and out fast. You usually have time to hit escape (on PC) and exit the server to the main menu before you land.
---
Came across an underground base once that was a complete obstacle course, Pressure plates and false doors and all kinds of interesting obstacles before it finally lead you to an epic vendor room. I was having fun exploring it but was super nervous the whole time waiting to escape/exit in case they logged off.
---
I got The Fixer plan from some event in the past week - it was a duplicate for me, but couldn't tell you if it was this event or not. I don't buy plans, and don't pick up what others drop, so had to have been something I received from the game. 
---
I'm still at the quests with Top of the World...not finished Encryptid, but still ended up with it. so... \*shrug\*
---
You have mutations without starched?
---
I legit came here for ideas 💡not to be that guy but I’m being that guy kinda upset they can’t be placed on a foundation floor 😡
---
I only have the door to my generator locked, and only because radtoads kept just opening the door and taking it out.   It being locked, they attack the door, which gives my turret a chance to waste them
---
Yea man ik. You on xbox? If so I have stealth boys available if you want
---
I have no idea if it's *supposed* to work this way, but I've watched mongrel dogs open my doors and run to my generator to attack it. Locks on the doors stop them from getting that far before my turrets finally activate and kill them. If it weren't for that nonsense I wouldn't feel the need to lock up.
---
I run unyielding ninja sneak blooded gauntlet build in this event and it is a lot of fun. The wendigos take one or two punches and I can do a good chunk of damage to Earl by jumping up in his faces and smacking him with a power attack while in hidden or caution status.
---
K gotchu
---
If they added the Fireproof perk card or dense armor mod it would help. I've been wanting a decent defense for explosives for quite some time.
---
I play on Xbox and don’t get too many crashes, and not usually during nukes. If you’re on pc your computer might not be good enough to handle everything going on in a nuke
---
I think I read that there was only 11 days left or something and I don't remember how long ago I read that. You should earn a total of 1500 atoms to rank 90, you could use those to buy out the last 10 ranks if you're desperate.
---
I don't need stealth boys.  I'm pretty tanky.
---
I always thought it would be cool if pvp would temporarily disable things like legendary effects and mutations. It wouldn't help the stealth boys and quantum spams, though...
---
WHAT THE HELL CAN ONE SHOT THE SHEEPSQUATCH?!?! Thats a scary weapon
---
Wait... what are they duping?
---
Only if it comes with an emote that shows 'Team Rocket is blasting off again!'
---
Just grind a ton of xp
---
One of my friends said when I asked him, and I quote: 'I don’t want anyone to fuck with my shit. I don't care if they can't take anything or break anything. It's mine, and they can stay the fuck out.'
---
I don't really get it myself, but to each their own, I guess. I do lock up my raider collectron and the mini ammo creator, but only because I can use the bullets. Everything else is free game.
---
Maybe new set of servers with wiped characters
---
K gotchu. If you know anyone who wants one lemme know please. I have too many now
---
Thanks all!  Scrip it is.
---
Bloodied, don't think anyone rocks that.
---
Watoga
---
Yeah those probably, the lever and the gauss
---
Nice. 😆
---
They glitch the game on console, without them in the event everything runs fine. Multiple duped guns all firing at once crashes the server.
---
Had to do a hard reset after the last time it happened. 
---
Sure earl is hard, but cheater guns ruins the event for everyone.
---
The only place that plan drops is the imposter Sheepsquatch. And doing the quest isn't needed to get in the event and get the drop. That's where you got it 100% guarantee.
---
Recently meaning earlier today I died once and it respawned me outside of the mine.  Had no way to get back in.  Tried to fast travel to teammates but still placed me outside.
---
The entrance was covered up.  Was pretty upset cause Earle was almost dead.  Though the one time I completed the event I got a 3 star weapon that was level 20...  I’m level 107.  
---
So Really just mad at all the wasted ammo.  Not sure if I will try the event again anytime soon.
---
Pipe revolvers and pipe bolt action double dip rifleman and pistol related perks. I have one whole vending machine dedicated to these lovely weapons. PIPE IS LIFE
---
if they wave or say hi I return the greeting and that's all
---
also some times I start squatting like a maniac until they return me the squat
---
I'm not sure why you're reporting people for using magic weapons. It's not like these people are hacking or anything, and magic weapons are really easy to get. The purveyor throws them at me faster than I can sell them in my vendor. (The upshot of Beth fixing magic weapons - whenever *that* finally happens - means I can toss all the ones I have and free up a ton of stash space.)
---
Some players might've picked up something interesting from the purveyor and not even realize it's magic. Junkie's for instance is a magic effect, and Junkie's is a meta build. What are players supposed to do? NOT use the weapon they've just gotten?
---
Factions..? 
---
As in foundation and crater? Because they already have note machines... Though legendary exchange machines would be nice.
---
It acts like a magical shotgun. If you use Vats with the cursed harpoon with the flechettes mod the damage will stick and it will one shot most things.
---
That first part was hilarious lol.  I lock my resources up myself
---
I set up an electric door with 2 pressure pads and wired it up nicely with conduit and it works well. However now I'm torn because I want to expand and I'm at max budget.
---
I tried doing it with bot vendors and it isnt worth my while. I'll put it up in my vendor tomorrow
---
West of the gorge junkyard is a little cliff with a steel and a copper spot.  
---
East of it, where the railroad bridges over the road, is a junk pile.  
---
Both are ludicrously easy to hit the junkyard workshop from.  
---
Though now I've parked on the junk spot just west of the haunted cabins and leave both my junk extractor and collection open with vaultboy cutouts pointing to them. Anyone coming to check my vendors is welcome to help themselves to free junk. Just ignore the blood curdling screams from the neighbors.
---
Yeah the foundation and crater and probably eventually The brotherhood and enclave. I know they have note machines but if they had legendary ones I could just do one stop. The other way around works too if they add treasury note machines to stations since they have legendary ones
---
Low level players with op explosive weapons they can't have yet.
---
I have an instigating explosive pipe rifle that is great for low area zones
---
I've noticed enemies can just go through foundations and windows anyway. Just have a couple turrets inside preferably up high or unreachable.
---
You got a source for that?
---
Cleaver and Master Infiltrator.
---
Yup, the pts
---
On PS4 it's usually a duped OG weapon from when they had stupidly overpowered perk combos..
---
Ah ok what level were they?
---
It's popped up on here a few times but the problem beyond griefing is that most camps don't load entirely until well after you arrive, so if you have you mat on say a third floor, you'll spawn but then fall to the ground or halfway into something as it materialises.
---
There's a lot of factors to take into account to make this work and I can only imagine the amount of players coming in here to rage about the bugs.
---
I got no problem with legacy.
---
It's when people are level 67 using plasma casters they can't have grinded the gold for yet.
---
Cheaters.
---
You got 3 more days of 'bonus challenge week' so you'll get 11 dailies per day, plus the 11 weekly. So that could get you a good 2-3 levels per day if you're also grinding XP.
---
Pretty sure you have atleast 11 days left, try to get atleast 2 levels per day and you'll be good
---
Wow! And I thought i had bad luck. Its a shame because I like the event but the payoff has been horrible for me as well. But at least I got a win finally...after 5 shots at it. I cant go at it all day like some. Maybe once a day and I go all in so its frustrating that it took 5 tries and got script! And when I went to visit mumbles...i got a plasma caster that I cant even trade so its LITERALLY script. But hey.. i love crafting a shit ton of ammo to leave down in a mine for no reward. Hopefully things turn around for us. Keep trying...maybe.
---
67
---
&gt; I was wondering if multiple players are firing and it’s a constant stream of magic damage, does the damage itself stack?
---
It's hard to tell, because it all happens so fast it's really difficult to tell who did what damage.
---
I do know that if 8 players show up all with magic weapons, Earle dies in less than a second. So this would seem to suggest that the magic damage does indeed stack.
---
Look at the title..?
---
So it's the guns that are causing it. Not duping? I have had no issues with 4 people firing explosive plasmas
---
This is easy.i have 4 of them.usually no more than 1k caps.and only weighs about 3 pounds. Waiting to scrip .
---
Do you not like your forehead tattoos enough? Maybe a different clover tattoo variation could spice things up.
---
Ah ok that makes sense now.  So someone is duping an OP weapon and giving it to them?  Sorry for all the questions, not sure how all this stuff works
---
Stop being lazy. When i was young we had to walk to the train stations uphill in the snow barefoot! Kids these days....
---
Pretty sure ive never seen that mentioned on this whole sub. What is that?
---
That camp Looks better than some of the camp builds I seen
---
Yeah same here on xbox. Super laggy and game crashes. Trying to fast travel and it lags so slow that I have enough time to go shit and make coffee before the loading screen even shows up
---
This is fun to think about!  Some perk ideas:
---
Perk (Perception, 2 Points): **Life Awareness** \- Living creatures are highlighted.  \[Or a much better alternative: This ability is added to the already existing Awareness perk.\]
---
Perk (Perception, 1 Point): **Craftsman's Sense** \- You hear directional audio when in range of a crafting station (not including cooking stations).  \[Kind of a joke, but I wish I could swap it in when I'm overloaded with unscrapped junk.  Or I could use a scrap kit.\]
---
Perk (Agility, 1/2/3/4/5 Points): **Knife Thrower** \- Thrown non-explosive weapons such as knives and tomahawks do +20%/+30%/+40%/+50%/+60% damage.  \[Follows the Demolitions Expert perk model.\]
---
Perk (Strength, 2 Points): **Deadly Discus** \- Explosive mines can be thrown as if they were grenades.
---
Perk (Strength, 1 Point): **Barroom Brawler** \- Empty bottles in junk inventory are now designated as thrown weapons.  Remove this perk to select conventional thrown items.  \[Mostly for fun.  Probably would do damage on par with a basic throwing knife at best, and bottles would shatter and become non-recoverable on impact.\]
---
Perk (Agility, 1 Point): **Cooked-Off Grenades** \- Grenades now explode on impact with no additional bounce or time delay.  \[I get tired of my expensive grenades bouncing and rolling around like ping-pong balls.\]
---
Perk (Charisma, 1/2/3 Point): **Intimidation** \- Aim your gun at any Human, Super Mutant or Mole Miner below your level for a 25%/50%/75% chance to pacify it. \[I probably wouldn't use it, but it fills a niche.\]
---
Perk (Intelligence, 1/2/3 Points): **Syringer Expert** \- Syringers ignore 33%/66%/100% of target resistances and are 33%/66%/100% more effective.  You can now craft Tier 1/2/3 syringer modifications.  3 point added effect: Syringers affect all targets and ignore immunity effects.  Does not affect robots. \[Syringers need some love.  Maybe higher tier would involve long-distance stimpacks, paralytics that prevent running, stun effects and so on.\]
---
And a couple mutations:
---
Mutation: **Scorchbeast Scream** \- You gain the ability to scream like a scorchbeast, emitting a cone of sonic destruction before you.  This costs 50 AP per second and cannot be stopped until you run out of action points.  You can no longer use thrown explosives, as this uses the same control (hold ALT on PC, etc.).  Deafens the user (mutes all sound) for 30 seconds after use.  Recipe: Oil (5), Pure Cobalt Flux (1), Ultracite (3), Scorchbeast Lung (1)
---
Mutation: **Wendigo Screech** \- You gain the ability to howl like a wendigo, stunning opponents in a conical area in front of you.  This costs 50 AP per use and has a 30 second cooldown \[balance as needed\].  You can no longer use thrown explosives, as this uses the same control (hold ALT on PC, etc.).  Deafens the user (mutes all sound) for 30 seconds after use.  Recipe: Acid (5), Pure Fluorescent Flux (1), Ultracite (1), Wendigo Colossus Vocal Sac (1)
---
That's what she said.
---
I’m just saying they are bringing back the brotherhood and there NPCs so I figure they might add the enclave next year or something or at least I hope they come back to the wasteland.
---
Did they finally fix em?
---
I got the two mixed up like 3 times in my head lmao my bad
---
ctrl+tab during the black screen, then esc, esc.
---
Yes, they did, from what I can tell.
---
Yeah, got them mixed up in my head, my bad, chill
---
I suspect when people talk about that happening that it's not a bug, but rather the fact that they can select multiple items in your inventory to trade for one of their items, and if someone doesn't know how the interface works or doesn't check to "show only offers," they can easily accidentally trade all their shit for one thing, or nothing probably. A a guy tried to take 3 of my really good weapons the other day that way, but I checked the show only offers and backed out.
---
This is solid advice. If you go with excavator calibrated shocks add a extra 100 lbs to the additional 100lbs it carries.but really any power armour better than none.but unyielding is definitely fun out of power armour
---
An they buying them for real money from people with mule character who sell weapons and armor way above players current level
---
Haha
---
Not as good for heavy weapons because of stabilized.  Defense in power armor is also better than non power armor
---
See now, this is where I'm getting conflicting reports. Because Angry Turtle demonstrated in a recent video (or was it on stream?) that magic damage still works on the PTS.
---
I don't have access to the PTS myself, but I'm more likely to believe him over some random redditor. No offense.
---
Fair enough. It was fun for a while.
---
I agree.
---
I switched to heavy gunner due to patch 22 nerf. I run 4 pieces weapon weight reduction armor and deep pockets. 1 perk card bear arms, 3 cards of bandolier.
---
When was the video posted?  Also link?
---
Interestingly, I’ve been able to place foundation and ladder pieces partly in the ground before even though the plan was red.
---
They should have a cello, that would sound good although I guess it doesn't fit with the Appalachia theme.
---
This was loooooong ago, before player vending. Spotted 4-5 dots on the map in one location. That usually meant they were hanging at someone's camp. I loved checking out camps to I travelled near them and ran over. When I got there I saw 3-4 people in swimsuits and bear mascot heads (or something similar) and one guy in power armor chasing them all around swinging a hammer.
---
I love when people have no regard for their mic and the whole world can hear.
---
Can't say I've seen anything quite that odd
---
Next patch, Crater and Foundation are going to be free fast travels. So other than waiting through a loading screen, there's going to be no other cost involved to visiting the bullion machines.
---
Im not sure, I don't think anyone screamed it at me in the last 7 seconds. Might have to do a bit of research, not much info on this sub. 1/10 stars, boo.
---
I concur 100%I have some nice P.A but I just recently started to use that with my heavy weapons vs earl the extra damage resistanceis nice.other than that ss unyielding does the trick for me
---
Stabilized is the best bonus
---
Gave me a good chuckle right there. The boo really sold it
---
It's not the plasma guns.
---
It's the game glitching because of guns and armor that should not be there.
---
If everyone uses legit gear the event runs fine.
---
When illegal gear shows up the game freaks out.
---
I just got back into playing after a long time. This just happened to me and I had no idea what happened because it didn’t say anything. Lol
---
How do you go beyond max budget? Please PM me I must be a part of this magic
---
I want the 1911 Colt in the game. Reload animation is the mags dropping out of the grips and two new ones slapped in.
---
whaddya mean?
---
I punch the wendigos, I tried punching Earles leg and pretty sure I didn't do any damage
---
But I read another post where someone talked about someone in their fight doing decent damage with a two handed melee weapon
---
I wouldn't really call this passive aggressive, but rather *actually* aggressive.
---
There seems to be a lot of pent-up anger in OP's post. Worryingly so.
---
Well lucky for you the exact opposite has been happening for me, so I basically never moved my camp nor try making a new one
---
If your on xbox I can build a power armor station for you ..if not try placing your camp near places that have workbenches you can use.near foundation is kinda center of the map.so is whitesprings resort.lmk
---
i have no issues but melee is my main build ..i recommend blocker perk 100%
---
I can't find the image but it in this video https://youtu.be/8apiJRTTrWE
---
I tried solo that damn thing..no dice.its not the gear.Hell maybe it is.bloodied unyielding but I cure half my rads because i dont want to die.
---
Word!
---
More or less it's a toy like at carnival
---
No shit?I cant post pics on this thread..I'm not worthy
---
Wait. You have 4 level 50 ones?
---
One thing the playerbase of 76 has proven is that Wild Wasteland was more realistic than we gave it credit for.
---
I never been able to move my whole camp unless its simple..like built up from a single foundation.usually best to start over.
---
&gt;The problem is that sniper rifles no longer have any punch.
---
I mean, that's debatable. My bloodied +10% Gauss Rifle still one-shots high level super mutants, now I just *have* to land headshots. I don't mind at all. With my new build it's very easy to switch from the long range sniper rifle to an automatic handmade for close quarters, so I think I'll be fine. 
---
I don't one-shot Mirelurk Queens or Scorchbeasts anymore, but that was kind of silly anyway. We'll be fine. Automatic rifles will still dominate, bloodied will still be good, and the Broadsider will still be a joke.
---
Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose.
---
Lol
---
Yeah oddly I find them in player vending machines..I paid 1k caps or less for each.it makes a good scrip bank.talk to me i wont upsell too high.lol if your on xbox I'll pass one on to you
---
Honestly it sounds like shotguns are working again, which I’m super happy about
---
I saw a bunch of players in a random spot on the map. Went there and found about 5 players wearing only sheep heads and underwear killing each other.
---
And that's the only wastelander quest I havent done.i havent even rescued her from the crash landing yet.lol
---
I’ve got a meat room that looks ominous from the window but if you go in it’s p bare bones because of the camp budget
---
Oh, cool!  I could see adding Scorched and Wendigos to the mix.  Would be tough to summarize these kinds of things in a one-line status in the PipBoy, but I suppose they could just have two or three related effects.
---
Scorched: Has overlap with various while-grouped perks and mutations, like +2 STR, +2 AGI, +2 PER when grouped.  Downside: -3 INT at all times and -1 AGI and -1 PER when ungrouped.  Immune to radiation.  Can consume Ultracite scrap as food/healing.  Stimpacks are only half as effective.
---
Wendigo: +3 AGI, +3 END, +3 STR, -3 INT, -3 CHA, -3 LCK (if you were lucky, you wouldn't have needed to eat your friends).  Gains increased sprint speed.  Gains effects similar to the Cannibal perk at max level, permanently.  Other food is only 33% as effective.
---
The effects themselves got nerfed, that has nothing to do with it. Explosive energy weapons are the only ones that weren't fixed, yet bethesda said they would fix them 19 months ago now.   You can kill it in a few seconds with a bloodied stealth commando or an explosive gatling plasma, but one shotting can only be done with hacked weapons, maybe a min-maxed unarmed character on a private server
---
it really is!!!! i’ve tried picking up my xbox account after pc a couple of times and it’s so hard
---
I can't launch chickens, though.
---
alright first what do you play on?
---
Dumb posts like this have been around since the start. They just get more attention now because people believe them lol
---
Steam, meant to say that.
---
Is it a freind request or a team invite.people try and invite me to their team for the xp bonuses.a team of 4 can have x4 intelligence or what ever based on the type of team
---
Not sure why this is getting downvoted, because you're not wrong.
---
I've run the event countless times and gotten several Fixer plans from it, but rarely do I get to loot the corpse because most of the time I can't even find it. It either blasts off into space, or rolls down the bank never to be seen again.
---
Regardless, I'm going to repeat what I say in every one of these threads. This game really needs area / event-wide corpse loot. Then problems like this would never happen again.
---
Yeah this is me personally. Only logging in to spend notes, sell stuff for caps, and get my daily scrip.
---
if you stand under him and swing up  you will get the headshot damage
---
If you havent tried bloodied I would try it.my 1st bloodied was a 10mm smg and it would melt level 60 ghouls with 5 or 6 rounds...felt really good.once your perk cards are down you dont die as much..good roll!
---
I'm about to change your whole life:
---
Place a powered door. Burn it down with a flame thrower trap. Place a pressure plate where the door was. Repair the door. Hook the pressure plate up to the door. Presto! You now have a pressure door powered by a single pressure plate!
---
Ok but how do I build one of those for myself
---
It said friend request received. What does it say when you get invited to a team? As far as I know, I’ve never been invited to a team. 
---
I was also already on a public team at the time. To be fair, I don’t 100% understand what being on a public team means and I don’t know if already being on a team would mean I wouldn’t get invited to another team.
---
Big thanks to you my dude, Yabvone hooked me up solid! Now my instigating Radium is actually useable! Thanks again!
---
Same here. Hardcore player for a long time now and definitely got my money’s worth. But these upcoming changes have really lowered interest in playing. I stopped playing half way through meat week and haven’t really felt the need to play anymore. I might come back for the brotherhood story stuff in the future but my desire to play is allmost gone. 
---
Its not even just about the new changes. Thats just the shit covered cherry on top. Bethesdas lack of bug fixes, refusal to seriously punish hackers/dupers and the way they are obsessed  with turning this game into some kind of grinding nightmare has stopped me from fully enjoying this game as much as i use to.
---
Log out of server and give it 30 seconds.
---
I mean we can mutate to have glowing eyes
---
Yep, that disproves what I heard. It was probably just someone that did the event a lot without getting it, completed the quest, and then coincidentally got it after that.
---
&gt;Anything else I should do to keep my private space private?
---
You can't, not really. There's a very simple glitch that allows you to phase through any obstruction, so a determined intruder will always find a way in.
---
The only way to ensure privacy is to turn up your mic and use it to blast Kenny G.
---
Dr.i dont use steam so I cant really help you on that one.as far as teams it's just personal preference .if doing events join a event team for extra xp completing events or building team does extra xp for everything.
---
Unfortunately I'm on PS4 so not much of a chance at nicking one from ya. I'm sure I'll find one going cheap tho

Oh. Is that why my Minigun shreds things. 
---
Should I avoid using it, or use it now while I can?  
---
I don't want to reduce the enjoyment of other players, but for solo play it should be fine, right?
---
Yea I’ve been bloodied since the beginning, be levers, b2525 fixers and handmades even a few entry level b gat plas but this is pretty good, wish it had 50 damage resist but I can’t really complain
---
I think i saw this part in neighbors 2..
---
Do that in an instance like the Wayward or the Overseer's house.
---
Honestly the ab rounds it takes I have no idea how to craft them but you can mod it to use cells I think but it makes the damage go lower so there are better energy options out there
---
Yes. something like a 50% buff to single shot weaponry (including bows!) could potentially make them a worthwhile option compared to full auto weapons.
---
It's unfortunate you have to do that at all.  Devs should have written a script that gives anyone who holds a pylon for a certain amount of time credit for the kill.  It's such an integral part of the fight.  To simplify it, they could just have a player holding a pylon do a small damage to the sheepsquatch after a certain duration of time.
---
But I'm sympathetic to the devs for not making those sorts of changes, because I get the feeling the post launch budget has been shit outside of the two content releases.
---
But then we need a pidgeotto... because his only use was blowing away that damned balloon.
---
Today's drops from Earle or ACP event: junkies Gauss mini (yay, but doesnt fit my build), Nocturnal Golf Club, Mutants wood RL w/ lockpocking, Mutants urban scout arm w/breathe underwater, Zealot rolling pin, Nocturnal rolling pin.
---
Does it count if it was me ? I have the betta fish lamp and I’d walk up to it and talk to him when people were in my camp , obviously a one sided conversation but I played it like he wanted me to kill them and I begged and pleaded not too
---
Outside Big Ben Tunnel where Blue Ridge Caravan were. Lots of Brahmins. Dunno if you can milk them tho 🤷
---
This has been posed exactly 1 million times. They know.
---
Yeah I don't even think you can make AB rounds. You can find like three in the TNT dome but that's about it
---
Meh. If you've picked the perfect perk cards for your builds thru leveling then no. Biggest issue is non essential perk cards/points. I had all the perk cards I needed by 150 but needed 20 levels to move perk points around
---
When I saw the wendigo's name that's the first thing that popped into my head lol
---
I got a suppressors explosive 10mm pistol today, not a terrible drop but I'm a heavy gun guy. Also ended up with a ghoul slayers radium rifle so...
---
GIVE ME PUMPKINS BETHESDA
---
I use in the AA power fist which does decent damage but  Since you are the closest the majority of the time you will draw agro so you're going to need a ton of stims
---
I miss how hard the alien blaster hit in the old games.always melted
---
Do you allow strangers to enter your home willy nilly
---
Saw a low level player (10-20) trying to get tags on the enemies during a glitched Line in the Sand. They clearly didn't have any crowd control weapons, but they *did* have mines. So they placed a few mines in the center area between waves ...and blew themselves up, while everyone was watching. (Because when the event is glitched, the whole place becomes like an amphitheater with everyone stood around the outside facing the center, lol)
---
Upvote worked for me to thanks alot
---
These comments are gonna be 🍿
---
I'm not going for a Bloodied build ever.  
---
Without going on for too long:  
---
I'm no fan of gear that requires the player be gimped to have an effect or otherwise it's useless.  
---
I'm slightly disabled in my hands and they go wonky at times. I don't group for many reasons but also b/c I don't want my affected skills to hamper others.  
---
I am keeping both and the char has the Unyielding one on. It replaced a level 40 Last Bastion that I've had forever.
---
Be careful all the bloody warriors are going to come for your head now
---
If your using a explosive weapon swap it during events.even splash damage hitting can trigger pvp.thats the only time this happens to me really
---
It'd be a bit too overpowered/cheesy if they all dropped full charge cores. But I suppose partially charged ones might work.
---
I concur seeing as how I'm camped on an acid node just south of it lol :(
---
You are using rejuvenated perk, right?
---
I'm sorry to hear about your meat...give grahm better meat!
---
Unfortunately the legendary mechanics often punish team players.  In uranium fever i can’t sit and take care of an extractor because I won’t get as much of chance at the legendaries.  Nobody wants to mop up all the random scorched at SBQ because then you might not get enough hits in on the queen.
---
Do guys use Instagram ?
---
Difficult to explain,  would have to see it in person.
---
I'm trying to figure out which backpack mod is best. 
---
I have Pack Rat, Bandolier, Thru-Hiker, and Traveling Pharmacy all maxed out. I have the first three equipped. Chemist backpack mod. That mod reduces Chem weight by 90%.
---
A mix of armor pieces have the following weight reductions:  
---
20% less ammo weight. The SS Underarmor with Shielded lining really helps.
---
Food, drink and chems weight 20% less.
---
I rocked the last bastion till I hit level 100.that extra 5 points really help.at the end of the day yeah have fun.sorry about your hands I'm getting a tad older and my hands go numb almost feels like I have rubber bands wrapped around my wrists and it doesnt hurt just very uncomfortable
---
Thank you, you gave me a good laugh, I really needed that 😊
---
I have starched but i only have it equipped when I need to cure rads.
---
TBH I think the volume of ammo drops still needs a rework regardless. 308 and 2mm rounds drop below 10, cos they're considered rifle rounds, but this makes the LMG useless as well as the brand new Gauss Mini. Where as 5mm rounds drop 100+ cos of the minigun despite also having a slow fire rate weapon (Gatling gun) in the same ammo category.
---
(***You have to aim at the head.***) I just figured that out today. Aiming at the feet/ legs does result in many missed hits. Sneak damage is most impactful, so I run Sneak, Ninja, and escape artist during this fight. I use unarmed and I’m Bloodied but I do like 1200 or something per hit not including criticals. (The only consumable I use is cooked meat with carnivore mutation, usually a 25% Melee buff).  
---
When not sneaking, it’s more like 300/hit. When I’m made to run off screaming, I use this time to reset my sneak from Danger to Caution. 
---
Possible Spoilers:
---
On another note for the OP, take time to smell the wendigos! Unless you fear not completing the event, kill and loot those wendigos! Feel free to shoot them, because you currently get a disproportional amount of ammo from them with whatever weapon you use to kill (I use this to farm fuel), and of course the screws and the other junk. 
---
Also, you’re going to feel pressured to ESCAPE THE MINE when the boss goes down. While there is a loot chest at the end with assorted weapons/junk/caps, you will still get the event rewards and wont lose any junk by not escaping. The mine will collapse but it just kicks you out. Be careful of dying after the boss goes down though because, while you won’t lose your junk, you will be kicked from the mine and not be able to loot anything, including the boss. Once out, make sure to get out of the blast zone. While you don’t get as much flux, it will disappear like it does when dying after completing scorched earth and sometimes (this happened to me today) your loot bag will disappear altogether (could have been another player but it didn’t notify me and never gave me a way point to get my dropped loot). 
---
One other small detail, If you die and the boss goes down while you’re respawning, you may find yourself stuck at the top of the shaft as it becomes blocked when he dies. If you sprint, you can find your way down to fighting floor by using the “escape” route provided to exit the mine. It’s fairly linear and shouldn’t be too hard to figure out, but hurry as you’ll be on a countdown to escape and it could take some time to find where the boss went down. Being able to verbally communicate with teammates will help in this process.
---
Hmm you could pick up a mutation you dont want.
---
Lol. les gendary
---
Follow him around some time when you find him in the wild , that dude does all sorts of crazy shit
---
Lol sadly just back to whitsprings lol there is one little plot of land that Frits ( raider that’s walking around ) normally hangs out at I allways move around but I keep going back to this same plot. Guess it’s ment to be ya
---
Still viable until the next big update nerfs damage
---
I think you could get a couple  Thousand. Because if nothing else they're fun to play with.
---
I'm level 500 something on my main, over 3000 hours into the game and have no idea. Is it a real perk?
---
Didn't have to, the bot exploded killing him and the bug got him so he couldn't respawn
---
Am I wrong in recalling that the math change was the start of their changes? If so, doesn’t that mean they will likely buff these weapons?
---
Alot of people rock b unarmed. Seen a few move to heavy weapons. Wastlanders brought in some good heavies
---
I mainly use the stealth armor so it’s pretty unlikely. I’m working on getting all the serum recipes that I use than I’ll prolly start collecting primo armor pieces. But till then max rad protection for me and I buy serums to stockpile
---
Its a 1/3 chance of stimpak/radaway or Sstimpk. If you’re worried about that maybe just kill the baby wendigoes.
---
Why would they fix it when they can get two years of loyal service and Atom sales "through thick and thin" without needing to pay to fix their product? Your mistake is *assuming* it is broken. This money/printing machine is working as intended.
---
They should make treasury notes appear on the collection tab
---
Yes Field Surgeon is a Perk, im curious on how the Perk works
---
Hey, I've been to The Big Pharma. I camp at the water/coal station down the tracks. Can confirm, I have loaded into a nuke zone with a destroyed camp.
---
Yes, but then I perpetually feel awkward.
---
Found out what magic weapons were realized i had one explains why i can kill a level 80 scorch beast in legit 3 seconds of direct fire to the head if not less
---
Another easy fix to what you're saying is to make the drop rate of full cores lower than the current ammo drop rate
---
What weapon is that?
---
Not the case. Visuals are loaded after but the physics (boundaries) are loaded instantly.
---
Huh? I don't see how this is relevant regarding changing unwanted random ammo drops to more aid items instead.
---
And that player's name? Albert Fucking Einstein. That definitely happened.
---
Mothman butt fucked me at some nuclear waste storage site and I’m still scared to go back for my junk loot
---
&gt;They glitch the game on console,
---
The game already sucks on consoles. Completely unoptimized.
---
Why so specific? Let us plant *everything* in our CAMPs - might make for some more varied gardens, at least. Never understood why there's this arbitrary restriction on some of the stuff, while others are perfectly okay.
---
&gt;Cheaters.
---
Or maybe someone sold it them through the trade system in this game?
---
It's kinda rare.  I buy them if anyone sells them cheap.
---
Melee is awesome now, going to suck patch 22. Bloodied/Junkies us only viable builds in 22 with high volume damage (auto riles/heavy weapons). Or get a magic weapon and build doesn't matter.
---
Tasty Squirrel Stew (2 squirrel bits, 2 tatos, and 1 or 2 salt) gives you 20% bonus experience for an hour (25% if you have Carnivore mutation), 1 cooked Scorchbeaast brain gives you bonus Intelligence, Building Team give you bonus Intelligence, and get Well Rested. 
---
This process doesn’t take too long once you get used to it (Scorchbeast brain being the most tedious and optional) and then just server hop Wes Tek over and over. You should level up twice within that Tasty Squirrel hour. 🐿🍜🧠
---
Got that drop from uranium fever for...
---
Nice going mate
---
Then why am I constantly getting stuck inside foundations and walls when I spawn at other people's camps? Why can I run through into someone's base where a wall spawns right where I ran through just before?
---
They are. You can get good cap sales for the masked and you csn get decent weapons for the BOS jumpsuit
---
They may have accidentally hit the block button and that’s why it’s saying that. It happened with me and my brother. Tell your friend to check if they have you guys block on accident in the game social menu
---
Anything that uses a broadsider. You’ll be the only 76er in all of Appalachia to use one. Every cannonball we drop will be yours.
---
Friend requests are usually invisible for me but today, I saw one when I needed to trade someone and they didn't tell me their name yet. I opened up the friends list with ctrl+tab when I got that notification and their name was different from the others. I think it had a little circle next to it?
---
My older friend requests were still invisible though. They pop up on my list once in a while.
---
I guess, sure
---
Played it 6-7 times.  First time I died near the end and could not get back before it ended.  Last time my client crashed about half way through. The other times it was a fun run.
---
Yup. Wait 30 sec...
---
Tasty gives you 10, 20 with carnivore, 25 with carnivore and strange in numbers
---
never spent a dollar on the game besides buying it
---
Bloodied gauss mini gun
---
Lol oops
---
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but what’s a magic weapon?
---
Very nice, thank you for answering 👍🏼
---
Aint it dark???  Wrapped up in that tarp
---
Then what have they lost here, exactly?
---
I mean.. if you are gonna stick around for every bad decision and every unfixed bug for two years, it's no wonder they aren't bothering to fix it 🤷‍♂️
---
Np. Willing to trade for anything? Lol
---
I typically go to my room upstairs, or go outside and stand at the side of my house. In both case, I awkwardly watch them. As soon as they buy something, I pop up and give them a thumbs up.
---
the mothman thanks you for your orificial contribution
---
Base geography is loaded instantly, player and entity information is loaded second, boundary and interaction comes third with visual and skin's last
---
I am willing to trade lol :)
---
Tried my TSE Gatling and noticed almost no difference,. Everything explodes and tryna to chunks like normal. Haven't tried my handmades but semi auto is dead in PTS unless you are bloodied/junkies.
---
We all would
---
I think it might be dependent on the person who did the event. I use to do Poseidon a lot and I’ve never seen it go offline.
---
My strat is to use the legendary stat on one I am already high in, like say I run 15 in strength: have legendary strength for 3 and move three out of the 15 in strength instead, so I have three extra stats to move around in other stats for future considerations. Instead of using the legendary stat in one I am low in
---
I had a TBI and back injury while I was in.  
---
There's no fix for either. The TBI can be managed and the only problem I have are on average 3 migraines every month. I'll have them until I die unless one of them kills me.  
---
The back is in the lower part; the L4 and L5. The only fix for that is spinal surgery and NO ONE is rooting around in there. I want ZERO chance of becoming paralyzed.  
---
Enough of that. I've learned how my gaming skills and hands have become altered since then. I can drive just fine. I've found the playstyle that works for me.  
---
If I'm solo but find an Event or something I Sneak so my Chameleon effect kicks in and I have my two highest DPS ranged weapons ready.
---
More Solo-focused perk cards:  
---
**The Lone Ranger:** 
---
You take 5% less damage when you're not in a group.
---
Yes, one player was.
---
It was so bad, I could swear my fps dropped below 5.
---
Once the frames dropped, everything was pixalated.
---
Got to wonder if I'm stressing my xbox out when these situations occur.
---
I could care not less about fertilizer, not hard to get.  The Coop giving eggs would have been brilliant.
---
I was thinking a type of macro too for swapping weapons that also changes out perks automatically, like going from melee to heavy guns in a hybrid unarmed heavy guns build
---
I got 3 kills tonight. I think you might have just had a bad run.
---
This is the right answer.
---
Yeah, my inputs were severely affected by the tesla as well. For instance, when I'm trying to loot the piles, I somehow exit out my PA.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I think it's more likely a reference to the British "Keep Calm and Carry On" signs of WWII.
---
Where is the loot trunk at the end? Ive only done the event twice but I haven't found this trunk.
---
&gt;Tony Stark has not figured out how to wear his backpack under his armors and he is a playboy, billionaire, 
---
Considering Tony once put his armor inside his fucking [BONE MARROW](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7d0d42df0f13aae439b1e25a12e51364.webp)
---
Kendrick Lamar shit right there.
---
GG
---
It's possible to do the entire thing single-handed, so as long as you're not hogging the legendary kills I don't think it's a big deal to run around. (I've done it by myself with just a pistol and I'm a very casual player.)
---
3000 hrs! How have you found the patience to reach that amount of hours?
---
So far, I think I crossed 600 hours and it feels like I lost a decade of my life! 😂😂😂
---
Can you build at that tree? :L Yeah I think the photo is hard to tell I may have to make a new one lol :( Thanks haven't seen that one either
---
Great. Thank you for the info.
---
I have a legendary broadsider with the lightweight effect.
---
Lightweight + light barrel mod make it weigh zero. Whenever I get a cannonball I fire it into the air.
---
Bookmark this in a Fallout 76 folder and use it frequently.

---
If you craft everything from blood packs the chemist perk goes great. 2 blood packs = 4 stimpaks = 16 diluted. It gives you 4 times the stimpaks
---
I figured it would be a little morbid for some
---
Backpacks are based on what you need in that moment. Now that I know the faction backpacks are 90% reduced weight, they don't stack with cards either. You're gonna have to decide on what reduction you want to focus on because you can't free up multiple things at once. If you use junk as extra armor then go with pack rat but that perk is very subjective on its uses if you carry a lot of junk on you a lot or not.
---
In what way?
---
who got da loot?
---
And with perks
---
Too bad you can’t make cannonballs weigh zero
---
with one wasteland this should not be a problem anymore. It just works then.
---
We are whalers on the moon
---
We carry a harpoon!
---
But the there are no whales so we tell tall tales
---
And  sing our  whaling tune!
---
Yea, especially if you're in your bed sleeping naked and they pop in and say do the Hi emote. No one else? Okay.
---
These types don't understand the concept of other people
---
I noticed that there are people that come and drop nice goodies for me in my camp. There was one guy who threw a frag grenade and left though. &gt;.&lt;
---
I never kill anyone's cows just those random out in the world lol. Don't you get a bounty if you kill someone's?
---
As a bloodied build I always use it at encryptid and now ACP. It seems to speed up or have less lag for my stim spamming needs. This is definitely more feel than scientific though 😂
---
Those mutations would make the griefers more unbearable. All I need is some prepubescent,19 year old boy who bought magical weapons with his mum's debit card to scream at me like a wendigo, lol. I mean I love wendigos being a skinny guy myself, but not that kind of wendigo! We need an anti-griefer perk: if you are in pacifist mode and someone attacks you and you don't attack back, after repeated attacking the dmg exponentially increases in a burst suddently and they effectively oneshot themselves. Call it, *I am rubber* short for *you are glue, whatever you say to me bounces (attacks) back to you* - which could be added to its description. . .
---
Earl's gotta die.
---
On consuls there's nothing like that though. On pc yes they have hacked weapons. The worst we have are quantam paddle balls. The most lag causing guns we have explosive plasmas.
---
You’ve seen kid in a fridge... now get ready for: BODY in the POTTY
---
Man the amount of times I find like 20 harpoons and cannonballs in my inventory after this as I just grab everything from the wendigos quick
---
🤣
---
And yet I can rarely find anyone who knows how to do this quest
---
Well that was exactly my point. I just heard some people found a work around even with a pacifist mode. Luckily I've never encountered this myself but I guess it's possible with all the hacking and glitching.
---
I have a army where it’s silver shrouds on sheepsquatch vs crocodile and the wizard on the large plushy
---
For real?
---
If Nocturnal weapons ever got a buff/rework I’d suggest a mutation called “Night Owl.” You’d get 15% damage boost at night but a 15% reduction during the day plus a little symbol (like a moon) on the interface indicating when night has fallen.
---
This is why I run reduced weapon weight on all 5 of my armor pieces. Miniguns, gatling lasers and LMGs are 2lbs, rifles are less than 1lbs. It does bite me in the ass sometimes in nuke zones though.
---
My friend and I lock our personal rooms in our camps to use as a drop off area for each other. If one of us needs something and we're to lazy to tp to the other, we just drop it off in the locked room since only we can access them.
---
If I could find bulk blood packs I would i only ever have 1 or 2
---
Faction backpacks?  
---
I don't like to carry a lot of junk unless I"m going on a Junk run. I do tend to carry a lot of food, drink, and chems but now that this one has the Herbivore mutation not so much. I still sell whatever meat stuff I pick up that provides no benefits.
---
Increases the heal rate by 66%. So it takes less time for the full effects to work.
---
Stimpaks and radaways don't apply their full recovery amount instantly but over time. With stimpaks this us even more noticeable because the first part is quick but the second part is a slow trickle of healing. The perk reduces the amount of time it takes to receive the full amount of healing or rad removal. It could potentially mean you dont have to use as many stimpaks when trying to survive high sustained damage.
---
I lock some doors to stop people from leaving them open. (Mostly irrelevant doors anyway just for looks) but I also lock certain doors to stop allies escaping, may also block them. But other than that, I used to lock my door because of the sheer fear of being raided...(thinking that was a thing) when I first played before I had a long break when the game first came out, had a really high level player level my whole base like he was stealing everything so after that I always thought, damn son let’s lock up the whole building lol... would be nice for them to add a info box explaining no one can steal your stuff.
---
Chemist and the aid backpack are faction plans from the Raiders and settlers
---
I think it's time to pick your flair for this group now. Tap the three dots and make it official
---
Crazy I was just thinking this today! Upvote this post! I had an idea for cursed perks, given the novel cursed legendary prefix. Except it would be a limited time perk system for October, and each week the perks become more ghastly or sinister. For examp, Monkey's Paw. Monkey's Paw grants unlimited ammo at greatly reduced durability. Or run a model of some sort of epidemic, like an aoe virus that grants a permanent disease. Make ppl really avoid each other, lol... That'd be insane, but maybe leave that for the last week of October when all hell breaks loose.
---
Because if they give us nicer bathroom stuff, they will have a hard time explaining why the settler wanderer is still dirty.
---
Honestly: Having 'Motherlode' drill ahole through the mine - drill under 'Earle' and heavily damage him (Them? 3 heads, soooo...?) would've been 50× better than needlessly launching a nuke. 
---
Canon/lore-wise: Wouldn't this fuck up the entire region (All the way north towards the Capital Wasteland/Piss off the entire Brotherhood of Steel [When they reach Appalachia? Would LOVE to see some dialogue reflecting nuke lanches/where they hit - if they'll comment on Mutations, than surely they'll comment on nuke launches]) 
---
Regardless just launching a nuke to find some woman's missing dead father is an extreme waste. I mean shit, let us use Dynamite or C-4 or even a damn Pickaxe.  Is Appalachia really worth one measly Windego?
---
I would rather they fix the bugs and glitches first that have gotten back into the game first.
---
Sweet, I can move my tent somewhere better! I have it at Crater since I do the Former Raider quest for easy caps
---
The same as when you left, bloody unyielding, will also still be the most powerful build even after nerf.
---
Dyslexicia read that as porn ceiling and just thought of vaultmeat wallpapers etc
---
Add me on discord JerryKiller#7825

Blood Splatter Tattoos please
---
Must be the first post were the respawn bug is appreciated
---
I...didn't post a pic?
---
At least, not intentionally.  It's not showing any images for me, just the link to my imgur gallery.
---
That's really interesting!
---
I'd like to see different map areas, like Charleston or Watoga. I'm tired of dropping the same spots
---
I'm not a little bitch, I stand by my mistakes
---
And silt beans.
---
That awesome. Pay it forward when you can :)
---
Or I should beable to drop them
---
I think you mean trap camps. Tramp camps are owned by hobos who dont care how bad their camps look, chuck a vendor in the middle of nowhere, stash box over there, yeah I'm done, lol.
---
It would be kind of cool as a more tame trade off that doesn't require 5 points in luck to sustain!
---
I got one in Fallout 4 once, the two I have on display I merely found in shops for 250 caps. I have them on display in my restaurant/shop section of my CAMP
---
Until you leave the server ive had Poseidon powered up for 12+ hours just coming back every now and then to make sure im not kicked
---
I bet if we ask Lou we could save some Nuke cards
---
Some idiots cryed to bethesda, that other players trapped them by using this mat. Because of this sissyes we lost so much opportunities in game.
---
Kudos, great bait
---
I nominate you for Governor of West Virginia sir.. heres your upvote.
---
I like where you're going, but I feel like lone wanderer is just like that. Maybe something like
---
Lonesome travels: when not in a group, food and drink lower at decreased rates
---
That fucker scared the SHIT out of me when I was a lvl 10. Now I one shot him haha. Good times.
---
Yep that’s what I meant, trap camps. I guess it’s pretty apparent I was still angry when I started writing the post.
---
Yeah though i've seen a level 30 on pc that killed a sheepsquatch alone(lv 50, 2star), he dealt with the mob in about 10-15 min, but didn't die once.
---
Love it!
---
All regions in the game have a pool of rare outfits that can only be obtained as very low percent chance drops from quests and events specific to the region (with some exceptions, like the Whitespring jumpsuit and the Western outfits). The chance to earn the drop is something like 0.04%, so it's stupidly unlikely. Usually if you do get the drop you only get 1 item from the pool, but for whatever reason the Savage Divide gives you all of the items in the pool, which are the BOS Jumpsuit, Whitespring Jumpsuit, White Powder Jumpsuit, Forest Scout Armor Mask and Urban Scout Armor Mask.
---
Don't sell any of them for caps, they're too valuable, with the exception of the Whitespring Jumpsuit which I'd say is worth around 20K, at least on PC. You can trade them for pretty much any legendary weapon you want, aside from legacies or the high demand stuff like B2525 Fixers/Handmades, but even those might be attainable if you find the right person to trade with. Or, just keep them, and know that you have some of the rarest items in the game in your collection.
---
And with SPECIAL points.
---
...than nobody will have need to play again to try a new build... Horrors, oh horrors!
---
I really wish... you wouldn't double post, lol.
---
😱
---
Not at all. Certain armor attributes (reduced damage while blocking) and ffr attributes on some legendaries  (stalker's LMG + ffr) are glitched and do crazy damage. It's a bug a lot of people are exploiting. PTS damage nerf has no impact on these weapons.
---
Gotcha.  
---
The Grocer one is from the Settlers right? Seeing as how I don't need to carry as much food anymore with that mutation I might save some gold.
---
Just try all your ffr heavy guns and see if one is crazy good for no apparent reason.
---
Trap camps has right to be in game. It's always pretty obvious, if there is something wrong with this camp. Just pay attention. As for me - this is the part of the game. Guys like you already made your role to bethesda, they nefred almost all ways to PvP, traps or else in game. After all of this - don't blame developers, that they made "non Fallout game", but something like 'Happy Farm"
---
So from what I've seen on other posts of this, this is caused by wall decorations. Its a dumb bug, but now-a-days I find moving and building a new camp is the only thing that I get excited about anymore. 
---
Try to store all wall decorations or anything that is supported by a wall like a light.
---
You know a shovel always spawns near the tree at the burial event.. that said, I too carry my 3 star reduced weight combat shovel. I love the bonk noise.
---
I run into the vengeful mothman quite often, I had to do a side quest that involved going to a cultist camp and I just so happened to show up at night. I got about halfway inside the camp when outta nowhere he attacked me from behind
---
thanks man I really needed help and I got it rather quick then I thought I would.
---
I got my camp on a lead and junk pile and I don't think I'll ever move.
---
Though the physical copies are registered to a certain account are they not?
---
Thanks for tips! Learned couple new things, much appreciated
---
Nope. 
---
When you have a disc you can play it and if you dont like it just sell it. Not tied to your account
---
I like seeing them there because they might buy something, I even put a little extra tent up for them to sleep in if they want.
---
Though I also keep an eye out to see if they're tricky little thieves after my water
---
Yup. Consistaht 600 DMG is doable, but that's not the case with me. Eventually BGS will do something, I hope, but not anytime soon.
---
Heh. Ive burned 5k 5mm rounds on sbq and don't get any credit. I've stopped fighting her, just run around and make satellite grenades.
---
Look up bloodied heavy build, that’ll get you started lol
---
Hey man is my gt showing up at the top of my comments or does it say dclemm? It is supposed to be my gt but is still showing dclemm on mine
---
Philanthropist
---
Yeah this is the exact reason. People were making huge death traps, like legit no chance of getting out at all. The mats used to teleport you right into the middle of this chaos and unsuspectingly you’d lose all your junk due to it being new. Instead of them making it for outside travel (can only use outside and not inside buildings) which most of the community asked for, they just completely removed it from the game. I’m certain the outside idea wouldn’t of been great but if they perfected it and found a way to make it possible without people using it to grief, it would of been 100x better than this base spawning that we have now.
---
The Mothman is a hoax... Its just a dude in a costume, specifically... Jeff Goldblum... The Mothman is Jeff Goldblum... youve been enlightened.
---
[Girl in a chally costume teabagging while spinning in place while reloading her black powder rifle.](https://twitter.com/fairy_vari/status/1299433049457856512?s=19) Was funny as hell and I joined the buffoonery with everyone else 😂
---
How about Ghoul Hands where your melee and unarmed range is extended to an absurd and stupid degree?
---
Just remember, it's their base, no one else's, and they and you can build your base anyway you wish. When you enter someone else's camp, you're in their neighbourhood. They didn't ask or force you to come visit. 
---
The devs put those items into the game, for reasons, and people will put them to use.
---
Same with people complaining about their camps and workshops getting nuked by other players.
---
Thats the nature of the game, it's multilayer, these are the tools at our disposal, which means others will do things that affect your game, good or bad, directly or indirectly. Don't hate the player.
---
bloody schmuddy but why would you give up 36 extra special points by going *yielding*
---
Whats the con?
---
its at the entrance to the mine when you walk inside on the left, 
---
its a closed door that cannot be opened, the wall with the door "collapses" once you kill earl, but the rewards inside are basicly ballistic fiber and a few ither junkitems
---
This is incorrect. Your character physics are loaded in much before the base boundaries are loaded. There’s been many cases of people running and trading peoples vendors which glitches out the game and lets people but shit for free (recently patched) but test it yourself. Load up someone’s base and just run and dive in the direction it’s loading, you’ll spawn inside the base and possibly stuck inside walls/floors etc. Kinda sucks really
---
The grenades are pretty skill dependent though. I only play solo and it's a necessary tool to get 2-4 killed in one action.
---
There are data-mined maps of these locations I believe. I don't know why they won't release them.
---
..and who not going to make you pay?   Chally!
---
Bloodied... just bloodied
---
It's not up to me dawg, sometimes reddit just be trippin, didn't even know it got double posted till you said so.
---
But doesn't it add damage to your ranged attacks as well?
---
I’ll duo it with you anytime this weekend. Lockedterror145 I’m bloodied commando.
---
Most awkward for me is, when im building something and they are standing there and watching me. 🙈
---
It is supposed to but after they nerfed the effect there is no visual difference in my testing.
---
The typical stuff, I guess. Reduced ranged weapon accuracy/damage, a hit to Intelligence, eating non-irradiated food is less effective.
---
Wut
---
I'm talking about people that use v.a.t.s. on grenades. That's about the only time they will shoot their guns is when they use v.a.t.s. I'll run up on a team of 3 or 4 while running solo then get 2 or 3 red grenade indicators almost every match. It would be skillful for them to shoot the grenades without v.a.t.s. It has gotten really bad on xbox. Then while being shot at with the gauss my game will freeze long enough to already be dead by the time I unfreeze.
---
You forgot the part where it take up 99% of the build budget too
---
I cannot speak, asshole. It's broken. Period.
---
No, no! it's even more stupid than that.  
---
You use a nuke to open a mine in order to find out what happened to the father. You don't even know there was a monster inside the place until AFTER you've nuked the area.  
---
I love the boss fight, I hate the justification for the nuke.
---
Not many do unfortunately
---
Think he means not using VATS is finally viable and capable of actual damage again.
---
Just "The Chicks" now, in case anyone is interested in what they are ip to these days
---
Was doing what Chameleons do on the top of Flatwoods Red Rocket. Taking a coffee break IRL and watched the group of gouls that hang around Flatwoods chase a level 5 down the road and off into the distance.... he was still wearing the partyhat and wielding a rollingpin.
---
? Where’s it say that?
---
I drop my extras in Murmrgh's cash register, and I check it every time I stop by just in case someone else did the same.
---
I think I only got 1 in the entire time I played Fallout 4, which was a considerable amount of time. 
---
I've only been playing Fo76 since earlier this year, and I've won 4.
---
I need to hang around flatwoods more often, I miss newbie antics
---
I wouldn't want to ruin someone else's *joy* of naturally getting legendaries
---
Well, I figured you didn't know so I thought I let you know and I didn't want to sound like an asshole so I added lol on the end. All good bro.
---
I agree. Some plants are hard to find and it would be nice to make a garden. I would love to plant some sootflower and rhododendrons around my house. I've only seen ginsing twice and never in the wild (garden shop and Project Paradise). Maybe there is some in-game reason they can't be cultivated, but I can't think of one.
---
It’s time. Your full initiation into the faith must now be recognized! 
---
Bow before the everlasting benevolent divinity that is the reality mentoring spirit of the Moth!!
---
❤ thought you were being an ass, thx for letting me know, was wandering why people's comments kept disappearing, turns out they were on the other post.
---
Lone wanderer has worked on teams for a while now
---
That is why i have a c.shotty with enforcer perk maxed so i can cripple anything and let the lower level players go nuts on a 3 star legendary.they love it.lol.
---
Definitely, I don't know if they made damage changes to the guass weapons since their release, but they are easily one of strongest weapons in the game. Makes ACP and SBQ look like a normal event.
---
Lol. A straight up religious experience haha
---
Oh its so fun, I do it when I go AFK.. I put on a Fauschnaught Jester Mask and a Clown Outfit and AFK on top of roofs or around well traveled corners... Lowbies turn the corner, stop, then slowly back away untill im out of view.... best screensaver ever
---
They gave the Blaster a 30% increase, but that should definitely have been at least 300%.
---
I feel the same way when. I visit one and the owner is home
---
(PS4) i tried every solution i read on here and none of them worked for me.  but i did eventually get it to work after 
---
1. restarting the game multiple times. 
---
2.deactivating the quest from my pip-boy then reactivating.  
---
3. (this might not actually be anything but)  i stood in front of the terminal for a few minutes and didnt touch it)
---
4. analyze the blood sample BEFORE entering the T-fuse. 
---
5. bonus step. i noticed alot of people saying that if the doors in the hospital are open that it wont work, well they were closed for me when it did eventually work so that might also help. 
---
 i know this might not help everyone but dont get frustrated with bethesdas features, be patient, it will work eventually with enough persistence and restarts. good luck!
---
It hasn't changed
---
Totally agree. Unarmed user here. I kill just as many wendigos as anyone else, and it’d be nice to be rewarded with actual useable items.
---
Even after the nerf. All builds are affected proportionately.
---
Your name shows dclemm78
---
To the best of my recollection, once you've obtained an addiction, it's permanent unless you take Addictol.
---
***Mothman has left the chat***
---
Are the dev team going to fix the fucking fast travel bug yet? It's been 2 fucking years. Pure incompetence.
---
Its like in real life. They last for as long as you don't do anything about it. You get rid of them only by addictol as far i know.
---
I usually end up clearing out the hordes of scorched. Im a melee build: i wait for the queen to land and unload a bunch of VATS shots with a furious super sledge. Havn't had a problem with getting kill credit.
---
What platform are you on
---
How about remind them to fix the fast travel bug that's been around for almost 2 years? Start with that.
---
Ok thank you
---
I have also thought this and totally appreciate and love hearing people’s rationale for locking things :)
---
i will be less anger when i need 2 scrap at a locked camp &amp; more “ok they don’t want allies or ppl opening doors &amp; everybody plays this game differently (and they can!) which is why I enjoy this game &amp; I respect that”
---
Yes, permanent addictions until you take something to remove it e.g. Addictol, Radscorpion omelette etc.
---
Now if only Vault 76 was a free fast travel point and actually had more stuff to do than buy bullion plans.
---
The poison effect works better against players than most other enemies. Unless of course they have one poison resist piece. I think there are a few different skins that cause issues with the rad resistance. I've seen a few different posts about it.
---
an anti-robot protest march with players handing out protest signs during fastnacht parade :)
---
It’s gonna take some getting used to the build, did the bloodied sniper/commando as my first build when the game started, definitely like the heavy build since I literally have a multitude of guns on me thanks to bear arms now I’m just working on which power armour to use that can put match my unyielding ss armour
---
Where did you come across the worshipers? I've been to the city but everything is always empty; the chapel, the shrine, etc. I want to become one with the mothman!
---
When I did SBQ, I focused the trash mobs because the xp was worth more to me than whatever garbage the queen usually droped anyway. Always got the tags/kills on the legendary mobs that showed up and it helps keep everyone alive in most cases too. 
---
Haven't played in a good while now though.
---
Get out their PA totally nude in my garage, sees me &amp; then quickly gets back into their PA &amp; then fast travel away.
---
This is cool except you have to walk up and wait every time right? I put them a few feet back so I can just run through.
---
You just need to do 1000 dmg, everything does 1 damage minimum, so you should only need 1000 rounds if you hit all shots.
---
It still begs the question of why not change the damage effect if most mobs are resistant to it in the first place and by next patch most players will be too. I wish it had a similar effect to bleed on a knife because it does noticeable amounts of damage but doesn’t kill super quick. About the skins I’ll have to look into that. Do you have a reference post by chance?
---
Liquor's all free at my CAMP, take a sip from the punch bowl! 
---
*side effects of punch bowl use include waking up in strange places
---
I completely agree with this. One wasteland will end up being the thing that really ends my enjoyment of this game.
---
Mothman gang!!
---
Vault 79? I agree, I just stock up bullion and go on spending sprees
---
I'd be down if they just Vault 94'd the whole thing. Fallout has always had the gun play of a 2001 indie game made by developers who can only use "if scripts"...
---
I don't know what Bethesda was thinking by adding a BR mode...I mean shit it says a lot about your BR if the two most popular ways of playing it are hide in bushes all game or jump 10ft in the air while lobbing explosives...
---
Not to mention that Warzone anti-cheat they got...
---
They could have given us a Camp Battle Mode where both teams get 5 mins to build a base to protect a generator or something. (Obviously Atom Shop shit disabled) That would have been so much better than another hastily developed BR...
---
It's impossible to trade it without cheating
---
this is cool \^\^ i like...
---
Here you go  [https://imgur.com/a/p4HBjOa](https://imgur.com/a/p4HBjOa)
---
Until we get legendary rolled PA nothing will match modular armor. T-65 has the best DR tho out of the PA currently available.
---
I put a door on mine but don't lock it.. The idea is fusion generator to me feels a lil dangerous or radioactive... So I put mine somewhere in the corner of my camp away from the main building.
---
Just know the SBQ is pretty much immune to explosives. Better to find a magic minigun.
---
Thank you.
---
What do you think is on pepperoni pizza?
---
Yea I’m just grinding the gold to put the mods in it definitely nice damage resistance in it
---
Blame Bethesda for fucking up every single patch every single time.
---
They do need to interact more, I agree.
---
It's  been almost a month and I'm still stuck on the main quest :(
---
In public servers, it’s very laggy.  In a private server, it behaves like a bonus Tesla Coil chest mod.  Not a lot of damage, but it will kill a radroach in a few seconds.  If I had to guess, it would probably take 2-3 minutes to kill a lvl 68 ghoul on its own.
---
The damage upon shooting an enemy is roughly the same.  A minor DoT effect.
---
Given that T-65 offers very little benefit versus a suit of T-51 or X-01, Strangler Heart is still the better option.
---
Yeah no problem. If you eat anything that causes you to slowly heal it can also cause the issue.
---
BE mini wouldn't be my first choice. Ouch on the ammo front. Queenie is immune to explosive.
---
Typical heavy queen build is PA with emergency protocols, blocker, max heavy gunner, stabilized, adrenaline, nerd rage, bloody mess, adrenal reaction mutation with a primed bloodied weapon and psychotats. Add magazine or bobblehead to taste.
---
If you are in a team that will stimpak each other I highly recommend revenant.
---
I don't know if Ballistic Bock or High Voltage hefe are working ATM.
---
Interesting. That still feels like a real piss poor effect for the set which sucks. Atleast the stats are decent
---
I know the junkyard, responder, and settler paints messed with the rr. Not sure if it was on all pa's and what's been fixed though
---
I do agree the sh bounse is sadly lacking. But even pre nerf it wasn't all that great for pve. Though it was better than it is now
---
Did you google it? All the primary FO76 wiki sites give good info about how each card works.
---
So this was one of the fixes in the patch 19 notes,  **Power Armor:** The Settler Vigilante paint no longer removes Rad Resistance from T-51 Power Armor. I think it extends to other skins as well though. It seems like some of my PA does almost nothing in the ore rooms at Radiation Rumble but I haven't cared enough to test it extensively.
---
Interesting I have tried with both the default and liberty prime skin and it still doesn’t feel like I have 500 rr to protect me from stuff
---
I don't mind a cleaver trap camp, I actually get a kick out of them. It's when players sit at there camp and build a box around you and hit you with a flamer, or stick pungis all around you that I don't like
---
I noticed a huge difference between my t51b and sh sets in the rr department
---
Look with the coming update most bloodied players don't care that they can one hit endgame mobs right now, it's not the point, you can do that with a instigating shovel build and no one is calling it an "instigating nerf" or making constant posts directed to the instigating shovel gang.
---
I don't care that we can down a SBQ or Earl in seconds because in FO76 that either needs a private server where you get all the damage buffs from sneak or a miracle on public servers where no one else shows up to break those buffs. 
---
Downing raid bosses in seconds might be someones motivation but as I said then that someone will almost certainly be forced to buy FO 1st.
---
So bloodied stealth commandos are hardly ruining anyone's game experience in boss raids, they're the one dealing the brunt of the damage but it's not enough to ruin anything. SBQ &amp; Earl still take minutes to down and if you're not able to deal enough damage as a tank or something else to get loot I'm afraid it's on you. In Encryptid you can shoot the cloaked ISS to deal the damage needed to get the loot, even though the pylons aren't active.
---
OK so all that being said why do I, for example do it then? It's because players like me like to push the legit boundaries of the game (and in RPG's it's usually with numbers) to see how high or far they can go. 
---
The highest damage I've gotten with my bloodied Fixer is a bit over 650, and that still excludes Ballistic Bock because I didn't have the recipe back then. It's a ridiculously niche and useless thing for playing the game because there's so many factors you have to add in to get that damage, like Strange in Numbers, Revenant and then finding 5 enemies for Adrenaline and when Revenant fizzles out it's gone (that's 2min) -- in game that is in no way a practical thing to constantly try to achieve.
---
But for me that's the fun part of the end game, as I said earlier it's not needed for anything, and now they're going to take it away. Remember how much crying there was when the double sided walls were "fixed" from the building community? Well, they're also not really needed for anything, you can still build a CAMP with walls, but it was the fun part for them that got taken away and everyone was super pissed and I totally understand that, even though I'm not a part of that community.
---
So that's that, the reply is long enough but I just wanted to shed some light why people like high damage numbers that are ultimately useless. End rant.
---
Yeah personally my T-51b, X01, ultracite, and strangler heart all feel like they have the exact same protection even though there are decent differences in rr
---
I get where you're coming from, which is why I made this post. If they would just make some balance changes, fix the bugs, change how XP is rewarded (example being more XP for kills instead of time), and fix the hacking problems for PC. This game mode would be amazing! It's actually one of my favorite battle Royale I've played.
---
Interesting I have not noticed much of a difference at all
---
Tell the dev team to fix the fast travel bug. There is no excuse that it still exists 2 fucking years later.
---
But you have to do it after she mutates, when she mutates it resets the damage for some reason. One time I got like a quarter of the damage along with my mates(private server) then she mutates and I got maybe 40 hits and ran out of ammo since I didn’t realize my plasma cores were mostly depleted so I switched it a shotgun and just cleared out the mobs around whe only landing maybe 3 shots after that on her and when she died I didn’t get kill credit for it
---
Well just did a queen run and yea it does a little bit of damage
---
Freezing, crash tilo desktop. Yup.
---
Some of the Legendary PA perks might be worth picking up for you too when they launch.
---
After server hopping 17 times hoping for the even to start I was about to give up. I look at my phone for a quick second after getting ready to leave the server again then all of a sudden I see my character get disintegrated. I had come just in time for the event! At first I thought we were screwed since only 3 people were there (A level 200, and two level 40+) I thought “Well shit, this sucks” and then the fight began. I was being able to do the most damage using a stalkers pump action and stealth, combined with critical shots. 
---
The battle was about it halfway through when all of a sudden more people came. It was gloriously lucky as we hadn’t gotten Earle to half health at that point. They provided massive help. After the event, I wanted to thank them with the heart emote but panicked after the mine started to collapse and being chased by Wendigos. 
---
Just in case anyone asks, I didn’t launch a nuke myself because the very first time I started the event myself, I got into the fight or about 3 mins before my game crashed and I couldn’t get back into the cave when I rejoined the server. I was just not willing to waste the resources necessary.
---
You talk about low levels like they’re cute little dogs and your throwing them a chew bone
---
all the yes. i had a bunch of lower level players buying all my plans n just chillin at my camp so i decided to be a weirdo and just sorta... swing by n hang out. left em a bunch of stims. hope they're doin well.
---
Yep that’s what I was about to say.
---
So I was exploring one dude’s camp. It was a floating camp off of a cliff so I was like “woah this might be a trap” so I stashed my junk and started exploring his base. Went upstairs and opened the door and the dude was riding a mf fuzzy ride, surrounded by mr pebbles plushies with a mr pebbles poster on the wall... backed away slowly
---
I haven’t paid to much attention to the whole legendary perk card thing, I’m not even sure if the newest nerfs in damage have been applied to the live server or not yet
---
relatively new to the game (lvl 49) but recently found an underground camp in whitespring. you entered through a bass instrument, it took a few tries band I kinda had fun falling through the earth and dying before actually getting into the camp. Didn’t know it was very rare but haven’t seen one since, thx for the info
---
I don’t see them, unless their icons
---
I'd love some new scars and facepaints.
---
That would definitely help, but the gunplay is still just so bad. Even if they fixed the issues you stated I still wouldn't touch it again. If you like more power to you, but I will never understand why.
---
Damage nerf is still only on the PTS as of rn.
---
I know they spawn there but I like using my 3 star! 😅
---
The bonk is the best part!
---
The Twitch Prime drops are all time locked so it’s unlikely we’ll see it again
---
how is it the cheaters fault the devs cant code straight?
---
It’ll be interesting to see the sh*t storm it will most likely cause
---
That’s pretty messed up. Suppose you get Fallout 76 months after the time lock. You basically lose out forever on a set of Raider armor, all because you either didn’t have Twitch, or didn’t get the game in time to even know the Twitch drop had ever happened.
---
If i remember correctly the current powerhouse will still be top tier while some of the barely viable builds are getting the shaft. RIP unarmed.
---
I remember meeting him in the mire every time I went past that cult place and he wouldn't stop teleporting behind me no matter how far I went, fucker gave up when I entered Watoga and the robots were useful for once.
---
It's the last picture, character with shotgun and helmet.
---
Ah, see the tank helmet now. But what about mask?
---
Just FYI, if you are on PC, you can actually bring in body made using CBBE bodyslider into the game.
---
Admittedly, this issue isn’t exclusive to FO76. Preorder exclusives, seasons and timed events are common place in most games with an online component. FO76 has its flaws but this definitely the least of them.
---
When people visit mine, I get nervous that they're gonna destroy it or picklock it &amp; somehow bug it out, idk. I'm on Xbox &amp; have no trust for other players on the game, regardless of level.
---
..and because of the bugs, equipping the new lip shape or different eyebrows causes your character's face to disappear.
---
Seriously unarmed is getting killed by it, I loved running west tek punching mutants
---
Ha maybe I will.
---
I often heard and had this, it was always strictly visual tho, the sequence ended without any progress bar.
---
I did this on my Xbox 6 months ago and it was a game changer indeed, especially because I camp hop a lot looking for good deals, so the way shorter loading times on fast travels completely changed everything for me.
---
Ummm be careful with this if you are super op. You totally can kill her before the pylons go online. I had just gotten a bffr fixer and one shot her when she first showed up. Didn’t mean to, just wanted my damage. 
---
I’m not a dick though and I messaged the team that started it and made them follow me to a new world where I started another.
---
I had one time, where I fast travelled to the event almost immediately after it started.   And I was all alone down there.  
---
I'd look on the map and there were supposedly a whole bunch of people in the event, but I was down there alone.  
---
I fought for about 5 minutes, but definitely didn't have enough ammo or guns to drop Earl by myself.  I spent the next 15 minutes creating around toying with the wendigos figuring out how they are programmed.  
---
One thing I learned, is that it's real easy to survive once you find cover, and the the wendigos spawn as you inflict damage on Earl.
---
I got a marine balaclava, a pipe weapon and leather armor also I still wear that mask to this day and never unintentionally took it off, just to show respect.
---
Vatsing grenades onto players takes very little skill. If you just throw it sure, but vatsing them is easy.
---
Wait, there is more than one motherlode? I didn’t know that. Could I have an link to read up on it?
---
It probably did. I started the event around this time today. I activated a pylon, turned around, and the sheepsquatch was dead. I didn’t even get a shot on it.
---
Well that's nice.
---
I hate the trading system.   There are many times I would just give people something just because they aren't an asshole.  But the trading system barely ever works and isn't worth my time.
---
I think I have done it between 10-15 times, 2 fails, one time with only one mate lvl 50-70, succeed in the last ten seconds \^\^
---
&gt;You basically lose out forever on a set of Raider armor.
---
Yea. That's the point. It's exclusive.
---
Orbital strikes I think
---
Idiot waving is the best part of 76
---
Makes great sense!
---
\^ He's got a point, Y'know
---
I know the feeling.  76 was my first fallout game and I found it confusing.  I feel like I'm just finally understanding the meta and I probably still have a bunch to learn.  
---
What's your build.   
---
I've learned that it's a big mistake to try to be a jack of all trades.  You need to pick a specific build and fine tune it.   
---
It sucks throwing out really good weapons just because they don't fit your build, but that's the way the game is designed. 
---
So what is your build?   Then commit to it.
---
Wow.  Then, yeah.  I definitely had a guardian angel player or two watching my back.
---
We are all playing other Bethesda titles again like fallout 4 and Skyrim until they get their finger out their assholes and produce some worthwhile content for 76 endgamers
---
Then can I please get squirrel traps that will force them to spawn?
---
SWTOR? What’s that?
---
I'm on PS4 so I can't but thanks anyway
---
Looking for the player in the recent tab should work, but only if you have been on a server with them recently. If someone sent you a friend request by typing your name in to the add friend bar down the bottom of the social menu, then it isn't as simple. Generally I would restart the game and after logging in to the main menu I would leave it to sit for about 5 minutes, after that I would open the social menu and I could see the players who had sent me requests, click their names (they show up greyed out in the friends list) and accept their requests.
---
Thanks.
---
Please do no crowd control on this event 
---
someone might uses a vampire gun to heal himself during he holds the pylons and for that he needs the bots / crowd
---
Wtf is this thread? This isnt your onlyfans place.
---
Honestly I don’t care about the duper’s too much, at best they’re dumping guns to sell and who cares just don’t buy their guns and at worst they’re duping ammo and stigma and stuff cause thsi game has too much grinding
---
Agreed.  You see the same thing with Rockstar games.  
---
Just hollow out a building and close it off.   
---
Leaves them the freedom to either expand on the game in the future or leave it alone depending how much money they are making.
---
Why would you wanna eat trash though
---
Don’t doubt it. They’ve stolen plenty of reddit ideas before, I wouldn’t expect them to stop anytime soon.
---
They're supposed to be working on it. That's what I heard. About a year ago.
---
I set up my camp near the wayward, i get tons of people stopping by, i usually offer the gift emote and give them free stuff, then use the follow/picture emote to get them to play an instrument around my campfire for pics :) Make my loading screen really neet to have all these different characters that ive helped along their way.
---
I punch the bomb bots and give myself regrets, personally
---
What’s a magic weapon? I still can’t figure it out but it sounds like it’s a form of hacked or legacy weapon that emerged in a recent patch
---
This one, honestly, I’d like more. Cranberries are some of the most useful in the game, and yet we can’t plant them?
---
Other plant related change: remove the word wild from the blackberries. Why is that distinction necessary to make when no other plant has a wild and domestic version?
---
From what I understand its a weapon that applies a bonus such as bash damage, to your normal shots but like with the furious effects stacking system
---
I fast traveled to my camp and there was someone else there who seemed like she was afking but she had area mic on. She sounded like she was on the phone talking to someone and giving that person relationship advice. I could only hear her side of the conversation.
---
I don’t know why, but the mothman and the Flatwoods seem to spawn extremely frequently at my camp, and I don’t know why. I’m not complaining, but I think I may have angered them both.
---
Cursed pickaxe is a great weapon.  But I also have four.  If everyone is getting cursed pick axes then they will have no value on the open market.  
---
You asked the exact question I was wondering.    
---
Sounds like we shod either create a mule or scrip them.  They will probably be valuable in the future, but who can afford the stash space to sit on them for a year?
---
If you are ahead of the alien you can finish it.
---
I've not seen it personally.
---
 I don't know if this is voluntary work they do in their spare time or if they get paid. If it's voluntary then fair enough, but if it's an actual job then they need to be more responsive. Just a copy and past response to acknowledge being tagged would be something, at least you would know it had been read.
---
I know lonevaultwanderer is a youtuber so likely just a voluntary thing, valseek is i think an actual dev? but this u/ladydevann person I have No idea. 
---
I see her getting tagged a lot so I assume she's here as some sort of liaison between the dev team and the community?
---
I would share my camp, however, it is NSFW. I don't think it is a good idea to share it here...
---
Anyone run into a 3 star legendary mothman? Most I’ve seen is the one star. Curious how tough he is
---
Let me make it lore friendly, until now the secret to how to garden these plants have been lost to Appalachia. Bethesda should add recipes or gold bullion bought plots that require special ingredients to plant. 
---
The biggest reason Bethesda doesn't want us to plant the plants that dead npcs have planted? The grind, making us go hunt it means more grind, if we can grow it that means less grind, if we can grow it then we can mass-produce chems and food to sell meaning the cap grind also drops off. In other words they don't want us to have less grind because it makes us more prone to pay for or buy things that lesson the grind. Aka firsts scrap box...
---
A fix to this is simple, reduce the growth time, increase the fertilizer grenades needed to rapidly grow them. Lock behind caps, bullion, or dropped recipes. Make it so it needs more then fertilizer and the plant for first plant. Toxic water or goo for brain fungus, glowing fungus and or blight. Pure water, a special planter that sits in water for cranberries. Gunpowder for firecracker berry etc
---
I’m still pissed they took out the perks that give you bonuses for wearing a full set of armor... I was looking forward to the medium armor perk and got a full set of unyielding urban scout armor for it, then they removed it. 
---
Now ammo factory is the only one I’m looking forward to, rest is meh.
---
By the speed it's been moving, I'm guessing we have another week and a half.
---
Need new clothing, tats, makeup, scars, hair etc.
---
Shoot the cars, they show damage even when exploded already
---
Ty
---
How about a washer and dryer. Because player’s underwear is FILTHY!
---
What people often seem to not realize when criticizing low level or "bad" players is there's more ways to contribute than just dealing damage. Even being bait is useful if you're squirrely enough to last a while with aggro. In Destiny 2 I suck at the pvp so whenever I had to do matches for dailies I'd sometimes just spend my time leading better players on the enemy side on wild goose chases while the rest of my team had less pressure doing whatever the objective of the match was (or just picking people off who were chasing me lmao)
---
Calmex
---
I had to lock my doors because the ticks were somehow opening doors and making their way inside my house on my balcony where my turrets were and breaking them constantly
---
Or even make it a special quest or sowmthing? Like sowmthing happens in the world and a new vault is revealed which was a vault full of arborists and botanists and other plant related people and they can teach you the secrets of gardening and give you special plans and stuff to make them, maybe they need seeds which can only be crafted in the vault and only once in a while?
---
Hey h that’s just silly that doesn’t even sounds close to intended
---
:D
---
And pumpkins, a favorite of mine
---
I agree. No nerf. Just better gameplay because of the challenge. Most importantly : it is not boring anymore for me. I wasn't enjoying the game anymore at highlv. So I think we are better off
---
Nah, just the way the fo4 dual wield mod works doesn't really prove anything either way 
---
It's pretty limited and very jank, kudos to the modder for finding the workarounds he did though
---
It isnt thankfully but unthankfully it is here, honestly nuking everythings health in 3 seconds of insane over kill gets old fast but its my only legendary gatling laser so thats what im using
---
I think it could be a issue with camps, weird had my camp on the same place for months, the day after meat week ended when I fast travel back to my camp It traps me under one of my foundation so I can't move.
---
Wait... someone ONE SHOTED THE SHEEPSQUATCH?!?!?!?! What kind of build that can do that?!!??!!
---
Of course it's an MMO. And text chat is sorely missed - on PCs, that is.
---
100% this.
---
finished it like 10 times (8 times successfully with 1 crash and 1 time out) and barely seen anyone other than myself using shotgun
---
Comic shop? How do you farm comics?
---
I mean I've been to around 10+ instances and I've never had one where a single player one shot a sheepsquatch and died!
---
I only want to keep one but I don't know exactly how to go about selling them or trading the picks away. I'm building towards heavy weapons but mostly interested in the plasma caster, Gatling gun, and Gatling plasma.
---
"comparing pipboy damage is literally the worst test" listen I know it's a Bethesda game and we should know better than to expect basic things like the game working as intended or explaining information in a useful and correct way, but...
---
I think there’s 11 days left in it.
---
The monarch.. definitely the monarch. Thanks now I'm gonna talk the wife into watching all the seasons. Twas a great  show!
---
You can figure it out I believe in you.  
---
Hint:  KOTOR
---
And please let us have the smaller razorgrain model like the ones at Silva Homestead. I dont want huge bushes all over my camp when you have perfectly fine little ones we could plant.
---
I'm not an expert but it sounds like you need a heavy gun build.  
---
My main character is a heavy gun build and I honestly enjoy it more than my bloody build because I can take so much damage I pretty much never die.  
---
Most heavy gunner cards that I'm aware of are under the strength perk, I have like 12 strength ony heavy gunner build. 
---
Just go on YouTube and search, fo76 heavy gunner build.  They can tell you better than me how to perfect the build.
---
This is why corporeal loot, especially legendaries should be available to all who participate in the event
---
Just so you know, you can change your name and he will never find you. 
---
 I had to ghost an oversharing person who I had friended in the beginning of the game and was so relieved when I found the name change option.  I was so stressed about it I considered not playing again, and yes I did try to talk to them about the behavior but it didnt change.
---
Oh nice
---
I used a shotgunner build my first time. Died what seemed like an infinite amount of Times. So i tried my stealth commando and it worked wonders on him.
---
In my experience a (magic) shotgunner is The best by far when it comes to The spawn but against the colossus himself it did'nt do enough damage. To be fair the performance has been pretty good for me so it might change when i experience the issues you are talking about.
---
Need more starlight creeper
---
Everyone else: "here are my awful experiences with Earle"
---
Me: It Just Works™️
---
(literally the only issue I've ever had is the single time I fast traveled out. I am appreciating my luck)
---
Is the cursed pickaxe better than the shovel? The shovel seems to have better perks but the pickaxe has better damage
---
Deep pocketed limbs is now available at vault 94, you can have buttress too 😁👍
---
Ps4
---
I regularly run through my unloaded walls to get in my base quicker.
---
There is something in those inaccessible cottages outside though that are also locked with hand scanners ;)
---
Everything else was too easy anyway. Yes the performance issues are real, but it does make it challaging. Which this make you have to work as a team. He has a weak point and is vulnerable at a certain time. You just have to work it out. But, a blooded lmg is decent if you have a good build. You think it's hard now? Wait till they fix the dmg bug and nerf dmg. Lol. I know what your talking about with the dmg bug shotguns. As far as i know, i have duo killing him in under 1 minute, using the magic shotgun. Lol
---
I haven't even used the shovel because I didn't like the stats.  
---
Two handed melee weapons have such a small range it barely even worth using them.
---
What? I don’t know or recognize what that should be?
---
Nice because I'm tier 95 or 96
---
What pylons? I did not need to activate anything to kill the Sheepsquatch.
---
sounds like me when i started my new character during meat week hehe
---
Listen, I hear you, but did you consider that specifically trying to poison a robot might not work out very well
---
I mean I’d like something like that so I could go and do my farming runs easy so it’s not a one week or more grind for like 3 hours of doing quests or fun events which is like 2 hours of fun combat
---
#BASED
---
Balls cam activated
---
I'm a carnivore, would be nice to plant squirrels at my base..
---
How do you get the worshippers to not immediately attack you?
---
Just be ready to rebuild everything. The prefab buildings like the red rocket can be handy for starting a new camp.
---
Ammo factory. Shotguns shells are a pain to craft because of the plastic.
---
I had no doors but mutants and molerats kept walking in so I found the circus trailer doors work well and arent so big they mess with/interfere with stuff inside or out.
---
Hope it is not the same thing with the new colossus
---
"bear mascot heads" "chasing with a hammer" oh God they were wearing the mole mascot head. You walked in on whack a mole RP (ERP???)
---
"why does 3* legendary enemies drop 1* items?"
---
Yeah, VATS nades combines grenades with predictable travel, faster throwing speed, instakill damage levels, and an aimbot. Anyone claiming this takes skill just doesn't know what skill is 😂
---
Damn man
---
You know that you only need to be roughly lvl 40 to successfully open vault 79, right?
---
Just because YOU couldn't it does not make them cheater.
---
FPS drops are usually caused by loads of meat piles and the use of automatic Tesla.
---
We already have the enclave though... it’s like the whole reason we call whitespeings home and can launch nukes? Although some npc would be nice that aren’t MODUS
---
Earl HAS to be defeated in less than 20 minutes. Theres a timer
---
I started playing the game because it Cameo on game pass and it's a lot better then what I thought and was told. I've played all the past main games so I stuck with my long range sneaky rifleman build but it just doesn't feel as effective nor do I want to rely on stealth boys or the Chinese suit. 
---
I noticed how much more effective melee, explosive, and heavy weapons are so I tried out heavy and it's a great change of pace. I'm only lvl 70
---
Contextual ammo is literally right around the corner and partially implemented right now, give it time.
---
You sure you weren't the 9th person to show up and put in your own group?
---
If only PipBoy QOL improvements did't require field soldering and finding some way to recompile the firmware...
---
My thoughts exactly! 🤣
---
This is from crafting, which makes it worse when you get 3x 3star in a row, then get a 1star bloodied
---
So like they're planning on making changes?
---
Just do it. Im sure it would get some followers.
---
But to be fair, this is not about gender. If a guy wouldve post this exact post, the comment section would look almost the same. It would just be "fuck no's" instead of "no's" and a few "gtfo" sprinkled in.
---
Not correct. You can literally spawn outside of someone's camp and then run through the walls before they load in. It was very common in Survival Mode and still works today.
---
Still not over the time a dude walked up to me while I was selling stuff at a rail station, put on his best stoner voice, and loudly asked HEY MA'AM YOU WANT SOME MENTATS?
---
He then joined the public team I was in and got roped into a suicide pact with the other person in the team, trying and failing to get player revives
---
All while I had Lemon Demon playing as background music
---
I can’t remember where, but one of my friends set up camp somewhere where the Mothman will usually spawn way more than usual.
---
Noice! Welcome!
---
And by fix you mean find a way to complete people lost time spent playing it and then remove it right?
---
*There's a fish lamp?*
---
Weren't they implying on One Wasteland release with patch 22 in their latest ITV article?
---
Magic weapons are ones with bugged effects, here’s a video explaining it
---
https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs
---
That limb damage one is magical. Try it out on bigger things, they will vaporise with a tri or penta barrel 😉
---
When it says it's looking for another server it's a lie. I have heard you should wait 30 seconds before trying again.
---
Oh well, soon all those bloody one shot builds will be bloody useless.
---
Wait that stupid Facebook mom shit is form WWII???
---
Im intrigued, which cottages?
---
Well... in case I happen to be there, I’m on a cliff directly west of the mountainside in. It’s also rather close to Bastion park.
---
You got me
---
Internet user learns how the sausage is made
---
Yeah I wouldn’t be complaining about that one, it’ll be a beast 🤣
---
I don't discuss bloodied nerf because there is none. I discuss information spreading and upcoming frame of reference realignment
---
Do you think running a shotty build with a fancy pump (AA 50LD 50drwa) could be viable?  I generally run a Hulk smash melee major/commando backup minor in game. Haven't done CP event yet.
---
Wait, wait. *Crippling Earle does something on console?!*
---
Thanks! this may save some caps
---
They nerfed it because of complaints that it was causing a lot of lag
---
Not for long...
---
So your idea of a cheater is a Level 67 with a Plasma Caster? 
---
That's well within the bounds of possibility. Bullion can be easily earned via Low Level Public Events meaning if you rush the quest line. (I finished it around Level 30 on one character for the Raider Achievement). You can grind rep and bullion while also not levelling up a huge amount. 
---
The Plasma Caster isn't expensive haha
---
Sleeping on junk extractors? Sounds uncomfortable!
---
Bit hypocritical to brag about a collection of duped weapons then complain about bad coding.
---
True ain’t gonna lie the ending should have been better or provide a better story to it
---
The only reason I even heard of fallout was because of all the memes bashing it.  Then I was talking to a friend, he insisted I give it a chance, and gave me the game.  I've been playing ever since. 
---
My bloodied stealth sniper does more damage, but it is also very flawed in certain situations.   The heavy gun build can go anywhere and you can practically take a nap in between stimpacks.
---
Nothin there too huh
---
Did he still get the rewards?
---
It does.  Which is why everyone takes it and its never there.   There's also one that spawns just south next to a lake and that's usually gone too.
---
I just sit on the toilet when people start investigating my camp.  I get on area comms and when they come in to notice me, I'm all "Thank god!  Please tell me you've got some TP!"
---
Yup sir here are the details https://fed76.info/a/limb-damage-bug/
---
Yeah, the plan is to make it so that, at least for some creatures, the ammo you use to kill the creature is the ammo that the creature drops.
---
Stabilized and dr% for pa is worth it.
---
Hint: Do or do not. There is no try...
---
Yes. This all occurred before earl died. In the next round I died right as earl said but I spawned outside during the "escape" timer and got the rewards. Just didnt ger to loot the body :(
---
Because its my Camp and i can do whatever i want with it.
---
They finally fixed it in patch 22 on the PTS?
---
Yup, no more magic for the pts
---
I’m convinced this man is a burglar and waiting to convince people IRL.
---
I have an issue with my friend who has the game on pc through Game Pass (I'm through Steam) where we both show up as offline for each other. We can still however join each other's servers as the option for that still shows up when I click their name. Can't send a team invite unless I'm standing in front of them in game though.
---
Id check if you can do any of the things I mentioned, as well as checking stuff related to Blocks like the other comment said. The social system in 76 is pretty wonky.
---
In the next installment of Fallout 1st exclusive.
---
I with they’d up how much you could turn in daily, I have over 750 treasury notes
---
No one even nukes white spring anymore
---
You can launch nukes in like 5 minutes if you know where the items are for the couple steps that can’t be skipped and then you can glitch through the rest of the doors suing photo mode
---
so looking forward to this shit being deleted/fixed
---
It made a big difference to me to go in with health at 40-50.   Still able to lay down good damage too.
---
I'm still trying to join the cult so I guess
---
Sounds very cozy, I wonder if there's a way for Xbox to upload pics...I'd love to see it. 🙂
---
Oh well, was fun while it lasted.
---
One thing my Fo4 Survival Pistol char showed me is how powerful those can be with the right perks. Beth can easily make that happen in 76 aswell.
---
Once u hit 97 u can but the last three and still have 50 atoms left if the final reward of 500. Should be able to make it still tho. Just make sure your not logged in during the refresh so u minimise the chances of the auto complete bug
---
Im confused by the question.
---
Are you standing on the petrol and need to shoot at something or are you going to shoot at the petrol on the floor from a distance?
---
it's all about glitched/magic weapns. go to somebody's event and make sure to one two tap the boss denying whoever ran the silo and fun or xp.
---
so yourf je shotguns, ffr heavy weapons etc. go out and have fun ruining the game in public servers.
---
Pvp doesn't have its place in the wasteland. 
---
Okay so let's remove it, and it's gone. 
---
Daily/Weekly Challenge comes up to claim workshops. Trolls have logged in as soon as possible and claimed all workshops. You cannot take any back without hopping server and hoping someone's not done the same. 
---
Part of the player base that enjoys pvp now have lost some of the game they enjoy. (sorry if you don't but some people do and have the same rights as you to enjoy the game how they like) 
---
Also lore wise. No pvp in a game with raiders in a post apocalyptic setting. Where food is scarce, fresh water is hard to come by and safe shelter is a rarity. People kill each other for far less so why should "A Wasteland" be all Happy Happy Jolly Cooperation?  
---
Did you complain when a raider in any other Fallout came after you? Probably not because you could kill them.
---
Actually doesn’t foundation sorta aka hey can you find me dad and maybe see if he’s somehow alive and the game décidées the way you open the mine is by nuking and therefore killing anything inside that was still human
---
I love this idea!
---
On point sir
---
Shooting petrol with a bullet most of the time will not cause it to catch fire. If you shoot it from close range the fire from the muzzle will light it.
---
There are a few cottages outside in the grounds of the Whitespring that are locked with hand scanners, they are fleshed out with contents but you can never get in them. If you check the wiki they were to be used for a cut quest called Room Service IIRC but you can get in by clipping in camera mode with a lot of trial and error, I haven’t managed to get in with power Armor clipping though.
---
That's weird...it took a bit but now there's an image in the post...
---
Again, all I did was post the link to my gallery...so I can't explain it... maybe it was the work of Mr. Pebbles, rewarding me for my faith? 🤷
---
If you talk to Maggie for ordeals, she quite literally says “Wish one of those nukes would land there.”
---
She literally is hoping for a nuclear warhead to hit near the mine.
---
Yeah.  You wouldn't believe the backlash I got saying this on other posts though.  People downvoted me as if that would change anything, and someone else who mentioned it as well.  Really strange.
---
Their adding a personal vault at some point so you can build alot more
---
If the bullet were to cause a spark when it hit the ground maybe? I've got no clue what op is even talking about though haha
---
I tried the rifleman build but I did good damage but it was just slow dps tried the stealth build liked the damage but it was difficult to always keep up with the stealth mechanics plus I'm not much of a stealth player tried the bloodybuild but I dont care for have such low health let alone trying to find a good bloodied weapon now I'm doing commando and it isnt the best at the moment but it fits my play style
---
Ammo Factory and Master Infiltrator are the ones im excited for. I never lockpick bc i hate switching 3 perk cards.
---
The legendary endurance too, as i have only 2.
---
I once showed up to grafting steel to help a buddy take it over as he didn’t have ammo and as I was scoping it out we realized he A) didn’t have generators for the collectors or have them connected to Poseidon. And B) had filled his camp budget building only high defensive walls and nukacola machines
---
You are not correct. Magic effect more than often barely worked on PTS due to latency. It legitimately won't be fixed soon.
---
I think the idea is to make you fight a mirelurk queen for it.
---
I’m comin on :)
---
Id pay atoms to have these machines in my camp along with my own vedor bot to sell stuff to
---
Why would you not want a bug to be fixed?
---
Yeh but bullets don't always cause a spark. I grew up in the country and we used to get drunk enough to try this sorta stupid stuff out. You can also extinguish lit cigarettes in a bucket of fuel. It's really not as volatile as the movies make out.
---
Outside of "cos vidya game" there is no reason. I think it's daft. There was plenty of feedback like this on the PTS for months.
---
It's a shame for people that care about the narrative.
---
oh please let this be true
---
*Great idea*
---
Both still work for me. Havent repaired my armor in ages and my TSE Dragon (has very low durability) breaks much much quicker without max Gunsmith.
---
I moved my camp as soon as I heard the new event was coming, since it was just a little behind the mine.  I like my new spot a little better, though.
---
Oh I am well aware. I'm a fire fighter and have a fair bit of experience with gas haha. If its overly concentrated like that it doesn't have the o2 to light
---
Was just saying it'd be a possibility
---
Just give us one for our camp
---
Stealth isn't good when your just learning the map, I would think.  
---
I honestly wasn't even planning to do bloody, until I met a generous stranger.  They offered to give me a full bloody set, and I figured why not?   
---
Halfway through they warned me the gear "us probably duped".   And it definitely is, it doesn't appear in the trade or vendor slots.  
---
But it's a different way to play the game, that gave me a much wider perspective on the importance of builds.   
---
Since then I've been honing my builds to the point where I will switch a couple cards depending where I'm going.
---
Only done with random groups. Never failed. PS4
---
Some times were harder than others, but all completed.
---
In between looking for the first five screws and adhesive we've seen in six hours of non-stop searching!
---
Why not a butcher vendor you can have in your camp same for vegetables. Cause just cause.
---
I think I was in this one. I joined the event and became the last conduit, something killed me instantly and by the time I respawned the squatch was dead
---
It was less awkward when we all had to have voice chat always on.
---
I think there is a very high chance op was “drunk enough” when they made this post.
---
I still find it comical that the meta for this game is to perpetually remain critically injured at all times, no matter what. This games playerbase needs to see a doctor, not enter combat.
---
That's max level gunsmith?
---
Are you fucking kidding me?
---
Isn't it supposed to be like 50% reduced wear and tear?
---
MAKE EM FREE AS WELL
---
True what if there are people still in the cabins or they go underground
---
Where is his weak point?  And when is the "certain time"?
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On
---
This
---
Not gonna mie, if they do fix this I'd be totally fine with it. Tired of assholes one shooting bosses before anyone can get a hit.
---
Yeah I got a bunch from primal cuts
---
I leave my upstairs locked where all my collections are displayed, incase some one figures out a gitch to steal them.
---
Huh weird I didnt think a virtual power surge would mess with servers
---
Look at the second picture, it's a lot more obvious
---
Retribution. That heal is going to help so much at SBQ/ACP. Survivability is king for a melee tank.
---
That or What’s Rads. Because radiation negation is the name of the game in these wastes. *Especially when your camp is built on a toxic waste dump.*
---
I mean, magic doesn't cause one shotting, but I know what you mean.
---
Oh shoot, i play vats/gunslinger... Im screwed!
---
Maybe not,  but still. Mekting bisses in mere seconds before anyone can tag it is a Dick move
---
I was thinking something about the vault 79 people or maybe when BoS arrives they have prisoners or something who they decide or release or who escape and they are scintist engineer people who go rejoin the enclave. As long as they’re not sad losers like that dude at the military camp
---
I mean, I tested it in the pts, unless they unfix it, which wouldn't surprise me, tbh, it's true.  I went into the pts and it didn't work
---
Honestly, I wish that if their event failed, they would make Nuke Zones. Would be fun.
---
Where do shotgun builds fit into this?
---
Like I said, I know what you mean, and I agree.
---
They need to fuse a bunch of the gun perks together...
---
That's a hard sell for five perk points.
---
I meant that I prefer to be proven wrong than wallow in ignorance.
---
She doesn’t tell you to, you just decide that it’s a good idea when you likely know any old explosive or hand removal would work fine. She’s just useless and also likely only has that line for instruction cause Beth thinks they need to explain in game the shit they have on the unavoidable pop up when you launch the game
---
As others have said, it increases the rate that Stims and Radaway work. Your bar will move faster w/healing from them.
---
Obligatory mention that the game and the wiki tell you this.
---
Did you see the picture under "more obvious proof"?
---
Oh no, Chally will make you pay alright. But it’s 2 hours later, when that milk finally starts to mix with all of the Cranberry Relish and Salisbury Steak.
---
Chally’s stinky piles will be a good dream in retrospect.
---
Hint: I don’t know what it is and any of you could just tell me what it means
---
Why would it be different in terms of latency from pts to normal servers?  I can get it to work consistently in regular servers.
---
Definitely some good songs, but not enough and too many bad ones.
---
A [seed vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault) would be rad! But you could only find certain seeds during certain seasons, and those planted in your camp die off depending on seasons too or can't be repaired without new seeds, so that there's still room for grind.
---
I did the event 6 times now, i never got more than 250caps
---
tbh I am just very keen about the idea of having lots of pretty flower beds.
---
Maybe each seed produces X crops then dies and to craft it needs flux or something
---
Oh ho?  Do tell!
---
This is one I'm fine with not having, in Fallout 4 a very big deal is made of how hard these are to cultivate. Silt Beans &amp; Pumpkins on the other hand...
---
I didn’t know why the damage change was happening but the lag reason is reassuring to know. Does that mean the rubber banding glitch with shotguns and such might be fixed too?
---
I found an Atom church. I joined it with like a dozen of players. The priest was chanting, and he baptized us all.
---
Then he launched a nuke in his church with everyone inside.
---
It was a good laugh.
---
That's probably what you will get then 😁😷😁👍
---
I love it when people visit my camp to the point I moved it to flatwoods on my main tank build so that it gets higher footfall especially for new players. I spent hours decorating the shelves perfectly and arranging it so the camp itself blends with the environment. It's nice when others get to enjoy that by popping by for a chat and some lemonade or nukashine 
---
On my bloodied melee build I must rebuild that camp at least once a month on my stream when I get new ideas and then I enjoy people coming to see it a hopefully enjoying/taking inspiration from it.
---
What build are you running to solo it? I’m yet to see anyone pull it off solo yet
---
Oh, but I want to be able to grow a pretty garden without flux! I'm still a wimpy low-ish level, barely left the forest.
---
I swear it just changed recently. Same thing is happening to me, it's driving me a bit nuts.
---
They need faster responding servers to fox the issue. But they will never pay for them.
---
Lol wow
---
Somebody said to me that Earles health and damage resistance are fixed and dont scale with the number of players. Idk what to believe anymore
---
I'd like to plant a scorchbeast brain tree myself.
---
Outlier here, but it was muted pretty much out the gate ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Think about one wasteland and lvl max mobs now
---
Destroy all those useless turrets
---
Not sure about latency, but frame rate does seem to play a role. As in, if your frame rate is too low, the "magic" doesn't happen, or at least not reliably.
---
"Your drunk, go home" moment
---
-written while drunk &amp; maybe on the toilet
---
"Would rather have something than nothing at all". Your words on the subject.
---
A seed vault in Appalachia would be interesting and possibly lore fir dot with value tec in the area? Like a vault with scientists continuing genetic work.or what could be really neat is if the enclave lower floors at white spring were fixed and it turns out there’s a full on seed vault and frozen zoo down there and some scientist here about to and comes and teaches you about to. And because there so rare and whatnot he charges serum type prices for them
---
It's usually not awkward until i invite them to a race on those weird ass child's ride cat thingies. After that yeah, it can get uncomfortable.
---
That’s alright, as soon as you can grab some PA you can get flux. I meant inert flux btw
---
I always acknowledge my visitors. Usually drop them some water or a soup. Good host
---
You wanted nothing... Probably what you will get then???
---
Humour is just wasted on some it seems 🙄🙄
---
You know what the responder vendor bot is right?
---
Never got any problems with my legacy weapons, event on the PTS.
---
I feel like the stash to pipboy menu at the moment is a bit broke. When I try to put things for sale sometime the item below moves up to the highlighted line then sometimes it jumps to the one above. Very annoying when your only half paying attention clearing your stash or something and you drop of scrap something you didn't want to.
---
I can vats it in one clip and tank alot of energy damage on my pvp char (no hacked, modded or cheated stuff all legit) and I mostly activate all 3 and then wait a few minutes except there are other strong players, then I usually shoot only a few shots.
---
omg I have tears LOL
---
There's a particular hype that comes with multiple delays. A hype the brings with it an expectation of a polished product. If we hadn't gotten delays I'd be happy to play a bugged event. But if it's still a buggy mess the delays were merely just prolonging the inevitable for no reason.
---
You just downvoted your own comment. Clownshoe.
---
Not a programmer. ELI5: If the client-server interaction is simplified, that will make the server run smoother overall? Maybe allow the introduction of new content, or bigger CAMPs?
---
If so, I'm in.
---
Yeah you need to be faster than the server in any form and the magic can happen, i got it sometimes with my BE laser rifle and i have melting the SQB two time with one clips... That really surprising sometimes and annoying when it's happen, i feel really bad at this time too
---
It's a contextual downvote. My words, recycled by an ass hole, turned them to shit.
---
This is also a thing at a lot of instanced rooms so they might also be intended as doors that take you further into the instanced zone like the bunker door access in whitespeings
---
I've put my ally on the roof, she stopped walking inside my house.
---
I'm ready for that shit to be fixed but sadly I don't think it will be soon. I would rather have people just afk after getting their tags than melt the boss on a nuke the didn't launch.
---
&gt; Are you capable of ever releasing anything that works? 
---
No they are not.
---
We got bugged reward from legendary run, we getting bugged items from atomic shop, we getting bugged events...
---
lol fucking season 1 almost over and those assholes still didn't fixed auto complition bug... it's just unbelievable.
---
Came to ask exactly this!
---
Last I heard that crippling Earl or the SBQ wasn't possible.
---
I visited the mothman town on the map and found nothing. I was quite let down considering I too heard people talk about it and it has a dedicated drawing in the games map. I must revisit it
---
It's never made sense to me why they gave a damage bonus set effect to power armor and a full hp set effect to regular armor.
---
I just spotted him today! I was like woooaaahhh what is that thing? I had the pro camera on me and snapped a lot pic of him, now I get to see him in the loading screen it’s so cool!
---
Dude.... Limb Damage is exactly what you want!
---
Weird, he usually just floats away into the ceiling. 🤔
---
Don't worry he did that before sinking into the ground. It's all in the video 😂
---
&gt; I don't see why Bethesda wouldn't try and copy what ZoS did.
---
Elder Scrolls Online uses a completely different engine than Fallout 76, so in that sense, Bethesda couldn't just "copy" something from ESO and put it into Fallout 76, any more than they could copy something from Animal Crossing or Bejeweled. That is to say, what they could copy would be the idea, the concept. Not how it is actually implemented within the engine itself.
---
Having said that, the engine of Fallout 76 should probably be able to work just fine with targets.
---
Move your camp by the tarberrys
---
Yea... I was just jesting 🙄🙄
---
Add a stupid comment... Bound to get stupid answers 😁
---
They were shit to start with. You complained when they didn't just launch the event regardless of whether it worked and now you're complaining that they did just that.
---
Sorry mate, you might wanna look behind you, I'm pretty sure I saw the point fly right over your head.
---
Is that the loading screen vault door 79?
---
There is a big difference between grinding and earning the legendary gear like everybody else and buying  
---
Buying duplicate gear from mules off the net. 
---
If you can't tell the difference from the two things that's on you.
---
We all know there is a black market
---
In this game.
---
Sure they could have got the gear legit by playing the game, but they didn't.
---
Pleasant valley area is a good spot to find many. They might have been raiders, but they liked reading.
---
It's not. Still breaks the game for the rest of the players in the game.
---
And f@#$ all cheaters anyway.
---
Learn to play the game like the rest of us. 
---
Lazy butts with money to burn and don't want to grind can all go screw.
---
You don't have a point. Any context.
---
But your talking about Plasma Casters haha. They are so easy to get hold of. Your stating that just because a 67 has a Plasma Caster that they must be a cheater/Duper. 
---
So easily grinded and earned at that level haha 
---
*Sure they could have got the gear by playing the game, but they didn't*
---
How do you know? Anddd
---
They probably did haha the black market for the Plasma Caster. It's not that good when legacies are flying about at the moment haha
---
Run to the other side with everyone and he comes out done it before
---
Dude he obviously meant the idea, not copying the  code directly.
---
Not gonna waste my time on you bro, have a good one.
---
No.
---
I'd be a little surprised if that were the case (although you can't put anything past Bethesda let's be honest) because when your junk is dropped, it's just like any other loot bag, it doesn't belong to you any more.  I would expect it to stay there either until a timer runs out and/or there's no players in the area.
---
Because visitors leave the doors open and it drives me insane
---
Not a fan of the fireproof idea. I shouldn't have to waste a card slot to defend against overpowered weapons. Adding dense to all armors is the best thing they could do.
---
Will have to try an coordinate that next time. Todd know's it'll happen again lol
---
First off you have no idea when I reached the end game.
---
And meat piles don't cause the entire system to crash.
---
No the system can't handle teams of dupers using illegal gear.
---
If you all think this isn't happening then you are playing with your eyes closed.
---
How is your highest damage 650 i hit over 1000 with my gatling gun or do you mean against the queen? Cause for it I hit like high 40s with adrenaline up
---
Magazines,bobbleheads, turrets, and crops take up a lot of budget, start there.
---
When did Earl turn into a floater?
---
Its on console tho... its called the "Juger" or something like that. It is quite janky as the ither comment said, and it works more like 1 weapon, rather than 2
---
I was new to the game and someone got bounty on their head so i said to myself why not lets see how the pvp works. so i went to his camp all sneaky like and opened the door and lo and behold it was his crouch. so i stare at his crouch for few seconds and then looked up and he was staring at me like WTF dude. then he got naked and it was weird i almost ran away but then i realised that it was so i could kill him. it was a wild night
---
I'd prefer dense for that reason. But if they just add fireproof perk card, I'll take it! Tired of getting clapped by explosives. I want to have decent gunfights.
---
Imagine my surprise when I shot a robot from a shotgun, but without VATS (aimed to cripple them and make myself little safer, this was in Daily Ops) and the robot dies.
---
DAMN. I abandoned my main because of the glitch but I’m happy to hear that
---
What ever. You weren't in the event watching a bunch of low level players with op god level weapons.
---
I wasn't just 1 player.
---
It wasn't just 1 time.
---
It wasn't just 1 plasma caster.
---
If you think black market gear isn't in the game you are sadly mistaken.
---
hi.
---
can i add you. I play often and will gladly assist with whatever.
---
happy to run silos
---
Go with the bloodied route and be one with the Children of Atom.. 😅
---
I mean the highest card damage portrayed when inspecting the weapon in the inventory
---
Ah that makes sense I would have to check what mine is
---
We can plant them, i have like 12 or so in my camp. You just need to find right version of pumpkins, search on YouTube.
---
I have 650 and it goes up daily, that damn Earle is too generous on death
---
I mean there *is* a difference between salami and "pepperoni" so....pepperoni?
---
ok lets take a step back, cranberries require a bog to grow. Masshole checking in and I remember the cranberry harvest. WV is way inland an the fact they wrote cranberries in makes little sense. 
---
Live in Hburg now so I know how far we are from the brackish water needed to grow good cranberries.
---
The health bar glitch where it would empty completely then refill fully when you shot something "should" be fixed now
---
I've joined a team that was in the mine right after I finished the event and was able to participate in it again. If the event isn't showing but there are people in the mine, try joining their team and fast travelling to them. 👌🏻
---
Legendary Squirrels!
---
Agree, I hate all explosives but the M79 kills me more than anything. Gauss shotgun is a close second. VATS nades rarely hit me but they're an issue too. I actually like the concept of VATS nades but they shouldn't be able to 1-shot.
---
Why is this being downvoted? lol
---
I meant copy the idea obviously
---
Okay but I think you are mistaken on what weapon they were using. 
---
You state it's the Plasma Caster but are you sure it wasn't the Gatling Plasma?
---
My reasoning:
---
In all my hours playing since the Plasma Caster became available. I could honestly count on my fingers how many Plasma Casters I've seen. It's just not that good Explosive or not. 
---
You apparently had an event that "lagged" due to lots of people using them. 
---
And on top of that apparently had several events go the same way. 
---
You claim that they are duped to high heaven. Really? Plasma Casters. I honestly don't see people spending real money on a weapon and choosing a Plasma Caster, A weapon so easily grinded for and still available in game  and weak compared to 99% of Legacies on the market right now which are far more versatile and powerful. 
---
I'm well aware of recent duping problems and the sheer amount of Legacies added to the marketplace and I don't dispute the black market being in existence. I'm sceptical about what weapon you are trying to complain about because the Plasma Caster isn't known to be a hugely duped weapon for many reasons. 
---
I'm feeling you are mistaken on what you've witnessed. 
---
Quick question: The weapons they were firing. Full Auto or Semi Auto?
---
Well, americans call pepperoni what we call salame piccante, so all you have to do is add a little bit of spicyness to the salame to create pepperoni. It's a misnomer, since what we call "peperoni" is bell peppers, not spicy and mostly not meat
---
The lead deposit near Sunny Top is a spawn site. Mothman most often but the Flatwoods will spawn there too. I’ve had my camp there a couple of times. Sometime while you’re fighting the Mothman the Moleminers from down the hill will come up to attack you from behind. Good times.
---
Same, idk why people complain about low levels. All you need is just 2 or 3 high dps builds. Maybe the wendigo spawns scale with amount of player so that could be a con, but they just serve as adrenaline imo...
---
i am all for balancing the game.
---
BUT if 'magic damage' is not sorted with this update  i will follow my now diminshed FO76 friends list, and be out .
---
Wait till you see the scorched Mothman
---
Genius! Fully stealing this idea.
---
Before an SSD: same was a stuttery mess.
---
After SSD: smooth as butter.
---
No one said that it isn't happening.
---
We all just don't agree with your stated causes.
---
It's also irrelevant when and if you've reached "endgame".
---
You also need to check up on what's illegal, there is no "illegal" gear in this game. Why? Because there is no law that says something is not allowed.
---
But you do you and keep on thinking what you want. Ignore evidence and the real (proven) reasons this shit happens.
---
Bye Karen.
---
But what about people who use explosive rounds or energy cores?
---
Fallout 4 could have more songs as it was a one off royalty to add them into the game. As 76 is online it's classed as a  broadcast/streaming content, so they have to pay ongoing royalties for each song they use, hence the limited selection.
---
Yeah aesthetics only, would be cool if we get a mini game out of it. I guess that would be too much fun =/.
---
Mirrored ceiling, ooooh yeah.
---
He shows up at cultist sites around the map, like the cemetery and church compound just north of the Nuka Cola plant, or the house on the border of the Forest and the Toxic Valley. There’s a cult site in the Mire and the Bog and a bunch more. Or there’s random encounter sites all over the map.
---
What do you mean, if you want them go grab some and plan in your camp, there are at least 9 spawns of plantable pumpkins in game
---
Not a single one, even how insignificant is a waste.
---
Me, I was a not so high level player and I joined the Colossal Problem event with the other 3 players. Yup there were only 4 of us and I was the only character not wearing a PA.
---
The entire battle there's this two high level cool PA wearing players slayed down by the big monster a couple of times and every time I've saved them with Stims! Kinda funny situation to watch sort of like a "glitch in the matrix" where this random non PA wearing player running around killing dozens of Wendigos and saving everyone in their awesome looking PAs.
---
yeah, sorry was humbling bragging there.
---
While you’re at it Bethesda give me more STASH space 800 is not nearly enough especially when for some reason you decided no even though the legendary exchange has 91 scrip left and this gun will give you 40 you can’t have have scrip and now you’ll have to carry it around because your STASH is full
---
They do have mini games in Holo tapes so it could be done and yeah that would be cool and something that kept score so you could compete with random people that play it
---
that is why I leave half a AP bar away from a train station.
---
Man that uh Thrill of the grill quest is kinda underwhelming lol i spent maybe 200 caps travelling to these locations for yao gui meat and deathclaw meat. Then i have like 6 stimpaks left when i had 20 or more and oh my god the ammunition i had to waste too. Too much time, resources and effort for some damn radaway and a recipe i already know
---
The only ore I have any interest in is lead, so I visit Lucky hole mine on occasion. All other minerals/metals I seem to obtain in enough quantities through game play looting and scrapping.
---
The mats obtained in these events you mention are to small for bulk crafting of ammo.
---
People smashing Earles face in at the mo, so they have tonnes of treasury notes saved up now, could be why?
---
I have no need for ore (melee build) and even if i do once another pwrson shows up they usually steal all the ore while im killing stuff.
---
Once one wasteland comes out i will join them because enemies will be worth killing.
---
Could you give me one please?
---
Im Alcoceba_1303 (on ps4)
---
I don’t think people see them down that side of the map.
---
almost 3k hours. I only powered up poseidon.
---
just recently I powered up the giant drill in ash heap. 
---
just recently I opened all dome doors in that disposal site. 
---
there is always something to do.
---
How much damage do you do on the  pipboy? I'm a gauss build and would like to know how it is affected.
---
lore to keep it in the lore of the game, why not have all of us ban together. There were what 200 of us in the vault I think is the story line...we could ban together and take over the whole place. That could be one way to work pvp out of the lore. As for your 2nd question, I didn’t play any other fallout game so I don’t know what the raiders did.
---
Well I kill him so much faster solo so that cannot be the case!
---
I would like to see the camp limit doubled or steady tack another quarter more budget onto it.
---
I get that the camp isn't supposed to be permanent housing but the game dosent have any better options (or any at all) for player housing.
---
Imagine a Bejeweled boss fight tho. Dodge giant colourful boulders that randomly cause disconnects as you run towards a chest that occasionally bugs out and has no loot.
---
Cranberries are also in a farm north end of the forest!
---
It depends on what weapon you are using.
---
They patched a glitch that let you stuff more
---
in there sadly.
---
I'm not sure if you'd find many people who don't agree that the build limits are too low.
---
Thanks! I’ll let my wife know, she picks all my songs for my videos
---
This\^\^
---
Good I can finally get rid of the six I have just sitting in my stash I keep convincing myself I'll trade one day.
---
I'm with you, in all the times I've played I've only ever moved my camp once. It really sucks finding a perfect location and having ideas of what to build, only to have your limit full half way through
---
It was the same weapon both times, a B2525 Fixer. More damage felt when solo and a 6 minute kill.
---
I have some explosive pipe pistols that are really fun. they get the job done.
---
some instigating pipe revolvers that with the double dip easily outclasses the lever action rifle.
---
and I’m level 400.
---
Yeah I went through 2 hours of gameplay yesterday looking for the powered door plan just to find that out for myself sadly ._. Hopefully that gets some notice or somebody finds a new bug
---
Heard all this before, and it turned out not to be true.
---
Ya I guess I'll take anything at this point.
---
Look it wasn't just a plasma caster and it wasn't just 1 person.
---
The level 67 was the highest person in the group.  And they all had god level op gear that takes lots of time to grind or simply isn't in the game any more.
---
So you tell me where is all the op gear coming from on low level players?
---
Okay well think of it like this. Whether we are from the same Vault doesn't mean we are all friends. 
---
Think back to your school days. Think of any class you had. Did you consider everyone in that room a friend. Did you get along with everyone in that class?  Now scale that to 200. 
---
Okay so new to Fallout well Raiders were aggressive and territorial. They would kill you on sight given the chance. The raiders in this Fallout are pansies. 
---
Some players want to role play the raider lifestyle and that includes murder and pillaging. 
---
If it's okay for you and others to play Happy Wasteland of Friendship you can't stop people playing Raider. 
---
Raiders are part of the Fallout story. Always have always will. Comes with living in such desperate times.
---
I dunno man, I played through the entirety of new vegas and it's dlc a month ago and the music is more tiresome than 76. (My opinion of course but I think nostalgia taints this opinion for most)
---
I like 4's best because I can do without the Beach boys, said as a native to the Bay Area.
---
&gt;!cripple screaming head!&lt;
---
This is what i thought, i.e bog, but they grow in a field  at Arronholt homestead, which is a lot closer to my camp than any place in the cranberry bog, so i cant complain.
---
🤣such is the state of this game
---
bad luck, m8. I’ve tried it 21 times. completed 18. bailed once (the lobby was 6 very low levels); crashed once; and failed once (despite a full group with another very high levels). 
---
yesterday I completed it naked, no armor, power armor or underarmor of any kind, without dying.
---
I've lost interest in this legendary run to be honest and really cannot be bothered to grind xp any longer.
---
I understand what you are saying. I cant go along with the school analogy because I didn’t have that issue, but I get what you are saying. I have pacifist on now, so there should be any more issues with friendly fire.
---
Higher level characters haha. Once you go 50+ all gear and stats are the same. 
---
I have 4 characters all 50 to 500+. Sometimes I play my low level characters sometimes I play my high. 
---
All of these characters can equip and max level gear. 
---
For all you know the 67 could have a high level main and just transferred gear to their low level character. 
---
Also how do you know exactly what gear they had? Did you offer trade to each one of them?
---
If you do it at the same time each day then you won't need one, I do mine most days at 6pm, same as treasury notes etc. Routine my friend, goes along way in this type of game but that said I don't disagree with you.
---
Exactly a system already exists to protect pve players outside of workshops. Trying to take a bigger chunk and remove pvp altogether is a step to far. Some people enjoy it.
---
The feral ghould samples the only one i can get it and when i scan the sample the damn terminal just says there isnt any
---
I’m at 339, have quality heavy guns, the perk load out to use them, and good armor. I’m used to tanking damage and living to tell about it. My 2nd ACP run I dropped with a 100 and a bunch of players under level 40. I thought ok this is still doable. Nope Earle didn’t even know we were there. I burned 3500 ultracite 2mm and 15 or so ultracite plasma cores. Just barely got him to regenerate. Everyone in the group bailed on the event except me, the 100 and a 37. I have nothing but respect for that 37. He stuck to the edges and sniped the wendigo spawn and ran in and revived me and the 100 multiple times. My 3 run I remembered that my furious flamer melts regular wendigo in 4 seconds, so I tried it on Earle, it did 30 times the damage that my two shot Gatling plasma was doing. It just sucks to be close enough to Earle to use it. It seems like he doesn’t like fire, I’ve got a bunch of those stupid flamer floater grenades that I’m bringing next time.
---
You may think that the queen ha sloss health, but the more people are in the event the more lag there is, giving you the assumption that she is harder to kill
---
From another post:
---
**Earle**: 32k HP, 400 DR, 400 ER, 500 RR, Ignores 80% of all incoming damage, immune to radiation and explosions.
---
**SBQ**: 32k HP, 300 DR, 300 ER, 300 RR, Ignores 70% of all incoming damage, immune to radiation and explosions. 
---
These numbers are static and do not change
---
I am level 89, but felt like a new player, I did barely any damage :/
---
I mean, it doesn't really count but I agreed to meet some one for a trade at vault 76...in which he was an hour late just fucking around apparently...
---
So I was at the vault, and speaking really close into my Mic out of pure bordem. Unfortunately a new player came by and instantly just heard a 100+ dude in full PA sounding like a knock off Kylo Ren
---
Good news everyone...I got bad news.
---
That's a really strange regional difference, who knew.
---
That's why I buy prefabs. At 3% per prefab it saves a bit of space and if its destroyed it takes all the expensive stuff as well. So total repair cost is like 9 wood instead of flux for the decon shower lol. My favorites are the red rocket garage (lots of internal space) and wood cabin (aesthetic) and the materials to repair are simply metal and wood. I also have the bungalow, and green house but their hard to place on the mountains uneven ground. 
---
 I don't have the the seedy shack but its too small. The communist bunker is very big, but doesn't have alot of internal space for its size also struggles with uneven ground. I don't have the raider outpost thingy looks cool but not an enclosed space, so defeats the purpose of defending the stuff inside.
---
I usually message and ask if they are new first.  Could be a second or third character by a player only trying to level up.
---
Keeps the molerats out
---
Omg I’ve given up trying to explain RNG and computers to people.
---
As a PC player. I envy that you can private message individuals.
---
I'm getting higher damage numbers on the displayed damage too, 101-120 damage with a team of 8, 160-300 on my own.
---
There was no latency or lag for me at all.
---
I vote for all the crops, and make them take up less budget.
---
Gourds or pumpkin?
---
Why limit yourself to certain parts of the map though? I end up traversing every section of the map each time I play, guaranteed. Each to their own I guess but it just seems like a waste 😎pun intended.
---
Don't you have them? I can clicknright and left in the camp selector to pick different razor grains
---
I think I read something about them looking to make camps instanced and do away with limits but we'll see.
---
Why do you need a machine when we have feral ghouls right there?
---
I'll have to go hunting
---
It's easy enough to track as those both reset after 20h you use them. If you have multiple characters then just use pen/paper, or do them always the same time like many of us.
---
No the server crashed because their team was glitching the hell out of the game.
---
We can argue all week about who had what and where the got it.
---
But can you seriously not tell when a group of cheaters are scamming the game.
---
Their is a big difference between playing straight and glitching exploits that ruin the experience for everyone.
---
That’s for sure. I have an anti armor ultracite gauss mini gun and a two shot ultracite Gatling plasma. I have all the heavy gunner perks maxed out and using chems and other buffs. I’m hitting Earle in the single digits. I’m hoping I’ll get a few more DPS once Beth fixes the High Voltage Hefe so it works again, but even with that I definitely can’t solo him.
---
I really hope you heard right, at this point I just wanna be able to display all of my bobbleheads at least
---
That's what friends are for
---
Not gonna lie I'd pay for that, and maybe a closet? A fridge that can hold more than 10 items?
---
Unless you have Fallout 1st you'll just be getting a lot of crafting materials you don't have room for &amp; not great XP for time spent. 
---
A fun buff for Breach &amp; Clear would be if it gave you plans for the Metoric sword so you could get it as drop or if leveled legendary versions dropped from the event.
---
The same basic principles behind the powered door build budget glitch apply to most of the other build budget glitches. Like, you also used to be able to decrease your budget with the asbestos roofs, dark cherry wood floors, circus trailer (using a different method), and most recently with the small generator from the atom shop. Best time to try and find out about these glitches is when something new comes to the atomic shop or as an unlock able in game that sits on the same place in the build menu as another item. Then you just need to test if building the new item, replacing it with the old item, then scrapping the old item does anything to the budget bar. People have been pretty quiet about the generator glitch so I’m sure the next one will be hush hush as well so it doesn’t get patched too quickly. 
---
I’ve personally got a camp that’s 2x max budget. It’s not easy to plan much bigger builds with these glitches. There’s a lot that you can no longer do when going over budget, enough to frustrate the average player. Can’t build anything new, can’t run anymore electrical wiring, and it’s easy to screw up existing wiring if you start rearranging the camp. What’s a real shame tho is I’ve had this big camp for so long I’ve had time to test the server stability over the long run, and I don’t notice any more issues in this camp vs my alts camp which is within budget. So theoretically they could definitely increase the budget, but just choose not to. Not asking for double (even though that runs fine) but even a 25% increase across the board should happen.
---
Earle has a 90% everything resist.
---
Still a flaw. Sea of thieves cycles it’s twitch rewards and drops in and out just fine. Fallout doing it poorly is on whoever manages that aspect
---
In that instance then the queen still has the same amount of health though, it's just your gun that is ouputting more damage.
---
There are other factors you have to take into account, such as the length of time she stays on the ground/in the air.
---
yes as i wrote with normal weapons in team i have the same problems, i have to rely on others to kill earl, with shotgun on team i can contribute. Or even solo it.
---
the crashes i wont even count
---
sbq not possible, earl definitely possible
---
I'm talking about Earle, I've not attempted a solo Queen fight yet and know I can output far more dps on her. Her flying or on the ground makes no difference to a B2525 handmade! I do the same damage in the air than on the ground.
---
"Ol man Mose" is hilarious though. "When I get low I get high" kicks all sorts of ass too. The only ones I find boring are "Bubbles in my beer" and "16tonnes", though that being said every so often even they can be enjoyable.
---
Wow yeah I’ve seen it! I was like level 15 and blown away...and then you showed me the underground part and I couldn’t believe it. The coolest camp I’ve ever seen!
---
Oh now i see...  
---
Because of localization gourds and pumpkins in my language are the same word.  
---
So yeah gourds, you can plant gourds.  
---
But why anyone need pumpkins in their camp, is there anything i dont know?
---
I've come across a few people that are on extra characters and it was awesome one time. They dropped me 40 different stable flux as a thank you. 
---
I guess I just remember how I went so long not knowing things. 
---
The excitement I see from some people about certain items I just help. And also giving someone their first marsupial serum is really neat. The reactions are amazing.
---
No one is sleeping in my bed but me
---
Same though. I'm a collector, I need more space lol
---
Somebody has covered this a long time ago. I'll let you read through this cause there are a lot of interesting points:
---
Reddit - fo76 - PSA: Scorchbeast queen's health does not scale with the amount of players present https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbuz2r/psa_scorchbeast_queens_health_does_not_scale_with/
---
I agree however. I don't think from the information you've provided (which seems to be showing a very narrow view on how the game works and what people would spend real money on) the issues you've outlined are legit. 
---
Plasma Casters are slow firing and wouldn't cause lag more then a normal full auto combat rifle. 
---
You state to know of the black market but then state that Plasma Casters are the real problem. Not legacy lasers/gat plasmas. 
---
You honestly think that "duped/glitched" gear at the event caused the lag but the game doesn't know what's duped or not. It has no way of knowing or the whole problem with duping would be solved as Bethesda would delete said Duped Gear. 
---
So this problem could be caused by legit gear too. 
---
Your knowledge about using an alt and how Gear works once you reach over level 50. Thinking that a level 67 cannot have decent gear shows you're not too clued up. Hell even a level 5 can have God tier gear without cheating if you trade it legendaries to Scrip for The purveyor. 
---
So yes we could argue over this for hours but I honestly don't see the point. Your points seem all over the place and so even if I struck a chord with you about something your story would change yet again to back up your claims. 
---
So go back to thinking that people with Plasma Casters at 67 are dupers and cheaters and causing game breaking lag haha hell report them to Bethesda. They might get a laugh out about it.
---
Instanced interiors* chances are it'll be like bunkers or pre built buildings
---
I'd say they're good where its at
---
I love Breach and Clear, mostly because I have a bottomless stash box. Much more fun than running Lucky Hole.
---
Who said its not permanent housing? Because the entire game seems to make it out to be
---
Oh wow I didn't know they were the same word in your language! that adds confusion because they are used in different recipes. To make pumpkin pies I guess? Or they just like how they look. Pumpkins are associated with Halloween so they may want that look I guess.
---
It's just getting even closer to the pay-to-win line. Even though you could make a case that it already has been crossed.
---
And plants this ain't farmville lol
---
Why do all your photos have this strange filter on them? Maybe it's time to fix your phone.
---
Let us plant all plants? That’d be great.
---
It's rediculous how much we as players have adjusted to that kind of bullshit from bethesda. Just think about it - an online multiplayer game in year 2020 without simple chat feature... un-fucking-believable...
---
If I see a low level, I see if thats a second character or if they are actually new. If they're new I ask if they want some back up, just use either my BE 50 Cal or AAE Tommy Gun to hose everything down if things are looking dicey for the guy.
---
I will also usually drop hundreds of stimpaks, hundreds of radaway, hundreds of purified water (since I usually have thousands of those three), whatever prewar food I have, whatever ammo I have that they are using I will just drop for them...as long as they want them. I have had a few people not take anything except for the backup.
---
One thing they dont ever say no to, whenever I ask, usually when I go to their camp, is if they want a fusion generator.
---
That’s a great camp location. I move my camp back there every so often. Right now I’m on the lead and acid double resource site.
---
I always join lode baring, but I sit by the tunnel entrance and wait for the event to end, before escaping. You don’t actually have to do anything to ‘win’ and you still get the rewards. Good time to go get another drink.
---
My first two tries failed and I was talking to call it quits, but it's been stable for me ever since. I've probably done it ten more times. I feel like it's definitely gotten more stable on PC than it was when it launched.
---
There's nothing in them, power armor clipped into them only to see a hollow void like in picture above.
---
is it? i used them as an example that even those wont work.
---
I hope it's not prebuilt, that would actually be pretty terrible. I'd be okay with a bunker if we could design it, though I'd still prefer to be able to build in the overworld.
---
You would not have them if not for bad coding.
---
Oh that's sad I was so excited when I first got there I thought I was gonna get all these amazing perks from being the general but no I'm just a glorified nuclear football
---
I'll miss my magic Quad Double Barrel, I hope they fiddle with shotguns soon, because outside of VATS it's fucking hopeless.
---
I'm not a high level player, level 53, but i regularly drop one star legendary items when i get them in events because like someone can use them and three legendary scrap is kinda useless
---
Where is the garden shop
---
i wont argue its to easy.
---
if everything works as intended it actually is.
---
but the bugs make it difficult to play thats the point i try to get across
---
Don't get me started bro. I whine about this frequently.
---
TIL
---
I usually solo Breach and Clear if I need the loot, plus I usually grab a couple Meteoric Swords to sell. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I do some times I also just drop meds and ammo :)
---
I find breach and clear is bugged most time I show up there's no ore in the containers. So I only bother now and then if no other events are on the map.
---
I love both of those events. I do Load Baring a lot. Quite often I’m the only one there but I don’t mind if others join. I prefer to do Breach and Clear by myself because I don’t want to share the loot. But to answer your question I’d say it’s because neither one of them have a guaranteed legendary.
---
Good idea kinda like BIV and the alcohol recipes
---
if the game works less buggy for you than for me i would not recommend a shotty. its fun but you usually almost have get into melee range because of the short range/dmg fall off. 
---
for crippling earl/other big enemies a  shotgun with enforcer as a sidearm is always a good idea :)
---
I did a year starting March 21 and havevnot received August atoms yet.
---
at least they are all -90% weight, so you do not have to shove several 20 pound weapons in your stash box until you can scrip them
---
im happy for you. i realize not everybody on ps4 has the same issues. im just lucky that way i guess...
---
That's what made me realise they are just scrip disguised as weapons haha
---
I'm gonna be honest looking back I've fallen into a lot of trap bases but I just keep thinking I'm dumb and that I accidentally walked into their spike traps then I respawn and do it again cause I'm that naive and think they have good loot for sale
---
Weren't you just claiming the event doesn't work? Make your fucking mind up.
---
I got my camp set up north near crater on a junk and lead deposit. Pretty sweet spot, also have my communist raider collection down for ammo and weapons.
---
Coming out into the next pach will be a fix for this now.
---
That's one way to look at that sentence, and I agree with the notion that comes out - it should be providing us with relevant numbers, and the current ones are often not so relevant.
---
But I meant something different. That numbers themselves mean little outside of their context. For example, a hit for 100000 damage is not so much in Diablo 3 mathematics, but is ultra extreme in Fallout76.
---
My point was more "50 in new math could be more than 100 in old math". My thesis is that comparing numbers across different frames of reference, without comparing the frames of reference themselves, is doomed to yield invalid results because of improper comparison methodology.
---
Thank you for being a nice chap not use it on ACP :)
---
I used to do this quite a bit but fewer and fewer people would accept the help. So, now I post on reddit when I’m looking to help someone.
---
Doubt it, this has been a thing for a long time and there are so many other methods to achieve similar results.
---
Ridiculous player currency limits, then you have to wait till it resets and remember it or write down every day what time you sold something. 
---
Welcome to 2020 gaming.
---
Bro XD for real just make sure you drink some water, all this salt must be making you dehydrated. The event can be buggy but it's not 100% impossible to finish every time. You really are delusional dawg.
---
It's also a gating system so low level players don't just wander in with some explosives.
---
How do u get the flair? I can’t figure it out
---
I used a full health stealth rifleman build. 
---
I used a FE Fixer thats been in my stash for months that I've never used. Also a combo of Psychobuff/tats and Balistic Bock.
---
The colossus and wendigos never saw me. Maybe a slight cheese that way but it worked.
---
I really hope it's getting fixed and I wish you happy encounters in any game you'll decide to relax with, I understand these emotions well
---
Thank you :)
---
Will agree with you in that magic weapons need a fix badly.
---
I love to base build and I say too low !
---
Smoothness of the experience was what shocked me the most from my PTS voyages
---
Into new definition of meta
---
We need more music
---
 Can you imagine how it’s on old consoles? I believe on PC it starts to get noticeable a while after...but it does eventually the same 0 fps. I hope they can rerelease the game on Unreal Engine for new consoles and pcs
---
I was a 100% PvP focused player because I consider F76s PvE dull. Not anymore. I am seriously excited to play Daily Ops because they provide way better PvE experience than anything we had before.
---
Well, as a Junkie Sniper I guess I’m fucked...
---
Doesn't work nearly as effectively as it used to against players. It's not worth using anymore in PvP, basically.
---
I was told they’re raising the gold limit as well
---
They are ok, but not amazing. They produce 25 junk per hour. That's about a minute of looting.
---
Nice camp, I dig how well decorated it is! 
---
[Here’s a walkthrough of my camp](https://youtu.be/w29Bz12ZL5E)
---
Oh maybe it banged while you were logged in already but your system was still loading the world for you, if you have a private server test it out, just nuke your camp and log out ten secs before it hits and the log back in 10 secs after...
---
Me too
---
This is perfect because I deeply enjoy good players trying to score my head :)
---
Corn soup helps with ap regen tho im not aure if its the same amount as tarberries
---
Feels good man
---
How about plant growing floors of different tiers? So you have your basics which can grow whatever is in dirt at camps now. Another tier which lets you grow most of the rest of the plants. And then a higher tier that lets you grow those that are supposedly harder to cultivate, but perhaps has an ongoing fertilizer cost to help with that.
---
Obviously each tier would be found separately (I can see the Brotherhood having found technology that allows them to cultivate more difficult plants on their archives somewhere) from the normal dirt floors,
---
And fire caps !!!
---
I don't know if this will help but check this page out and scroll down to bugs. Says a patch is going to be introduce in update 22(next update) that is going to fix issues with the quest.
---

---
It’s 1% of enemy max HP
---
I run my potato cpu hot and spicy and my gpu's fan is lifting my case of the ground. And still I play f76 with joy and low settings 😜. Good luck with finding a solution and see you in the wastes.
---
Which outfits? I believe the paramedic and firebreather you only have one chance to get, but it's a guaranteed reward from the early main quest and I see them in player vendors for sale all the time.
---
The only one that is rare (AFAIK) is the Responder Fireman outfit and helmet, and you only.get that as an event reward in the Forest.
---
Calling this a nerf is a symptom of missing the point of those changes
---
id like them to fix the other bugs that prevent damage first then remove the magic after ;)
---
The drop rate for the responder fireman's helmet and out suck ass. It's under 1%. I grinded doing the fly swatter event for 2 years and I never got it to drop once. I would say don't bother, it's cool but the grind isn't worth it.
---
24 years. The brotherhood can eat dick.
---
Mothman squad!
---
I played PTS as fullHP too (tested multiple toons) and shredded stuff efficiently.
---
I love this idea :)
---
Try a low level without legendary guns!
---
well i concur.
---
i would not be upset if they remove or nerf legacies if they also fix the other bugs :)
---
 The drop rate is below 1% I believe. I've done more events then I can count im level 390 and I've been grinding since fashnact too was level 130 back then I do bout 100 events a day and I've only got the responders helmet to drop in that time, still grinding but like you my resolve is waining.
---
I will have to, agreed
---
Ha
---
Point to you :)
---
i hope you never get to experience those performace issues its really something ...
---
Exactly, it's actually more satisfying to play bloodied on PTS too, because the overall experience is smoother
---
How about they just give you the juice instead? No crafting required. And while they’re at it they can start handing out free XP and legacy weapons....
---
There’s a lot of plants that we should be able to grow in our camps. Other have managed cultivating them, and were supposed to be the cream of humanity
---
I Second this !
---
Smoke machines are a good sign that it’s a trap.
---
This is the reason I am on this forum today. I'd like to know if I have a chance at getting the plans/items I didnt get a couple months ago during the first treasure hunter event. The new stuff is cool but I still want that circus cage and marine helmet.
---
Reset the game completely and load back in. Then use the terminal and analyze the blood sample before putting in the fuse. This worked for my brother
---
If you're a gunslinger build pipe pistols are your highest dps option - almost all the "real" guns are slow, high damage weapons that have crappy dps, except for the 10mm, which the pipe pistol does a little better than.
---
I'm always so grateful to higher level players who help me out; I'm gradually getting there (hit lvl 45 today!) and I hope to return the favour to some newer players when I get higher up, myself.
---
Dude lob a grenade behind the cabinet upstairs in the overseers house. You can blast a Firebreather outfit clean out. I made a post about it a while back. No helmet though.
---
You control your own reset timer. It’s 20 hours from when you did the first transaction. When you log in, sell an item and scrip an item as early as possible. If you can’t clear the vendor out, that’s fine. Just visit one again later in your play session. 
---
Have a set daily reset time for everyone would reduce your potential acquisitions by 20%.  That might not affect you but it would affect those that understand the system and use it effectively.
---
What, you mean you no longer have to fight the  creatures, out-think them and use tactics ? You can just one shot them due to your magic weapons and armour...??
---
Bloodier/Unyealding is a joke and it's running the game. If it was ESO I  could maybe get my head round it, what with actual magic and spells, but there is no downside to being so full to the neck of radiation.
---
Yes, it's a game and an alternative Earth, but if people want to combine weapons and armour that  so compliment each other there needs to be serious negatives that comes with it.
---
I'd take away mutations and many other in-game positives to anyone who wants to play a character that can one-shot most enemies in the game. I just don't see the fun in playing like that...pointless stuff, it really is.
---
Pumpkin grenades...I have a demolition build.
---
Bit of classic asbestos ceilings too
---
Oh yeah that makes sense
---
I’m wondering why he was worried about that little detail of realism in a game with mutated giant bats.
---
Cause it'd be nice to have a training dummy you can adjust to get practical damage numbers on your gear instead of relying on the tooltip purely.
---
Warframe's Simulacrum area is great because you can customize the level of any enemy you've fully scanned in your codex and have them either be still or actually fight to test things like survivability and your weapon's actual in action performance without having to haul yourself to a mission.
---
Make it like a VR pod or something.
---
I already have every perk card I need i was going for a bloodied shotgun build and im pretty sure I did it right i can solo the sbq in 9 minutes aslong as she lands consistently.
---
It's like the enclave event, having a blast. They're so much fun but I'm usually doing them on my own.
---
Maybe for the effort they dont give good rewards?
---
I honestly cant remember what the rewards for the enclave events are, I'd certainly remember if it was something awesome like a few orbital strike beacons.
---
September 8th at Noon ET. That’s the end of the tenth week. 
---
You’ve got just over 10 days left.
---
Fast travel back to my camp and female player wearing only underwear sitting in my living room, with her mic on arguing with a guy then they start having sex (hear them on mic). 5 minutes later she throws on armor then fast traveled away haha
---
Oh yeah?!
---
Well when I was a kid we didn’t even have feet! We walked on our ankles, as was the style at the time.
---
I’ve played it about 10 times now on PS4 pro. Bit of slowdown which is annoying. I’ve died probably once per run and luckily have spawned back inside every time.
---
If it wasn’t for the bugs, it is actually a cool event. Hope they fix it. It does suck exiting the mine into radiation after the event. I have to switch to stealth armor and then walk out of the radiation because I’m over burdened.... every time 🙄
---
Posts like this will never make it to the top. The people who use explosives downvote because they need their crutch. The adventure mode people downvote because they think any NW updates take away from adventure mode updates. 
---
NW is pretty much doomed unless we can manage to get all of the every day NW players to participate on Reddit and Bethesda forums. We should also [start sending in suggestions directly to the 76 team](https://help.bethesda.net/?_ga=2.173897123.1210133216.1598476443-2065279281.1597436017) in massive numbers.
---
No keyboard for Xbox.
---
I work at a casino. I know your pain. I just realized walking the floor feels like walking through a mental health ward, with each patient showing wildly divergent tics and behaviors. Logic has no place here.
---
They could always make them grow via some sort of small artificial environment. The CAMP lets us build all manner of structures at high speed, so some sort of device for growing harder to grow plants isn't absurd (plus there's also that fertilizer grenade).
---
If there were a ps4 server text chat I would gladly help lower lvl players. Sadly there isn't so I treat this game as a single player game and ignore everybody I come across.
---
Been that way since beta for over 400 levels now.  I cannot communicate with those stupid emotes so I don't do those either.
---
 I have a stash full of godly weapons that I will never use that just collect dust because I have no way to communicate with others to trade or give away.
---
Leave it to Bethesda be the only online multiplayer mmo type game to not have a text chat.
---
Yeah , he swims around in a glass lamp full of water
---
You're expecting Queensbury rules?
---
I’ve got a friend who’s a computer engineer. He also has a degree in statistics. I’ve had many conversations with him about random. 
---
And one thing he says people have trouble accepting is that streaks of similar or same results are far more common than people think.
---
WoW has this, its just set up in a public area and you hit it and it shows damage numbers. Wish Beth could do this too
---
Id like to see  a return of the cages from fallout 4s dlc, Catching a deathclaw in one and a raider in the other, and then opening both to watch the two meat.   
---
and then obviously eat anything that remains.
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
You are obviously aware that shops are PvP area, and yet you run around there with scrap on you? You are also not new to this sub and I'm sure you've read other's stories about the shops.
---
Yes, it sucks when it happens, just keep your scrap at home and stay crouched with the CSS...
---
By completing daily missions and  events and those are  the only ways I know of
---
You get treasury notes and can swap 20 of them for 200 gold per day.
---
You can farm public events and some others for treasury notes. Then you can turn on up to 20 treasury notes per day at the gold exchange machines, there’s one in foundation and one at the crater.
---
Workshops should be avoided if you aren’t actively looking to pvp , most pvp players think you are issuing them a personal challenge when you take one. Not saying it makes sense but they are sharks who smell blood in the water as soon as it’s claimed
---
Imo there is no much influence for me. I’m on PS4 and I have those weapons considered as magic but I never felt that because I heard that it only works in a high frame rate which PS4 never does
---
Finally
---
Shit like this made Beth curtail building. It needs to stop.
---
No it didn’t. This has been in the game for a long time in one form or another. If they wanted to curtail building they would stop this specific thing and they haven’t.
---
How about plans for those row planters everyone and their cat has figured out how to use? Everyone except the vault 76 geniuses...
---
I think that ghoulification of the character that's heavily radiated for prolonged time should occur.
---
I.e. I get how a heavily ghoulified creature is less prone to exhaustion (lots of AP), but I think they shouldn't be able to be as fast as fullHP players, and should i.e. break their legs more easily on falls
---
I've never been bothered before. Higher level players have always gone out if their way to help me.   In fact one time, a higher level started nuking the workshop I'd taken, I fast travelled back like 'wtf?' and they stopped and waved and ran away. If it was me, and I was 6 x levels higher than another, I'd just leave them alone.  There are other workshops to take and there was no reason for this guy to be a dick.  
---
Also saying that I'm not new to this suburb is just really stupid.  I don't spend hours here reading every little post that comes along.  In fact most of the time I only read the posts that I get in my notifications.  So yeah I haven't read too much about workshops and people getting pwnd at them. But whatever.
---
Honestly just stick to private servers if you need to take a workshop for any reason.
---
There are a ton of Cranberries at Abernathy Farm in the Forest protected by nothing more than a few Bloodbugs or Bloatflies.
---
 Why does everyone complain about having to go to Cranberry Bog for them?
---
You can use this:
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151) 
---
Unless you are on Game Pass... :(
---
If you do it always at the same time and log your toons in, in the same order...
---
I can do it w/o a timer or pen &amp; paper, with 10 toons.
---
Unfortunately making it part of the SCORE challenges means I kind of have to claim them if I want to get ahead. And I've never been bothered before.  Maybe it's cos it's a weekend, maybe it's the workshop I chose, I dunno.  Been claiming workshops for the last couple months and this is the first time it's happened.  :-/
---
I honestly just hate that entire region of the map , if it’s not something important I don’t bother even going down there
---
I still remember the guy selling plans for a fusion generator at 5 caps. That guy is forever in my heart.
---
Commercially raised cranberries IRL are a thing. Take Ocen Spray for example. Should be a plantable item but I think they want to make you work for it.
---
I always do Breach and Clear and 99% of the time it's just me there...which is perfect lol
---
There's a bunch of Ginseng in the Mire at the farm across the river from the Galleria.
---
Except Ore don't go in the Stashbox, it's listed under Misc. You have to smelt it down to scrap to make it junk so you can get it in your Stashbox... which means farming acid.
---
Explosives are extremely OP on PC too. An average player with explosives and high ground will beat a good player with a gun 90% of the time.
---
🖕🏻
---
Then you should be fine
---
Breach &amp; clear is always bugged for me, the fucking mobs stay underground.
---
Lode Baring? I just activate it and take a break .)
---
Definitely worse on weekends but you have also been very lucky if it’s your first time
---
One point you are wrong about; the claim that *’they didn’t ask for anyone to visit.*’
---
The vast majority of trap camps have active vendors, which means they are advertising their location on the map. Which means they are inviting people to come by. Which means that they are then being ‘poor hosts’ by trapping/killing their guests. 
---
While this is still ‘within the rules of the game’, that doesn’t mean that everyone else has to approve of it. Just like Freedom of Speech lets some people say a lot of horrible things, but no one else has to approve of it. 
---
OP has a valid reason to be frustrated.
---
I'm guessing you're on console?
---
I've no idea what Queensbury rules means but all I know is this is the first time this is happened to me in the last couple of months of playing.  In fact one time I had a higher-level player nuke my workshop while I was away and I fast travel back and as soon as he saw me he stopped, waved and left.  I have no problems getting into it with someone who's a similar level to me but when I used to play World of Warcraft it was considered a no honour kill to kill someone much lower than you.  Guess times have changed!!
---
Man to me happens the same thing a few months ago
---
I have helped down earl 2 times but it always take almost the full time. What weapons are you using to bring him down so fast?
---
Way too low at the moment. I've a decent sized building with two floors, some advanced power stuff going on, a few vending machines, and all but the booze workbenches. Now that I'm looking into decorations alongside the utility I'm bopping my head against the limit.
---
Yeah, xbox.  From what I hear we tend to be less competitive and PVP-prone to the PC players.
---
even skylanders have combat dummies
---
Soft cap is level 50 so it would be an honourable kill.
---
It would be easier and more fun if I had people to play with but none of my friends want to play FO76.  :-/
---
I'd be cool if we could plant a special tree that attracted squirrels. Or a trash pile that attracted opossums. IRL you can put out a salt lick and deer bait, why not add these?
---
so much low hanging fruit bethesda doesn’t take lol
---
This had me in tears
---
&gt; a higher level started nuking the workshop I'd taken, I fast travelled back like 'wtf?' and they stopped
---
This need some explanation, because when we nuke something, we are not present at the target location and once the target is set, there is no way to abort.
---
&gt; There are other workshops to take and there was no reason for this guy to be a dick.
---
Shops are PvP, everyone knows this. Staying there is an invitation to participate in PvP. Heck it even says so when you take the shop. READ IT.
---
&gt; Also saying that I'm not new to this suburb is just really stupid.
---
Really? You are here for over a month now, no clue how long you've been lurking before. And if you are not here to read, then wtf are you doing here at all? Are you a karma-masochist?
---
I don't know if your mentally challenged or what... Because you say there in the game for our disposal but they have specifically been trying to take out PvP/trap bases. Before you say no they havnt Imma shut you down right now; punji board don't stack now except for glitching them took it out to stop trap bases, took out survival mode, added pacifist mode, changed PvP/workshops because it was flawed and hurt players who don't PvP. There's plenty more too so don't say it's the nature of the game. It was 2 years ago when it first came out its changed now it's not a PvP game at all anymore they've changed it for a reason and if you can't get on board with the change get out! Oh one more thing if they have vendors out they did ask you to come because there's stuff to buy if it's just a trap base take out the vendors oh wait no one would come because there's nothing to buy. Your a joke kid PCE out
---
I wanna know how big rock candy mountain didn’t make it into this game , should have been the intro music.
---
Well... Yet another thing Bethesda doesn't understand about PvP MMOs.  When I think about it the ones I've played always have much less experienced or even no experience for killing someone who's a lot lower than you.
---

There is wild ginseng growing at one of the houses cultist squat in, think its near top of the world somewhere. But yeah, I'd like to grow it in my camp, its very few and far between.
---
Thanks everyone :)
---
Just claim it and leave.
---
Also don't blame it on the challenge when you were actually

&gt; tooling around in a workshop building up resource generators

which is NOT part of the challenge.

What outfits does she have?
---
I also would like more camp space. I look forward to the instanced bunkers but would like some more "regular* space as well.
---
It’s this kind of talk that started the great clip and drop bag of (insert here) in 2019.  Mine was a bag filled with a complete skeleton.  I miss those days.
---
I saw that going diffrently in my mind.
---
I was wandering the northern More and saw a few people on the North road so I swung by to say hi. I came out from behind a boulder so I didn't see what they were doing before I was already on them, but it was three level 100+ characters doing what I can only assume was some sort of initiation ritual. Two of them, one in Power Armor and one in regular armor were facing the third who was only in his underwear. Upon my arrival the Power Armor guy ran straight up into my face and stared me down while the other clothed one started taking shots at the naked guy (who must've had pacifist on since he wasn't taking damage and no bounty appeared on clothed guy). I started to back away slowly but the guy in Power Armor was staying right in my face. I finally decided this was not a situation which needed my presence and turned and dead sprinted straight out, the Power Armor guy followed me a good distance before returning to... whatever it was they were doing.
---
Again, you're technically the same level. The true WoW comparison would be someone in greens being ganked by someone in full arena gear. Personal opinions aside it's still a valid kill.
---
Explosive bullets in real life ?
---
I meant nuking in a general sense. As in, he was standing on the roof literally blowing all my structures up.  And yes I'm aware taking a shop involves PVP, but in my experience of the last 3 months of playing this game that has never happened to me before.  As as I've stated.  So I think you need to learn to read.  
---
Your last sentence makes no sense... Like... I do read this sub? I mostly read the posts that come through as notifications, but I stick around to read a few more and if I have some time free I scroll through and comment on things... So I'm hardly a lurker. Just because I don't have hours of spare time to make sure I've read every post, I'm not supposed to be here? SMH.
---
Nice. Took me about 90 rolls to get a full set, plus I picked up a few alright piece's that work as a full health set along the way. I'm building my supply of modules again so I can further refine my build.. Looking for all powered.
---
We already have disconnects and random boss fights (Looking at you Queen) with no loot lol. They hust aren't colorful
---
I did actually try this mod. Most I found was 3 others in a server who used it. Unfortunately. They were German. Soo I gave up.
---
Breach and Clear I only go to when I'm really low on resources and high on space in the stash. You get so much stuff from it. It's easy enough solo too, so I tend not to join if someone else has it on the go.
---
Always hit the other one when it comes up, but I've only seen it twice since starting to play the day this hit Gamepass.
---
So as I stated multiple times, over the last 3 months of taking workshops I have always stuck around to play a little and no one has ever bothered me. But I guess you guys have really schooled me. 🤷🙄
---
The bushwookie delegation has issued a statement : NO.
---
How is a level 350 the same as a level 55? Makes no sense to me.  Ah well.
---
It's the best events imo
---
If the patch 22 damage nerfs are applied to NW too, NW will get a lot more toxic. Stackable damage is getting nerfed so gun builds will get hit much harder than explosives.
---
Good gun builds rely on stacking at least two damage cards. Explosive builds only need demo for damage to be viable. 
---
Against Marine armor, the M79s will still easily two-shot without needing precise aim. The Gauss shotguns will still shred. Most grenades will still one-shot. The 10mm subs will tickle it and other low damage autos will see a significant nerf.
---
I use a windows app "multitimer" it lets you have multiple timers and multiple groups of timers, great for keeping track of multiple characters.
---
He do be vibing  (also big F)
---
Levelling is soft capped at 50. Beyond that you gain no stat increases, only more cards.
---
I haven't looked into the private servers yet, I thought they cost money as in you have to subscribe to FO 1st or something right? I'm the only one I know who plays, none of my friends do and my boyfriend just wants to play Destiny.  /Sigh.
---
Awesome. 
---
Rather happy about red armour, ship in a bottle and PA display. Greenhouse set looks pretty useful too.
---
Good job man! Still trying to get my perfect full health set. What are the 2nd and 3rd roles on the pieces?
---
Well that explains why none of the weapons and armour go above level 50, thanks!
---
Thanks
---
I don't get why we have such a limited "gardening" selection anyway. We should be able to plant every ingredient for foods, as well as some herbs and flowers (if not for the function, then for aesthetic). It would incentivize cooking more if we could grow the necessary plants.
---
Nice, I’ve got full uny and vanguards on 2 characters.. can’t get unyielding or Vanguards on my latest character used 40 modules so far.
---
RNG had to run out at some point!
---
Not that bothered though, I’m happy to get a usable set of full health to run with at this point and refine it over time
---
It works on ps4, has nothing to do with the consols FPS. Its more of overloading damage calculations due to server connections/latency.
---
Thanks. I did this last night. Used one near a train station.
---
My luck has been similiar so far. The strangest was when I looked at the map there were 8 or so players in the event. When I FT in, had the mine to myself.  
---
Solo time, I guess? Had Earle almost dead, then got feared into one of those burny/acidy things. Came back to a full health Earle.   
---
A lot of lag I find.  
---
Honestly though, pretty fun event even when you don't complete successfully.

i like the shovel

it makes ploink

Heh, what I do is say "Alexa, remind me in 20 hours to get scrip" or "buy gold" or "get caps".
---
Alexa is always telling me to get shrimps or camps.
---
Ive had the opposite . 6 earls so far, have not seen any issues that are being reported here, except for some frame rate drop. Playing on PS4. However havent had anyone use explosive weapons(rocket launcher, mini nuke) grenades or teslas yet. Supposedly that can bug Earl out. Also havent died in the event yet so havent experienced any of the death bugs.
---
This morning i dropped a nuke and only 3 people including myself showed and it was the smoothest one yet. Right after it finished someone else dropped a nuke and we had 8 people, it took longer to do. I think because then increased wendigo spawn slows down the focus on Earl alot.
---
I think a good server between players and stabilty/lag really makes the difference.
---
Shall give that a try, thanks. Guessing it needs to be done every time Iog in?
---
Oh I’m so fucked, my main weapon is a lvl 15 handmade with no effects (someone gave it to me), and the ammo is already expensive, and my other main weap is a marksman’s sniper rifle
---
Hmmm thats strange, had few times same feelings, but after cleaning console i didnt noticed that (for example at uranium fewer was dude with Tesla and nothing happend). Not sure that's solution (cleaning: torx 8 and compressed air) but my game experience was much improoved after this. Ill try to pay attention for to Tesla issues, mabye im wrong. Cheers!

They'd have to let you grow squirrels too, or Herbivore would become a significantly better mutation than Carnivore.
---
I mean yeah, that's the problem. $15/month for Fallout 1st. For me...it's worth it because I play enough and have friends that play as well. I hate pvp so having access to private servers when we just wanna farm workshops or build camps on our own is perfect. Plus the scrap box is absolutely necessary for me lol
---
Exactly that. That's why I say it's greens vs arena. The only real advantage a higher level player has is the time they've had to grind for gear and sort their build.
---
I gave up after 75 rolls on the gauss minigun. From 75 rolls, I got 0 junkies. I only wanted a junkies/faster fire rate one (so 2*), and a faste reliad would be the cherry on the top... but no... RNG refused it.
---
I take a bit break now.

Sniper rifles have been hit HARD! Max level legendary Handmades will be fine, but yeah early game they'll take up too much ammo!
---
 As you pointed out and many others, PVP hardly happens at all, PVP in adventure mode is just poorly designed with no win condition allowing greifers to ruin your experience with no real penalty other than easy to get bottlecaps. 
---
They can just keep coming back even if you somehow did kill them. 
---
In the end it's not that well thought out. 
---
IF someone wanted to ruin your day they can basically making it not even worth spending the materials to even build it up unless you NEED certain harder to get materials like nuclear material.
---
I just don't understand the try-hards who say don't use them when we want to get materials. 
---
Who the fuck are you? PVP is the thing i do the least in a workshop same for most players, i am going to live in fear and not gonna use workshops because 5% of my workshops get attacked a handful times a month?
---
Weapon with 200 fire rate or more, using bugged effects like 23 hit,bash, limb damage,instagating or junkies. Two shot mini guns with the bugged effects are the easiest since they essentially double the damage calculations being done.
---
Shotguns with bash,33 and limb damage will almost always bug qhen used in vats. I have a vsmpire bash pump shotgun with zero shotgun perks and it one hits super mutants in vats.
---
I had a similar reaction, but as a creature of the wasteland in my own right my first reaction to meeting him was to best him in the art of combat. It was also to show him off to my father, but the glorious bastard vanished before he could get there.
---
Since then, the mix of emotions and details of the event have scorned me and now I see mothman as a rival of sorts. Because no matter how many times I kill a mothman I really am never satisfied. I am obsessed with mothman, yet worship is the last thing on ny mind.
---
Also, a little tip I have for those who wanna fight him, if you find a mothman at a cultist camp that can't be hurt then attack him anyways. Load a few shots into him, beat him over the head, whatever. You'll piss him off and you may find an extra pair of eyes following you on your next wasteland stroll. 
---
(I think it's because for regular mothmen, if you attack them and they run away they are likely to come back and you attacking them and letting them despawn counts as the same thing. Not like I would know for sure I never see him!)
---
I overheard someone listening to a college lecture on some medical stuff. It sounded as if they were in the classroom and not just listening to a zoom meeting. This was pre covid.
---
They have a fridge you can buy that reduces the spoilage rate of foods. I'm sure an ammo box that not only gives you say 100-200 stash limit just for ammo, but also takes you directly to the ammo page of the stash when opened,  would sell like hotcakes.
---
Honestly, I'd drop some atoms on that.
---
They already added vault targets, should've made them into a damage sponge but as usual... That requires a bit of coding which eats into profit margins.
---
What build/weapons?
---
Wild mutfruit, wild corn ...
---
I dont use builds that require food. They spoil so i dont see a point.
---
Oof.. Picked up a fireman helmet for 30 caps, no idea it was so rare.
---
Good luck with your hunting! Gonna put em on mannequins?
---
If they want to restrict us that's fine, make it so we can only plant x amount of something in our bases. As long as you use green thumb it shouldn't matter anyway. Everything in your camp grows super fast.
---
Girl, I was just playing about it being about gender.  😓 don’t cancel me
---
But why can’t I feel any magic when I use the magic gauss minigun?
---
Ehhhh, I'm undecided. While it's true that camps could use a bit more utility, there should also be resources that you can only collect by going out into the world. It's probably no coincidence that tarberries and cranberries help craft some of the more useful aid items.
---
Wait till you are walking around the world and spot a pair of massive red eyes as he is watching you or the sudden no warning attack out of the blue.
---
What effects are on it? You using penta barrel?  
---
Normal mobs it wont trigger muxh because youre not laying into them long enough, but bosses it should trigger for
---
I honestly found it worse on a toon that knocked out a full set in the first couple of rolls. I've now got to hope they introduce something interesting to do with all the modules I farmed thinking this would be a ballache.
---
I have so many treasury notes from  E A R L E  but I keep forgetting to cash them in. I’d have a piece of SS/T-65 if there wasn’t a low as hell bullion cap.

---
I dig it, my favorite underground camp was one that straight up looked like a bunker from the outside, you even went through a powered door.
---
I'm not sure what the problem is, they're restricted by the same things as a normal camp, it's not like Ark with people underground shooting you with rocket launchers.

---
Ahaha, I had to keep it PG rated because my daughter would love singing along whenever I'd play 🤣
---
I didn't tho
---
Please, if you would.
---
My husband and I loved this game but couldn’t tolerate the mess it was, so we left a year ago. After Wastelanders came out, we gave it three months knowing there would be patches. We came back last week.
---
Why does the bounce-back damage bug seem even worse? The damage from my minigun literal takes two steps forward and one step back all the way down the enemy’s health bar, and my shotgun seems to swing wildly from modest damage free firing to one-shot-kill through VATS (no critical). Perhaps most importantly for one of my themed alts, why are energy weapons so completely and utterly useless, despite his rolls and mods?
---
Will this new system rectify this stuff?
---
Not sure if you ever tested, but I'll admit that I'm wrong.
---
I just solo'd Earl, killing him in 7 mins and only using 1500 or so rounds of ammo.
---
When I fight in a group he usually takes about 10 mins to kill and I'll burn through 2-3k rounds per fight.
---
And the damage numbers I'm seeing when I fight him solo are the same as when I fight in a group. So, my apologies for being dismissive of you.
---
Exactly! I miss that.
---
I don't know why, but once I stayed into the boss room and fight and decided to head out later.
---
The counter went to zero nd thing started rumbling, and I was at the cavern where you wait for the debris to clear before earl, when screen went pretty dark, I could still see with the flashlight and run and got to the exit.
---
The M79 kills me more than anything and the Gauss shotgun is a  close second. Most people struggle to hit with guns but never miss the explosive weapons.
---
I can't either. Definitely something wrong with Gatling Plasmas.
---
I'd consider first if I had a couple friends who played... Some of the things like the Scrapbox and the survival tent look cool!
---
I do lode baring all the time, the little treasure things getting mined up is a good source of scrap and caps. Sometimes even chems! Breach and clear though is rarely worth it mostly because its not a "!" Event so I have to pay a caps fee to fast travel there.
---
I may have 10000+ caps on me at all times, but every cap is sacred to me and even picking up one off the ground still gives me a rush.
---
The red fireman and fire breather helmet aren't so rare, just the white responders one.
---
Ah yes, I had the red normal one. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Could you elaborate on how to use it? I'm a bit confused but the idea behind it sounds great.
---
This is not an MMO.
---
24 players per server is not an MMO.
---
Yeah, more experience + access to more perks and more caps to burn... But I get your comparison about greens vs. arena gear.  A lot of games have "power level" beyond the level cap. I'm just surprised that fallout 76 has such a low level cap, considering it only took me a short time with minimal effort to reach! I still haven't built my power armor or finished the Miner Miracles quest yet.
---
i.like using the airplane seat, if you place it just right it cant be seen but accesed from above ground

I do the same, it’s the only event where I’m cool with going afk. There is basically no further benefit other than tokens which I’ve never seen get anybody anything worthwhile.

---
It's in the atom store in the camp section for like 500 atoms. Not something for me, but if you do buy it can you let me know how it works (limited space, etc) please?
---
Well I do now
---
Really? That's your argument? I'm the mentally  challenged one?
---
If PVP was supposed to be taken out of the game and no longer a factor then they would have removed all the traps by now.
---
They would have removed the Perk card that allows you to do more damage to other people's camps.
---
They would have removed the legendary weapons and armour that either have bonus to damage to other players or adds protection from other players. And those items would be restricted to just NW.
---
Them fixing the spikes so they can't be stacked only makes sense due to very few items being stackable in the first place, like storage containers. You can't balance nailed boards on top of each other in real life  unless you nailed the lower spikes into the board above, thus no extra damage.
---
The devs no doubt did not intend the spikes to be stacked for extra damage so they fixed it, but if they were so against PVP traps, they would have simply removed them and all the other traps, or just make them so they only damage NPCs.
---
But they didn't. So yeah, like it or not, it is the nature of the game.
---
And if players couldn't use vendors to trap people, they wouldn't be traps, would they? If you get past the traps, which many people do and post on here saying they do, some players end up getting some good loot for their efforts because those making the traps something don't think anybody would get past, or want to reward them for their troubles.
---
Some players want to play nice and help others, while others want to be the bad guys. Let them.

It's already a thing, It can spawn in nuked zones at the fissure site prime

ahh target dummies, the thing that exists in most modern mmos

If you play on pc I wouldn't mind opening the private server if you ever need to take workshops. Me and my friends usually play in public servers to do events and trade with vendors but the private server's always just a click away
---
I'm sorry, is there something everyone knows that I don't?
---
Well if I hadn’t read this while on the toilet I would fully admit to wasting time reading this. But thankfully the fact I was dropping a grumper, I didn’t actually waste any of my life.
---
Not at all, I tend to build big and always enjoy when people look around. I have noticed how shy people are though when I explore theirs. Its pretty funny.
---
No he means food/drink and chems.
---
Lmao! Mine are being retained literally on the other side of the planet by my ex so I haven't seen them since February. Hopefully the Hague Convention comes through for me and I see them soon because damn life's not the same, almost not even worth waking up anymore. Cheers for the laugh 😏
---
This is something I myself participated in, but plenty of months before Wastelanders ‘The Gang’(™) was going to the ammo factory since we needed to make some 5mm ammo. We found another trio of people already there, of which they also owned the workshop. We all eventually congregated on the roof and decided to try cramming 6 people into one singular port-a-potty. Long story short, 6 people, one bathroom.
---
Only twice out of 7 fights did I not die right always after looting him. But when I was able to run and loot everything I still had 30 seconds left. I did not stay to loot the smaller enemies. But that chest is not worth it to me. Yesterday when I fought earl I just let myself die after looting him and I got taken outside and waited until I got my rewards. Which was a freaking rolling pin and a cursed harpoon. Which is my second one and have not gotten any other cursed weapons yet. I just want the mask. I have all the other plans so I just need mask and pickaxe and shovel.
---
I deeply regret grinding for this power armor too. I was so excited to get he last plan put it all together and try it out. I have not used it since and will probably scrap it.
---
That’s what popcorn is
---
Yes. Im not sure how I feel about yet another loading screen added to this game. Their are already too many.
---
And people say DMG like this is balanced.
---
Well there you go.
---
A lot about the levelling system is a bit weird. Hopefully the one Appalachia update will help with some of it. Part of the problem is xp gains are relative to character intelligence, not level. I think this is due to change but currently mobs give a set xp + int bonus so if you invest your first 15 points in int you'll fly up levelling.
---
This post had me laughing up until the Julie dissing started, how dare you
---
I know but stacking glowing meat and nukashine will be a bit shit for commando.
---
I don’t know. But I do think this is why no one joins them.

Angry Turtle just posted a video showing they do still work, but there's a heck of a lot of fixes happening this week. Maybe some magics got fixed and others didn't? Or the PTS latency is an issue for your magic weps.

Energy explosive weapons were so bugged and powerful that any changes to the basic energy ones would make the explosive ones even more ridiculous.
---
In PTS, the legacies seem to be put into their place (powerful, but not ridiculously), and shotguns dealt the same damage for VATS noncrit chest shot and regular free aim shot.
---
It gives a good foundation to properly care for non-explosive energy weapons, but I can't guarantee this to be the case for the first weeks after the big switch to new math model.
---
I saw that that downthread- thanks for reminding me! It took almost 2 minutes to kill an albino deathclaw. The only reason he didn't kill me first is because I have Mysterious Stranger and he draws so much aggro away from me..  thankfully!!! I am almost level 200 but still squishy against big claws (Yao guais and deathclaws get me every time!)

Personally I dont and will not use FO1st so I dont have an endless scrap box. The ore those events give really weigh me down and I dont have room to store it even after they are broken down.  Also I have almost all the keys and passwords in my Misc tab that I can not drop so it takes a long time to scroll through all that just to find and toss out the heavy ore. Simply isnt worth it too me.

You still did. That could have been a cathartic dump but instead you read this.
---
Somewhat missing the point; Part of recaculating the math is that its' less taxing on the server as well as making player damage a lot more predictable. From a game-designer point of view it would be stupid not to make this move.
---
Things will probably need to be retuned from here, but this is absolutely the correct path.

I haven't helped lower levels much, but I deliberately pick up .38 and 10mm until I get to like 1k rounds or so and pick a soul to give either ammo type to. I figured it'd be nice to not have to worry about ammo while working at a lower level.
---
Was it Moth-love Thursday?
---
I personally think Bethesda needs to implement a system for public events that doesn’t allow players to join unless they are at LEAST the recommended level for it.  I’ve done so many SBQ’s full of useless low levels that buff her so badly it’s impossible to complete the event.  It says lvl 50, not fkn 12!!!!   😤

Cranberries are abundant in cranberry biome. With X2 picking I get around 30 from 1 cranberry glade. That's more than enough. There is also that farm in forest where you can find them too.
---
I'm not sure above tarberries but perhaps they should create few dense zones with them around the world.
---
And uhm, allow fridges to stop spoiling so I could sell my expendable Cranberry Relish. I always have like 30 sitting and rotting.

Otherwise game will slowly turn into "sit at camp and resource will generate automatically"

😆
---
I dont think anyone ever tries to decrypt them. I use nukacrypt as well and they update the codes once a week
---
I did too.
---
You mean legendary perks?
---
Ahh....good question.
---
In cranberry bog you can get 30 of them in a less than minute
---
Have to watch out for him. In NW he's a bush wookie that waits for prey to foolishly go running by, then he pounces.
---
For my rifles sweetwater's special blend and company tea. With herbivore and party boy/girl that gives a huge perception and ap regen buff.  Other than that I either use psychotats or overdrive. Bobbleheads if I got them.
---
Lode Baring would be SLIGHTLY more interesting if the tokens didn't way a tenth of a pound each.
---
It would still be a pretty bad event though, with trash enemies and no legendaries.  One Wasteland will at least boost the kill XP.
---
Because target dummy counts as NPC , because it's literally NPC with a static model. Its too taxing on servers if everyone had one in their camp
---
For me, the token rewards from lode bearing are hot garbage so it's not worth my time or effort. I don't mind breach and clear so much but it's a pain in the ass to make sure you hit all the containers because they are bugged so that if a teammate opens one it will be empty but for you it still appears "green" like it hasn't been touched... and I just can't be bothered with that little guessing game. I pretty much only run that event with someone I know well so we can each stick to one side or something.
---
I have a jffr and V33 but I don’t feel any magic when I use it on SBQ and colossus wedigo
---
Haha really? Which cabinet upstairs?
---
Yup, I have better things to do with acid than making steel or aluminum.
---
I have been seeing president trump on alot here lately playing a few matches on xbox. I wonder if he could talk to someone at bethesda about adding another map to nuclear winter
---
I second this, we need more plonks!
---
Its a very satisfying sound when bashing a ghouls skull.
---
Try a normal minigun.  The gauss my have to low of fire rate, it what 130 with penta?
---
I mean you don't really even need a lore reason for the change but okay, if you want to go that route instead of a in game update or simple options menu choice. Tinkers bench for the physical upgrade, terminal for the firmware.
---
Ya, its the dark blue fireman outfit and white helmet that are rare.
---
The others are guaranteed from early quests.  My buddy buys a lot of them from player vendors.
---
One place to look for those is the robot vendors in Flatwoods,  Charleston,  and Morgantown.  I've found the white helmet once and the outfit twice just checking there.
---
I stand corrected, I had no idea. Thank you for setting me straight!
---
Came across a C.A.M.P. in the dried up lakebed in Morgantown. A wall with vaultboy and girl statues had some, interesting... labels on their bodies. The wall behind them had valentines lights and the words, "Anna loves Mike's C**k." They also had a stairway of stacking bear rugs.
---
A guy had a camp by Whitesprings station, trader trap, vending machines where is a box with security doors and a F*CKING FLAMER.
---
Jokes on him, I didn't have sh*t.
---
Dude, /s, chill out, I actually found your post having the same question
---
I'm assuming the coding is based on 5 pieces, given the reports that 5x of the same power armor pieces works.
---
Yeah, I misread the OP.
---
The one with the folded up uniform in it. It also has a miner hat (blast-able) but the fireman hat won't budge but thats okay as it's not a Firebreather one.
---
I've been doing it so long with one grenade I catch it on the fly lol Might take a few blasts on your first to dislodge it.
---
Exactly this. Also it's annoying trying to access upper levels of ores
---
I had it bug out 3 times and had to redo the entire fucking quest over and over ....
---
Not all popcorn ceiling is asbestos
---
And I lost a ton of lead because I got the respawn glitch with 70 tin cans on me :(
---
i was killed by a trap camp last week, my fault, i run light foot but forgot to crouch.  it was in whitesprings.  i snuck through a silo and nuked his camo.  thankfully he stayed in world.  went to his decimated camp and dropped a "you've been insulted" note then messaged him"you kill me i kill your camp.  he was PISSED!  we bantered for a while then i said why you mad you killed me unprovoked? then blocked him.  was a good day, i got xp for the silo run and 3  3\* in the golf course and pissed a juvanile trap camperr off!  ;D
---
What can I do to make it now
---
I wish they would fix this however Angry Turtle just released a video this morning showing they are still working. I think it may just be you man.
---
But a very large amount of it is. Asbestos was used up to the 1980s because the use of it already in storage wasn’t banned.
---
It's been said many times before
---
I had no clue before this game; I remember reading some article about the real-life basis for some locations in 76, and this place was supposedly the basis for the "Cranberry Glade" location in-game, and the larger Cranberry Bog area in general.
---
They're all a pain in the ass.
---
I've scrapped all allies and my Collectron as the dialogue is mind-numbingly repetitive and fucking droning to a suicidal level.
---
Then paper or styrofoam was used as a replacement from the 80s
---
I like watching the low levels die...it’s a good learning experience for them. If I have to put the event on my shoulders, I will.
---
This level 84 motherfucker standing at the entrance of Foundation wearing Flannel Shirt and Jeans with the Cowboy Hat, shouting at people in area chat to "hand over your fucking water cooled bonesaws or else". Hilarious and tramautic.
---
Hey! Don’t speak about my 26 razorgrain and 21 corn like that! I’ve got things to make!
---
Yes but some people said the explosive effect of gauss minigun will double up the firerate to above 200
---
And caps plz
---
Gooogle... you’re our only hope
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
Try the normal minigun it works for certain. I had an instagating 33 hit one and it was nuts.
---
At least Ace's dialogue is humorous, despite hearing some of the lines dozens of times they still make me smile.
---
You can stack psychobuff and overdrive if you take overdrive first
---
Makes sense Bethesda is great in research. As a Masshole, that lived in DC and now in Hburg the last few games are spot on. New Vegas I can't say. My last visit there was a fucking shit show, chem's.
---
Do you have all 8 codes?
---
I get excited and then very nervous.  💜 I throw up hearts and just sit in my diner seat.
---
Plants and turrets are decorations in my mind. I don’t use them  for their intended purpose. Turrets should be low budget cost but a max of 4.  They don’t do a damn thing so to give them a huge budget cost is insane .  Pieces of garbage get pwn’d by mole rats .
---
I'm still recovering from Fasnacht version..... Lord he broke me mentally.
---
Totally naked dude in the main area for ACP, he was AFK and spinning.  He must have been stuck from the last instance because we had 8 people down there.  It was just so random when you pop down and boom, naked dude.
---
Odd but not surprising. Thanks for the info
---
I've had a stack of bluescreen boots lately. Not sure if connected to or not. But yeah some wierd shit.
---
Whole game just drops.
---
Most of the time i just wave to them but sometimes there are people that stare into my soul for no reason.
---
Do I need both the "quick configuration tool" and the SFE? You link to the 1st one but on the nexus is the second as a requirement
---
Latest Angryturtle video shows that the magic weapons still work. It was uploaded 2 hours ago.
---
Thanks for sharing
---
THIS- like I don’t care if people use my workbenches or take my crops but whenever I get back to my camp every single door is open and ofc my turrets didn’t take care of the army of mole rats that are now in my house... that happens a lot
---
I do Breach &amp; Clear if one of the daily/weekly challenges is to complete an event. May not be great XP but it's an event and mole miners count as a creature which is another challenge that frequently pops up.
---
Awwww she just wanted to be a part of it!! 
---
Nukes come and go but family is forever.
---
Thanks but this one is the only want that I knew that was unique and I kept it
---
I don’t have any walls from the atomic shop so it’s a floating mess
---
Its is nice in that regard, a bloodied build or junkies build pumps out solid damage as well, i read somewhere that as of yesterday in the pts they’re officially fixed so here soon my gun with just be awesome not god tier
---
Now I feel less alone
---
Probably a golf course map...
---
And I'm on my phone which doesn't lend to lengthy and clear descriptions, apologies for that.
---
Check people's vendors all the time. I've got 3x Responders jumpsuits doing this. One for me, one for ally (when I can be bothered bringing those annoying af allies out) and a third as a backup thanks to Beth not allowing up to lock/protect gear.
---
I was hoping I wasn’t the only one
---
Th e budget is way to small. I don’t consider myself a big builder compared to most of the camps I see but I can’t have half the things I would like.
---
I did this to myself at campfire tales with pulse mines.  VATS targets the mine not the enemy.  I laughed so hard.
---
Been playing since B.E.T.A. but after the first season I tapped out of the game, currently - for the foreseeable future.  
---
Personally for me it's no longer the game I used to love. Bethesda started chasing the retention crowd. Currencies and daily caps etc. Before Wastelanders I loved just logging in and feeling as if I could just be in the world, without this lingering pressure to "get the things done!". Just casually heading here and there, farming or doing events, it felt open ended and more like a sandbox.   
---
Could I have ignored all of that and continued my game-play loop? Sure, I guess.. But the game just started to change shape for me after that, then more and more the development seemed to steer toward Mobile-esque features or currency farming. It's as if post Wastelanders everything seems to be driven by retention mechanics, and less on the actual strength of the world, the sandbox and it's mechanics.   
---
Don't get me wrong, some good things have come from it, the group feature is nice, some of the new events have been great but overall the flavour has changed too much for me.   
---
Dare I say, I actually miss the pre Wastelanders Appalachia, it was quiet and atmospheric, it could be chilling and ominous, but always so strangely inviting.   
---
Now it's just repeated dialogue of wooden NPC's and continuous currency grinds for things you buy outside of the game.  
---
I will admit that I miss it though.
---
Will that is I wanted to know, so I can't get the paramedic again I will pay more attention on vendors since now. I'm looking for cop cap to.
---
Thanks man, I’ll try it later
---
Explosives are extremely OP on PC too. Gauss Shotty and grenades insta kill with massive blast radius. The M79 with lock and load 2-shots faster than revolvers and scoped levers and you just have to shoot it in the general direction of a player.
---
I scrap them.
---
That’s a little disheartening about the legacies. Knowing this is going to get “shut up” downvoted for asking this, will Bethesda just reroll to explosive perk on legendaries? I don’t see any logical reason they wouldn’t, and I don’t consider “because overpowered players getting butthurt” as logical.
---
Thanks a lot, so it's better to start a new character, usually I don't pay to much attention in outfits on vendors now I will do. Also the info of vendors is useful.
---
Now I'm little less crazy
---
Explosives are extremely OP on PC too. Gauss Shotty and grenades insta kill with massive blast radius. The M79 can one shot with enough buffs and two-shots with demo alone. If you use lock and load, the M79 fires faster than revolvers and scoped levers. It's sad that precision weapons have lower DPS than weapons with 30ft blast radius.
---
I agree, but the cosmetic designers and the game programmers are 2 different teams
---
I've heard far too many people screaming at their partners or kids.  💔
---
Thanks I will do it
---
Baited a line of vending machines after seeing ammo sold at five caps a round for even .38's.
---
Im sure he wondered why sales were *extra slow* that day.
---
I agree that bugs need work before new functions, but the cosmetic design skins by the artists are not really taking time from the developers working on bugs and the workings of the game... until the cosmetic element happens to clip into the floor or obscures field of view and needs adjusting...
---
"WE" need more mininukes. there is no I in Communwesm
---
Free range
---
The only Brahmin I’ll kill are the ones next to the Wayward, and that’s *if* for some reason I have no food
---
I was mostly kidding, but these are great ideas vault dweller 👍🏽👍🏽
---
Well technically it has a whole mission dedicated to learning about him but you also have free range where one is always at those.
---
I forgot about that event, I still think it’d be cool to have an event where we learn about his origins like with the SBQ
---
The vendors don't naturally sell it. I think people get the outfits, even the rare ones,  and sell them not knowing what they have. 
---
The normal paramedics jumpsuit, firebreathers suit, and police suit aren't that rare. I find those pretty regularly. Heck you can probably message people you see wearing them and offer to buy them.
---
But starting an alt character and running through the early quests isn't too difficult either.
---
I am hoping that the ‘nerf’ is outweighed by the fact that there will be a solve to the current issue of my enemies completely regaining their health due to bugs (and because of this i think my commando weapons will be fine), but my bloodied snipers are going to take a big hit.
---
Why are u living in stealth armour?  Onky use it for nuke zones
---
As long as vendors have to be located outside of any personal vault it wouldn’t bug me very much.
---
Nice try Iron man
---
I decided to run it on my private. Did the nuke. Equipped what I needed. Entered the instance. Turned the wrong way and left to Appalachia FML
---
Off the top of my head, Level 50 Double Barrel Shotgun. Quad ammo capacity, 50% more limb damage, 25% less AP cost in Vats. 15 Strength, all shotgun Perks, full Adrenaline, Full psychopath, Full better Criticals.
---
Takes about 3 minutes to cause Earl to mutate, and 5 minutes after that to kill solo.
---
I am finding the lower levels immensely helpful with revives and spawn control.  Always drop them extra stims before you drop into the main area.  We had a level 34 last night go full Leroy Jenkins and run right into Earle.
---
That’s what I do. After Earle goes down, I farm the bodies until 5 secs remains then I switch over to my CSS. I plant my survival tent as soon as I can, dump the junk, take off the CSS and let the rads kill me and then fast travel back to camp.
---
Mmm....  If you count that everything was nerfed, then we could say that bloodied stayed the same, but its effectiveness was in fact reduced, why? Because it was a thing that will double or triple the damage? (Bloodied was at best 95% extra and adrenal a 50% right? Sorry I never used bloodied that much) but now instead its a flat damage bonus (that depends on your hp) so at best +145% damage (instead of the 1.95*1.5*other damage bonus) compared to junkie its a 95% flat damage difference that means now you dont lose that much by not going for a full health build (ranged damage wise because you still lose at everything else)
---
PD: can someone confirm how instigating works now? Its a flat extra 100%? Or as it actually says double your damage?
---
Power Armor ones are good to sell in a vending machine, as are enclave plasma rifle ones.  Some others do ok especially if you have them cheap or are in a lower level area where people haven't done the unlock grind however if you need the space you should scrap or sell them to a vendor.
---
I mean if you’re taking requests one small one I’d love to see is piercings, would love to have little deathclaw teeth hanging from my ears
---
Dear Marx, Im(were) not Communist enough!
---
Fire and poison resist legendary perks still require a matching set of armor.
---
Take over workshops and build random towns or weird layouts which have actually helped me create some of my camps on accident. Boredom happens frequently with this game
---
It's not just that gun it's happening with my LMG aswell, didn't occur to me that it might be down to the prime receiver
---
The mothman lore is some of my favorite. It's a real myth from West Virginia!
---
Ran around fixing low level player’s broken C.A.M.P.  items.
---
Are you on ps4? I have a spare responder paramedic outfit, though you probably don't want that one.
---
Lmao that would be fine with me. It would be something different
---
Don't rush it, besides there are many builds, some become outdated and you loose the let's say 20k caps we spent on gun, to 40 scrip because it's no longer good. Like god knows when the magical weapons no longer work, so why not invest some caps in it while you can 🤔
---
Done this event twice today.  Both times it freezes on a black screen after exiting the mine.  Never get rewards, never continues.  Have to close app to get out of the screen. 
---
This is a colossal waste of time
---
That was because they didn’t put a cap on the stacks applied so if you were using anything automatic you could easily get hundreds of stacks. It was poor programming.
---
I just found the Wanderer a couple days ago and the constant guitar playing is getting on my nerves already. I thought I'd fix it by putting her guitar on my roof. Nope! She just magically teleports there and starts strumming away. Oh well, her quests aren't any different than the others, so back to Sofia I go.
---
Well I supposed that, but sure i will run other character, just want to reach lvl 300 with my main first for the legendary perks.
---
Planning in a bloodied heavy gun, I'm running junkies rifleman and never tried anything else I have 100+ levels stored but I prefer to keep this character like it is.
---
Not really messing with people, more like "What you did to become the Wastelands' Angel". I dig it tho
---
If there's one thing FO76 won't get, its basic QOL improvement.
---
Thank you for understanding! I do want a Raider Punk and Grahm radio show
---
TY!
---
It was cathartic to know that I took a big grumper on this post.
---
They need to just make it reset at the daily reset time and not based on when you used it the previous day.
---
For me it was that mortifying moment when I realised that the loot in the motherlode boxes was shared, not instanced, that made me avoid breach and clear. The times I snatched all the loot in front of lower levels like a marsupial MF, flashed before my eyes. It made the whole event awkward for me.
---
I’ve read if you take overdrive first, it stacks with other chems. And if your melee, glowing steak and mutant hound steak stack.
---
are you sure it wasn't a mole head? if so, are you on xbox, by chance?
---
i have [no reason for asking](https://imgur.com/a/IYDChkR)
---
Idk man, personally I just think people spend more time xp farming than being low level explorer. Especially with "Line in the sand" and Glass caverns, also a load of xp from cook out events that were just happening. So naturally they leveled up faster than regularly doing quests and walking around.
---
I was at a camp in the Cranberry Bog near Watoga and this player started throwing plasma grenades at the ground inside the camp, ultimately killing himself. He respawns nearby, and continued throwing grenades at the ground to damage himself. He didn't die again, but he never went to grab his loot bag and eventually just ran away.
---
Yeah it’s barely noticeable damage currently. Have you seen how high enemies poised resistances are in One Wasteland? 
---
Virtually every enemy has an extremely high poison resistance on the Public Test Server of One Wasteland. 
---
So I’m a Month when One Wasteland our Stangler Heart sets may be completely useless.
---
Oh, sure, totally forgot, yep you have to install SFE also.  
---
quick configuration tool isn't a requirement, it's just an easy way to install mods
---
Thanks a lot, sorry pc
---
There was talk to bring this to F1st.
---
Not sure if your issue is the same but I came across a bug with Weapon Quick Swap - weapons with modified ammo receivers (changing the ammo the gun uses) results in a bug where the game expects the original type of ammo.
---
I made a video if you're curious:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mks3o9sVLsw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mks3o9sVLsw)
---
That was a thing? Sounds awful
---
I had something similar with a bloodied limb damage faster reload ultracite snpier. But when I tried to swap to it I had permanent fists only. After punching Earl in the shin it would equip the gun for about 10 seconds.
---
Seems as though this post is making folks aware that this is a thing, which is good! Underground camps are fun! 
---
I imagine they would have to make serious changes to how the game world is constructed to prevent folks from building under the map. It'll never happen.
---
Is there data on how much camp budget a prefab takes versus floors and walls (aka Doors &amp; Corners build?)
---
My doors and corners build is barely anything compared to other people, but I’m banging the budget limits to add anything.
---
Yeah that one lol. I probably shouldn’t be in that sector anyways
---
It’s really frustrating because it takes awhile to get the set and once you get it you just get shit on.
---
I only keep ones that seem viable for my current build and I scrap the rest. Don't even like selling them because no one ever buys them even when they're free and they just take up weight in your stash.
---
What about small letters? They see to run out the budget clock faster than I would think.
---
Some people place her chair backwards against a wall so she can’t sit down. Maybe worth a try?
---
What do you mean? Atomic shop has wallpaper skins for walls but other than that it's all in the game. You have to find plans for things like barn/steel/brick walls, those aren't atom shop items
---
Pumpkins are Orange gourds. We use them for halloween to carve Jack-o-lanterns. Also pumpkin pie and as another guy pointed out pumpkin grenades. Might be something else too. Not really sure.
---
This^^^
---
I've ended up using the coloured cycled lights to give ceilings some sort of design, instead of the ugly design it always has
---
It’s really frustrating because it’s a grind to get the set but once you get it you just get shit on because it’s “special abilities” do nothing
---
Wait what.
---
I’ve been looking for so long to find something that’s just base game?
---
Needed this since launch, its too tedious to build up a workshop only to disconnect and have nothing. Or even be in build mode and the defend event starts up.
---
Nah man I joinee soon as it started.
---
from what i have seen, No. they need a full set of matching armor (wood, leather, etc.) or a matching set of Power armor (Excavator, T51, Etc.)
---
I can go to Arronholt homestead, get 10 (which will last me long enough anyways) and then get 10 pumpkins to turn into the pumpkin house.  One stop shop
---
Im bad at time. I thought it was half an hour
---
As a I on-auto sniper build, I am greatly concerned about this. I have only recently been strong enough to start holding my own and I don't have any perks related to automatic weapons.
---
I'm playing one day and I'm yelling at my 3 year old who's chewing a peice of construction paper "spit it out, get that out of your mouth". Repeatedly  and I had my mic on this guys like dude theirs nothing in my mouth please stop yelling at me (obviously he knew and was jkn) he was funny reminded me of Ben Kissel from LPN lol.
---
I mean I got a bunch of screws from the wendigo spawn, so there's that.
---
The same as the responder bot?  Damn i didn't know I've seen her a couple of times and completely ignored her lol thanks for the info
---
Calmex or overdrive+small guns bobble head+ballistic bock+ Tales from the west virginia hills magazine15% more damage to wendigos
---
Hey, sorry I just see this. I found both the outfit and the hat! Thank you for offering to help
---
Part of me is ok with that. As much as people shit on it, I have this feeling that the more serious players all have it, if for nothing else but the scrap box. And personally, those are the people I'd like to see building over some of these floating squares builders.
---
no, was in pve
---
Yup, finally crafted my strangler PA yesterday, it's now back in my stash, back to T-65 :)
---
You have 10 characters and do this grind every day? 😱
---
What's really annoying is that it often switches to a melee  weapon when I'm in a fight with the SBQ or something.
---
Tato Salad is definitely the way to go for HP boost if you are a herbivore.
---
Project Paradise
---
The mask is rather old, it's the raider skull gas mask with an officer's cap ontop.
---
The game gives you a warning sometimes when a server is about to shut down/go offline. Or maybe when it’s time for maintenance. Just switch servers or wait until the maint. ends.
---
Doesn't always mean that, sometimes they'll shut down a server so they can "open" a fresher on and try to keep things from lagging too horribly
---
12 every day
---
1hr normally and have saw up to 5hrs before
---
This.  12pm EST.
---
*Can we not have a limit on gold and script at all?
---
I believe it is a more appropriate question.
---
Some I scrap, some I make low level items and attach and then place them in the world for others to find
---
That's exactly what's happening.
---
Something’s wrong lately. I’ve missed out the whole Meat Week. It was impossible to log in or stay connected.
---
My question is: how do you get your caster to do 600 to 800 ish? 
---
I dont have instigating yet, but I can't imagine it gets that much higher. Mine atm is a prime executioner. Depending on the enemy resistance, I've seen it crit for mid to high 300s.
---
You get the barn set pretty often for completing workshop defense events. The brick and steel ones can be bought from some of the NPC vendors in the southern half of the map. The standard wood one I thought you just started with but maybe not?
---
If you're on PC I have butt tons of plans and stuff if you need help =)
---
Thanks, I am!
---
Everything should reset at the same time at least. It's a QOL update I'd live to see.
---
If you’re a low lvl with no legendary weapon than you probably won’t even notice a change since you don’t have many if any damage multipliers . 
---
They’re nerfing the math not weapons
---
A few weeks until this is sorted for ya.
---
And to add to what you said you also have to grind for Ultracite mods from the Queen to even modify the Strangler Heart Power Armor. 
---
I’ll still stick with my SH for the Radiation resistance, but I won’t grind for anymore “Vault Raid” Power Armors. Bethesda nerfs things to readily with Fallout 76 and it’s starting to suck the fun away.
---
Shutdown imminent is just when a server is getting closed due to it being running for a long time, if you leave you'll be able to rejoin a new server no problem.
---
Yeah I thought 2 I actually play and mules was a lot 😂
---
It would be ridiculous to allow people to wear armor over it. I would personally like to know immediately upon meeting someone if they're a stealth armor food build or not. It's arguable the cheapest way to play 76 imo.
---
I’m on PS4, I get decent foot traffic because I’m right next to The Wayward. My PSN is 
---
Bibleman-_-
---
So this only happened a couple weeks ago. I was running around bored on my unarmed character when I noticed someone in the Forest area with a bounty. They were probably level 50ish if I remember right, and apparently just hanging out at their diner camp. I came in and was sort of surprised at the layout of the place, and said they had a nice camp. To which, they thanked me then asked me to kill them. When I pulled out my power fist, he got all excited and was like “Oh boy! Are you going to fist me to death? I love getting fisted!” In a rather flamboyant manner. I was cracking up by the end of the whole encounter, and ended up giving him some advice on where to find a few things in the game. I also bought enough stuff in his vendor to give him a bit extra caps. Was totally worth the laugh.
---
I stalk players wearing a Fauchnaught Jester Mask and Clown Outfit. I stand completely still when im in eyesight of my victems, when they turn thier backs I move closer and closer till im right behind them.... I gotten my girlfriend, my brother, and his girlfriend to join in as well. Each wearing a different Fauchnaught mask.
---
Unfortunately they won't increase the STASH space, with fallout 1st providing the scrap box. If they can get people to pay extra for additional storage, they won't change it as long as people still pay for it.
---
I’ve done SBQ hundreds of times only encountered one dick move when someone killed it as soon as it spawned (PS4). But many times the players took their time and used the magic only to shorten the fight for everyone. If you’re happy that magic is completely removed, you probably also enjoy spending a lot more time and ammo and failed events for a one star rolling pin.
---
Thank you for letting me know
---
If your prices are too high, I turn off every light I can in your camp.
---
How is the number of loading screens different from any other fo game?
---
I would play it again and see what you think we can't tell you how you like games
---
Only ones I keep are Power Armor Headlamps.. i junk the rest
---
What counts as a magic minigun?
---
XB1
---
Are you on XB1?
---
Or don’t have a limit what a crazy idea

Yes but rumour has it the upcoming changes to the damage system fixes all this nonsense.
---
Nerfing the math nerfs the weapon mods and the perks, 10% perk card makes a big difference in being able to deal damage that early on!
---
I think it is. I’m running a mutt character now. When I feel bored I use weaker weapons and different tactics to accomplish what I’m doing. I’m at the point now to start a 2nd character and build another camp.  But make this character specialized in a fighting tactic.  Stealth or maybe bloody.  Keeps it interesting for now.
---
Yes NW is still a thing and the world is more expansiv3 and becoming more and more so they are actually investing time to make the game better
---
If you already tried this I apologize, but my dumb ass couldn't figure it out on my own, so...
---
You have to chose the items in the atom shop in order to make them.
---
in order to place your camp you pull up the favorite items wheel and press (triangle on PS4)
---
Yes
---
There's an entire questline dedicated to it and the people who searched for it and it leads to the imposter event. They also just released a bundle specifically for the sheepsquatch. He is loved.
---
So have I bud. It's happened way more often than I'd like.  I haven't failed the eventvat all and getting ammo is really not hard. Fuck me for not breaking an already broken game and playing legit though, amirite?
---
That’s the countdown timer for panic mode to finish what ever task you were doing. Kind of like GPS arrival time. It’s a time to beat
---
Lol yes I also tried on low level scorched too and it yielded the same results
---
I think you mean crotch ;)
---
Shutdown imminent is server specific, unless systemwide maintenance or an update has been previously announced. Almost all updates are on Tuesdays. Bethesda notifies us when this happens. You’ll see the announcement in the upper right corner of the main menu screen. Otherwise, when a server has been running for 24 hours it gets shut down.
---
Yes, how else would I get rid of all those scrip items?
---
It's actually quite easy, running 2 accounts at the same time. One stays on base as a drop off and the other plays.
---
E.g. one nuke session on WS is about 4-6 runs and nets somewhere between 8-10 scrip items, besides around 100 of each stabilizing agents. Then there is West Tech and The Burrows, both are also very good for scrip.
---
I find low ranked players and offer them gifts. Than drop spoiled meat and run away
---
Hey, it's the same post we've been seeing since this sub began. Watch it blow up with everyone agreeing and then make sure to upvote the next time somebody posts this. This is an echo chamber and we're saying it to each other and not being heard. Such a shame. I'll upvote this and the next time it's posted mind you lol
---
If you find an observant radstag, they can leas you to hollowed out stumps that sometimes have outfits and plans in them. I got the white firefighter helmet for one of my alt characters this way.
---
Worth it, I got it at release, and hated it. I started again a few months ago and it’s so much better. Spending atoms wont make it much easier, unless you get the monthly subscription.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject

---
Here's the problem with these posts. Take Red Dead, a well renowned game with a lot of praise. I got it free with my PS4 and can honestly say it spent longer being installed than played. Not because it's a bad game, I just personally didn't find it very interesting at the time. FO76, which on the other hand has mostly been considered a massive disaster since launch, I'm around 3k hours into.
---
 Tl:dr It's subjective.
---
Thanks, I'll check that out!
---
Did u know there is a category of builds called stealth builds?
---
I know they mentioned it during Quakecon so I’m hoping that means it’s still on the radar.
---
Thank you for posting this.
---
It is legit because there’s no hacking involved and most of those weapons were considered trash tier so they aren’t even duped. What’s really broken is the reward from the scrip beast queen, a one star armor piece literally means three scrips, weapons is five, while talking to Ward rewards you 8. For the time and ammo invested to get this it is insane. Any means to shorten the ‘boss’ fights is a welcomed feature.
---
Did u know u can achieve max sneak without the stealth armour and even without the sneak perk?
---
You can just stay in the mine collecting stuff until it collapses and it’ll spawn you at the entrance with everything. The end chest isn’t worth missing out on the ~300 loose screws.
---
I said this a while ago. There should be a ghoul tied to a tree/pole
---
This is when you put them inside your vault, with a maze to get to them.
---
I did the same thing on respawn my first time playing it.
---
Definitely not legit haha
---
You're welcome to your opinion bud
---
I don’t see how it’s cheap, you only get stealth no other benefits
---
I’m working on an app right now that keeps track of all the different timings for fallout 76. Kind of pointless but I’m just learning app development right now and seems like something I could make easily enough.
---
Stealth at all times, makes clearing content so much easier
---
The same argument could be for all armor types and builds. I'm not asking for a buff to stealth armor, just the ability to equip clothes over.
---
I usually try to loot the wendigos as I go as I’m always getting low on ammo (unless it’s my shotgunner ) , I stayed in a few times but twice that was the on,y time I died :(
---
I have stealth at all times. I’m not seeing your point. Stealth suit gives up way to much to use outside of nuke zones
---
I'd be happy meeting in the middle and making it so displaying items doesn't consume camp budget AND stash space anymore.
---
Aye. But theres a few different traders. One with possibly the rare apparel. A other with the bow plans ans abother with drug plans.
---
Getting perfect rolls and add ons &lt; free suit from quest line
---
This is true despite being downvoted by the food build population
---
It's in one of the buildings outlying the Whitesprings resort. There are several little shops that look like more hotel rooms from the outside. Maybe it's supposed to be a florist.
---
Easier to do on queen but earl is a lot harder to get the magic effect tow or with how much he moves or when you get staggered
---
I use a handmade for running around with and a prime fixer for boss fights.
---
Don’t need perfect rolls. You’re kinda new right?  Total stealth is acheiveable without the stealth suit or perk. Currently wandering around undetected in a solo
---
This right here! If you join a server and see people in the nuke zone at the mine, fast travel to them. Sometimes the event ACP is going but with no "!" and you'll be in the event.
---
All you need to do is go to the atlas observatory and look for the big boxes with a BOS banner beside them.  Put your scrap in in 250 scrap increments.
---
And yes, the durability on my handmade is way better than my fixer
---
Yeah ... that sucks
---
Fair enough. It's still frustrating though. I was in school and didn't have time to get this armor. I didn't even have Twitch, as I've never once had a reason to have a Twitch account. I only learned about the armor recently, when I saw NPCs in Crater wearing it.
---
Recently finished the Brotherhood quest line? You gain a full set for beating it but it's just marked as a weightless chassis until deployed for the first time.
---
Ahhh the condescending type, did some one in stealth suit kill your or something and you’re salty
---
Go to the observatory and there should be boxes that look like stash boxes and each time you click on them it takes it from your inventory.  Not from your stash so you have to carry what you want to deposit on you.  Ideally someone has a survival tent nearby so that you can get what you want and deposit with ease.
---
Its been a bit for me since i went but I believe theres a bunch of Blue/black Boxes with the bos logo that you can deposit the current scrap needed
---
I’ll play wit u when u wanna run it
---
Gourds are plantable, but pumpkins are not. It's especially irritating because pumpkins are a type of gourd.
---
Thank you
---
Nothing you say will make the fact that it is a free item that grants stealth at all times. You literally don’t have to find a single piece of gear all you need is a decent gun and you’re golden. The cherry on top is you don’t need anything for nuke zones
---
For some reason on the SBQ and Earl I can’t get it to do anywhere near the damage I see other people getting out of it. I normally just use my BE .50 for them because of it. I run full Commando perks and concentrated fire but just doesn’t seem to get me what I’m looking for.
---
Yeah that might be it thx for clarification. 😊
---
? Sorry if that’s how it came over. How would anyone kill me? I don’t nw and in pacifist all the time. If u take the sneak perk your at 75% sneak. Add 15 points into agility and your pretty much there. As a couple of sneak armour pieces your done. Or if u run low health 5 pieces of Uny you’re there. No need for the sneak perk
---
No sir.
---
Speaking of that, projectiles **DO NOT** go back out of the ground. I have learned this with first hand experience involving a bloodied fatman and 30 health.
---
One month later and this is still a thing for me.
---
Ahhh. The stubborn won’t listen to advice type. Don’t whine u can’t wear anything else then when someone try’s to help you so that you can.
---
No there wasn’t, the talk about workshops was just making them stay after you left and joined a private world. Not uploading and loading blueprints
---
Timer is a much better idea. A set daily reset time would screw a lot of players, not everyone is playing at the same time. Actually no limit is the best idea but I doubt we'll ever see that. BSG doesn't see to care about our QOL, just that we are logging in daily and spending real $$$.
---
Are you using sneak perks? They make up a considerable park of my damage. Plus a lot of food buffs and drugs
---
got it, uploaded it into the online app and I see everything. Is there a way to filter through the items without having to upload the file again and again with different filters? Also, is the file overwritten each time I click O to extract, for example when I get new items or on alts or does it create new and new itemsmod.ini ?
---
I mean, you were playing nuclear winter before joining adventure.
---
Ooooooor you could just wear stealth armor, I don’t see how you’re arguing that it’s not more efficient. There’s a million post complaint about how long it takes to get unyielding ss armor if people want to rock just a hazmat suit with stealth so be it. And if you think you didn’t come off condescending I can tell you don’t have many friends irl and you’re probably the type to think people are ass holes when in fact the ass hole is you
---
I was level 20?  maybe lower.  I had a quest sending me to a radio tower, forget which one.  There were a handful of super mutants inside that were totally kicking my butt.
---
I was crouching down and sneaking up the hill to them (no chameleon), taking 2-3 shots with my hunting rifle, then running down a hill and hiding behind a player's CAMP that had a bunch of turrets.  I did this maybe a dozen times?  Was making very little progress on the mutants.  This lvl 180 (?) comes out of the camp, crouches down, and follows me up the hill, and then runs back down with me.  He goes into the camp, comes back out with a gatling plasma, and shreds all the super mutants in about 20 seconds.  Big "thumbs up" emote all around, and he goes back in his camp.
---
I can only imagine what he was thinking "What do my turrets keep shooting at?  What is that crazy lowbie doing?  There, they're dead.  Now I can craft in peace."
---
The other day I became wanted on purpose and had players chase me all around the map without fast traveling. Normally I’d be pretty easy to catch, but I know how to fly across the map using springboard traps. So I claimed a handful of workshops first, built launchers to the other workshops, became wanted, then just started flying from one workshop to the next. It took about an hour before someone got me cause I was arrogantly AFK for a minute. But it was a fun chase
---
OP is literally asking to wear a costume I don’t think you can read
---
Look in the big bend tunnel there’s 3 - 5 concrete there
---
Put your nuclear keycards in the vendor for us 👌
---
I’m in full unyielding ss armor this means nothing. Would be nice to have skins go over stealth suits though absolutely
---
I’m not really spec’d out for any sneak perks at the moment
---
I should have cleaned out his loot bag but didn’t bother.
---
Because I run bloodied. So with 5 pieces of standard one star Uny against a stealth suit u give up carry weight/accuracy/stealth/better crits with luck. And u can wear the outfit I want over the top. Oh and u have better armour ratings.
---
I would definitely recommend them
---
How about when you reload in the middle of a shot with 150 rounds left? These energy weapons are bugged to hell
---
Did you get mobbed by the spawn? Usually once you kill the ones in Earle’s chamber, the ones that spawn in the tunnel will chase the toons running back to the entrance and leave you to your loot rat ways.
---
If you’re on PS4 I have a responders firemen outfit for trade
---
Yep. And u can’t with a stealth suit but can with a stealth build. Obviously that’s to difficult to comprehend
---
After killing the Queen Mirelurk.  You can get 20 easy at Arronholt, in probably less than 30 seconds.  Just saying it's easier there.
---
Explosive makes it degrade quicker. Maybe look into a b2525 fixer or handmade
---
I always loot the Charleston station and prison for lead, and the military base for springs. 
---
There is also a mine that yields a tooooooon of lead, but I cant remember the name.
---
Which perks specifically? There was a lot that we were promised when it was introduced that we haven’t gotten yet.
---
Always bother in situations like that
---
At least it wasn't a meat tenderizer?
---
There seems to be multiple "Motherlode"s....

Why would you even post this.

If a person gets the rad barrel, shouldn’t they be able to grow nuked flora too?  Raw flux!
---
It mostly depends what you're after but if you just feel like going nuts Fort Defiance is good to clear out for a whole bunch of stuff.
---
I main using Prime Plasma Gatling and a Prime Handmade. HOWEVER USING THE D PAD FOR FAST SWITCHES MAKES ME GO TO MY FLAMER. 
---
I also found out that for the D PAD will not switch you out for ammo that you do not have. SOMETIMES THIS CAN GLITCH, and thinking that you do not have the ammo for your weapon because it sometimes won't count prime rounds as your ammo.
---
YOU CAN FIX THIS BY HAVING REGULAR ROUNDS FOR YOUR PREFERRED GUNS. EVEN 1 WILL DO.
---
This is why it always switched to my flamer, even after months of me scratching my head. Because the flamer has no PRIME ammo. But I would sporadically be able to switch to my handmade instead of my flamer. I found this out after I picked up 5.56 rounds from a dead super mutant.

What system are you on? I can help if it's PS4.
---
Good tip. Will have to look for them. Thanks!
---
Pc
---
I could be surrounded by 7 level 1s and still prefer that over one guy with a hacked M2 with the laser splitter. As he insta gibs all the Wendigo spawns so no one else can get the XP or loot.
---
I'll revive everyone in this game with aggressive intent. Except those guys, fuck those guys. Take the respawn timer, dick.
---
20 tick rate servers = magic weapons for ever and ever ....
---
We lost that RNG too. Oh well good luck.
---
No, filter works only before file upload - however, I'm working on this right now.  
---
Yes, file will be  overwritten each time you "extract" items.  
---
Right now this was made intentionally, since in order to be able to append the data, I'll need to read all the file content and if there are tons of items - it might seriously impact performance in the game.  
---
However, I might add an config option for those users, who just want to dump all their items, but it's not on a priority list atm
---
One reason they limited the number of players to 8 is to give people better sense of a team especially in a confined space. Apparently no efforts can make dicks function like team players.
---
I believe the general consensus is that the Handmade is better if you're not planning on running a VATS build due to the lesser recoil, while the Fixer does slightly more damage and of course you get the sneak bonus.
---
I prefer the Handmade all day, though - I like how it looks and "feels", and I'm very much VATS focused. Plus the new camo skin coming with season two looks very good.
---
I think the reason you're durability is so low is due to the fact that you're using an explosive weapon. I used to have a BE Handmade that broke far more frequently than my current B2525.
---
In my experience, a special tree that attracts squirrels is called a "Bird Feeder".
---
Nice! I got my 4th piece yesterday only missing a chest.
---
My character is the liberator but are you for real man?
---
I don't see any problems with it either and it needs to be left alone.  There are times I can see both the 10% and 60% effects active in the pop boy at the same time.  Just ignore it and move on.
---
No limit is best.  But the 20-24hr reset screws as many players as a set daily time would.  
---
I currently often run into issues where one day I get time to play at 10pm.  And the next day at only 3pm.  
---
Both ways have drawbacks.  But at least if it was a set time.  You could know without logging in whether the reset has happened or not.
---
* points Gauss shotgun at back of OP's head. 
---
"Always has been."
---
pvp with 20tic rate servers = 🤢🤢🤮🤮
---
pve makes more sense.
---
It’s the best shotgun in the game. Why wouldn’t it still be good did something happen?
---
True that. Those furry rats are mad clever when it comes to sneaking into bird feeders. So perhaps we could have a bird feeder that attracts squirrels and chickens. Two meats at once!
---
Because the clean sink doesnt come with a water purifier. We can probably get it from the atom shop soon tho.
---
It can hardly handle when I change how it organizes my pip boy. If I keep my food on spoil it always lags versus keeping on alphabetical. I have no idea if that relevant, but it has issues.
---
I think it works the same way as Borderlands 3. The enemies will be tuned per person level wise. So if you see a level 100 super mutant and he has 1000 health. But the level 10 sees a level 10 super mutant wjth 100 health. You're both fighting the same enemy in regards to the damage you can deal and take. But the higher level person will be getting much more xp and better loot to compensate. 
---
This system has the much anticipated benefit of making all low level public events appealing to high level players. Because enemies being max level means you won't be cursed by getting that God rolled legendary- from a level 35 enemy so it's only level 35.
---
How would a set daily timer screw people over. As it is if I have a long day at work and can't get on until late then the next day the vendors won't even be reset when I'm playing because I had a late start the day before.
---
OK, thanks, this is great. And what do you mean impact performance, it's only active when I choose to extract items, right?
---
Dirty pipes?
---
Object cleanliness does not determine source cleanliness =)
---
Great idea 👍
---
Even without perks sneak is 2x damage. Probably the single biggest damage modifier in the game.
---
The big issue I have with the gauss shotgun is that, D-pad becomes inoperable.  I have to go into my pip boy, switch weapons to use d-pad again.  During SBQ and Earle I find myself dying because I cant chem up or switch weapons.  Going into pip boy to pick what I need just (literally) kills me.
---
In my experience, even without a God rolled weapon, damage perks or adrenaline. Gatling Lasers are just the best for heavy bosses. Their DPS combined with the total damage in each fusion core means you aren't going to be wasting 10,000 5.56 rounds. And you'll actually kill him pretty easily. 
---
The worst part about solo'ing Earle is you're the only target he will aggro to. So you'll be taking more hits and dodging more often than a group.
---

Running a melee build and carnivore serum eating glowing meat makes me horny

Wish granted.  However, workshops are now too powerful so we have to bury a single molerat under the workshop so you can never claim it again.

I have chronic migraines (military). I have a blue light filter on my PC, phone, and tablets. That is why there's an orange-ish look to them.
---
Someone else commented the exact same thing ~3-4 weeks ago.
---
Never heard it, so I’m immune, I guess.
---
Allright, yeah, that might be annoying if it would lag even more. Thanks for the info :)
---
Noob question. I run full UNY for my armor. Would it be worth it to switch out a piece of UNY to use a piece of Chameleon armor as well? I usually sell all of my stealth boys and the Chameleon serum only works if I’m not wearing armor
---
Yes why
---
That sucks :( Can you not message other players over the PlayStation network like you can via Xbox or Steam?
---
... in your opinion
---
I agree entirely with the proposed change.
---
Those are probably hacked weapons. The magic weapons can burn Earle an the SBQ down pretty fast. But it still takes like 10-15 seconds. (Magic weapons seem to be compounded in damage when more people are shooting the target at once) There exist a few hacked weapons that show 2000+ listed damage as well as have the laser splitter attachment. So they can quite literally instant kill the Sheepsquatch Imposter and kill Earle and the Queen in under 5 seconds.
---
He’s asking in the post for that to be changed what can’t you get. Lmao you’re being willingly stupid this is no different than any request post. This isn’t possible and he wishes it was. No amount of “just do this” is gonna change what he wants from the post dumb ass
---
oops you're right...sorry not a native speaker
---
Up to 88 rolls and I’ve only got me left arm and left leg so far. Most have gone into trying for a chest. 65 rolls and nothing, not even a UNY piece.
---
Nope, you'll get more overall from the UNY. I just use that, 3 points in sneak and escape artist and it does the job.
---
No worries, it was funny either way :)
---
This, this, a thousand times this.
---
No. I’m offering a solution. Stealth build is preferable in every way to stealth suit. Plus he can wear an outfit. It’s not getting changed so that’s what you do. I’m done.
---
Of they did that it probably turn into some sort of death timer due to bugs
---
I just kill it.
---
He most likely has a stealth build that’s what you don’t get, why does it have to be one or the other
---
How do you get the meteoric sword?
---
Breach and clear you get a lot of garbage ores, I'd rather run lode baring and harvest the iron nodes for steel alone than sort through loads of uranium ores and raw crystal. 
---
As for life baring itself, I practically ignore the auto miners until I'm done mining myself. The only problem with the event is that the claim tokens can only be turned in there, and 100 claim tokens is 10 lbs. If I'm waiting to cash out a jackpot I can be walking around with 8.5 lbs of claim token doing nothing for me.
---
Angry Turtle just posted a new video. Magic still works on the PTS.
---
You’re very slow, vaccinated since birth confirmed. Your head is so far up your own ass you just couldn’t understand that he’s a stealth build that uses stealth armor and wants to wear outfits. You just had to use your autistic powers

It's the only way I can feed the addiction of Radium Rifle crafting to learn all the mods... So fucking close...
---
There are other good sources of wood as well like the beaver dams east of Watoga and that civil war fort up at the top of the map, so I recommend going to those places as well. Item refresh is based on a 150 item cycle I think, so the more things you pick up the faster your wood resources will reset
---
Meh.  I've been in logged in many times during noon EDT and only got hit by it once.  BGS supposedly put logging in to figure this out.  Problem determination has been a challenge on this (pardon the pun) just like the FT bug.
---
Same with lode baring and the ore deposits, half the time you interact with them they only give you one ore before you can't get anymore despite still giving you the prompt to collect from them.
---
Respawn on a teammate it puts you back in the cave
---
My build pays off after 2400 hours ahaha.
---
You can but you have to exit out the game bring up the messenger and send a message.  I typically stay away from doing anything if it's not in game.
---
 A server chat would be extremely handy. You could tell the whole server you found the responder bot or the dead lady with the camera.  Or ask if anybody wants to team up and do some end game events.
---
 I can think of a million reasons why a server chat will be extremely handy to everyone on the server. I'm sure there will be a few D bags and Spammers but that's what the block or mute button is for on the text chat.  There are usually only 20 players on a server so I don't see that as being a big problem.
---
The wanderer is the best companion so far imo. As long as you build her chair in a way that it blocks her from sitting, she just walks around my camp doing whatever. No depressing space talk, no lame old dude jokes, no lamest raider of all time... just a happy lil ally that is banned from playing that fucking song
---
You can get 50 lead from the weights in the prison yard too, not a great deal but for 30secs collecting and scrapping it's not bad.
---
Mm sounds legit.take care.
---
Ha ha my mind immediately envisioned The Fly
---
Strictly anecdotal, but my current CAMP is the first I've built almost entirely of prefabs, and it did make a big difference budget-wise versus building with the snappable wall/floor pieces.
---
It has a chance to be in the containers on the Motherlode, It's fairly common but is always level 25(I think it's been a long time since i've done this one).
---
You left the event and not completed it. You are meant to escape as in run out once Earle is dead
---
Someone finally found the gaming terminal in whitesprings.
---
I think you need to traverse the whole map for certain daily to pop up so I travel the whole map.
---
hey, you don't apology at all, there: you are just blaming your daughter!
---
One last question, how do I disable it to get into Nuclear winter?  With other mods i just move the fallout76custom file away from where it's supposed to be to disable them.
---
That would be a consequence of dying at that point. Some players have the same thing happen when they keep dying over, and over, and end up missing Earl because they're stuck in a 60-second respawn timer.
---
Will try!
---
Seriously. U need to ask why u need a stealth suit if your a stealth build?????
---
Interesting. Could you test both weapons without the Tank Killer perk and see how they perform? Technically that should make the damage gap between Junkie's and AA even wider, since armor penetration has diminishing returns the more you stack it.
---
Correct, I am stealth/sniper build, stealth armor frees up perk space for other things.
---
Bethesda will reply when there's a nice post about cool stuff.  They occasionally "pass on" bug reports.  But absolute bare minimum basic gameplay stuff *that should have been there from the start*...  \*crickets\* every time, without fail.  They are a garbage company, I wish someone competent could buy this IP from them.
---
It is legit.  
---
I could screenshot, crop, upload to Google photos, then upload to imgur copy the link and THEN post that like I always do.  
---
Or take a picture with my phone it's automatically uploaded to Google, upload to Imgur and then past link. Much faster.
---
Ok thanks I always panic when it says get out lol
---
I'm pretty sure this trick will work with this mod also.  
---
If not - go to mod manager: [https://prnt.sc/u8167c](https://prnt.sc/u8167c) and choose NW mode, then click Apply
---
Was at the Whitesprings browsing someone's camp. As I finished shopping some dude in power armor runs in with a fatman and launches it at me at melee distance. Dude dies and owner of base comes in right behind him. Only thing I could do is throw a confused emote.
---
Oh nice! I know that spot! I sell pretty much all my ammo for a cap a piece, drop .38 ammo around the vault, and have a vendor specifically dedicated to low levels where everything sells for 5-25 caps. Rest of my plans sell for half price, but if a low level is interested in them and sends me a message, I'll drop the plan for them for free. Got a note on the front porch as well telling new players to message me if they need any gear.
---
Worshop persistence was suppose to be a feature that would be added to FO1st but has yet to happen and probably never will.
---
Pray to Todd.
---
A persitent workshop is a persistant workshop. All Bethesda said is that the workshops would stay, not how they'd do it. But right now FO1st doesn't have 3/4s off the things it was promised.
---
It probably would and I suspect that's why AA was better when my buddy tested the. 50 cals. The heavy guns onle get one source of armor penetration (perk) while the rifles have both perks and magazines
---
Great, I see it was modified by the mod manager. Thank you again

Just once. Worked for me.
---
You can die in there as well at the end and you’ll spawn right outside the mine then.  You just have to wait there for the timer to run out to get your rewards
---
Even better when it's a Ghoul somehow under the map... or getting stuck behind the doors at Poseidon.
---
She won't teleport to her chair if you put it facing a wall? Sort of how like Sofia will teleport to her console and even clip through walls to get to it?
---
Sadly I'm on the Game Pass version and the SFE dependancy isn't Game Pass compliant yet (probably a week or so according to the author) so I haven't been able to test it out.
---
Are you one of the developers? Because if you are this is a hilarious last resort!
---
I mean... **whats the problem with eating people**
---
Oh cool 😎
---
But people would buy it, which increases profits
---
Aren't the Enclave kind of the Fallout ewuivalent to the nazis?
---
Only 8 allowed in the earl instance. If anyone downs it, they all get credit. However, that are some people that hide and get credit for doing nothing. I call these players, sonichus. Because they are ugly and are ugly on the inside.
---
*weeks
---
Painful!
---
I's still PTS. I wouldn't be surpriced if they changed how the AA effects work too. Would not make sense to nerfs everything else and leave AA as it is.
---
So do I. Im courius is there any bug related to budget, Im pretty sure that creating stuff and destroyin it later makes bug happend. Time to time Im replacing stuff, redecorating and im almost convinced that my budget is smaller each time I change smth. My camp is located in these energy pillars (high voltage metal constructions - dont know how its called in english) and it fits exactly the metal construction, so if i wanna change place i have to destroy or store everything. That's why (becouse campus fits into metal construction) when im changing something i have to store walls etc (almost everything to the foundation) - that's how ive noticed that there probably is a bug, each time I change smth the budget gets smaller. Not 100% sure but pretty convinced.
---
I know roughly where to find bags of cement with guaranteed spawn, but it's still not enough. I like my extractor, I can make a nice stash and just move to a next valuable resource :p Like I know about lucky hole mine with lots of lead, but it's still not enough if you craft ammo a lot. I like sitting on a resource deposit :p
---
&gt; not great XP
---
That, and the fact that chances to get legendaries from "non special" Mole Miners is 0% (or close).
---
Um yeah who else are we gonna blame? Trump???
---
Heh heh. Quite a "what are ye doing in my swamp " moment.
---
Not in my experience? I have her chair set really close to a desk with a tv currently, she hangs mostly around there but she doesn’t play ever. In my previous camp I had the chair really close to a cooking station (just like a little campfire where people would chill) and that worked fine as well. I’d never put it just against a wall cause that just doesn’t make my camp flow
---
The guy getting shit on is saying you don't need the sneak perks for max sneak, just high agility and possibly a sneak bonus on armor. Having a mix of legendary effects works a lot better than a suit with about the same Dr/ER as a shrouded wood set.
---
Same thing happened to me. I did probably 75%  of the damage but play bloodied so had died about 3 times by then. I died right before probably the last 1000 damage was dealt to him and he died while I was waiting to respawn.
---
I was board so I started a new character to test it, I built a wood 4x4 of 4 floor, 8 walls, 4 roofs, and one door. It takes up the same 3% as the cabin with a door (without door its 2.75%). But if you add x4 wall archs so its not just a block and matches the cabin roof hight its 4%. They are the same x4 space area.
---
However a red rocket garage is also 2.5 without active features. However with features on it has it's got a powered wall door, a side door and x3 light sources and the cool rocket lol. When you include all that it probably gets to 3.5% budget space  (including the small generator to power it up) but it only shows as 3%. 
---
Now here comes the crazy part the red rocket garbage is bugged. In the second image I shared with you its showing up as less than 1% somewhere probably around 0.50% of camp budget stored by it self. I had to store the cabin to get a accurate number of wgat budget it takes up, which should be 2.5%. Lol even with the wall door, generator and regular door it will only take up 1% budget for that giant thing lol. Hopefully it doesn't get patched lol.

Do you have healing factor? I removed mine and have had one single instance of it in a week, when before it was all the time.
---
Mine make 2444 damage for shot, yes is still good.
---
I already had it from the atom shop bundle
---
Lode Baring seems such a waste of time for little reward.
---
No if he was the dev he’d just move on to nerfing things instead.
---
I didn't know they sold it before. Might be why they only now added it to the legendary run
---
Did not work for me but maybe the event had ended or someone took my place.  On xbox FYI.
---
Remember when you launched the ghouls in Fonv? The flight of the Valkyries playing. The sense of accomplishing something.  Getting Euclid's C locator. Making brass shells dude, I miss that so much. Went off track there.
---
Because only the sink is clean, not the water. The only clean water you get comes out of purifiers. The rustic sink, water fountain, water well, etc. all give dirty water. I've been suggesting for a while there should be a way to connect the sink to a water purifier with basic plumbing pipes, much in the same way we do with electrical conduit. Doubt this will ever happen though.
---
The pickaxe utterly smacks for a 2H melee build that is bloodied.
---
I thought i was excessive with my 12 razorgrain and 16 corn lol

"It's not a bug it's a feature." Todd.

I'm guessing OP is referring to the Path to Enlightenment event.
---
oh thanks. finished the run some days ago and wouldnt have looked.
---
... said the homeowner to Flint city council.
---
Cleaning and rebuilding database indeed helps but just a little bit...also ssd will help, but then a guy with auto Tesla will come and ruin your game
---
Only found out myself because I accidentally clicked on it 😅
---
Were you using one of the armor piercing magazines on the handmades?
---
The sink is clean......not the water it produces. They got us again.
---
I would love that as well , I have all the essential Secret service plans such as the T-65, the armor and some mods for the power armor I need for my build so I don't really gold just scrip for better weapons , only thing I'm complaining about is the respawn glitch I've been hit by it 4 times already during the Earle fight and all those times I just remain dead on the floor while the randoms kill it then I just respawn outside dead and I gotta abandon the server cause I'm just locked
---
Thanks a lot! Nearly forgot about that. Claimed it again now.
---
Ironically... OP is the safest one of the two of you.
---
Aye. Piercing mags on all of them. The guns are pictured in the link.
---
You're welcome 😊 we earned it
---
Invite them to a private team.
---
Name those 3/4
---
Junkie's will only increase base damage... AA will still work for the whole number... I wonder how energy damage and AA will be impacted. You got any energy weapons to test?
---
Did much better than me, got my Uny set after about 200, maybe closer to 220, and I've still got a few 1* : /
---
till the next patch assuming current PTS goes live
---
Neat.
---
I don’t get it either, but mods have removed this post most likely cause it’s promoting an exploit. This isn’t a damn exploit, it’s a camp building glitch. Same as double sided walls, round camps, stacked stairs, floating objects, the rug glitch, etc. I fucking hate the mods here on this sub, so restrictive about casual ass topics
---
so there is no summary...
---
Why can't we plant everything we find at our camps? If there's natural vegetation and we have the same thing at our camp, we should be able to plant it. How are we supposed to "heal Appalachia" if we can't grow all the things? Lol
---
Horde
---
Drop people propaganda fliers. They get pissed when they think it's a legit gift lol
---
how do i do that? im sorry im new to the game
---
It just works, all damage is getting reduced next patch.  If they fix the vats and high fire rate problem too, shotguns will be garage till they fix the healing bugs.
---
Back in the day, I would camp on top of senneca rock the tip of the mountain (the point thats hard to get to)
---
Then go around busting up claimed workshops until my bounty was a few thousand, then sit at my camp and rain down mirvs, missiles, and orbital strikes on anyone trying to climb up to me.
---
It was pretty fun having nearly everyone on the server trying to climb up to me to claim an 8k bounty all while I'm taunting themandchucking every explosive (nearly zero dmg, just for dramatics) I have at them.
---
Supposedly if you wait 5+ minutes you can eventually respawn. It’s worth claiming the event loot IMO. Played with a guy who I told this once, and it took 7 minutes.
---
One ore? About 90% of the ore doesn't let me collect any.
---
Well when she screams the fuck out of you it has a nice blue...
---
I don't know about a lot of time but I have so much in my STASH I want gone. I put every plan at 0 caps and what mods I had a 1-5 caps. I sold off a lot of Junk and things I'd been hoarding. I'm going to save the ammo I do use and 2 types I plan to use with other weapons. No more picking up plans if I have the recipe.    
---
Considering the mats to make and repair one piece of SS armor I'm going to need more space. At times I'll see new players heading toward the Wayward and my CAMP is not far N of it. I'll fast travel to the Overseer CAMP load up and do the "Follow Me" emote. I'll drop a few things and then start going through other stuff which shows them I'm going to give them more. I helped 2 less than level 10 players less than a week ago.    
---
Time is more valuable than anything. If I can save new players more time in giving them plans, some gear, and items then I'm going to do it.
---
Definitely :( well anyway, thanks for the video, I didn't know how it was done. Think I'll tear down my communist's tower and make a bunker.
---
So it was helpful while it lasted lol.
---
Man I hate that effect.
---
It is bugged and will occasionally do little to no damage.
---
It suffers from the VATS bug where you will miss every shot even though it's 95% chance to hit.
---
It is bugged and does far less damage than it should outside of VATS.
---
It suffers from Fireproof being buggy and will often kill you if you shoot something beside you.
---
It is severely bugged and will go into a "charging" animation after firing which prevents you from running, using stims etc. until you holster it.
---
It is bugged in first person and won't fire at the proper rate.
---
It is bugged and often won't properly play the reload animation.  If you are deaf you won't hear the clicks when trying to fire so won't know if it's this bug or the charging animation bug that you're being screwed by.
---
It is bugged and does almost no damage to Gulpers, a few other mobs.  Putting 8 rounds of what should be more than 1k damage into a 1 star sheepsquatch and moving the bar 2 pixels is definitely a bug.
---
I'm missing about 50 more bugs here.
---
For short range I've gone back to my vampiric magic shotgun because it will 1-shot anything anyway and is super reliable.  I only use my gauss for middle ranges because the combat shotgun damage falloff is pretty extreme.
---
It does not determine water quality it needs a purifier to do so it just means that you won’t get rads from collecting water
---
I'm about 45 rolls in to the chest piece and still nothing
---
You suppose to imagining it. Anyhow in fallout your safe from the risk of gasoline catching fire ive you use explosive.  .. get it now .. or do i have to explain something else what usaly shouldnt hard to get!!?
---
No timer, no limits. 
---
#EUREKA
---
Haha good to hear! I’ll at least have the video to link when anyone asks about this in the future.
---
I only hate it because it makes it difficult to see and empties my AP bar (I run dodgy).
---
Yeah I used to just restart the game but after I finished working this post, it worked. Good to know in the future, thanks!
---
I am more looking at a global reset... When the clock is xx.xx caps, scrips, gold and scrap Will reset. Not when you have been there and loot, collect or What ever.. Then i dont need to remember My last clock i was there
---
Ive been wondering how they compared. I ha e collected a second set of AA weapons with the same rolls as my junkies just in case lol.
---
Would you be able to report their damage with these conditions:
---
- No tank killer + swift mag (aka no armor pen mag)
---
- Tank killer + non pen mag
---
- Tank killer+ piercing mag
---
Curious to see how the deminishing returns will stack up.
---
If AA+ tank killer and a swift mag is 5% less damage than a junkies + tank killer and swift mag, im switching back to AA.
---
Same
---
It just means that the server is getting shut down because well if it lasts too long the only loot would be in containers pretty much wiping the servers
---
Aye, but any gun with a splitter will be hard to get a read on, I think?
---
Does that mean gauntlets are fucked?
---
The thing is that power armor has a unique effect on all pieces from all sets.
---
Every piece of power armor reduces incoming radiation by 15%, so with all six you are receiving 90% less radiation before radiation resistance is even considered. So 60 rads from a nuke zone would be reduced to 6 by a suit with zero rad resistance.
---
Then, because the math system of the game you end up with super heavy diminishing returns that means more than 10 times the amount of radiation you are taking is almost unnoticeable, so 60 radiation resistance is going to get you to the point in order to lower the rad counter by one more point would take about 6000. Every point does help, it's just not very noticeable. 
---
Also The reason hazmat suits stop you taking rads with "only" 1000 rad resist is because they also have an invisible effect to cut radiation by 90%.
---
To yield the same rad resistance as a hazmat suit or power armor do without their invisible effects would require them to have rad resistance numbers of approximately 6 million
---
Some times it for general maintenance
---
Very interesting. I've been trying to decide whether I should try to find a junkies combat shotgun or stick with the quad double barrel I have now. It sounds like an anti-armor combat shotgun would be better - and shotguns are going to be even more sensitive to armor penetration than handmades. Reminds me of ESO where the meta (last time I played) was armor piercing gear.
---
I could, but that's a lot of work and I have kids and a job :) If I do any more testing I will do a more thorough heavy guns test
---
A communist in a capitalist society that has succeeded helps others succeed
---
Handmade.  It sounds awesome too.
---
Ok that's why I was asking. This is exactly what I was looking for. I barely do any damage to scortchbeats and the new boss. It says the damage is around 1000 but I don't do anything near that. I look up videos and everyone was killing everything one shot. I'm just confused.
---
Collect a few low level legendaries by server hopping for forest hoard events and that wolf pack event. Then I dress in the mole mascot outfit and get low level players to do the obsticle course near the pheasant picture on the map. 
---
Their reward is 2-3 fully modded weapons, a lot of ammo and supplies, the best armor I can craft fully modded, and all the known plans I've been picking up for the past week.
---
The whole time they are doing the obsicle course I encourage them in my best goofy impression. A-huyuck!
---
You’re not the only one I’ve had all the problems dying, spawn bug, lagging to death, filled with noobs, etc.
---
Get out it is so unfunny
---
Good to know and thanks! Gonna be trying this out for sure when I get home from work since the Wanderer is my favorite ally. Like I said, I'm a bit disappointed in how Sofia's quest wrapped up so I don't feel so bad about replacing her lol
---
Ya, didn’t occur to me at the time.  Silly but I avoid pvp.
---
I know the feeling, on baby duty right now (nap time). Id mess around with it if i wasnt on console 😪
---
No tent, no 1600 atoms, no "Fallout 1st" sub in the shop?
---
This shit is so infuriating it alone would have made me go junkies but now Bethesda wants everyone to go full Unyielding for XP apparently so that went out the window with the legendary run.  I’ve had times where I try to FT over a dozen times, moving around, firing then reloading the FTing.  Sometimes it just takes time.  Then yesterday I’m in danger and literally taking damage from multiple scorched and I can FT away no problem.  SMH.
---
FIFTEEN MILES
---
I rp a commie too. I've got a garage and cafe set up, with a farm house and underground commie bunker. Are you on ps?
---
Why would anyone want to have to suffer addictions to do more damage when you can just go anti armor?
---
Yes, it still stands though they should fix it. I dont want to remove it as its an important mutation for my build.  
---
Its good to know that may be the cause. Ill try it on my alt. Thank you.
---
I’m 240, and I use a tse25 pipe revolver. I’m

The emote loop usually works itself out after a couple seconds but I've had a loop last for a good minute before. Just stuck hopping in place while emoting xD

Lycanthropy,  turn into an animal at night.
---
He was shooting heads of  the wolfs from like 1-2 meters, that’s clearly not a good display of magic as even .44 pistol would do the same. Regardless, the OP may also be incorrect as we need testing and data from more people
---
Some truth right there. lol
---
Hyboria(Conan's world)has a lot of  advanced civilization &amp; Grelock looks the part. Conan has the loin cloth look b/c he's something of a barbarian.

" Ever since wastelanders dropped fast travel often fails on PC "
---
The bug has been around since early 2019 when they changed the way fast travel works. They added the ability to fast travel in combat with the timer we see today. This patch broke it.
---
There was this level 600 who dropped 3 in the server and carried ACP, I gave him 2 as thank you.
---
I would like to point out that if you are a gunslinger build, pipe pistols are your highest dps option.
---
If he was a dev he'd be doing exactly this - asking people how they work around a bug, then patching the workaround out so there's no way to avoid the crashes.
---
Don't scrap the one with limb damage, and wait till the one-wasteland patch drops to see if the magic remains.
---
Simply put, don't change what you are doing due to a future patch, where we don't know how it will be. Wait till it lands and see how it is before you start changing stuff.
---
It never happened to me until wastelanders dropped. I was only speaking for myself.
---
I play on Ps4. My C.A.M.P. is a Communist military base, has a Commitron and Comm. Daguerre wearing Chinese Stealth. The base is placed near the SBQ nuke zone in Cranberry Bog
---
Lmao probably.  I think part of it right now is ACP honestly.  I’ve had a lot more disconnects since it went live.  I also crash like 5% of the time I enter west tek but that’s been going on for a while now.  Most places are fine for me honestly.
---
Exactly. That is why i said what i said. AA should be nerfed the same way as other prefixes. Right now it remains the same as it is on live.
---
I mean it makes sense. You don't need to strip down to your underwear to put on power armor.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help
---
You just click on their name in the social menu, there should be an option there to create a team. You and them have to leave the public team.
---
Sent you a pm
---
Probably from the nuclear fallout I would imagine
---
Haha might have to try that!
---
Sometimes, the friend request is someone mis-clicking cause they're trying to fast travel  to the same location you are at.
---
Example, when i was playing this game in my early days, solo, I would get random friend requests when I was at Vault 76.
---
When I was a kid, the bombs hadn’t even dropped yet!
---
Oh ok , I get it. Words hard you

Looting all the ski poles around Top of the World is a good source for aluminum. Each one gives 2 aluminum scrap and there's loads of them laying around.
---
Too far, too far! I fast travel to my local train station even though it’s probably quicker to walk, and it costs 1 cap.
---
I’m on now if you are
---
You can pull the helmet, you have to walk in to the case. I've done it in and out of PA, after the grenade tho.
---
Tell that to my M1050 single action revolver I got from his corpse...
---
If you nerf anti armor the same way you nerf other prefixes, even mutants will be stronger. So no.
---
The name of the game are FFR auto rifles or heavy weapons.
---
What I am saying is, drop junkies and change to anti armor.
---
Nope even worse. Almost every time I die Especially during daily OPS I get the bug. Really hope it doesn’t stay like that
---
No one likes clowns.  No. One.
---
There is the Silver Shroud outfit and hat :-)
---
I don’t know but there is a few mobster items so that’s kind of like that
---
You probably know all this but for anyone who doesn't.. they focused more on the Mistress of Mystery in 76. Fallout 4 had a lot of Silver Shroud material, and I agree, more of their radio plays would have been cool, even if it were MoM that would have gone well.
---
I use Spotify on PS4 so I can listen to NV radio
---
I'll shoot Scorchbeasts sometimes and do next to no damage for a few shots, then suddenly 1 shot will do almost the entire bar.
---
It's an extremely buggy weapon in an extremely buggy combat system in an extremely buggy game.
---
Do you definitely have an unobstructed veiw of said targets? If anything breaks line of sight ( looking at you, PA wearers ) vats won't work.
---
Skeet Shooter goes a long way. And when it starts failing 95% shots just give up on VATS for a few seconds and fire manually. Eventually it'll hit it's stride again. Mine wrecks everything it touches.
---
If you ever find a black powder rifle bayonet mod keep it. It's the only way to get a bayonet on that rifle since scrapping them will not let you learn it. There's also old, outdated info online that says scrapping the mod will let you learn how to craft it normally, which is no longer true. Don't scrap the mod like I did!
---
No but I mean we already got one to quake con
---
Five minutes ! She made it quick so she could go back to playing 🤣
---
Let me try to explain this one more time so you can try to understand. Hopefully. Right now on live servers AA equals 28.80% increased damage on targets that have enough armor to penetrate. ANd it needs to nerfed like rest of the prefixes so that it will remain in the same position (ranking) in damage as it is now on live. Meaning behind effects that do 50% increased damage. Not the way it is now, doing the same damage as them.
---
If youre on PC add Fabledx and we can run through setting off a nuke sometime. Its way more fun with other people.
---
Oh this I did see lol
---
I have the plans to craft the Halloween skeleton costume and mask so sometimes I make a boat load of them and then drop one for each player I see. Pretty soon the server is crawling with skeletons. Once I had 5 noobies at oncee all dressed as skeletons in front of the Wayward. It was glorious.
---
I dreamed the mothman the other night. I think it was a dream anyway...
---
I disagree with you. Everything is fine in the pts.
---
❤️❤️❤️😂
---
Junkies is stronger than anti armor in the pts, so not sure what's your deal.
---
Good. Less bushes for bush pussies to hide in.
---
I’d love to find whatever remaining unstoppable characters running around together as a group all old and shit because they survived the 25 years, that would be hilarious with content like maybe do missions for them and get the option to pick an unstoppable to replace
---
Omg this is amazing
---
Good to know I wasn’t aware of the PA pieces having that effect. Thank you!
---
&gt;Other plant related change: remove the word wild from the blackberries. Why is that distinction necessary to make when no other plant has a wild and domestic version?
---
Corn and mutfruit have wild versions as well. I don't understand why either.
---
Are you even trying to read and comprehend what i write?
---
Yes you want anti armor to do less damage, sorry but no. It's already behind junkies and bloodied, so just give it up.
---
sounds like way too powerful.   
---
what would it be the ingredients? with a power like you said, it should be made out of 10 nuka quantums, 2 of each flux and a random magazine.
---
Last year we got a atom/outfit bundle for every event like these
---
Not quite as bad as I remembered, but here's what we're missing:
---
* Exclusive discounts in Atom Shop (if it does happen they need to advertise it as such)    
---
* Increased CAMP budget    
---
* Increased Worskhop Budget    
---
* Persistant Workshops
---
Here's what First member's get for their $13 a month: 
---
   
---
* 1650 Atoms a month (A pretty good deal if you were going to buy them anyway)    
---
* A Tent    
---
* Unlimited Scrap in its own box.    
---
* Private-ish Worlds capped at 8 people (Open to all friends by default, This can be switched to team only but you need to be on a team *before* joining the world.)    
---
* A whopping 2 emotes.
---
What day?
---
Why do i even bother with you dum dums.
---
Yep, for us it was stuck above, so had to improvise:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmF9I7p9i7c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmF9I7p9i7c)   
---
And am not feeling bad about it at all, glitchy ass game
---
Since there is a much worse bug that reduces damage that isn't being fixed?  Fixing a bug that increases damage and not fixing a much bigger bug that reduces it is bad.
---
Health rubber banding is a much bigger issue.  Shotguns being completely useless outside of VATS is a much bigger issue.
---
It could require fluxes
---
Oh no, this would make it too enjoyable for us players. We need to get on *every single day* or else we will never play the game!
---
not fixed yet.
---
but if you know someone with FO 1st, use their private server
---
alright, thanks for responding.
---
Flint city council has found a solution: clean your sinks
---
Man, I'm glad I liked the video on YouTube...... It seems things have taken a turn here. I hate it you tried to do something helpful and it seemingly went to crap. This filthy casual appreciates your video.
---
Huh very good info. I've got b, mu, j, and v ffr versions of all the ballistic heavys as well as ult gats and flamers. Kinda wishing I had aa now haha. Just didn't think it'd be worth it with the diminishing returns using stabilzed. Oh well I use my energy weapons most and those are still fucked up with aa.
---
Thank you for the testing and info!
---
Yeah I don’t use the fixer in power armor and I only play in 1st person when playing with the fixer.
---
Tnt domes
---
I’d love to see video comparison. Playing fo76 on what feels like an ancient potato for almost two years has been a test of patience. Moving around your pip boy boy and stash taking up to 4 seconds to add/pull something feels crazy in a game that has more inventory management than any other fallout. Idk bout u guys but I have to hold down X each time when I do it because there’s a tiny window where the lag stops, otherwise it won’t register. What sucks even more is watching ppl on pc flip through their pip boy at lightning speeds. When steam finally offered that switch to pc i was hopeful, until I realized it was a complete character restart. I don’t wanna even get into listing the rest of the long loads in the game. I quit for awhile and this is definitely one of the bigger reasons.
---
They also said in a podcast that the balance pass will be delayed and not part of One Wasteland

I’m sure he wasn’t mad, takes the press of a button to repair a camp, while you had to waste your time cause you were salty.
---
I was told to put the sample in. Then insert t fuse. Then go to computer.

That's why I did queen.  Stood right under her and shot her.  I've done it a million times.

Would need Kent to move down from Boston into the Manor of Mysteries.

Would also like the option to respond to NPCs as the Silver Shroud.

Kind of like the Overseer Overseen quest.

"Fear not, for your OVERSEER is here"

I meant PA wearers have a habit of running in front of people. That breaks your los/vats.

Was this on pts? Was wondering how they are with damage nerf
---
I’m on Xbox, but I appreciate the offer, that would be awesome otherwise.
---
Second this. Doing the nuke silo is about as interesting as watching an extractor fill up. Glad some folks know how to do it fast for the rest of us
---
Oh damn. That’s really similar to one of my characters actually. I haven’t even tried ACP on that one either so I need to get on that
---
Had someone lure me up a mountain with cotton candy then drop an insult note. I laughed my ass off and then accepted their friend request.
---
can add you?
---
This requires updoots
---
Well, it's a play test after all. They might change this before the patch of course.
---
No worries. Happy to be of service :)
---
You do know that it isn't a nerf right? It's a change in how damage is calculated so they aren't going to nerf anything. Bloodied wasn't "nerfed" nothing was actually "nerfed". It wasn't done to balance, it was done to make the damage easier to calculate since working with additives is easier then working with multiplicatives.
---
Almost, ... Stoned!
---
I saw a "you've been insulted" at 30k and i was tempted
---
On pts.   The damage nerf shouldn't matter.  Yes they start out weaker, but it's a multiplicative effect, it's still very very strong, but I saw no evidence of it.
---
Haha, I’m used to it. Mods here will allow millions of pointless complaint posts but lord forbid we try to spread some useful information to actually improve on fun gameplay. Oh well, at least a few folks learned something new today
---
Do you have the game on a SSD(might help), are you playing windowed borderless(change to fullscreen)?
---
So I watched the video.  He just casually shot an enemy and claimed it was still working.  I launched a nuke and shot the sbq and couldn't actually get the bug to work.  I'm not convinced
---
I understand why they did it, and it is a good change. But when builds and legendary weapons are doing less damage on PTS than they are on live, then it is an nerf. If they were doing exactly the same damage, then it wouldn't be a nerf.
---
Each tree icon on the map in the cranberry bog has cranberries as well, some more than others. Don’t need to fight a MQ for it.
---
OR have a second face where Earl climbs out of the mine and you have to fight him outside
---
Craft radium rifles in peace.
---
the only reason i played was because of the legendary run, and now i stopped playing again until the next legendary run
---
Do u wanna play sometime? I’m on Xbox 
---
gt: kozybunni
---
A vampire's pump action shotgun without any perks will not one shot anything, even a radrat. He one shot two enemies in VATS one after another. The bug is still there. Even on live servers, my magic weapons don't always work... It really depends on latency, game performance and a few other factors.
---
No, he didn't, he shot one weak enemy with a shotgun at close range.  I shot the sbq for several minutes and it didn't work.
---
Acid.   Invest in a loooooot of acid.   There is no such thing as too much, you will run out faster than you think.   Now that you can do private lobbies, I strongly suggest you spend a couple days farming the hemlock holes maintenance workshop, the grafton monster+ 2 snallys by the crashed vertibird just outside the workshop, and the flooded trainyard.
---
For just random junk farming, I hit the flooded trainyard, sugar grove, and all the AMS buildings.
---
Good luck!
---
Sure - I wont be on much longer today but Ill drop in on you when I can sometime :)
---
When you request a cargobot drop with the holotape and shoot it down does it drop a nuclear key card or do you have to find one in the world?
---
That's exactly what I thought.  I'm pretty sure I would have noticed the magic when I was fighting the sbq
---
I'm getting down to the bottom of the barrel. Just about done with Phenix and then it's just MODUS left.
---
Where did you get the helmet from.
---
I generally keep all the PA Mods, excavator especially, leg mods for carrying weight are very valuable .. I sell or scrap the rest. You can generally 6 caps at a regular vendor .. if they were lighter, I would keep more.
---
Is from the Colossal Problem event rewards pool.
---
I really like the reclaimed helmet and ranger outfit, from fallout 1st, combo. Sorry I don't have pictures.
---
Most people have an NPC follower in their camp. Why not just have a target dummy fill that slot?
---
I think this would ruin the meta and everyone would just wear PA over their op under Armor.
---
I think a better solution would be legendary PA parts.
---
But you can take down the entire server 😅
---
Beeeehold the poooowwrr
---
Hmph. Guess I'll have to pick up the pace on replacing the magic plasma shotty I've been using with my gunslinger. 
---
He was supposed to be a junkie, but in 124 levels I haven't gotten a single Junkie pistol drop. A ton of bloodies though. Seems like there's going to be even less point to having a Non-bloodied build after this next patch. Guess it's time to surrender and just turn all my toons bloodied to avoid the impending ammo grind. 
---
What a wide and interesting variety of viable character creation strategies for an RPG.
---
Ohh yess.. but there's other more important fixes also like being able to add atims shop camo skin to ss under armour and the shielded lining at the same time......... Like just saying here.
---
I wonder if he uses the photomode "laying out" pose to ambush people.
---
Just add the info to the already existing personal terminal.
---
So you have to kill the creature to get it?
---
Then it would of been called H.O.U.S.E and you would not have started off with a cook camp stove and sleeping bag :)
---
That's the opposite case.  Also don't forget the new ammo production perk, by my calculation, ammo is easier to deal with in pts than live.
---
Congrats, you now have a full time job
---
Lots of people like to put that one in a vendor for a laugh. In my 3 I added "I'm watching you", "Always watching" and "Damnit, Janet!".
---
The fish *what* now?
---
It also looks bad ass with a marine set. Would love to see it with full heavy metal
---
Yeah way too low, coming from FO4, it's dismal .. but I get why, I wish there was a better design or an enclosed house system. Supposedly it is coming, it sort of ruins any real creativity and don't get me started about those freaking stairs and limiting or we can'r remove stairs.
---
Been using a prime gauss most of the game and quick switch has not worked once with it. Prime lever works just fine though.
---
And that it is so obvious!  The kill cam will put you on the naked guy running through the sky.
---
Goes well with the dollar store stormtrooper outfit that is SS armor then.
---
I'd rather people know what seems to be the situation than not know it.
---
I... tested it.
---
Must say, Nuke runs are pretty fun. Some tedious parts but overall an experience.
---
Should try it sometime.
---
What if a camp is your home? Gee i wish they could add cardboard box items
---
To make you repeat old content to play new content. Play time is king.
---
If I remember correctly they don’t know how to fix it
---
Why risk it ? Either open them all up or drop them in the bush. I refuse to pick up even a single xmas gift, that's me. That's the thing, people want to give away gifts to as many people as they can to spread who has them ..  you unlikely will get banned as people here say, but I wouldn't hold on to them, what for ?
---
I've got a high int gunslinger that's literally Rick Sanchez. One of these days when I'm in the mood I'm gonna go on voice chat as Rick and adopt a level one as my Morty then follow and help them. Just haven't yet.
---
There would be no reason to not wear power armor.
---
Finally finished him last night and got all the loot.  I may wait a while till I try again,  not sure the loot is worth the resource sink.
---
I love this idea! Maybe one of them turned into a ghoul?
---
Same.  I was doing the final Enclave quest that requires you to do it...but apparently that quest will complete if someone on the server (or maybe it's in your team) launches a nuke.  Ah well.
---
We already have a perk for that.  Mutations add a lot of power, it should come at some cost beyond popping a chem.
---
Are you in a workshop or your camp? I'm also assume you ment mat
---
They gotta be in workshop
---
If nothing else I just want people to stop having to be nakie in their exo suit. Like cmon cool bodysuits are such a common thing in fiction with things like Power Armor. Look at Samus and Metroid, hell look at Paladin Danse from 4 - does anyone really think all he wears is that funny cap and nothing protecting his meaty bits in the suit?
---
Please Todd, end the chafing.
---
I have a level 187, 97, 52, and 6. Last night is the first time I ever dropped a nuke, and i actually got to do it twice. I joined a random building team and the other person was in alpha silo. He sent a message asking if I wanted to drop it. I told him I had never done it and he walked me through it, all with no mic. We did it again 20 minutes later. Killed Earle twice. Al in all a pretty great night. If you ever want help I'm down, and I have a buddy that has solo'd several nukes, and I know he would be down. I do have a mic, but i know not everyone likes to be in a party.
---
Yes I have an SSD and full screen. But thx anyways
---
They can. It's just very rare. Same with radroaches... I have gotten a few scorched hoards and and radroach hoards with legendary leaders.
---
Wait, they can be sold? Nice! What's a good price for them? I'm gonna stick all mine in the machine right now.
---
Yeah this is the first time I've seen one and I've played for over 500 hrs.
---
How?
---
But can the problem be that it’s not on my main disk?
---
What's weirder is when you find a scorched scorched.
---
Ty :)
---
lesson learned, never carry that much junk on you unless you are ready to lose it
---
Easier to buy the plan. They are very rare to find in the wild.
---
Ah I see
---
Thanks for this confirmation. I also have avoided learning plans under the assumption that knowing them would lead to more legendary drops for those plans specifically. Now I can learn that pesky dinner fork plan. I'm happy knowing that when I kill a three star bandit, the knowledge of it isn't causing a one star Mudcrab Slayer's Dinner Fork to drop. Oh wait, that's the Elder Scrolls VI. I should've added a spoiler alert. :P
---
I got about 3500 hours in at this point. I have seen it only a few times, but it does happen. It began right before the holiday scorched
---
Well, power armor is objectively better than non pa defensively and non pa is better than pa for the legendary effects, so put them together, why use anything else?
---
Ah right, so it's a "the math is different so looking at the pure stats doesn't actually help" kinda situation. I vaguely remember some other game I play (Maybe Destiny 2?) having a rebalance patch that made everyone's numbers lower across the board and people were furious about this, not thinking about how *across the board* means everything is equalized and there is effectively little to no nerf.
---
why were you carrying 91 bulk leather to an event
---
Where do I find the plans?
---
Add this to your custom.ini. It should remove all blur in game and make water clear. 
---
fDOFBlendRatio=0
---
Well, I guess they're shooting themselves in the foot then.
---
Vendors in Whitespring. The Responder one I think.
---
The stash space in this game is really restrictive
---
Loses , I see a lot of posts on here where people say they loose things. Is it auto correct?
---
i was going to bring to my camp right after the point is he don't help me and was a dick
---
Okay thanks
---
Treasure maps drop a lot of the basic weapons. Great for learning mods
---
i wouldn't think so, i would monitor your cpu/gpu usage when loading in. if they are very high maybe dial back them setting. there are also some ini tools on nexus mods to  better optimize the game
---
friend gave it to me and was going to cash it in after the event
---
So I was playing with a friend on Xbox that had randomly been invited to a “farmers market” by someone on our server that we ended up checking out the next day. Turns out it was a large group of friends who had each built a shop down the roads near Morgantown (comic book shop, pizza joint, soda shop, plant nursery, appliance shop, bar/restaurant, etc.) as well as an actual “farmers market” at the beginning of the road, complete with stalls for selling food, junk, xp supplies, a bar and a goodie bag for each person when you walked in. There was even a Brahmin petting zoo and a lounge area with a fire pit and music (yes, people belted out a few songs). It was actually pretty neat considering the amount of time and effort you could tell went into even the tiniest detail with every persons shop and stall. 
---
There was one stall though that caught my eye. It looked like a tiny church, complete with a few rows of pews, a podium at the front and an alter with a punch bowl. At the top of this stall were the words “send noodz.” 
---
Which is exactly what I ended up doing. 
---
Friend and I left the market for about 10 minutes to explore the fire station and auto shop, craft up some chicken noodle soup and came back. Once we were back inside the market, we headed straight to their noodle church, got one vendors attention and we each gave them our chicken noodz. I’m assuming this vendor must have alerted the rest that we had fulfilled their request because 10 seconds later, their entire squad of about a dozen players surrounded us and started opening lunchboxes, dropping gifts, emoting and dancing around us for a lengthy amount of time. 
---
We joined voice chat shorty after they all sat down in the pews (sad we missed their reaction to our noodz as they were a lively group), and one guy from the group was standing at the podium leading everyone in “prayer” and worship to the noodle and pizza gods. I don’t remember the whole prayer. Only that we came in on, “Give us this day, our daily bread, with cheese and lots of sauce...”
---
I just about died listening to them praise his speech with not quiet little “amens” but joyful bursts of “Ramen!” 
---
I was done when one girl offered to everyone “a drink of blood-I mean, pizza sauce..” from their punch bowl. 
---
[Best couple of hours](https://imgur.com/gallery/AayLP76) I’ve spent in that game.
---
That silly mothman and his hijinks
---
Wise decision!
---
The legendary run made me stop playing.  It really drove home that the game had become a chore
---
There are already daily reset timers for Challenges, why not simply make it the same?
---
Every day I live on the edge, carrying around literally every piece of junk I own until Legendary Perks launch and I can finally start making a real build. I have 3k steel on me and stashing it doesnt even have a noticeable effect on my carry weight. I am a freak.
---
100 is modest
---
so carry something else you WONT lose upon death.
---
If you want Bloodied or Junkies, 10K caps ain't gonna cut it.
---
This wouldn't give PA legendary effects
---
Yes its a possible reward but its all random
---
Ah.  Under armor, not just "armor" my bad.
---
It’ll be a combination of a couple things primarily a damage increasing legendary prefix such as bloodied, the player having low health, perks and armours that lead to that much damage :)
---
I'm not familiar with pc, I'm on xbox. But on xbox 10k won't likely get you much. Caps arnt worth much. I recently wolf a suppressors, 50 vcd, rw fixer in my vendor for 10k.it was there less than a day. And I feel that that was a fair price, I also put my vendor prices much lower than what you would get on the market sub
---
For a 1 star or a 2 star that wasn’t fire rate it probably would
---
My husband and I play together as well.  It’s a lot of fun knowing someone always has your back!
---
Ok. Thanks
---
If they’d fix as much as they talk internally... that’d be great.
---
The fact that this game tries to make me play everyday to be able to get anything is frustrating and I play less because it feels so forced. There shouldn’t be a limit on how much you can make.
---
There's really not much of an option.  I'm not op though.  I don't tend to die that much in this game, so I'm not super concerned about it.
---
I traded an urban scout mask and TSE handmade for a bloodied explosive fixer. I guess it's a case of get some rare gear and trade it!
---
In your scenario you could have the possibility to catch the vendor right before and after the reset. 
---
In the current scenario you’ll never get lucky and only risk getting screwed.
---
I’ve started buying the signs and letters plans. They sell quickly (at half price) and I get the satisfaction of helping someone out
---
True, and no LVC - that might work if you have a decent human not looking to jack up the price because of specific combos.
---
how is it not an option? you said that you'd carry junk because your stash is full. pull out something else- idk, a gun or armor or something- to free up space and carry that instead of your junk. you wont drop your gear when you die so it's way more safe.
---
The post is true. I’ve seen game reviews on Bethesda games that were removed by them that had to do with bugs and glitches. I even had a review about bugs and glitches that got removed. Many other crappy gaming companies censor info on bugs and glitches too like Rockstar, Activision, Playground Games, Turn 10, 2K, Gearbox, and many others. They often lie about bug and glitch fixes.
---
And they'll buy it without, so why bother.
---
Camp or Workshop?
---
All my settings are low
---
I used to squat in sneak mode (so I couldn't be seen on the map) on the toilet in my camps bathroom. If someone explored the whole place, they'd inevitably bust in on me in the bathroom, and I'd throw out a confused emote followed by an angry one and then close the door back.
---
The worst part is that there are caps on Gold, Script and Caps anyway so even if they got rid of the daily caps and timers we would still be unable to accumulate excessive amounts of any of these so why not remove the time gates?
---
Yes. There is literally a dump box right in front of you when you fast travel to the observatory.
---
Sadly there are many many people like this. Just flat out jerks for nothing other then their own personal gain.
---
I had a person join a public team I was on, you can see on the map my vendors are off. They're behind locked doors even. So they used the loading in time to bypass the doors and spam purchased a bunch of stuff.
---
Luckily I saw it in time to log out right as I was at 29763 caps or something.
---
And the technical data too while we’re at it.
---
Workshop 😔
---
My entire stash is junk.  I use a few weapons, but keep them all on me.
---
It’s a bloodied 1-h melee build’s first weapon kind of deal.  Only worth it if you don’t have anything better
---
The power armor in the original Fallout game required an underarmor, though not as a separate garment.
---
I have heard tales of this roachzilla... Earle had best watch his legs I guess.
---
Have you tested two shot variants yet? On top of that, magic weapons still works on pts, so junkies heavy guns gonna work the same for fat bosses.
---
I don't like Bloodied or Junkies, I was looking more at AA, Two-Shot, Explosive, some of those. (not all 3 of course)
---
Add UnicycleTy on xbox if you want! Level 99, did alpha last night to spawn Earl, and am planning on running a silo later tonight when I'm off work if you'd like to join!
---
gameplay and story segregation. that's all. if your Motherlode died, then for your canon she's dead. but to keep the event happening, they ignore that.
---
also technically there's only one Scorchbeast Queen, only one Imposter Sheepsquatch, and only one Earle Williams. but they keep "coming back" so we can do the events.
---
Awesome idea 👍
---
nope. it's scrip. with melee weapons people want 40% faster swing speed. and the reflect damage back is crap
---
I hate that this stream was basically everything we already knew about from quakcon, also feels like they refuse to acknologue fractured steel is prob gonna get wastelandered like last years big update
---
Always dump junk before going to a dangerous area. Whether stash or an alt.
---
Cross play has always been the dream, but I’d settle for cross-save ala Destiny. Wonder if that would be a good possible compromise.
---
Or the one in the theme park. Now you need screws!
---
if your entire stash is junk, then it sounds like you should be selling some junk you dont use.
---
The 20 hours thing is weird and I hate it.  I never remember to do it until my pockets are full and then I basically lose an entire day on the weekend with how my schedule work (even though I played both days)
---
That's good news since my aa/25 handmade lies in stash oiled and ready to go if necessary.
---
Still, this game desperately need rework of legendary bonuses aside from aa/b/j
---
&gt; Playable races (Ghouls, supermutants, etc.) are not in their **immediate** plans. 
---
So, that could be happen in the future... Nice.
---
Thanks so much! I am successful! I guess it also would make sense for me to have the items on hand before approaching the box...maybe that was my problem before 🤣
---
You would be surprised because it happens all the time with the censorship on any major issues with video games. It’s only gotten worse since early 2020. I’ve looked up other issues that I’ve seen people had in video games and there would be nothing that would exist on the internet that had to do with whatever issues they had in any given video game. The USA no longer has net neutrality so that could be the most critical thing about it.
---
The bloodied is kinda okay but the rest is trash.
---
No limit would justify my purchase of first and make me intensely happy
---
The reward for Having a Blast is watching all the explosions!
---
40 scrip
---
If you are doing Lode Baring and not using an Excavator PA, you’re definitely doing it wrong.
---
You should have stashed it first.  Don’t ever carry junk/scrap on you that you can’t afford to lose. 
---
Same idea as *‘don’t take more cash with you to a casino than you can afford to lose’*. 
---
You’re mad at the opportunist who claimed your ‘abandoned salvage’, but not mad at yourself for being careless?
---
I recommend you reevaluate the situation and look for the important lesson needed here.
---
Motherlode 001 dies. 002 and 003 are still around.
---
You're talking about the Wise Mothman, right? There's absolutely nothing pure and harmonizing about the cultists and their Vengeful Mothman.
---
They do get atom discounts, and they’ve been doing it for months. It’s advertised in the atom shop update notes. That’s your fault for not reading it
---
Bowl hahah good catch 😂
---
Since forever. It’s just a bit more rare. Do enough farming for them and you’ll see one sooner or later.
---
he chose not to help me and then took me shit also i got downed by bs i used my stimpack but it  don't work
---
That’s always been there. It wasn’t taken away.
---
The bubble is unbreakable, lol. Look the censorship is no joke it’s happening all the time now. Gaming companies are breaking there own games on purpose and they don’t want anyone to notice it. That’s a major reason why bugs and glitches are being censored on epic proportions.
---
No what they really need to do is get rid of the refresh time. Its extremely annoying having to wait weeks to turn in all my notes and junk legendary weapons. Especially after events like meat week. Why do they even have a refresh time in the first place? If anything make each machine have a separate bank of scrit and gold so you can get rid of what you need to without having to take a week to do it.
---
lets not forget perk cards. a well build build (hehe) can put you in a decent position even without a legendary weapon.
---
a good build and a good legendary weapon is the goal.
---
most people go for automatic weapons. either commando or heavy guns.
---
I have a vision in my head of grognak with dementia sending us on a mission like 3 times before it completes
---
You can’t use your Stimpak when you’re downed. It’s too late. 
---
And why should he have to use one of his own Stimpaks on you?  Did he swear allegiance to you?  Did he make some sort of promise to watch your back?
---
He was an opportunist. 
---
The Wasteland is full of dangers, kid. Next time, secure your loot and find some friends to watch your back.
---
Yep, none of your choices matter.  Just get the 1000 gold instead
---
whatever choice you make will have no diff. on your ability to be friends with either group.
---
yes, this is a useful thread and should answer your questions. First comment is useful as well.
---

They said they took some of the limits away you have with regular camps like build limit and snapping.
---
Thanks everyone
---
Hi, i just wanna let you know you know that i have a video ready for you. The problem is that Youtube is fucking bugging on me. I can't edit my video, it immediatly make crash the app. I have no computer, so i gotta use the app on my tablette. But I can confirm you, it is still working. As long as you quickly fast-travel to Dyer Chimical as soon as the event pops, you have your Strangler Blooms. I failed yesterday due the the fact that the event has already started on the world i joined. I'm definitely gonna pay more attention. But i'm sure it's it...they spawn for a really short period of time, once the event started.
---
Oh and before you ask, if you actually happen to really care about my video. It's a french video. So i have no choice...i gotta edit it a lil bit.
---
Yep, after you complete the end with either faction you can continue to do stuff with both factions to gain rep. So even if you side with the raiders you can still eventually Max rep with the settlers as well.
---
i used my stim when i was up but todd told me no and nothing happened  and it dont work and i got downed
---
They are more equivalent to a camp turret, which the game also considers to be NPCs. We can place lots of those at once without too much problem.
---
I don’t disagree with you, I’m just saying balance should be done carefully with these weapons
---
Nah I just like knowing people get my sense of humor
---
Nah reflect damage is actually pretty good. Got a buddy who uses a troubleshooters melee weapon with reflect and take less damage while blocking and charges the Imposter and blocks. However, yes, most people want SS and strength while others want the power attack perks.
---
They should just reset all timers once a day for everyone instead of thousands upon thousands of timers for every currency
---
Good points but the censorship is real. I do understand that some people don’t have the ability to notice bugs and glitches very well because maybe they only just started playing a specific game but I’ve been playing a variety of video games for almost 2 decades. Gaming companies also can manipulate people into thinking there’s nothing wrong with there games when easily obvious that there are major issues.
---
Should have kept it all. you lose a small bit of rep. Takes longer to get 500 bullion.
---
I mean, if it’s something new in the game.... fish blow could have uses
---
I gave all my gold to raiders, but you should have kept the gold. You could have used it with Reg while you started farming more gold and rep with the two factions. 
---
Donating to both gives you a small faction increase for both. You can easily make it up over time.
---
Yeah between the poison nerf and the mods dropped by the queen the only reason you'd bother using it over T-65 would be if you have a legacy version with the jetpack applied to the arm instead of the torso. 
---
not gonna lie, running a bloody build with both emergency protocol and a jetpack is glorious
---
Yeah but you Lose only little Reputation if you relate it to 250 Gold bullion. Best decision is to keep all Gold for yourself. You can easily get the lost Reputation back by doing a few fraction quests.
---
Can you link to a guide on the best/fastest currently viable way to do it?
---
That’s what I thought you were talking about i found one ginseng growing my Brahms meat cookout but I haven’t been able to find it again :/ .. what does ginseng make?
---
We all died in the vault and are trapped in Valhalla forced to fight the same battles over and over every day
---
Treasure Hunter, and Reclaimed Mining Helmet is an extremely great combo. Along with the Ranger Helmet and Treasure Hunter outfit (that was always what I wore before the mining helmet)
---
I 100% would get a fish blow in the game if I could. Not even going to pretend I wouldn't.
---
It’s actually a good choice, the gold you can make back in 2-3 days but the rep can take weeks! Good luck out there vault dweller
---
Edit don’t forget to go to Smiley inside the Wayward to buy 300 gold every Monday, so if you go now you can go back on Monday
---
Hmh. They're not fixers but since you're using a rifleman build, how about an instigating handmade and an instigating gauss rifle?
---
Hear hear. Fellow lvl 163 who only recently did a couple of solo runs to launch. Let me tell you - at a resource, economics and time level, it’s totally not worth it to do it for selfish reasons. You’ll burn through 50 stimpaks, dozens of RadAway and 2000 rounds of scarce ammo, plus an hour of your IRL time....and for what? Microscopic amounts of Lead and Steel Scrap and a handful of fusion cells from OP’d Assaultrons and Gutsy’s. All, really, so that us ham and eggers can bum rush SBQ or ACP and do inconsequential amounts of damage to try and score a 3 star, but ending up with a Nocturnal Pool Cue for our troubles.
---
People Suck !
---
Thanks.  Fixed it.
---
I think they need to make some changes for sure!
---
It's more like a race tbh, like once the nuke lands I'll be like fc*k fu*k!
---
That’s a guarantee that it does. All of their updates have been delayed at least once. Hopefully not as much as Wastelanders but we need to temper our expectations for sure.
---
I encountered this “co-exist event” once, not sure why, possibly because I just logged in the server
---
Yep. Tried Private&gt;Adventure&gt;Private last night too. I can't analyze the blood sample, gather another, or even interact with the centrifuge at all.
---
It should be common knowledge now to log off approximately 30 mins before the cutover and only login 30 mins after. You can stay on but you likely to be hit with this bug. I try log off about 15 before and login 30 mins after, the later the better. Nothing you can do, just get into he habit of logging off and hope it doesn't happen tomorrow.
---
Sorry no insanity here. Just telling the truth. The post wasn’t deleted by me but probably by someone with Bethesda that could of did it. They are deleting posts about game bug and glitches all the time on any part of the whole internet. They don’t people to know that there games are becoming more glitchy and buggy as they purposely add them.
---
Everything that happens inside an instanced area only happens for your own character.
---
Oh wow I didn’t realize that. This has been going on for long enough that this could be considered common knowledge? LOL
---
Who’s smiley I haven’t been back to the wayward since I was level 10 I’m now 46
---
Buying the plan is the easiest.    Sometimes the Cultists at lucky hole mine will have them as well.
---
I’m on Xbox and would love some help. Lvl 62
---
Because without those how are they going to force people to play every day and coerse them out of $12?
---
Is Atom Shop being non-canon something that was actually ever a question?
---
He shows up as soon as you complete the vault, he’s dressed in American flag apparel and will be upstairs
---
Look up the Streisand Effect. There is no way that Bethesda is censoring it. There is no way they can trick all search engines out there. They’d be spending more money doing that than on the game.
---
And given all the shit this game has gotten, I don’t think they care
---
I’ve seen a legendary wandering vendor before.
---
What where what am i missing you open map and fast travel its always been there
---
i sat in the silo for quite a while &amp; nothing changed...
---
Just press Y(Xbox) or triangle (ps) when you’re in the challenges menu and it’ll show up by the score challenges when you press pause
---
I had a random message once "sorry about your camp hehe" and I went there and they'd somehow  blown up a whole water purifier and a whole piano. It took me two whole wood and two whole steel to fix. I was devastated yo
---
Thanks! 
---
Sounds logical, so it's more looking at the perks/prefixes than the actual damage ? Does this also explain why I often see players running around with low health and lots of radiation?
---
Why not make it a higher, weekly limit? (Daily Caps limit, i guess is okay)  
---
People that spend 1 day a week to play video games can't log on every day. Unless I grind a disgusting routine of events, I'll likely never have enough to cash in all at once, anyways. 
---
The cons to this; it creates a scenario that doesn't force a higher daily player count. Which, in a game like this, could be detrimental... However, those players just logging on daily for 50 minutes usually aren't adding much to the overall experience.
---
On my public team one of the guys started playing music over the mic and signing. I started doing emotes in time to the songs (YMCA was good). Ended up at their camp with a small audience all dancing... and then One Violent Night started up and I was like "yes!" I fast travelled there and did the beckon and he came and the joy in his voice when he saw the mic and then continued to do a full on concert while two or three people trying to do the event looked on bemused. I was dying of laughter it was brilliant.
---
Yeah I wish they would at least do something simple like make a craftable "junk turret" that we could build shoot at to test damage.
---
I made a mod like that for fallout 4 and it wasn't very difficult, it took an afternoon and I'm not even a coder, I just used creation kit and copied and altered the workshop turrets.
---
lol I've had a slew of camp threats only to find my Brahmin had been shot....damn guys ya got me haha if only I had a few razor grain growing literally next to it haha
---
Y can’t they top them off when they do the daily reset makes more since to me I work full time and on weekends I’m off so now I can’t play cuz I need to sell stuff and can’t
---
With chinese stealth suite, it's a lot more easier. I do it alone (for the first time) at level 50.
---
You need lot of patience and a lot of munitions for your stealth weapon (a sniper for me + 10mm pistol). I found only one workbench for ammo in the silo (bravo), so be sure you have what you need. I've often hack turrets, especially in the big storage room. They did the job for me.
---
Well it all depends on what you like to do when you play, I personally run a bloodied 25 25 fixer so I vats everything. If I solo the queen I can do it in about 6 minutes. I have a friend who plays as a bloodied heavy build but he uses it for pvp a lot more since he uses an explosive flamer and a explosive Gatling plasma
---
I did the same thing, the drawback to this is you make the rep grind a bit longer for both factions. Second, and the last time I'm ever doing that grind I sided with Foundation, and I had full ally faster. I feel like its better to go with one side to cut the grind down a bit. I feel like the gold is immaterial in the choice you make here, since your time invested to make it to full ally with either faction is the actual choice.
---
I can't find info online without them all being about walkthroughs for the Motherlode quest. But I found out through in game and holotapes stories. I think it's mentioned there's more than one during the settler questline if you choose them for the heist.
---
Dr/Er/Pr/RR (and possible FR) are all summarized in the armor view of your pip-boy. 
---
% based resistances are not, however.
---
I already have an explosive AA lever action rifle and a non-legendary fixer so I'd rather save up for a good fixer/fixer plans.
---
Hold release weapon button and that emote bug will get fixed.
---
They are creating a tick tock effect that creates an emotional reward response from players and establishes addiction like tendencies. This makes sense in free to play games but on AAA titles it is disgusting.
---
Thank you, so i'll also have to take a better look at my perk card build. .. now "how to build builds to get a better build build " 🤭
---
Sweet
---
Simple solution to legacies would be as follows:
---
Replace explosive legacy effect with the most popular alternative, then add something bonus to the equation. There's "20% more damage" legendary effect in game files. I'm not sure whether it's 4* or 5*. You can see it applied on Bunker Buster, legendary rocket launcher quest reward.
---
They should replace explosive effect on all energy weapons with faster firerate and 20% bonus damage. In terms of PvE, that would be a substantial boost (i.e. B25 gatling plasma is much better queen shredder than BE one), they would still be rare items with high trade value, and they'd stop being the "I don't need to aim to dominate" bullshit weapons they're now in PvP.
---
Yep, being irradiated stops health regen as you probably know. It’s a good way of stay low
---
Just got the stealth suit, must say it’s a lot of fun to sneak up behind something and smash it over the head with my sledgehammer 😂
---
Wait, so....modding is considered???? Wasn't that promised ever since Fallout 1st was announced? So basically they lied?
---
I have both a full health pa heavy gunner and a bloodied stealth commando. I much prefer heavys. There are many different weapons that act differently while using the same perks allowing for variety in game play. I also just prefer barging in and dealing death rather than sneaking around haha
---
They better be...I started an unarmed character last week and just hit level 50 today...
---
I honestly don't even know why they would bother to include that.
---
You're missing shotguns, and they're growing to position of being just as meta as commando/heavy-auto weapons
---
It's indeed an unintended nerf so if you want to see it like that then yes, it's a nerf.
---
It sounds like they're working on it. There's just a lot they have to consider since this is a multiplayer game and not a single player game.
---
No problem, nuking things is always fun lol
---
On point sir, this is exactly where we are now
---
Thank you for the info/help 🙂
---
I stand corrected. It took a couple tried, but if you have access to a Private Server, it is completable!
---
Feel the same way I've been trading building up gear for a junkie unarmed to do for new season.  Just tradesd for a junkies ss bear arms and a junkies ss +s mole miner gaunlet.
---
I stand corrected. Tried again this morning on my Private server and completed it. May take a couple tries but it works!
---
OP under armor?   Is there some legendary under armor variant I’ve missed?   Even the best under armor with mods it’s just like +25 to each resistance.
---
they're gonna get hit the hardest by the nerf, but are still definitely viable.
---
not tens of thousands of damage per hit-viable, though.
---
I remember those in fallout 4, but I don’t remember those in game.
---
And in case I’ve caused confusion, I don’t mean the name of the plant, I mean the name of the inventory item.
---
Then you may actually be in luck! I hope you find one at a decent price!
---
Alot of caverns and caves have slight glimpses of daylight from very small holes and gaps. I find that sort of thing delightfully claustrophobic as you realise  daylight is just there just out of reach while you're stuck under ground.
---
Reference video link pls?
---
the BoS underarmor was even designed to be used in PA
---
thats really cool...i wish my wife liked games. It would be so much more fun.
---
https://youtu.be/Yk1YZOF2aAI
---
As it was optional that's entirely on you. 
---
I wasn't overly fond of the season, so just got challenges done naturally while playing. 
---
I did a few days here and there of completing most of them, just to make sure I got a few things in wanted. 
---
Never became a chore, because I didn't make it one.
---
I dont have one. I just watched the stream live
---
When public teams came in with Wastelanders, Bethesda made it so team members (because they were potentially random team members) could not open locks in your camp nor build in your camp/workshops. This was a safety precaution to protect your assets. The only way you be in a team and allow that is to be in a private team, and I believe you have to be not in a team in order to invite them from the social menu. It's a little bit clunky really, the invite to team option just isn't there if you are already in a public team yourself. I think it's that way round. It's the old method of forming a team, before the public team system was introduced.
---
Nice idea! It would be an idea if it was fiendishly difficult to make though, like formula P, else otherwise everyone, as pointed out by other posters, would be slamming it non stop.
---
With my budget (or a couple thousand extra), would I be able to get an AA Explosive Fixer?
---
I watched it too and didn't hear anything new.
---
Kinda bummed about clans. Wish they'd at least add Faction related public teams though.
---
Mothman fam!
---
the PTS is being frequently updated, I wouldn't worry too much about the day to day changes until it is close to or is out.
---
Link/ time code pls
---
I can solo earle with ease.
---
Yessss, and put it up for 0 caps. I found one in a vendor yesterday for more than 1000 caps. Like, really, you want others to do the work of launching a nuke but want to benefit from it twice?!?
---
I dont have one
---
HA! Nah, we are all in a Vault-Tec Simulation Pod. They are testing us to see how we would go about fixing Appalachia and they programmed in Earle, the SBQ etc to strengthen us BUT we keep messing up and they need to reset us to KEEP TESTING! So...maybe the Overseer is GLaDoS? Shit....NEUROTOXINS!!!
---
I did not know that! That's awesome thankyou.
---
Used to see them at launch quite a bit. There was one I'd farm a lot in Watoga civic arena. Then they basically disappeared. 
---
Now I only find them in a scorched horde event. Just killed one in fact outside glassed cavern.
---
it really is, i just wish bethesda (of this forum) wouldn't ban you if you posted video evidence of someone cheating. they rather its not posted to scare off any potential fallout 1st cuckstomers
---
If you are using Dodgy to deflect damage to AP rather than HP you can end up in a situation where you constantly are low or on zero AP, so then VATS won't work because it requires AP. Catch 22 situation.
---
We got a friend of ours to start playing for the first time a few months ago. Day 1, starting the game and she's... a little baked. It takes her an hour to get out of the vault, at which point she immediately discovers you can take all of your clothes off, proceeds to do so, and runs randomly into the forest naked and unarmed laughing madly.
---
We follow her until she runs straight off a cliff and immediately cakes it, at which point she yells "HOLY S**T YOU CAN DIE IN THIS GAME?!"
---
She's up to lvl 30 and much less naked now; she still has a tendency not to see cliffs until halfway to her falling death though 😂
---
This is why we worship Mothman. Jeff Goldblum is a god, and if he wants to dress up as a mothman, we worship him as such.
---
Could it be that they expect you to make up for the damage loss by using legendary perks? There is the that greatly increases ranged (stealth?) damage.
---
They could probably add a card similar to Home Defense but for more and new plants
---
I like that they mention Atom Shop items being loose canon. Especially all these PA skins. I know PA has its share of history revisions with T-51 being the pinnacle but we also have T-60 (now even T-65) X-01, etc. but I'm glad they don't consider everything sold there to be hard canon.
---
Really depends on the market. Though [Fed76](https://fed76.info/pricing/?item=None&amp;effects=None) is really only an idea of where to price items, that might give you a ballpark?
---
Unethical and manipulative, like loot boxes. They need to make it illegal.
---
Pretty sure there's testing dummies in Elder Scrolls Online so they could definitely do it here too
---
Sadly it's more likely just PR speech of "won't confirm or deny", but we can still hope
---
Pretty sure he thinks about all armor parts and not just underarmor
---
claim again how? doesnt look like I can do that. is this a console thing?
---
Thats with excavator armor on, I meant it only lets you activate it once even while wearing it.
---
Edit: so even then I'm only getting 2 ore vs the 10 you can get with excavator PA.
---
Wait you dont get your vault suit bonuses in power armor? I never noticed that....
---
yeah totally should work. +1 to this suggestion. Thats from someone who only wears power armor in nuked zoned.
---
I enjoy both equally, kinda depends on my mood and if there are any goals for a particular character. Also enjoy my melee guy and food build gal.
---
20 hours after the first legacy you traded in.
---
Excellent. Thanks! :)
---
Which mods on the weapon make a difference to the condition (length of the condition bar), and I found that one of the major factors was the stock. I put the Forceful stock on an explosive combat rifle which greatly increased the time I could use it before having to repair. 
---
Also use Weapon Artisan to repair to 200% or the Improved Repair Kits you get from Scorched Earth which give 150% repair condition.
---
It should all have been added to the personal terminal functionality, but they just forgot all about it's existance.
---
If you're on xbox, screenshot your pics and then go to  
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/YOUR GAMER TAG/screenshots then you can save them but of course if you want to have more than 50 pics for loading screens that's no good
---
Only if you have extremely powerful weapons could you kill Earle easily. 8 people can kill him with average weapons but that wasn't my point.
---
I meant the 8 player limit in a event which also happens to be the best place to get several materials kinda means you get 2-3 people grinding screws and stuff. If there was no limit, then there's be no issue of losing your space or people grinding materials.
---
This event is just what happens when a dugtrio gets mad. It even sends its single-headed minions at you
---
I see what you mean, but yeah I don’t use it because AP is vital to my build. Let’s say it like this: when I shoot a normal SB and when I shoot the Queen, everything works like it supposed to be, except the queen won’t take any damage. My AP Is basically always above 75% because my handmade and fixer both have 25% less AP cost as a 3rd star.
---
I just check their achievements on Xbox.
---
Also if they're using the default icon it's usually a giveaway.
---
I've seen this happen every time I visited the abandoned bog town in the past two days, do they just want a behemoth to always spawn there now?
---
You have to shoot down  a cargobot thats in a convoy with a bunch of vertibirds that flies around the whole map. The government supply drops/enclave supply drops/crash course any any more I can't remember don't drop nuclear keycards.
---
I won't mind a notification of reset send to my phone instead of display in game which is not as useful
---
I agree especially given that my fo1st is late one year and two months I’d like more than a bot telling me what lies it’s programmed to tell
---
I still don't understand why there aren't  legendary power armor parts, I might actually use it then. Not worth giving up legendary armor effects for a little more DR, even my carry weight is less in PA.
---
How rude 😯
---
So the workshop is saved. Doubt the molerat is saved with it, so hop to another server. Load said save.
---
Fucking finally, now they just need to keep that promise from 19 months ago and fix explosive energy weapons, then we can start actually balancing the game around **intended** damage
---
Haven’t we seen many, many fictional characters “die” only to return somehow? Motherlode is just one of those. Explanations could be anything from “you dreamed it” to “that wasn’t the real Motherlode” to “it wasn’t entirely dead”. Pick one and move on!
---
All the plants should be
---
For the loading screens
---
Apparently Magic Legacy Weapons like a Junkie's Explosive Gatling Plasma are a diffent story.
---
Let’s fix damage output and accuracy on bows / compound bows. Make bows great again.
---
My inbox is actually full of abuse from taking workshops. The best I've had though was from a guy a little while ago.
---
I got to the workshop crouched, he had the cranberry bog workshop. He was on the roof which I didn't know, as I intiiated he jumped from the roof just outside of the area of takeover and stsrted to wave... Sent me a message saying, "haha fckr, not this time!". I thought it was epic of him tbh, and laughed. Messaged him back saying touché, next time. Haha.
---
I think the Atomic Shop does not affect the canon at all, they are only modifications to common armor or suits, anyone would modify their things to their liking in a post apocalyptic world
---
That's how shotguns always have been. That is their intended damage. They are bugged to deal extra damage in VATS, not the other way around
---
Ghouls would seem more likely that supermutants, but It would be cool to have one day
---
I'm rocking the helmet with the insurgents outfit
---
Interesting
---
I looked into it a bit. Seems my post was a little outdated hahah.
---
Seems like this was updated about a week ago. Plus someone mentioned they had it from the atomic shop ages ago.
---
Also no, it happened on PC, Xbox and PS4 all the same. My guess would be you unlocked the bundle after they added the helmet.
---
It was more of an 'anything's possible' kind of thing. I would love to play as a ghoul though.
---
I was sort of in the situation you are in.
---
I started as a stealth sniper, and found myself struggling in events.
---
I had gotten a decent lvl40 AA LMG and started using that at events and was doing much better. I re-speced towards a heavy gun build and heavy guns definitely can put out sustained DPS. It took me like 50 levels to respec and get the perk cards needed for heavy guns. I ened up with a bloodied PA heavy guns build, but am currently drifting away from that towards a full health vampire tanking build. This is due to events where I goto (SBQ and Earl) where noone can seem to stay alive, resulting in chaos. I had to tank earl in excavator armor cause noone else could take a hit and survive.
---
I later made a new character and focused on the stealth sniper build, but ended up as a commando build. But even then, I carry a heavy gun to use for some events. Although my automatic combat rifle does decent damage, having to reload every few seconds didn't help when it came to dealing enough damage on SBQ. This one is a bloodied stealth commando.
---
Stealth builds hurt when you get spotted, so you lose alot of your damage. So if you are not using an unyielding bloodied build, you will want to include the sneak and possibly the escape artist perks, to help keep you stealthed.
---
So what you can try, get an automatic rifle and try the commando side, requires minimal changes, swap rifleman for commando.
---
This is the rough build my stealth commando is using.
---

---
How do you think he became legendary?.
---
the event has an eight person limit. After 8 people enter the event "closes" and a second copy starts, this is why you can get multiple notifications for the event starting, if 30 people show up you will get 4 different events start up.
---
If you try to join after starting the event it will fail if the boss fight portion has already started, kicking you out of the area, putting you in front of the mine.
---
You have 3 minutes to show up before the event stops working, and if you are the 9th person there you are on your own (or 17th/25th/33rd, ect)
---
Skin color would be an issue as a full model swap would mean the skin would be a preset.
---
Let me translate that for you. In Bethspeak, "not in our immediate plans" means : 'not in a million years!' 
---
If they had the balls, (and the goodwill), to make a proper Fallout MMORPG, Bethesda would've introduced playable races from the very off.  To understand why they didn't, you have to look at that decision through the marketing lense: It pays to make you all Vault Boys and Vault Girls so they can flog you all the same clown costumes, crazy emotes, and other over-priced tat they have at their Atomic Shop - can't do that if you're all playing as different races. Put simply, a one size Plastic Nukashine Beer Hat can't fit all!
---
Oh, I play both and enjoy both.
---
I like running around with my stealth commando.
---
For big events like SBQ, Encryptid, Earl... I prefer my heavy gun
---
It wasn't over message but voice chat that I got my best one for a workshop.  Best part is that I was walking from my cooking daily to grafton station and just passed through.
---
I don't remember exact words but he threatened to report me to Bethesda cussed at me up and down calling me a griefer and "something something fucking high levels picking on me."  Just for passing through
---
That’s not what net neutrality is about....
---
Net neutrality is about how isp’s charge for different types of communication. Totally irrelevant to this conversation. 
---
Nothing is being censored by Bethesda lol. Just go on YouTube. They aren’t squashing any descent. Hey don’t have that type of power lol.
---
PS4
---
Its like your replaying a memory
---
Thank you everyone for the comments!
---
This is still a live issue, it’s just happened to me!!!
---
It would give the opportunity of having better looking bathrooms IMO. I know they are pointless in a way to have, but for the sake of role playing I would like to drink out of my toilet.
---
If you're on pc I can mod if for you... I might even have the plan in my stash so you can craft the weapon to scrap it and unlock the mods...
---
If you are on pc... my Beth dot net account name is the same as here... Mr_3ppozz and you're free to add me and drop by any time I'm online :)
---
Damn I would offer help if you were in Xbox. But if you create a new character there’s a ton of friendly people that will help
---
Just go back the same time everyday.   Simple
---
Something is seriously wrong then. 
---
Excavators give 4 vs 1 per activation.
---
I do know that there is some ore veins it won’t let me activate, but I attribute that to my mining them recently and think there is a timer similar to containers.
---
I think people just need to be aware that they are being manipulated. I suspect that enough people would be okay with it that it would remain a viable business practice.
---
Like in Monster Hunter World
---
You didn’t use it fast enough. That’s all there is to it. 
---
You keep blaming everyone but yourself for your lost scrap.
---
pwoer armor under armor hmmmm brilliant
---
that'll be 7600 atoms please plus tip
---
On  the positive side it is what keeps these games supported with new content
---
go for a gunslinger build, with fully into vats and vats crit, and ofc, u have to have a cowboy hat
---
You can't target limbs in VATS with Melee.
---
Okay, finished the Run 2-3 days ago so I might be in the clear then.
---
Haha was actually thinking about doing a gunslinger thanks for the suggestion!
---
anything is fun with friends
---
&gt;I would like to drink out of my toilet.
---
Well of course, who wouldn't? Lol
---
And there are clean toilets in places all over the map, why can't we get one of those? I'm not putting that busted ass crapper we currently have in my camp. I camp near the whitespring bunker anyway, I'll just use the nice facilities they have there.
---
You must be, though I'd go check anyway. It is Fallout 76 after all 😂
---
Cilvil war outfit
---
Black Powder and Bowie Knife
---
Hehe yeah thats true :-)
---
what’s pts?
---
“Certain awards”, I’m fine with it but I highly doubt they’ll be reusing anything soon.
---
I’m not seeing the ‘man’ part of this Mothman. Just looks like a giant moth to me.
---
Thanks for the suggestion!
---
It used to be, but not anymore.
---
One of my friends told Alexa to remind him to buy this game tomorrow. She replied, "Okay. I will remind you to buy crack tomorrow."
---
I hate fear of missing out and it makes me not play other games. Fortnite, destiny, bo4 its just not fun when you missed 1 season and everyone has cool stuff and you dont
---
The game would've been in development for another decade if they had planned on doing a proper MMORPG from the very beginning...instead they half-assed it because they thought we wanted Fallout meets Fortnite.
---
What outfit is that?
---
Edited my comment now that I’ve realised my mistake.
---
Just got a bit carried away as I’m a PA user that’s slightly annoyed I can’t make use of all the legendary effects non PA users get.
---
Still think PA should get 1-2 star effects tho. 3 may be it bit OP.
---
It can be repeated
---
I put on my PA with a jet pack on.
---
Some things like the Ammo Converter should be available in other ways. That’s a potentially useful utility that required very little effort to get. No harm making it available to everyone.
---
Just thought of another theme.
---
Junkie Baseball player.
---
Bat melee weapon and baseball grenades.
---
Junkies cause of roid rage.
---
I may do this one myself.
---
I actually got to do this quest twice today on that technicality. I accidentally didn't return the microscope to Ward yesterday and did so this morning– usually that means I won't be able to do a fresh Vital Equipment on that day, but I must have picked up the osmosis kit off of an enemy I looted at some point on the way to Foundation, because when I went to turn in the microscope VE triggered again afterward for the osmosis kit; which I didn't even know I had in my inventory at the time. Auto-complete. It's honestly a nice refresher to have a bug work in our favor for once. 
---
P.S. Does anyone have the microscope spawn by itself without a body to loot? This happens to me all the time and it's harder to spot; like, hello random microscope on the ground, lol.
---
I assume it will be thinks like lunchboxes and things like the ammo converter but I could be wrong
---
Insurgents outfit from the mole miner treasure hunt thing a couple months ago.
---
Yea some rewards I would also be fine with returning but not all. The ammo machine, and maybe the original cosmo power armor(not the level 100 all black one though) paint are some items I can think of that I wouldn’t have an issue with return.
---
literally me
---
500c is the price I usually sell them.
---
I don't think it drops any to my knowledge. At least it didn't for me when I used my used gauss mini.
---
Gotta go pick up a nice junkies swatter from good ole moe down in diamond city
---
Do you know if it's bad for hardware?  I have a radeon rx 580 gpu if that matters
---
Usually get 30-40 ult 45. Pretty good seeing as I kill them in 1-2 shots.
---
Some of the camp items from season 1, have been added to the items you can buy for gold bullion on the PTS.
---
Most of the protection from power armor doesn't come from the DR, wearing a full set provides an innate ~42% damage reduction, before DR, as for legendary power armor, ircc they're all already set up to be equipped with legendary effects, they must be planning on making them a big event I recon. But there is no question that Power armor is super useful for A Colossal Problem. As for carry weight, Excavator and calibrated stocks are for you, it'll give you more then Unyielding will.
---
I really appreciate this answer by the way, forgot to say. I think I'm beginning to get how to work it out on the fly.
---
You have my vote! For RP pursoses i "wear" something under PA, always have to care to not destroy it while in workbench.
---
For some strange reason, I like pooping on people’s bed. Drop dirty water, spoiled meat, and fertilizer in the paper bag. I just wish I could light the bag on fire...
---
And potentially Project Paradise if people do zone A.
---
Public test servers on pc to test stuff before it comes out.
---
In the PTS you can buy the rewards for gold bullion. But you can't get any of the cosmetics. 
---
I have no issue with that myself. Things like a ammo converter can give a massive advantage over people. So people having to buy stuff like that with bullion in my opinion is good.
---
There will be new cool items though. Ive missed out on many things in the past but I’m fine with that cus I can get new cool items.
---
I need 10 at most.
---
Basically, they'll atom shop stuff in the future.
---
Bethesda had acknowledged that VATs is broken and how it would take a significant amount of time to fix.
---
Bethesda be like "Hmm thats a nice suggestion but we think PA might still be too good so let's just add some more perks that only apply if your outside of PA"
---
If PA had been this bad in the lore as it is in game then China would have been storming America with their stealth suits.
---
Love all these experiences.  I REALLY wish we had an LOL emote or hysterically laughing emote for these situations especially us who don’t have mics.  Maybe one where I’m laughing so hard I’m clutching my stomach or rolling around on the ground
---
WoW has 2 full development teams working on it and they still screw up game design/implementation royally
---
game development isn't as easy as some people think.
---
Thats fine YOU are fine with that but other people no
---
No, it’s perfectly fine in that regard. It was an engine performance issue, the game couldn’t handle over a specific FPS and it would do some wonky things making the game unstable. Those have been fixed and I’ve been  running uncapped FPS since launch.
---
It makes a few teas, though I'm not sure what the effects are. I only collected one for an achievement, and it decayed before I had a chance to make something out of it.
---
Like what?
---
You can do them as many times as you like, but you can get the "even better" rewards (new plans) for successful ops once a day.
---
" **Daily Ops** — Put your skills to the test by taking on instanced, randomized, and repeatable encounters called “Daily Ops.” Enemies in Daily Ops will feature unique “mutations” that may require you to strategize how best to take them out, such as stealth, exploding on death, and others. Location, enemy types, and enemy mutations will be randomized each day to keep you on your toes. Every time you complete the Daily Ops objectives, you will receive some loot. Once per day, you will be able to claim even better rewards by finishing a Daily Op within certain time limits. You can tackle Daily Ops alone or in a group of up to four players, so round up your friends and head to the PTS to try out this challenging new addition. "
---
approx 30 2mm ec for my shotty. Which is nice seeing as it only takes 1 or 2 to drop them.
---
I tell people I had better things to do with those games when it comes to fearing missing out.
---
In reality i'm just watching TV in my boxers or something just as pointless 😂
---
I am level 185 and I did not know that 😂
---
this is for the wendigos in a colossal problem.
---
Thank god! Appreciate it :)
---
Thank you! :)
---
Unfortunately, I've noticed this since day one.
---
I saw something similar on xbox last night, but instead someone nuked the empty area west of the mothman museum. 15-20 minutes later another nuke was dropped on Monongah.
---
I may or may not collect it all on occasion with green thumb, cook some, and eat the spoiled vegetables at a later time
---
I saw a guy transferring about 40k christmas gifts to his alt, so i stepped in while he was gone, took all of them and dropped a clown outfit i always carry around for this kind of occasions
---
I have extra hatred for the op Tesla Rifles. You find a legendary and in a blink of a eye, everything is dead.
---
I have both types, both junkie and bloodied versions. All are viable, but heavy gunner is more fun in my opinion. Commando is basically the same setup of perks, so maybe you want to try that?
---
Things like the chicken coop. Trying to remember what else. But try googling too.
---
You're welcome :)
---
This makes sense. 
---
I killed a raider in one shot and he made an annoyed sound that he had to play dead. Took him a whole 2 seconds to actually "die".
---
Is it really what it?  I take a lot of the fallout youtubers with a grain of salt anymore however I must say last time during radiation rumble I brought my QFFR Tesla and the game dropped to an unplayable like 5fps.  When I put it away it didn’t really recover either.  Idk haven’t used it really since.  It’s normally not a problem.  It may just be that it is chaining to so many enemies at once that  it causes such issues.  Hence why this is such a problem at radiation rumble and ACP most likely.
---
What rewards can you get?
---
I happened to stumble upon a female player character wearing nothing but under clothes standing in a river, wearing a mask and holding a protest sign. 
---
Just standing there. Never moved or reacted to anything.
---
Basically nothing we didn’t already know.
---
How they can even consider guilds on 20 player servers
---
Motherloade... remembers.
---
I really wish there was another option.
---
btw, what detonators is Ward talking about?
---
I only half paid attention to the settlers side.
---
The ops themselves are quite easy and straight forward. You can finish the hardest difficulty (Elder) solo if you have optimized build and some experience in the game (and with little practice). In a group it is very easy.
---
You did good B33 guass mini, you did good. You may rest now.
---
LOL. Yep. Watch angry turtle, what is the best power armor part 2 video. More or less every single power armor is about the same including excavator. I know the numbers are different vastly but it's pretty much a 10% difference in damage taken in. No real difference in radiation. And really no difference in energy weapons at all. He has a chart at the end.
---
Will it drop ultracite plasma core??
---
That's the exact weapon I used in the pts.  The thing is, it's still bloodied, so it's still useful.
---
You turn in legendary weapons and armor at scrip machines. There is a machine at every station and 1 at the legendary vendor.
---
Scrip is used to purchase random legendaries at the rusty pick in the Ash Heap.
---
You get certain amounts of scrip per star and whether it's a weapon or a piece of armor. For example a 3 star ranged weapon or melee will give you 40 scrip.
---
The daily scrip limit is 150, you can only trade in so many legendaries per day. Also the scrip limit you can hold is capped at 1000.
---
Hope this helps.
---
I'm an Xbox gamer or else I would've taken up on your kind offer 😉 are the fletchers sold as a mod or plan?
---
The goal setting for the Legendary Run made it fun for me. I knew what I needed to do for the day.
---
Ammo converter, chicken coop, lunch boxes and stuff along those lines.
---
"Modding" is a VERY loose term that could mean any number of things.  Replacing all the Scorchbeasts on your server with flying Thomas the Tank Engines is a mod, but so is being able to set an entire world to open free for all pvp.  One of those is more likely to happen than the other.
---
What kind of rewards do you get for them?
---
I have not seen one legendary in it
---
There's a location in the ash place called the "Rusty pick" with this legendary scrip currency you can buy legendary weapons, you get legendary scrip by doing daily missions and in a legendary exchange you sell the legendary guns you dislike
---
I'm not sure what Mothman is at this point tbh
---
There are sightings of them prewar yeah, and yet the mothman cultists seem to actually believe it's just a normal animal pretty much
---
The cult leaders instead seem to worship the cthulhu thing that is in lucky hole mine, while tricking their followers into thinking it's the mothmans that are the deities 
---
Idk it's weirdly more complicated than I expected when I started looking into it
---
You fool! You've told Bezos when your Bullion is available! And your shrimp!
---
Pretty sure, I learned each of mine straight after they dropped and I never got any doubles
---
Wild vs hand selected fruits/vegetables is a real thing. 
---
Human grown blackberries are sweeter than wild ones.. due to generations and generations of selective breeding
---
That's been happening to a lot of people, myself included on one occasion. There are some theories as to the cause, such as playing at the moment when the daily reset happens (noon eastern standard time). I don't think anyone knows for sure though.
---
For me, it only happened on one day and then never again.
---
Any time, can be confusing as hell lol. Beth likes to have alot of hidden things
---
Legendary scrip let's you purchase new legendary Weapons and armor at the purveyor at the rusty pick
---
I thought they patched it to where you can't go through the map anymore? I haven't tried to drop one since the patch, so idk
---
fallout 76 is definitely a con, a huge con
---
Get rid of the legendaries you don't want and get some cool new ones you want
---
Noob
---
At the same time, you can also get the gold bullion over time.
---
In the end, whether you take it all, split it evenly, or keep the original deal, you can cover the differences with ~~time~~ grind.
---
The ash place is the black spot on the bottom left, if you go to the northern part of the ash place you should see a icon on your compass that looks like a mole miner, that is the Rusty pick
---
All my friends hate dropping nukes, but I enjoy it. There's something cathartic about pushing the button. I also like being able to offer people something to do/a chance to snatch up flux and other materials if they wish.
---
It was being considered since release. Still I don't think they will implement mods support (and that's gonna be yet another creation club, no random mods from nexus) anytime soon.
---
My next build is going to be explosives based. So mainly grenades, missile launchers etc. And since there’s not a ton of explosive perks I can have enough points left over for an almost complete one handed melee build as well.
---
that would mean less fallout 1st subscriptions since people don't need to hoard as much, will never happen,  you can screenshot this
---
What is this? I thought OP was talking about the repeatable daily quests, but this sounds like a different beast altogether. Is this something new coming out?
---
I have been trying to get a fish blow since Beta.
---
then amazon would go bankrupt, are you a commie??? /s
---
That's literally an alien in a technological exoskeleton.
---
You're definitely a brave person to want such... Pet?
---
I still hate that there is a limit per day for selling legendaries and gold bullion
---
why would they need to make you happy when they already got your money every month
---
Chinese stealth suit + Robitics Expert Perk lvl 3 makes things a lot more chill and less expensive.
---
That just makes me want it even more.
---
Yes new thing that is coming. It is on PTS right now.
---
We should position Besthdea for a fish blow. Everyone deserves one!
---
i think if anything they would want you as a pet, the only thing that can resist their 100% pacify chance
---
I had some dude try and be all "spooper special" and only nick the mine.
---
Missed it by *that* much.
---
Still since you can keep retrying to place it how in the fuck do you mess that up.
---
I'm right there with you, OP! My wife and I both play, and having the Legendary Run to give us something quick and achievable I'm a quick hour or half-hour is perfect since we're also taking care of our infant son.  Without these daily challenges the only break from work-from-home grind and the diaper/bottle/spit-up grind would be TV.
---
Playable races for a game like Fallout are a total shitshow in far too many regards and NONE of them are fucking "marketing".  
---
ESPECIALLY with the advent of wastelanders this isn't your average fantasy setting like skyrim where you can pick an elf or a human or an orc and it's totally normal for any of them to be walking around a town.  You can't just decide you're going to be a super mutant on the character creation screen and then saunter your way into Foundation like everything is normal.  It would even be a stretch to have a ghoul do as much considering their stigma.
---
THEN you have to consider limitations like equipment where the more varied your player races the more work you're making with every addition.  Again to compare to Skyrim there's a reason every race is just a human body with a different type of head and at most a lizard/cat tail.  Ghouls are easy to equip but if people expect a super mutant race that's a whole new model for every piece of equipment so everything fits.
---
Lol was this om xbox think i saw this gt not too long ago
---
Here is a video from youtuber doing it. Don't watch if you don't want spoilers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO_sS2lG0Gs
---
Did they remove that?  I was wondering the same thing but thought I saw someone say it was causing stability issues so the gave the legendary like every other event
---
Yeh, it's stupid... A tad bit anyway. As I'm seeing way more legendaries playing atm, in turn getting loads of legendaries, most I drop tbh but the few I keep for scrip leave me with not so much room in my stash. Then all the public events handing out treasury notes  like there's no tomorrow... I have nearly 1000 notes, maybe more now after prime events, luckily the notes don't weigh fuck all.
---
Perhaps that can be a secret quest in Fallout 76, where you get kidnapped as a pet and live in it's camp in outer space.
---
You...you mean turned COMPLETELY around away from the obvious path deeper into the mine?
---
How...
---
My guess is that they'll make slightly different versions of the season rewards available through the atom shop or as event rewards. The new ones will probably be a different color or something just so they're not exactly the same as the season items.
---
Do you happen to still be there with her? I'm getting in game now.
---
Oh well.  If I didn’t pay for first I wouldn’t be playing, so you’ve got me on that one.  I would literally quit if I had to play with my scrap in the stash box.  I could probably turn it off with the amount of scrap I have in the box, but the tent tho.  I guess I’m just a sucker for Bethesda’s brand of bull shit.
---
It’s not just the Tesla itself. It’s the ash piles it makes. The Tesla is an insane number of independent light effects. Same for the ash piles. Those light sources all put a huge hit to your gpu. This is while Beth limits lights in your camp. It’s so that your camp doesn’t take forever to load and your fps drops through the floor when your at a camp.
---
Ha nice idea might try this one, ill solo earl with my rolling pin 😂
---
Cool, thanks. I'll have to check it out.
---
Nope I stay in the mine and loot the corpses instead because it’s all ore and grenades or stims
---
Another good idea thanks for ur suggestion!
---
Well I picked up the holotape. Then my son wanted something. Then I turned to my right again went. Oooo there’s the end of the tunnel.......oh bollocks
---
+2 PER, INT and END for 10 minutes -5 CHR for 1 hour.
---
Well mine is ult 2mm and when I kill wendigos there, they don't drop any, regular 2mm might br a diff story.
---
I barely do daily missions and the only events I do is radiation rumble, scorch beast, colossus, campfire tales, and encryptid yet I somehow have 150 scrip
---
Haha, I can relate, once imagined this seems necessary :D
---
Has it actually been confirmed whether or not it's untameable?
---
GardenZombie on Xbox. Would be fun.
---
I've always felt like the single shot weapons needed buffs, and I think its more true now on PTS than ever before.
---
It feels so damn bad using them and doing so little damage while also having such slow ROF. You just think why am I not using an auto instead, and that's a bummer.
---
I say this as a power armor heavy weapons guy who loves more dakka above all else.
---
I'll give it a try. Thanks!
---
Same here. Daily and weekly atom challenges were really fair, they were the real optional ones. Either do them to get some currency, or ignore them at close to no loss. Now, if you want certain items the only way you can get them is grinding endlessly every day for 100 levels. If you only wanted a few items from different levels, you're still stuck with the whole map to complete regardless.
---
Mountain scout and treasure hunter hat. Insurgent outfit and white raider skull mask.
---
Weird I heard a bunch of people say it has a chance
---
Canning Machine, and Canned food recipes. including "Fresh" Variants of pre-existing cans, and some new ones. they would "Settle" like booze Ferments, and once done they do not expire
---
No, it is already op. If you dont like, dont fcking wear it.
---
Totally.
---
I’ve ran the event 30+ times and never seen one so I gave up at that point and started looting the screws instead
---
just left and now she's been replaced by a bear. Sorry!
---
PS4 lets you copy the photos elsewhere, like to a USB drive, through the system photo app. Of course, you won't get to see them as loading screens anymore if they're just on a drive somewhere.
---
But it just *feels* better. I like the feel of cold-rolled steel on my junk when exploring the wasteland, ok?
---
Despite having several mutations, above level 300, and having Super Duper equipped.....I'm still just a regular mutant :&lt;
---
Yeah I've went quite some times never got 1
---
Can drop at level 35 too.
---
You should avoid pvp. Its toxic af lol
---
Ah. Bummer. She's been elusive for me and I've never encountered her. Oh well. Thanks.
---
lol, right.
---
I wouldn’t think that there would be an issue allowing players to build critter traps.
---
I wear a full set of Unyielding Marine and tried it today. It certainly looks like a light, agile set of Power Armor. 
---
You can have heavy combat in different tones, but Marine... Marine never changes.
---
Plans for new weapons (atleast two, craftable with legendary modules) and some camp items. I have only done 10 or so, and have not checked datamined info just so i don't spoil too much of the fun. And ofc random legendaries.
---
Correction: It is not a hoax, The Mothman "used" to be Jeff Goldblum... on a related note, I am now rewatching The Fly
---
I'd never assumed the PA skins to be canon in the strictest of senses.  
---
The Chinese suits, for example? Sure, we know they were researching PA, and this seems like proof they succeeded, but I doubt we'll ever see NPCs in it, so it's one of those "maybe, maybe not" moments.  
---
The Four Horsemen skins, that are just visibly heavily modded existing suits, so I attribute those to inventive, now very dead, Raiders.  
---
Liberty Prime? I've gone so far as to making a loose story explaining it, but like the rest, it's very much a "lost to time" kind of thing that won't show up anywhere else or used by anyone but us Residents.  
---
The stuff we can find certainly is, but the store stuff is really just customization so we can feel unique.
---
It’s a promised feature that was never added. In other words false advertising.
---
100% true
---
Question: How much do you play?
---
Answer: Yes
---
Exactly what I'd expect from a Bethesda dev.
---
Why does my pristine and clean sink produce dirty, flammable water?
---
-Everyone in Flint Michigan
---
I've only seen them as horde leaders, never as random spawns.
---
I honestly wish there wasn't a limit at all
---
Its twenty hours man if you buy something at 7pm by 3 pm next day your ready to go it's not that hard
---
Can I have this guy's other 40 then Bethesda?
---
GT: dydamas
---
Easy enough to run past them took about 10% damage on the way out
---
I must be super lucky. woke up this morning and i loaded it up for a quick 20 mins before work and she was there. and after work i found her on my 3rd check of lost home.
---
Ehm no. 20 hours is perfect. After a workday and the vendors are reset. Imagine 24hours. It would get later every day.
---
I can't even get into a game any more. I've just given up now. After 15 levels I'd actually started enjoying it and now realise that those one shot kills through walls were hackers. It was fun but I am not queueing for that shit.
---
Of course! I just meant it was nice to have that confirmation that the stuff from there is non-canon. In my own headcanon, Appalachia is so far off the grid from our usual Fallout experiences that it makes sense things would be so different.
---
Keep in mind that they're about to change how a lot of the damage buff perk cards and effects work with the next big update. Save a few points in case you want to swap things around later.
---
I have many chars and i can say that my sneak rifle build can kill anything one shot, only the bigger boss mobs take some time but is no problem. Full Sneak Chinese Stealth Suit Headshots with a Instigating Hunting Rifle = DEAD Mob! A Gauss Rifle does the same job (i wish i had a instigating gauss rifle, thats my dream) or if u want the Pipe Revolver/Bolt Action Pistol both modded to RIFLE earn dmg bonus from Rifle Perks AND Gunslinger Perk and Deal more Dmg then a Hunting Rifle!!! (Was never patched so i think its a feature XD)
---
Moved the goalposts like an asshole. Terrible. He showed you.
---
Yes... I wouldn't bother with that to be honest. But since you want to try out heavy weapons, try to test a gatling laser or gatling plasma :) AA on energy weapons is wonky right now (only benefits base damage), maybe at least they fixed that... So a comparison AA Vs Junkie's on a, gatling laser would be fun to do in sure :)
---
And I wouldn't be surprised if on a minigun AA will beat Junkie's... The lower per bullet hit, the higher AA effectiveness. And minigun has one of the lowest per bullet damage.
---
&gt; And it needs to nerfed like rest of the prefixes so that it will remain in the same position (ranking) in damage as it is now on live.
---
Why? What makes the current ranking of legendary effects "correct"?
---
On ps4, I only rubber band sometimes when entering white springs.
---
I lag every so often, but I cant think of an online game that doesn't
---
I got 30-45 from 45, Shotgun shells, and 5.56. 
---
But I got 3-7 when using my railway rifle.
---
I am guessing you won't receive too much, but always enough to recover your rounds. My shotgun straight FARMS shells during the event, since I oneshoot them.
---
No it would just reset at the same time every day. Not 24 hrs from last time you played.
---
Doesn't matter if the hierarchy is the same. A reduction value is a reduction value. A nerf.
---
well if there is one game where you can hack without literally any consequences it's nuclear winter
---
Considering Bethesda’s love for money, it actually comes as a surprise they’re not all like
---
#BUY THIS NOW, FALLOUT 1ST EXCLUSIVE DISCOUNT
---
Lol. Super duper perk will only give you more food
---
i’d be jumping over cities with this
---
You could do pistols.  With the new legendary perks you can free up more spots in agility. Sounds like pistols will also fall under the tank killer perk now too
---
Which is literally illegal, I’m surprised they haven’t had a lawsuit against them yet.
---
As far I know, ultracite ammo is not in the pool.
---
There should be a machine at Mama Dolce's that allows you to can certain foods for a limited time once Feed the People ends.
---
5am starts a new day kind of thing.
---
Stop calling them "hackers". They are cheaters.
---
That annoys the living fuck out of me. If I’m lucky, I can VATS crit the bastard and the explosive effect on my handmade deals with the others.
---
Bethesda Automated Response:
---
I'm sorry, but we are currently too busy not fixing the plethora of-
---
*existing bugs, glitches, exploits
---
*events that have been recently released that are still incredibly iffy as to whether they will actually let you complete them or not
---
*having to come up with ways to auto-complete collection events without anyone knowing because the requirements are a complete joke
---
*getting ready to launch new events/content that will most likely break the remaining mechanics of the game that currently are functioning properly
---
-To currently care about something like your suggestion above. Please try your suggestion at a much later later date.
---
Thank you, and enjoy your adventures in Fallout 76!
---
The light effects I imagine are the biggest culprit.  Imagine just how many arcs it would need to create incredibly quickly for my Tesla if I used it at the event.  I can’t imagine ash piles are more taxing than goo piles or even meat piles.
---
Don't know about stash space but photo space issues is tied to the consoles as they limit the storage. 
---
On PC it's whatever you have available.
---
MOAR POOP
---
if you're asking for someone else to drop nukes then i'm sure you are not the person i want helping me with earle or sbq
---
Deadly Neurotoxin....
---
I’ve killed a few wendigos with a gatling plasma but I usually switch to my Gatling gun instead when killed those (don’t like the wind-up)... haven’t had any drop yet
---
Oh! Excellent point.
---
I'd use power armor more if my refrigerated back pack still worked with it.
---
whatever they are, they seem to be bethesda's best friends considering they have free reign
---
Not sure about the team size, there are more things in this game than the common perception would give. Also don't forget we are now in a state of emergency almost everywhere. Things are not easy at all.
---
Besides, recently, I feel things have improved greatly... just check the PTS.  
---
That mods things however seems a bit off... I hope they don't spend too much time on this right now, I don't feel this is a priority at all.
---
Not sure why they don't just reset at noon eastern time like the dailies. 👍
---
Is there anythimg they are planning on implementing immediately? Sounds like everything players want are being delayed to hell and back.
---
No I'm asking if people are going to drop nukes can I join in or if they want to join me drop nukes. And I infact have be handmades and a be90 laser. I would have though that's the exact person wanted to kill sbq or earle;)
---
I think they need add more space in general for each update, stash, photo, camp etc
---
Hoping they buff pistols in general too
---
Same i like to run pistols and rifleman together but they really need a buff badly rifleman could use a bit of one too
---
increases hunger and thirst
---
Yes, good to keep reminding people because if I hadn't seen a thread about this the other day, I would never have thought to revisit my finished board. Love the helmet. Now Jangles in my backpack matches.
---
Mine is kinda close to vault 76 but also more toward Morgantown so anyone can visit and its on the river so I can place water its a good middle for fast traveling
---
I have mine in the Mire right next to a downed vertibird in a lake. I like it for all the free purified water, the fact that it's close to the vault when people come out or go in and they might need some supplies from a local vendor, and I surprisingly see very little action in the way of traveling enemies.
---
Tell that [to the guy from Edge of Tomorrow](https://www.scifihistory.net/uploads/3/0/6/7/30676431/birthdays-tony-way_orig.jpg)
---
"You fight balls out, literally"
---
How do you increase the photo limit on PC? 
---
Cause it caps just like the consoles.
---
Well i guess nothing, but since it has been certain way from launch of the game people have used hundreds of hours (some thousands) trading and getting items and by changing the "rankings" bethesda will undo everything people have worked for. Items they have may lose most of their value. In this case, junkies being relatively expensive prefix atm, will become close to worthless as anti armor would be way better and way more desirable since it does the same damage (roughly) with zero negative effects. All prefixes that provide 50% increased damage on live right now would also lose their value, as all of them also have negative effects on them. All this would have massive negative effect in player trading and markets.
---
I noticed it as well on PC since last update, rather annoying.
---
You should have kept all yourself. The penalty is really small and getting reputation is easier than getting gold bullions.
---
I will not be actively participating in Season 2. Season 1 killed any desire to be a slave to the grind. In the end,  none of the rewards were worth the effort.
---
It’s not just the light itself. The game then has to calculate shadow effects for each of those light effects. 
---
Yes ash is worse than goo. Goo doesn’t have a changing light effect that requires constant shadow recalculation. I have a GP and can handle piles and piles of goo, but the Tesla kills my FPS.
---
Hopefully local reset. I live in the netherlands
---
Agreed!!
---
Sorry, but you are being a bit silly. 
---
I mean, you want stealth? You have it. Want rad resistance equivalent to a hazmat suit? You have it. 
---
Want to look good using an outfit? Equip the outfit. 
---
You can't wear the outfit, get the looks and also the benefits from what is an overpowered piece of equipment. It's like wearing a full set of SS Chameleon and Power Armor on top of it. 
---
You can always carry the stealth suit, as I carry the Emmet Hazmat suit, just in case.
---
I love my camp build as well as my location. I just like hanging out in it haha

Do you use VATS? Commando.
---
Do you use Power armor? Heavy gunner.
---
Do you like to Sneak? Commando.
---
Do you feel comfortable with "more ammo then you really need"? Heavy Gunner.
---
Do you want to cause a lot of VATS Crits? Commando.
---
Do you want weapon related weight perks? Heavy Gunner.
---
Well that's kind of it. Plus, we're supposed to be "the best and the brightest" in a state that wasn't directly hit. There's gonna be all kinds of weird and wonderful things going on around us that didn't pop up anywhere else.
---
Accidentally left it out, but the only PA suit I'd consider hard canon at this point to my memory is the Ultracite Prototype, and that's because we know they were experimenting with the Ultracite design, so they probably did have prototype parts along the way.
---
For me reset time is at Noon. Vendors should just reset at whatever time your daily reset time is every day.
---
Not sure what triggers the bug, but it is a bug.
---
To get around it, you need to do the free states part. (Abbie's Bunker)
---
For me, I tried talking to rose again when the free states part sent me back to her. After talking to her about the free states part, she said "I see there's something else you want to say" and then it proceeded as normal.
---
Whether you can return to her earlier, I'm not sure.
---
But it should definitely fix itself when the free states part sends you back to her.
---
So console has the ability to "send a message" to another player? or have I just missed this feature on PC?
---
Wait so i could have 50 strength as an intelligence build?
---
You dont need to run out btw, kill all ghouls and loot them after Earl death, u will be teleported outside just fine. Box at the entrance have crap loot anyway
---
It did in the PTS sometimes, now  if you get a cursed weapon it does directly into your inventory
---
I like to clean out Flatwoods as a junk run. It has some of almost everything, and it's an outdoor zone so no extra load screen.
---
It Will most likely just end when your competitor reaches rank100(dont remember his name). Not giving you extra time to purchase ranks. I have no facts of this, im just assuming
---
Reset for me is at noon which is when I usually play but if I have to work late and can't play until later that night then when I get on the next day, vendors will not have reset when I start playing.
---
My understanding is that there is a two week gap between the first season ending and the second beginning.
---
Thanks! Any links to posts that show what they look like?
---
But a cursed weapon drops from event completion not chest
---
Would it though?  I'm pretty sure the Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit would have had to support that.
---
Although it has been nerfed hard and everyones running around Bloodied, i love my Two Shot Explosive Handmade. Combined with stealth perks i can take out lvl 70 enemies with 2-3 shots.
---
After Bloodied Commando: AA PA Heavy Gunner. 
---
Completely different play style.
---
I get ult 5.56 from them
---
I dont have any pics but the cursed weapons are just low weight scrip and the plans are ok mask is trading very well right now
---
Believe it or not my actual fear about what to choose is how loud the weapon is, whereas a suppressed assault rifle is like pspspspspsppspspspspspspsppspspspspspspspspspspspspspssp a 50. Mg is like RADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADA
---
Wow, yeah that makes sense, never thought about like that,  good info man.
---
Ignoring points and whether they were well made I always decide internet arguments on grammar and correct spelling in a tiebreaker situation so I'm afraid you lost this one no matter how "street" you try to sound.
---
Nothing in this game amuses me more than stumbling across those insane battle royales and seeing a couple of lowly insects holding their own.
---
I started playing a few weeks ago. It’s a great game, but holy shit is a lot of stuff broken. 
---
I can’t complete a main quest because of the blood sample thing, and that prevents me from moving forward with the overseer. 
---
I make progress on side quests and then the server drops. 
---
I shoot the head off of a ghoul and it freezes still standing with no health but somehow still alive?
---
I kill some monster and then it’s corpse glitches through the floor and disappears. 
---
Wtf
---
Yup, idk who started that false rumor but its been known since like day 3 of WL.
---
It helps to think of it this way, __you failed the main objective__ therefore you do not get the good reward payout
---
Ya I was definetly contemplating a heavy full health build thabks for the suggestion!
---
Thank you for the heads up :)
---
exactly they used to be in the chest
---
So it doesn't anymore then
---
Thanks for the info, i'll look into that as well :)
---
Only try it at your own house. Do not try it at a bar because your Per could hit 0 and then regret it next morning.
---
😂😂😂😂😂 that's fucking gold.
---
I missed the last one all together - but I finally got to do one. I had NO idea what I was doing out in the world, like I was on my lvl 31 and was getting just eaten by these lvl 50 creatures. I didn't know you could do the same thing in different areas with different lvl creatures.
---
But finding the actual BBQ spot with Grahm was so nice and made me happy. Yes I got the cow body outfit and lots of meat bits. But it was worth it and Im happy to have done it. Now to wander from camp to camp to see if I can find any plans I can buy lol \^\_\^
---
Nice
---
Small addition to already good summary. Both build types, stealth commando and power armor heavy gunner have similar power level when killing bosses. So it all boils down to which playstyle one likes the best. Stealthy commando with silenced weapons killing enemy silently from the shadows or a walking badass tank with huge weapons that go BBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! while laughing at the enemy as they fall before him (or her).
---
I'm using a bloodied handmade as my everyday gun, and it shreds most things. The durability is pretty good; I use weaponsmith to get a double bar, of course, and also put the forceful stock on it which greatly increases durability.
---
Nice to hear. I have heard from others my/our age that it has kept them hooked though they are not traditional "gamers".
---
I won't be up for the second season though personally, simply because I'm totally burnt out with the game after so long and I won't play enough after I've earned those tidbit rewards to actually appreciate them.
---
That sucks that you have to quit out the game on PlayStation to send a message! Every time I've messsaged another player I've done it through the Xbox app on my phone (quicker than the on screen keyboard) whilst the game's running.
---
But yeah, I agree about the server chat...definitely a good idea and also a standard on online games so it's weird there isn't one. Here's hoping it'll come eventually!
---
The Bethesda community manager replied a week or two ago saying they’ll pass this request onto the developers. I hope it happens, it’s frustrating having to pick from so many photo opportunities...
---
Yeah, the power armor in FO76 is just another option, not really any better or worse than regular armor, given its trade offs.  In the previous games (maybe up to FNV), I felt rather exposed and vulnerable until getting that first PA suit.  After that, I could quit sneaking around all the time and actually face (some) of my foes head-on.  Some areas that were instadeath before became doable with a set of PA.  Yeah, keeping up with fusion cores was a bit of a pain, but power armor gave you exactly that - power.
---
In FO76, I wear power armor for high-rad areas and nuke zones only.  I feel big, heavy, slow, and stupid, and cant wait to get back to being small, smart, sneaky, and speedy again.  I understand that PA appeals strongly to a lot of people, the same way a huge 4x4 SUV might.  Me?  I’d rather be in the equivalent of a Lotus or an Ariel Atom.
---
That's pretty much because the server isn't recognizing the amount of damage being dealt, so it negates it, exact same thing occurs with magic shotguns as an example.
---
The oddest thing I've seen is a Cultist base being attacked by a Scorched Mothman.  The dialogue was...well...odd.
---
165 is nothing. I'm over level 250 and still have yet to drop one of my own. I've run through a silo a few times with other people launching a nuke, but never for myself. I've got the key card, I even grabbed 14 of those cores you need on one the runs I tagged along for. I even went to do it myself one time but all three silos rejected me because of recent nukes being set off by others, and I didn't feel like ditching my public team for a server hop at the moment. 
---
One of these days, man. One of these days.
---
The only reason pa is set up for legendary effects is because they were present in fo4. Its likely they haven't added legendary pa because it may make regular armor obsolete. I mean imagine a full set of sentinels t-65. Although I'd love to see unique peices like the tesla t-60 set return.
---
Whitespring golf club down the stairs to your left theres the boss room and check all the lockers I occasionally find a clean one here and there
---
Insult Bot asks me when I'll start using the pile of trash I accumulated to build something.
---
I used to do 3-way inter account trades in the toilets at Watoga station before 1st. A male and 2 females. Though we (I) closed the door, sometimes people would get interested and have a look. Not exactly what you asked but I think I'm probably the odd one in those situations.
---
Just realised that if anyone reads this comment out of context in my post history...
---
He complains to me about them too and I have no idea what's he talking about.
---
I could be wrong but from what I saw power armor has three slots for legendary effects which is no doubt fallout 76 exclusive.
---
Cool. Might mod my lever action into prime, then. Ammo farming.
---
I just hated having to deal with level 60 bloater ghouls in whitespring i chose a spot that was a direct spawn point for them 😂
---
Yes please, I would love to have either a timer system or a consistent reset time based on time zones. How about raising the daily gold limit from 200 to at least 300 while they're at it.
---
I have a saved blueprint that I use for workshops. It's a seedy shack with workbenches, stash, and turrets on the roof. It doesn't include resource extractors of course, but it gives me an instant core to build from.
---
Also, with the raise of Bloodied and Junkies, TSE weapons have become cheaper aswell.
---
Max out demo expert and bloody mess for damage and get the rifleman perks.
---
You can run commando Automatic too but it eats through ammo.
---
Tank killer is great too.
---
I feel ya man.  I have 140 Treasury Notes and can only turn in 20 a day.  Plus I am still doing dailies.  It's a pain in the ass.  I have a solid weeks worth of notes to turn in if I do nothing but log in and turn in 20 a day.  Don't get it.
---
Very true. Honestly I don't bother to loot the wendigos. But people do. Info like though would be useful to pass around to those using the event for junk though :)
---
Yeah, the ‘wild corn’ plant looks a little different from regular corn (which is a little unnecessary IMHO, but whatever) and the item they drop is just...corn.  Why ‘wild blueberry’ bushes don’t just drop blueberries is beyond me.
---
Let me second planting cranberries, though.  They are darn useful.  Tarberries I don’t see a lot of, so I maybe don’t feel so strongly about, but them cranberries...
---
I kinda just went to high place to get a nice view while I was low lv. Stayed there since, and only thing that annoys me is 2 tents that spawn low lv Blood eagles. If my turrets actually target them and not loose their shit on wandering merchants, it would be nice and cozy place, with occasional missile clearing pests.
---
I didn't even know till today. You'd think it would be a idea to have a in game notification or something.
---
Lol, this is what happens when you let your kids play with nuclear weapons.
---
YES! Workshops are wasted potential atm as no one will spend time building them up into cool settlements if it will be deleted as soon as you log off.
---
Is meaty sarcastic?
---
Not if you melt the boss before they can deal the minimum damage.
---
I don't think we really need to worry, first of all, the season pass is free. It's not like it wasn't.
---
Beside a couple of Atomic shop stuff, Bethesda is making sure that the stuff to gain must be grinded. To make it more clear, we are working for our unlocks. Don't expect them to simply throw all of this in the Atomic shop. Our adventures have always been rewarded though our efforts. I don't think it's gonna change.
---
Rewards are mostly trophies in this game, this is what i mean.
---
But i give an upvote, it's an interesting subject.
---
So in the player specific vault instance, is there unlimited storage as well? The biggest gripe I have with the game is the limited amount of storage for everything, and I'm not paying a monthly fee to get FO1st just to get unlimited storage. I *MIGHT* pay a single time fee of at most $10-$15 to get it, but monthly? No way. But if the player vault has much larger build limits, I would think it would have either much larger storage or unlimited. But then, it is Bethesda we are talking about, the same company that made the ammo converter the most painful experience in video games ever.
---
I’m gonna start using super duper soon. Probably should start now with stockpiling 2mm ec
---
I have almost 400 notes and over 10 3* weapons I can't do anything with
---
Its a great event and lots of fun and worth trying to join in on it, just wary of sinking resources into it when i'm not getting rewarded for the grind..
---
And there's no way for me to fix that? Only Bethesda?
---
Cosmetic
---
More rad resist would be amazing
---
ran into this problem myself today, going to attempt relogs and hope for the best.
---
I’m with you but I get why people didn’t like it too. It made playing the game a chore, but it happened to be a chore I liked doing every day. I finished earlier this week and just hanging out with my friends and doing material grinding has been so much more enjoyable
---
It is not available as a legendary in any way shape or form
---
So, the whitesprings? Honestly, I wouldn’t mind that.
---
Yep, they nerfed lag, lol.
---
Lol tell that to people putting cursed weapons in their vending machines! I totally agree that the cursed weapons are scrip (although the pickaxe is pretty good/not great/but good). But damn last night I was vendor hopping and people were pricing these in their machines at like 15k... and I just scripped 4 cursed harpoons because of the near 20% drop chance and I’ll probably scrip more of them again tomorrow.
---
Why 2mm? Gauss weapons?
---
for the love of god get rid off scrips or at least increase them if you really wanna people to comeback in the game and spend more time in it, is that to much to ask???
---
There are several other items.  Look them up
---
I am on xbox and i've been having this bad luck since I got the cursed harpoon gun on my 3rd event lol  
---
\*Edit (I got the Earle rug on my first event).
---
I was wondering about this.  I’m glad you let us know they would be useful to sell in a vendor.  I shoot the officers and pick up the keycards just so I don’t have to listen to the (to me, really unnerving) beeping noise when I’m trying to sneak around clearing an area.  Then they just stay in my inventory until they expire.
---
Hey I could be wrong too, it could go either way. As a pa user I'd love it but it might be too strong.
---
Yeah, gauss minigun. It’s only safe to assume it being a minigun will cause it to consume as much if not more ammo as my tri-barrel minigun.
---
I don't think he's a cryptid honestly.  I think the real mothman is out there and the ones we see are mutated moths.
---
I like your post though!!
---
I think you can buy each level up, so technically depending on how much real money you wanna spend, you can do anything your heart desires.
---
Ok sweet.
---
You could always buy levels with atoms
---
One of my characters is a hobo with a camp with no power, so, it doesn't show in the map. Minimalistic camp, you won't see it unless you walk by it. Not hidden, but at an unusual location in the forest. Just the machines, a sleeping bag and a small fire with a pot on. 
---
He sells godrolls (bloodied faster fire handmade, furious faster fire gatlings and plasma, junkies fixers, you name it) and full sets of armor for 100 caps. A bloodied faster fire Tesla is 80 caps or some wine, if you have it and I am there, sleeping.
---
Yeah, every time you log in you get their big advertisements to buy shit in the Atomic Shop. Would have been a perfect place to add a little heads up about this, too!
---
This! Much Will most likely change
---
There is a text chat mod for PC, but no official messaging outside of that, other than perhaps via your Steam interface maybe.
---
Yeah that's fair enough and it should be a power armour or non-power armour user but there is just so much benefits to not being in PA. I like the feel of it which is why I often use it but know that I'm handicapping myself.
---
Jesus christ why are you so into it? You don't seem to get the whole point. OP is asking bethesda for a way to get costumes over stealth armor, OP already probably fucking knows you can't and have to use other armors for stealth. How hard to understand is that?
---
Don't hate me, but I got a full unyielding set in about 25 tries, including a couple extra unyielding single stars. I'm starting to believe the server rng bias thing, because when I did legs I made three pieces of each and got three unyielding pieces.
---
I assume power armor will get it’s own pool of effects, but on that note when are we going to get 4 and 5 star legendaries in the first place?
---
20 hour reset times applies to bullion from the machines, scrip and caps.
---
Thanks. Seems like whitespring in general is my best bet from what I've read so far. Let the hunt continue!
---
Litterally hundreds of people on LFG doing it
---
If you are on PS4 and need help with the blood quest glitch, let me know. I can bring you into my private server to complete it.
---
I could also be wrong
---
Finally someone who understands. I got downvoted because someone was asking for backpacks for power armor and I said they already have tons of pros.
---
They have all the benefits you mentioned, no fall damage, built in rad reduction on top of the RR from the pieces, and no stimpack animation.
---
Hope you like Gauss weapons!
---
On a power armor chaise
---
Lfg?
---
weird that it doesn't
---
Exactly what i'm thinking. Could event keep the add, just a little message under it would do.
---
Sadly yes, your best bet (and my guess) would be waiting a few seconds before firing the next shot.
---
Yarp bad luck its a pain in the arse!, i'm playing on xbox and its been really stable for bugs and issues until now, and i've seen lots of other events going off without any issues, even the meat feast only bugged out once for me and I played that event at least 4 times a day.
---
You think I know lol? My guess is never. It mightve been some holdover from an abandoned concept.
---
I built stairs outback to hold up my floor so I could make a spiral stair case.
---
It took a lot of trial and error since I have a wall and a half on my first floor. But if you don't do that it's very simple
---
I mean they still have time as technically the have it put down as winter. That doesn't have to and very likely wont mean this year. If it released Feb 2021 then it's still a winter release.
---
I tend to be sneaky and stealthed and doing about 12-15 damage per pellet, per shotgun blast that increases with each damage due to that perception card that increases VATs dmg with each shot.
---
It almost ALWAYS goes after me. But because I'm stealthed, it just stomps around angrily and spits where it thinks I am. Makes for a surprisingly effective tank.
---
Oddly enough I have found several inside gulpers. The other spots seem to be lockers like at whitesprings, westec, and camp venture.
---
I just found a police outfit and cap in the Monongah police station. I think they're static spawns. 
---
Graham's meat cook was giving me random responder gear as rewards, including a sort of dirty white fire helmet that I don't think I've seen elsewhere.
---
Yeah if there ever was any Chinese Power armour it was likely a prototype long lost in some Chinese lab.
---
When you think they'll get around to fixing this? Lol
---
chassis
---
LOL so much of PvP has been nerfed and your foodbuild ass still ain't happy.
---
Thanks but Xbox unfortunately :(
---
The lack of a stimpack animation is low key the greatest thing. Super useful when you’re getting staggered by a dozen wendigo spawn at once. But I don’t blame people for getting the wrong idea, it’s not as though the game makes it obvious how power armor is protecting you.
---
Sorry, I've never been great at spelling. Thank you for the correction
---
But it's a frame I believe
---
I manage 12-15 a pellet w/ a shotgun but I think its cause its got insane armor pen. 50% from legendary and then perf  mag
---
Ghouls seem pretty simple to implement tbh. It's just a skin texture change on the human body and you can throw in sum buffs and weakness to it.
---
This fixed it for my husband as well a few months back.
---
What system you on?
---
I think it was meant to be like that. Maybe power armor is made by the same guy who makes the hooded rags.
---
I just use power armor as a shield I'm too over encumbered to move quickly in power Armor but it sure makes a good shield! ^_^
---
I have a nice flat spot that isn't Whitesprings.  Lol. Makes it easy to place prefabs and its centrally located on the map. Low and high levels visit. On the NE corner of the empty lake along the road.
---
Xbox
---
Now I want a chaise lounge I can faint on while in PA.  :)
---
My camp is rubbish and someone annihilated it today but I love the fact that I can leap from my clifftop home and land on Bravo's doorstep.
---
There is a reason Fractured Steel was labeled something vague like Winter 2020 instead of a concrete date or even just a specific month. They were giving themselves leeway.
---
I wish there was some way to prevent food spoiling or just remove that mechanic. It's not like it benefits the game and players are already heavily limited from hoarding by the stash limits.
---
It's not as cool as you might think. I was looking forward to it myself but felt quite disappointed when I got it. It's quite small and you can't remove the small deer head from it. There is a new fireplace found thru datamining that'll be on the atom shop at some point and from the pictures, it looks way more grand than the fireplace door from Season 1.
---
The pre nuke Tales from West Virginia audio books have the same appearance for the Mothman as the ones we see in game so I don't think it's a mutation. If anything it makes the statue at the museum an oddity, other than just being a copy of the RL version.
---
Like others said basically if you clean your sink but still have rusty pipes you're not gonna have good water
---
Only 15 more until I have a chance to score a short scope!
---
Apologies, English isn't my main, what do you mean with outback? 🤔
---
I understand how the sink doesn't literally determine the water quality that comes out. But in a video game it's just funny that something clean would give something dirty
---
Beach and clear is always broken for me. It never marks the area as clear even after I kill everything.
---
Yeah. I mean, the thing about secret doors, is that everyone in the game knows exactly what they look like. And it's graphics are slightly blurry.
---
No idea, but the least i hope is that with the damage nerf the server actually registers the damage done.
---
It always just stored onto my hard drive in a particular folder.
---
It's whatever you have, in this case I have 4TB but it's nowhere close to filling it out.
---
So I have my house. And the stairs are behind the walls of my house. So that they are not inside, but are outside my house holding up the floor.
---
 Will try to upload a pic soon to help explain
---
Screws are the new wood. Those wendigos drop tons of them. I used to have 100-150, now I am selling 800 a day.
---
&gt; As for carry weight, Excavator and calibrated stocks are for you, it'll give you more **than** Unyielding will.
---
You forgot backpacks and it's mods which are not working while in PA.
---
135 carry weight (unyielding set + backpack) + chemist or food mod. 
---
PA have this meh ''bonus'' which sets your strength to 8 if you have less than that. This basically punishes your for putting any strength points if you are deciding to play mostly with PA.
---
Now there is a question for you. Would you prefer:
---
* Excavator + CS to have 200 weight carry 
---
or 
---
* Unyielding set with chemist/food backpack to have 135 weight carry and 90% reduction for either chems or food
---
There is also third option (although not that good):
---
* Unyielding set with high capacity mod for backpack to have 195 weight carry at the cost of losing 60 DR/ER
---
Or how about take the timer off and let us use what we have
---
So you have no problems with your Gauss shotgun?
---
Or the Sunshine Meadows workshop
---
They are low weight scrip though.....I can see myself keeping doing this event for that (and flux) in the same way that the SBQ provides repair kits (and also flux). Earl is more benevolent though giving back so much ammo of the type you used*.....and screws....
---
*not railway spikes though
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
Click "Hide All" then select just "Power Armor" and then start going to each location, they are mostly random to what you're going to find on each one, might take a bit to find the helmet type you want.
---
I think I get what you mean, but you have to leave them there then...they would be visible. ☹️
---
How about all plants we can grow and harvest? I mean why not? It already takes budget and thats more precious than gold bullion ..
---
I could totally see someone building a camp with a huge canning cellar if this was a thing. Great idea!
---
I'm certainly interested - more data is always welcome. :-)
---
I run a T65 with calibrated shocks and get about 370 carry weight. Same as my regular excavator armor. Adding to my excavator shocks gets me about 470.
---
Star Wars The Old Republic MMO
---
Yeah. Sadly I don't know of a way to have an upper floor without stairs maybe the folks on r/fallout76settlements might have some thoughts
---
It has been happening to me too. Big numbers but health doesn't drop. Got tired of it with my main, so I am transitioning towards a full 8 SPECIAL character. 
---
What's the point in specialising if I am not going to do REAL damage?
---
Jump higher :3
---
A waste of bullion really, maybe not so much if it was half the  current price, but even then I'd still think twice :-)
---
A good bit of them are found in the various vendors in The Whitespring 
---
Pretty pricey though but they have some fancy stuff
---
Fuckin right.
---
Agree totally, I often don't have to fight anything until the final room protecting the damn technicians, CSS and hacking the turrets works best for me though.
---
Will have a look. Thanks. 😊
---
Snag a few heavy gun perks and grab something that does decent damage. If you’re bloodied i use a 1* bloodied minigun to take those out on my melee toon. Since melee and heavy guns share strength it’s easy enough to do without fucking up your build
---
Ok, ive also gone to some responder vendor bots and they have like 5 plans
---
Bloodied 50 cal works a treat....
---
Having literally the exact same issue
---
Mine is inspired by the Bakers Plantation (RE7) when people come inside I start walking towards them with a shovel.
---
Mine didn’t
---
One Whitespring vendor deals specifically in expensive camp plans, some can be over 10k caps tho
---
My bloodied explosive fixer broke too much, gave it to a friend who gave it back for the same reasons.
---
So overrated. Bloodied limb damage might be good.
---
Talk to the bot, see what its feelings are.
---
Even the most die hard melee build should have a ranged weapon for just in case situations. With maxed strength a .50 cal or LMG would make short work of the cargo bots and vertibots in a key card convoy.
---
I knew the Atom Shop items weren’t all cannon!
---
Mechanic being removed :3
---
Another issue is that’s it’s hard to get into heavy weapons until late game, so what can I use in the mean time?
---
Anti Armor and Crippling effects help with taking them down. for a heavy gunner i use One gun army as well as Stabilized
---
Yeah man I really feel you
---
That's a nice idea. Even if it's just a single target type, it would be useful. It could tell you your damage stats and you'd get to check recoil etc.
---
I once met Abraham Lincoln
---
Wtf.
---
Thanks!

There is no legendary version and it protects from airborne diseases just as good as a simple bandana.
---
It’s a proper little farm I’ve set up near 76, I use it to supply new players and get them started
---
OK, not what I was hoping for.
---
Was hoping to increase the photo limit so that more than 50 photos can be cycled through for the splash screens during loading.
---
Workshops drop tons of C.A.M.P. plans. Just be prepared for someone to challenge you for it since they are the only pvp areas available now.
---
I thought it cycled through all the photos you had?  First I heard that there was a set 50.
---
It kept me logging on everyday with something to do.  A lot of the rewards were pretty terrible.  Perk card packs, really?  I have enjoyed this season method of leveling in other games.  I think it will be good here.  Hopefully there won't be a lot of down time between them.
---
PA has the best defense in the game.
---
The first night I had a 6/6 success rate with 0 deaths. Longest kill time was 23 minutes and shortest was ~10 seconds. Since then I've done it another ~10 times but still no helmet :-/
---
Behind the Red Rocket in Flatwoods there are usually 2 or 3.
---
This has happened to me as well (on ps4). I’ve found if you have joined a team, you can force close the game then restart it and pick “play with team”. It should spawn you right outside the mine and you can join back in.
---
Be sure to server hop and check grahm next meat week.  He sells quit a few different rare camp plans.
---
I can usually scrape 1500 off desperate folk. If you leave em in there at 1500 long enough, someone will buy. 1500 is probably the upper limit.
---
Use Gatling Gun (heavy weapon). It uses the cheapest ammo (5mm) and shoots hard hitting bullets with low fire rate. Extremely efficient ranged weapon. If not the most efficient.
---
Yeah, haven't done much with workshops but I claimed one and dropped some turrets, and when i needed to defend it I got quite a few
---
No it dont.. 😂.. My secret service is tankier then that
---
Yes. I crouch and hide and fast travel away as soon as possible...  
---
However, I don't willingly leave the server if I see someone at my camp in case they're shopping or crafting etc.
---
Xbox? I've played with and against him quite a bit
---
Smh, poor people.
---
? It straight up negates 40% of incoming damage, it's the best defense in the game.  It's not like it'll make you invincible.
---
If I try to take a photo after I hit the cap, it doesn't save it.
---
The explosive Gatling guns are just as bad. The Tesla’s arc dissipates as soon as it’s fired but the explosive guns are causing a secondary explosive effect to be rendered with every single round fired.
---
Lingering effects are causing the problem. It’s a combination of:
---
- red “lava/radiation” falling all over the area
---
- green radiation pools all over the area
---
- rocks falling
---
- a multitude of glowing wendigos having to be rendered on screen, then when you kill them they drop individual loot for everyone that tagged them all at one time and if people don’t loot them to make their bodies disappear it just adds more “data” having to be rendered/stored which makes it even worse for the next group of wendigos that spawns
---
You can test this by jumping into the event and noticing how smooth it starts off in the beginning. You can use the Tesla or any freaking weapon you want at first but as soon as the first set of Wendigos spawn and are killed, the FPS goes below 10. It’s literally a race to kill Earle as quick as possible because the longer you take to kill him, the worse the performance of the event gets.
---
Here's a list of all the stuff that's only (I think?) available from the Atom Shop, and a lot of these are no loner available at all. So basically, if you want absolutely everything, you'll need a huge amount of atoms and have to wait for all of them to come up for sale again.
---
Plus a few are only available with Fallout 1st or twitch prime.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Atomic_Shop/C.A.M.P.
---
It’s every twenty hours since you scrip first piece and or buy gold
---
Yep good luck using that with earl.. 😂.. You cant..
---
that's literally impossible. PA has a hidden flat damage reduction effect.
---
much, much more useful at reducing damage than all the dr you can get through SS and perks like barbarian, evasive, etc.
---
that’s my main point.  Furious isn’t too bad and some folks like Vampire, but there’s SO MANY legendary types that are essentially useless and just take up space, or are narrowly specialized (and not even all that great at their specialization anyway).  I know that in RPGs/MMORPGs there’s usually one or two ‘super’ weapons that reign superior over all others, but it sure would be nice if the gaping divide between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ legendaries wasn’t so wide in this game.
---
I agree.  I could probably kill him by myself, but I don't want to waste all that ammo.  If everyone helps, no one has to spend too much ammo, etc.
---
My camp is on the hill at line in the sand. Fuck those never landing scorched beasts with my shotgun build.
---
Lolz no power armor is trash.. ive had worse experiences with it.. i never see people use it.
---
Each instance can hold 8 people - looks like you missed being in the first instance
---
The weapons I tend to use in the Collossal problem and Scorched beast queen is usually a Plasma caster and Lvl 30 fixer, I'll try looking through vendors for 50. Cal thank you &lt;3
---
It does?  And I do.  In fact I pretty much can't die in that event.
---
I will buy their keycard then use it to nuke their camp.
---
I'll try looking for one, Thank you!
---
I'm all for the cosmetic/camp stuff staying exclusive to the season, but I think items that have a gameplay use/purpose (ammo converter, chicken coop, etc) should be made available through other means.
---
Again...it just worked again ( ingame day time, all my attempts ), i couldn't pick the ones i picked earlier, but others bloomed and yeah...it worked again. I'll do a quick montage as soon as Youtube let me edit my video so i can put decent french and english details in the description. Yeah, i mean imma take the oppotunity to actually do an helpful video.
---
until i got my first heavy weapon, i just played with what ever i found, but mind you this was back in the day where TS, E and TSE where stupid strong
---
I really only care about the stuff you can get by just finding it
---
Thank you for the replies everyone! Yeah, its disappointing that is it still only cosmetic. It would be nice if you could craft a legendary variant or added some buff like extra perception or endurance.
---
I'm still showing up with my clown suit and legendary tenderizer and you can't stop me
---
i see people die all the time including myself.. 😂
---
Those are code pieces. Nuclear keycards are totally different.
---
that's not an argument. it's a fact that power armor reduces incoming damage by a given %, unlike regular armor.
---
that's also not true. a lot of players use PA.
---
Ohhh I didn't know that, thank you ill look out more for legendary Lmg in vendors thank you!
---
What is this man thinking?  Power armor is definitely better for defense than non power armor.
---
That makes sense. I wish it was mote like SBQ. I love having 20 of us there.
---
Console?
---
That unkillable bloodbug I ran into at Fort Defiance was a force to be reckoned with and handily killed me with DOTs.
---
Maybe you/they aren't using the right gear.
---
Shoot the engines. Gets slower with each one hit. Get all 4 it hovers and can’t move.
---
h-t- is absolutely right. When properly modded (with emergency protocols) and using correct perk setup PA's are **BY FAR** the tankiest you can get.
---
You’re gonna get downvoted but youre right. It’s not forced on you, half the challenges get done by just playing yourself, and if you really want all
---
The rewards you can just pay for them
---
He will also get stuck in an endless falling animation from the ceiling through the floor.
---
I guess that would have been what they would have bought with the extra gold bullion.
---
Didn't know that thank you!
---
It apparently happens because you’re playing at or immediately after daily reset. This subreddit is flooded with the same complaint at the same time every day so I’d say that’s the reason why.
---
I don't know. extremely confused right now. maybe fishing for downvotes, who knows.
---
I guess that they both like seeing Appalachia from a distance seeing as they don’t leave your camp ever. Maybe they prefer the sofa area near your tv?
---
lol no power armor is way to clunky..
---
I like the location of mine and also the layout of my building. I don't like living in a singular box like I see a lot of the time x) so I spice it up
---
Maybe.  Or just a secret service fanboy?  Or purposely trying to mislead people?
---
I also like it even if I don't play enough to finish the run. (I think I'm at level 75).
---
One-shotting? Maybe not. Killing Earl in 10 seconds? Yes.
---
Oh lord!
---
Yes.  Something along those lines.
---
If you use emergency protocols on the chest piece you're pretty much unkillable tbh, it's like having an emergency second healthbar 
---
I have a vampire laser gatling I switch over to when my health reaches about 1/4th, just spam lasers instead of stimpacks til I'm back to max health, and then go back dealing damage with my gauss minigun 
---
Haven't come close to dying on Collosal Problem once
---
&gt; Not sure about the team size, there are more things in this game than the common perception would give. Also don't forget we are now in a state of emergency almost everywhere. Things are not easy at all.
---
&gt; 
---
The initial game was made by all of Bethesda Game Studios so there was a good chunk put into the initial game. The post work has been handled by the Texas studios, specifically Austin with an occasional assist from Dallas. They are the smallest studios. Not saying things would be perfect, but I suspect things would likely go better more often in terms of content if they were a good 2-3 times the size they currently are.
---
Ok thank you for the info. I apologize for the same question. How do you fix it? I've tried leaving worlds, reopening the game, etc.
---
Let us keep our armor on while wearing power armor. Idc if i lose all of the DR from my normal armor, I would rather not be 400 pounds over the weight limit.
---
I agree - Valseek said this is not intended to "make the game harder", which leads me to believe they will be dialing up key buffs or base damages.  
---
I asked them on forums whether or not this is shipping in P22. Fingers crossed it won't.
---
I just traded for a JE GP. So you are saying it's still a viable weapon in the PTS?
---
When I see nuke dropping I wait with the map up and click it right away. Least people I’ve had was 4 of us. Don’t wait ever
---
Is there actually an official end date?
---
I have a campe below the map, so you're able to just look into the endless void, or passively watch the world go by
---
Shotgunner perk, demolition expert, charge first shot and then spam
---
Explosive Gatling gun. It's like a rifle but for high str builds. You can take down a cargo bot easily without any perks assigned.
---
Alright? I am missing something?
---
Haha you'll get plenty of caps soon enough, try getting the daily amount of caps from robot vendors by selling bulked junk 
---
And much more can be made from selling legendaries in your vendor for other players to scrip
---
Yeah. Complete question dodge. Apparently they don't play enough
---
I just use the short gattling gun because it just feels good, and it sounds like the tractor cows from cars when you stop firing
---
Explosive weapons are good for damaging the engines since you can afford be less precise.
---
Even if they added it to the enclave base as a shooting range
---
Most I see are bloodied and refuse to adjust their tactics when they are swarmed. They stay at the 20% upper limit and die in 1-2 hits.
---
I radaway myself to \~40-50% and generally don't die.
---
I can take a full salvo from Earl and stay alive, needing to stimpack myself so I can take another salvo.
---
What will now be the best OP non-legacy heavy weapon? A bloodied firerate gauss minigun? Or, for the SBQ, a faster firerate bloodied 50 Cal?
---
This is shotguns today: when in VATS, crazy overpowered. Outside of VATS, can't kill a molerat.
---
This happened to me last night! I expected it to be a super mutant and went in swinging, no light, wooopsie, big fella!
---
I'm currently at level 40 and trying to save up scrip, so right now I'm stockpiling and selling the legendaries whenever i can
---
The secret answer is 20% health and a vampire's heavy weapon.  I was standing under the embers, being attacked by earle, and not losing any health.
---
When doing earl with my ss armor he can kill me with his spit attack in one shot. When I’m in power armor killing earl I can take multiple spit attacks before he kills me and both armors have about the same damage resistance so power does have 40% less incoming damage.
---
The blinding flash should be a thing for sure
---
I use Green Thumb to double the hall - never need more than I can find there, especially since Good With Salt makes it last basically forever.
---
I honestly can’t wait for it to be done. While I’m trying to actually complete the game itself I feel compelled to do these challenges, just because you do some of them any way and it rewards you, so after being rewarded for doing some I kind of want to do them all or most of them at least. I mainly wanted the boost to caps and atoms
---
Power ranking should remain about the same.  I personally like vampire's at low health.  Hard to die but still do a lot of damage.
---
Have you consider, just maybe they don't like you? Use the remote it come with it.  or maybe you didn't have hacker perk on xD
---
pretty much expected that reply with that title.
---
Need to swing by Freddy's to get one myself for my next run.
---
Mine is built at the alien guide stones, an unmarked location that most people are completely unaware of.
---
Thank you so much! I had no idea this had been added! :)
---
I must be really lucky.  Most of the time (on PC) others are actively working to advance the event.  There have been some players leaching, but not to the extent I feel a need to make a Reddit post about it.  
---
Are leachers really a problem?  Like, most of the time you’re having to carry the event?  If so, I sincerely sympathize.  That would totally suck.  Counting my blessings here.
---
Rather have the bugs fixed then worry about how many pictures are on it, it’s simple rather have a working model then a game that splits off on players whims in a thousand directions and still don’t work
---
But I love my little shooting babies ;_; 
---
Why don't they like meee
---
Its an easy question to answer, thats why. That and they probably get asked that alot.
---
Everyone on the map should die when a nuke goes off technically.
---
You forgot to add the 1* part in your comment about the pool cue.
---
What chest?
---
I feel like players stash should be a minimum of 1000? Maybe let us be able to upgrade it?
---
Sounds romantic
---
Could somebody define “magic weapon”? I’m a level 190 junkies furious handmade user but I’ve never understood the “magic” prefix. I’ve looked for Fixer plans forever and just can’t get them so I’m settling for the handmade. Been wondering what magic means.
---
It looks great!! I have wanted that building set for forever but I missed it in the atom shop. :(
---
All heavy damage perks (+60%), bloody mess (+15%) and stabilized (ignore 45% armor) with a prime capacitor (+20%), with instigating (+100%) does it for me
---
I even sometimes use it in Earles for wendigo spawn, takes about 3 hits per spawn (they are like lv 75) though.
---
Oh, I forgot stacks of adrenaline. Thats another potential 60%. Will put you well over 800 per hit at max stack, no stealth needed.
---
If you want to squeeze every drop, don't forget tenderizer in charisma. And hell, drop to 50% hp with adrenal reaction and you're now probably in the 4 digits.
---
That’s really nice, I started this game a couple months ago and would have loved seeing a camp like yours near the vault!
---
They’re boring
---
Not really. If we compare the damage done by Little Boy, the lethal radius was [only 0.8 miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy#Radiation) [Map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Hiroshima_Damage_Map.png)
---
You can’t fix it
---
Not always, but yea that's when that happens. It partially happened to me yesterday. Half my dailies were completed. I apparently even survived 15 minutes of my 30 minutes needed to complet the Nuclear winter dailie. This one was a first lol.
---
So essentially you miss out on an entire days worth of dailies?
---
Yep
---
Little Boy was tiny at approximately 17-20 kilotons, not a good example. Tzar Bomba at 50 Mtons blew out windows hundreds of miles away and was variable yield up to 100 Mtons.
---
What was wrong with the post you made last month about the exact same thing? You didn't know there were mods for PA then, have you tried them yet?
---
What platform do u play please?
---
Hope to not spoil anything but if you decide to go with heavy guns finish Becketts questline ASAP. You get a wonderful heavy gun as a reward.
---
Nah, it just starts a meta-chasing cycle on the optimized margins. And roiling of the trading markets is a good thing unless you insist on selling buggy whips after Mr. Ford opens his factory.
---
Demolition ? work for weapons ? sorry kinda new didn't know this.
---
A fixer will probably work just fine. You can grab free .50 cals in toxic valley just below hemlock holes by the vertibird, if you really need, but you probably good, you just need a ranged weapon.
---
I’m directly south of Gorge Junkyard, only separated mere feet by a stream. The land my camp is on feels like a building should be there.
---
Do we know what types are used in Appalachia?
---
I will add my two cents. Power armour negates all legendary effects from regular armour. If you have a full set of vanguard sentinel this is a big difference. Also check out angry turtles video on power armour, the difference between the worst pa and the best is very small.
---
We’ve been requesting this since beta. Doesn’t seem like there’s much hope for it. Would be great.
---
Yes! Power Armor is underpowered. Adding this plus better mods for the arms would go a long way into making it more viable.

Hey man sorry it took so long. Really slow uploads from xbox

Hope you can figure something out that you like

I don’t think the missiles in the silos are the size of the tsar bomba lol
---
They may not be yours, but somebody's turrets damn sure always tracks me from across the map in every game causing me to use my 2 expired stims that took me 10mins to find
---
Whitesprings literally 8 out of 10 times a slideshow like 5frames or totally stop for a few seconds.
---
I would recommend not spending that scrip until you hit LVL 50 as the weapons and armor you get are leveled. Worst mistake I made when I first played was spending a bunch of scrip for lvl twenty weapons that my character outgrew a few days later.
---
Being set in the pseudo 50s they would have been in the multi megaton range. They built them  big back then.
---
Ok thank god. We dont need anymore of u on xbox. No offense
---
I hop in and go for the wendigo spawn exclusively, bc I have a shotgun+perks that kills them in 2-3 shots. However, nothing I do to Earle seems to give him much damage, but I noticed not many people try to get rid of the wendys and most attack Earle, so I feel like I'm being useful.
---
Nor would they be 17 Ktons, they would be 5-15 Mtons.
---
AA or troubleshooters weapon.  Vats sometimes helps, especially if you have concentrated fire and can target the thrusters.  Once one of those is damaged, it slows down and takes a less erratic path.
---
First onE I took down (also as a melee), did it with a combat rifle, and yea, it takes a good while
---
You mean every high lv?
---
I got him down last night in what had to have been around 2-3 minutes.  I have a TS ffr limb damage gauss mini and, seeing as how he is mostly limbs, it works in my favor.  usually with a full crew of 8 it takes 5 minutes or so but get one other person with insanity levels of gun and its game over.  Remember to enjoy it while it lasts.  I have a suspicion that Mr. Earl is going to be insanely difficult once we all get "debuffed" for One Wasteland.
---
I have mine right on one of the fairways of The Whitespring. 1 min run away from the disease cure fountain, ghoal farming and vendors inside the main building.
---
Plus I have free defense robots and a nice view.
---
Thats a good perspective there tiger. No opinions here are wrong.
---
But your post does come off a bit combative and confrontational. Are you doing okay?
---
It was until i finished it that i realized there's nothing to do in the game.  
---
And now i am taking a long break.
---
Beckett’s always saying that he hopes we stay up here in the mountains. Savage divide east of WS
---
Same for me too 🤬
---
Couldn’t be mad if it fails in that case
---
But see, that's what I'm talking about. Thats being a real team player. Thank you for your service.
---
Got to say, I enjoy a sense of realism, but frankly this would be a nuisance. I'd rather just keep the game fun with less restriction, it is just a game after all.
---
I wouldn't be against a hardcore game mode with extra hazards though, that could be cool, but I'd rather not die from taking rads from a nuke dropped a mile away while trying to cook a scorchbeast steak, just because my cooking station is in line of sight of the blast. Just saying.
---
Oh wow a helmet

Grind the repeatable! It's doable in one week. Fireplace door is my favourite item of the run. More than a few times Ive tricked players who are not yet familiar that it is a door, and that brings warm and fuzzy feelings.
---
Yes I have the famous problems mentioned, and for my style of game I die a lot of times with the explosive damage but the dps is brutal, mine is bloodied and make a lot of damage.
---
My build is bloodied shotgun, I know is not the meta but for me is funny, although my main shotgun is a quad double barrel that is one shoot and for big levels enemies like mireluk Queen, etc I use the gauss
---
Good. Finally.
---
To be honest this will make a great future story. This time the settlers were the bad guys plot twist.
---
Great thing about my CAMP is, it’s a central spot and it feels like a home.
---
Source?
---
Yeah I have an ultracite set with that it’s wonderful
---
Me also, I love the screws and if I try to help with the boss I am just waiting my .45 or 5.56, I have never been blessed with a substantially powerful weapon on any of my three characters, but I paid for this damn game and will do as I wish.
---
I can solo a nuke quicker than I can with a team. It takes me about 16 minutes by myself to do it. Usually 20+ with a team.
---
I feel the same way about Firecracker and Starlight Berries, for Berry Mentats.
---
The Titan II had a 9Mton warhead.
---
It happened to me too on my low lvl Shotgun build character. I took a Black power weapon. It's still a lil pain in the ass, but you eventually take it down. I'm not repeating the experience tho.
---
I've been hanging out at my 20% range and doing just fine against Earle and wendigo. It's the falling roofs that have been doing me in.
---
I quit going. It’s such a bullet sponge. I agree I’d prefer more of a SBQ setting because we usually have two teams of four and we can never seem to all get in the same instance. Lately I’ve been getting stuck with low damage players who just seem to run around or can’t do enough damage to beat the event. 
---
I think I may start asking our teams to come to a private world to hopefully fix this issue.
---
I have 30 plans for sale at 1/10 list cost, and another 30 or so waiting to replace them. Stuff that’s absurdly common I have sitting in a bag next to a vendor for free. The prices people ask for plans is delusional. Come see if I have anything if you’re on PS4.
---
As terrible as the Reconstruction period was at times, it doesn't compare to the sheer scale or suddenness of the Great War. It is very possible that, as more settlers migrate to Appalachia, systems of exploitation will develop, especially when arable land is so scarce in the wasteland.
---
The only time I ever get rubber banded is when I use my jet pack sometimes
---
I’ll be on in 10. Thanks!
---
is it a bloody one?
---
You're lucky mine just CTD, no message, just straight closes :-)
---
If settlers claim more land than just foundation, I want an option to seize it from them. I havent gotten over how Paige was all like, well we're here and you can't do nothing about it.
---
Place is less defended than Westtek and their best troops are regular army washouts with low tier assault rifles. If they start expanding?! Make the wasteland dangerous for them again.
---
I drop 6 today 4 were easy as can be 2 of them I had like ten assautrons on me constantly
---
Kinda want an object that gives boiled water
---
Player vendors is the easiest and cheapest. Taking workshops and doing the defend events nets a ton of plans.
---
I'm not trading lol
---
I was dying a few times as a shotgunner, switched to my commando character and got a vampires Handmade as a 2nd weapon and I’ve not died since,  I’ve not even got SS Armour yet just a mix of random stuff that has AP refresh.
---
Bugged weapons that do more damage
---
I had two crashes during the event..... one of them was dying and being in a respawn limbo..... I freakin lost it!
---
There are cultist locations all across the map. Ingram’s Mansion (Savage Divide), Moth-Home (Mire), Kanawha County Cemetery (Forest), Sacrament (Toxic Valley), etc.
---
Just little quality of life features would make this game better, along with bug fixes.
---
can you progress the plot without playing the plot related quests? no.
---
If you want to do the raider/settler stuff, you do have to visit her house and do the inoculation stuff.
---
I prefer commando mostly cus i RP and carrying around a minigun or whatever isn't very practical for wasteland travel. But thats me.
---
The gauss would be fine if we had some kind of defense from it to try and fight back but we do not. When someone is spamming the trigger at me with one my game turns in to a slide show. I'll freeze for a few secs then will be dead after unfreezing. Loads of people are complaining about it so I know it's not just my internet.
---
Hopefully we get something like that. As big as Appalachia is, with so many people moving in, a conflict is inevitable.
---
As it is repeated in every Fallout game: War Never Changes.
---
Anytime you have the beginning of an aristocracy you have the risk of creating a serf class. An even more likely scenario is for the BoS to offer protection in exchange for supplies  ... exactly how the Middle Ages started.
---
Wanna experience it together?
---
Because the hardest of the core can't get that one extra turn-in a week if you change it to a 24 hour reset.
---
Oof, I'm on xbox
---
100% Agree about FOMO, quit Fortnite for this very reason.
---
Yep everytime someone is spamming the gauss shitgun trigger the game cuts down to about 5-10fps
---
All gauss weapons have built in explosive damage.
---
A quest to discover the nefarious secret behind the "perfectly preserved pie" leads to unlocking recipes to cook food that doesn't spoil.
---
Get on it, Bethesda!
---
Funny enough having an official canonical status for the Atomic shop makes the lore-breaky content a bit more appealing to me now. 
---
Like it puts it into that space where mods live, you know.
---
That's nice, WAY bigger building than mine tho and I don't have the luxury of trees to hide it.
---
It is what it is I guess, it will probably be a slightly bigger balcony... 🤷🏻‍♂️😊
---
Day one of the event being live the bobblehead was there every time I did the event. Now it’s more scarce I feel like they lowered the spawn rate for it.
---
I put Tesla Coil for increased ammo capacity and faster reload.
---
Gunner Sight for better accuracy.
---
I left the barrel stock, faster ROF means more healing, but I found the standard barrel fine for me. Keeping the sock barrel means slightly lower ammo consumption, as you can fire longer before having to reload. But if you want the higher ROF, triple barrel is what I normally use.
---
Personally play bloodied heavy gunner, commando is probably one of the top builds currently, but it's also fun just to experiment with new builds.
---
If you want to try something new, maybe try a bow build since there are the archer cards under perception and the bows that were released with wastelanders.
---
I'd be game to game a bit, just hit me up with your GT in a PM.
---
I don't really mind that there's no legendaries, I'd just like to see an additional mod slot for each piece. Calibrated Shocks are near a requirement and even then they're a worse backpack, jetpacks are just too damn convenient to not use, and the arms are in dire need of non-melee mods (stabilized for example).
---
But what if I wanna be nakey?
---
I'd be all for adding canning into the game. I could either see it requiring the player to just use metal in the production of the canned good, or by having a new recipe at the tinker bench to make tin-cans for canning goods. Could also be a cool idea to get a new "provisions" shelf or containers for you or your private team members to use. Maybe alcohol crates that would appear to fill up as you put beverages into it, shelves that would become full of your freshly canned goods or drinks that you could quickly interact with to use one of them without diving into the stash box. Now to avoid pantry thieves, this would be limited to the owner and private team members.

About 99% of the time I load in to an Adventure server my CAMP placement is fine - I don't get the message that I can't place my camp. Also, the main structure of my camp is so fortified that I hardly ever have to repair it.
---
Sorry, Laura took out my power/internet.
---
Yes, I've tamed and lost other pets. Griefers killed my last one, it took a while for me to even want a pet again after that. Still, I did everything as I'd done before. My only guess is that it either fell through the world, or maybe something to do with the fact the game wanted me to place a new camp as a misc wastelanders quest that I never did
---
oh really? I thought only dailies. So I can.. oh wow ty.
---
It'll only be a random spawn of a cargo boy and usually 2-3 vertibots, it'll be labeled as "steal from" but you won't get a bounty. 
---
Best way to get the cargo bot is to cripple it, one gun army, tormentor, enforcer, anything to cripple the thrusters
---
It makes sense to me that they would identify the items that have utility within the game  And the sensually year mark those as future bullion purchases because otherwise a vast majority of people would scream holy murder. I'd put 5 bucks that the upcoming weight bench in this next season is a guaranteed lock for the same type of treatment as the chicken coop and the ammo converter this time around.
---
I think the cosmetics should remain exclusive for those who actually did the seasons but stuff like the Ammo Converter, which is basically an essential item, should be available to everyone.
---
 I like the way FO76's season pass is in terms of the rewards and that it doesn't require anyone to buy it.  I'm even OK with how the score level up system works because I already play everyday and it takes like half an hour to finish, it just needs that fix to auto complete and maybe a small change to dailies after finishing the season.
---
Personally, I've always thought that the exclusivity in passes should only be limited to re-skins/color changes.  I think because they're giving away items for a limited time at the cost of a grind (dailies) that it is also fair to reintroduce those same items at the cost of another grind (gold bullion), so long as the latter is permanent.  It's how you attempt to avoid FOMO, which in my opinion is the worst thing to happen to the industry (worse than microtransactions).
---
I’m kinda doing a rifleman/Heavy gunner build myself with a little bit of stealth
---
essentially earmark*, not whatever twisted tale my bluetooth was trying to get out.
---
It is probably limited to 8 because of how confined the mine is, it also changes difficulty based on how many players are in the fight so that helps a lot. I dont do much damage in a full event, but I do a good amount of damage when there are only 3 to 5 players.
---
Personally I like doing this event with 3 to 4 players who know the fight, it goes quick and pretty smooth.
---
Pardon my grammar friend, but excavator does absolutely increase my carry weight, and I beleive the strength floor is 11 in fallout 76 it was  8 in Fallout 4. And for me I have 353 out of power armor and 448 inside. I use a refrigerated backpack myself so of course you can achieve better carry weight without power armor. This doesn’t change the fact that power armor has utility and depending on what options you select then that utility may be redundant, but that is a deliberate aspect of the game’s design. Not all items and mechanics are as important to different builds as others and that’s okay!
---
Now on the other hand I do have firmly disagree that a strength floor is “punishing.” That’s not how that works, points in strength allow you to equip more strength perk cards and I’m not here to discuss the value in that, only you can decide that for yourself. If anything the biggest “punishment” would be to not put points into Intelligence, since many of the power armor related perks are there.
---
I want to be clear that there are PLENTY of situations where no power armor would be more beneficial then the metal suit but that as said that’s kind of the point.
---
I believe at quakecon last year they said something like certain items (DOOM related cosmetics for example) will not be there because of being overly immersion breaking? Might be remembering wrong though
---
Nothing great, but 10 steps to westek for xp and steel
---
I agree my shotgun I was using has limb damaged as well then I use concentrated fire. I couldn’t do it alone because if I died his health goes back up. I could definitely do it otherwise would probably take me 10-15 minutes tho 😂
---
It's a huge grind. You gotta be prepared to spec for xp and server hop westek/burrows like it owes you a life. But all that being said, totally doable. I hopped like 30 ranks in 1 night alone from when I wanted to get ahead of Zorbo.
---
If we compare the world of Fallout to what took place in Europe following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, we do see some similarities.  
---
\- The Brotherhood of Steel is similar to the Catholic Church in how it held a monopoly on Pre-War knowledge and technology, similar to how the Chruch held a monopoly on academic learning.
---
\- The Enclave is an evil version of the Eastern Roman Empire, in that they still consider themselves true Americans and dream of restoring the United States to its former glory, only to be destroyed.
---
\- And much like the real Dark Ages, the misery the people experienced varied depending on where they resided. Places like California were utterly blasted into nuclear hellscapes, while places like Appalachia were still livable, as they were not directly targeted by the bombs.
---
However things turn out, it seems likely that both the Raiders and the Settlers will see the Brotherhood of Steel as a threat to their claims on Appalachia.
---
GOOD IDEA
---
&gt;flammable water
---
Sign me the fuck up!
---
Well that must be nice. Haha I am literally always having to repair something
---
Did anyone use any kind of explosive on him before the glitch?
---
Because based on totally anecdotal evidence from the folks I run around with in game (also PS4), it seems to be triggered by people using explosives (grenades, mines, fatman/nukes) on him.
---
If this works and is shown on the bar at the bottom, I'm going to feel like such a bloody idiot.
---
Thanks. Not exactly what I'm after but should give me a close enough effect.
---
“Plot” = hitting a button and listening to recordings
---
Nothing,my camp sucks at the moment. I got plans for the glass panels so I probably won't rebuild it for abother month.
---
Clean he means clean!!
---
Canned Cranberry Relish would be an absolute gem.
---
I have tall concrete walls surrounding three sides of my 'house' so that they takes damage from enemies before my turrets, or I, kill them.
---
Hmm. Good to know, but I’ve also heard him whining about Rose.
---
Any idea on other region dialogues?
---
I'm excited to finally drop the AP perks and gear off of my build and use shotguns normally rather than tapping Q over and over again to get realistic amounts of damage with them.
---
That’s just a bandaid fix to a bigger design problem.
---
Mine is on a cliff near The Bounty. The view is amazing, i have my peace and the Monorail Elevator is right in front for lead and cement.
---
Jumping down the cliff or the Elevator  with 2 free falling pieces is always fun to do.
---
You're more than welcome :)
---
Does a vampire gauss minigun on a heavy build count as "etc"?  
---
But anyway, I wouldn't be happy either to launch and have half the team do basically nothing.  I probably wouldn't stick it out and would just cut my losses by leaving.   Very disappointing.
---
People logging in every day for an hour looks better on paper than people logging in every other day for three.  It’s all about marketing, everyday you look at the atomic shop, which increases the likelihood of buying something.
---
I also find that sound incredibly obnoxious. I don’t pick up the codes because I don’t do nuke runs often (as a solo player who’s not really strong at combat, it just takes too long) but they can also be found online so there’s really no reason to pick them up.
---
Lvl 20 Returning player here, this is the exact reason I stopped playing. The lack of NPC people In the world back in the day REALLY killed it for me. Now I'm so close to the start of the game that I don't really have a clue what part is new or where should I go first.
---
Will the clean ones spawn as world spawns instead of in containers? There's 3 at camden park that are never clean.
---
From what I've herd it's not ingame yet it's coming as reward from season 2 along with bubble turrets and other high tech defenses unless your pc and on pts
---
So what do you feel the penalty for death should be?
---
How many hits do you need on a wendigo to take it out?
---
That’s what it is?? Ugh.
---
Hi,
---
Do you use the mutation or the armour?
---
Just remove the damn caps. Its dumb. Let us play the damn game.
---
100 percent agree.
---
Literally nothing in the shop....no membership status whatsoever.
---
Dude I've done the event a few times and yes the frame rate drops really low when there are 4+ players firing like crazy at Earle and the wendigo spawns. The same thing used to happen fighting the SBQ when somebody was using Strangler Heart PA (it produces a AOE cloud effect from poison damage). Its lagging the server because of all the effects that need to be rendered, that's all. 
---
Legacy weapons (I'm assuming this is what you're complaining about) are no good in this fight anyway as Earle has a high resistance to the explosive legendary effect (rip BE Gatling Plasma), BUT heavy weapons (eg. LMG, Minigun) with a 'magic' effect (eg. limb damage, '+33 VATS hit chance') are really good here. These 'magic' weapons are common too, there are no exploits needed to obtain them.
---
I dunno... kind of loving that fireplace secret door in my camp.
---
Those get given out so frequently as rewards that anybody of a high-level ends up with tons of them they can't sell.
---
Apart from screws and useless weapons just a pointless event.
---
Hope so....sure am glad I didn't buy a whole year lol
---
Magic weapons are weapons that apply incorrect damage types per shot (or per pellet for shotguns in particular) due to bugged legendary effects.  This adds extra damage calculations that the client/server relationship messes up somehow, meaning that you do a ton of extra damage with fast firing weapons, or do automatic one-shot kills on non-boss type enemies (anything except highest level super mutants, scorchbeasts, Wendigo Colossus, sheepsquatches, etc) with shotguns.
---
I've run it like 20 30 times and never had a problem. But I do have a problem with the fact if you die before you loot Earle there is no way to get back into the mine in order to get you loot, this has happened at least 3 times
---
Besides presents where do you get them?
---
Yeah it fuckin sucks. No matter how cheap no one wants them
---
Just everything that is on the sign up screen on the website. I was mostly looking forward to having the extra scrap storage and building up my base this past weekend....well needless to say, I'm still living in a wall-less 4x4 with all my crafting stations.
---
Nope, not at all.
---
Here you go
---
https://youtu.be/3LKkiKyWqlQ
---
It also can cause brain damage.  Enjoy!
---
That's because us PC players are the best!
---
Scrap storage is from the Scrap Box. Need to craft it under the stash menu
---
According to the wiki, they come in the Advanced Power connector's plan. they would be under power connectors, and if i recall correctly they require either Home defense, or Science perks
---
Oh, CTD happens too.
---
I wish...I literally stalk the shop.
---
Some people want the rewards so its good trades and its a guaranteed 3star drop
---
Oh it’s not for drinking...
---
50 cal makes short work of those
---
&gt; or by having a new recipe at the tinker bench to make tin-cans for canning goods.
---
Or just use tin cans already littered throughout the world lol?
---
You don't have to literally quit out of the game but you have to open up a new window and close the game window for a second or too.  I don't even like to do that I like to do everything in game when I'm playing a game.
---
Great, now we’ll have snobbish guilds where they require your resume to even join. Then bragging rights to “world’s first kills” ?
---
No problem my my ingame name is the same as reddit name got 1 good bud i play with we are both respectful and knowlegable who knows maybe when he sees how much fun your having he might decide to join in
---
Again, this not so subtle mechanic should not be in a game that you have already purchased. If they were willing to implement similar mechanics the game must have been free of charge, in that case no one would complain.
---
Little fun fact is that the tsar Bomba was supposed to be bigger, but the head guy (don't remember his name) purposely halved the materials. I couldn't imagine the damage 100MT bomb would do
---
I can't handle hostility in a game where we're all on the same side.. apparently.
---
I have my psn set up so people can send friend requests, and messages with the friend requests.
---
So if someone gives me shit with the friend request it's easy to block and delete them .
---
Try placing a Custom Marker then Fast travelling, works for me!
---
Looks pretty nice with Enclave Officer Uniform though
---
Earl just glitched through the ceiling and the wendigos stopped coming butvthe event clock was still running
---
Why do you need that many? The 20 you can get from the farm will produce 10 relish, which is more than you can use before they spoil. I just grab 4 plants (8 berries) to make 4 or 5 relish and that's enough for a couple days of playing unless you're on for like 8 hours straight.
---
You can get an arktos fridge that does help a bit... might be gone from the store thiugh
---
DIY flamethrower?
---
The perk card packs were worth over 100 coins towards the upcoming legendary perks.
---
Both to save ammo
---
Also let me say for the most part great community of people
---
I was in the event with a group when we got the notification that another nuke was coming. We did good teamwork and killed Earl fairly quickly. As I was on my way to the exit I got the notification that the event was available again. So, I exited the mine, got my rewards, and immediately joined the new ACP event. This time there was already 1 player there, waiting for the shaft to clear. They were talking on their mic to someone IRL in another language. The ruble cleared and I jumped down. Knowing that I can kill Earl in ~15 seconds, I waited for them. It took like 2 minutes of emotes to get them to jump down for the event. I made sure they got their hits in and I went to work on Earl and killed him this time in about 2 minutes. The other player was busy taking on a group of wendigo spawns and made a disappointed sound when they realized Earl was dead. I helped them kill most of the remaining spawns and made my way out of the mine. Still trying to get that helmet :-/
---
Ill gladly take any extras and will give them to new players.  Im on Xbox.
---
I don’t get the feeling it’s *that* flammable. More for party tricks.
---
At this point ill try anything. Thank you for the suggestion.
---
It looks like it belongs on the Quack outfit (the one with hanging radaway pouch), which is what I wear it with :)
---
I mean if we want to be the boring scientist here ;)
---
the cultist do tend to show up around Mothman's egg, and some animals can tell the difference between possibly-hostile and non-hostile humans. The Mothmen could just see them as part of a symbiotic relationship, "hairless apes protect my eggs, these apes are good unlike the other ones".
---
If you piss me off, I have a nuclear missile silo in my back yard!
---
Yeah, just stick a little countdown next to the scrip/bullion count for the machine
---
I’ve ran it 5 times now and 3 times he’s fallen thru the floor and we run out of time
---
how is it different than pressing "talk" and having an npc say things to you?
---
I think the 50 cal is better
---
To be honest, I never cared for them. I was happy to watch my husband play. But he would hand me the controller when he would go to the bathroom. His instruction was “don’t let me die”. After enough times, I wanted to play my own character!  Got to wean us wives into it!
---
It's already significantly better. I know exactly where to find cranberries. I can replenish my hunger and thirst bars by eating a couple raw melons every time I go back to my camp.
---
I don't have to hunt for random critters, and the only thing I ever have to cook is relish.
---
Hmm, I haven't had any problems with mine?
---
did bethesda come to your house and put a gun against your head? 
---
If someone logs in daily and gets all the good stuff in 60 days and you log in 60 days over 3 or 4 months you're still getting the same rewards they got by logging in 60 times. Why should you get the same rewards logging in and playing a fraction of the time?
---
So many paid games have daily stuff to do and limits. This is not a new thing.
---
I saw a friendly Legendary General’s Steakhouse Protectron.    He gave me some moldy food as a free sample.     He was walking down the highway in front of the restaurant trying to encourage people to visit.
---
I have a good 1 star legendary handmade that I could give you. On later. Psn snow-ninja
---
Idk if it is all of the reason but I do know that the gauss is causing everyones game to lag while being shot at with one
---
Tasty Squirrel Stew for me and my Carnivore mutated body
---
I recently learned the term "magic" weapon.  I have a lvl 50 vampire LMG/50% limb/50 dmg resist.  It's kind of useless on scorched but on deathclaws and scortchbeasts I can usually kill them with one clip - and that's with no commando perk cards up.   Would this be considered a magic weapon?  
---
I've had it forever and have moved it to several characters now.
---
Both! Those are great weapons and those are some great rolls for them, so use the gauss minigun for tougher enemies, 50 cal for day to day things.
---
Same, I'm using a launch ps4 and have no issues.
---
I’ve done this event on Xbox 20 to 30 times as well and only the first one on day one, was a laggy shot show. Only one we failed to kill him too. Been successful in every one since. Though one instance last night got a little laggy. but I think it was all power armor users with explosive heavy weapons. Causing my sound to get all static and distorted like. We still finished the job though. 
---
So only 1.5 events so far out of 20+ have had issues.
---
What have you noticed in terms of patterns that has caused this? I've run it about 10 times, no issues. Ps4.
---
There's gotta be a cause, because no one is that unlucky.
---
I wish that outfit was a little cheaper
---
Add both to camps...
---
Sigh. As a brand new filthy casual, I don't get to play as often as I like. I was really enjoying the slow crawl I was doing with the legendary run thinking it was just a fun part of the game. I got maybe 10 or so squares in to it and probably won't get much further before it goes away.
---
Angry Turtle's most recent PTS video shows that the magic effect for shotguns is still working. Have you tested it out on shotguns?
---
EDIT: I just saw your note about today's PTS update that answers my question.
---
after one world its a good few secs at least heh
---
Now that’s lazy lol jk
---
I’m having a tough time finding an outfit that I like with it. Insurgent is the only that’ I’m okay with so far. But it’s a common outfit that a lot of people wear. I don’t like dressing the same lol
---
Same here
---
You don't want a 60 second respawn timer then don't die 8 times (or whatever it is)
---
8 time is excessive. 8 times is careless. The only time i die is when i target a wendigo and after i kill it gun fu snaps to one which is 1 foot in front of me and i pull the trigger blowing myself up. Usually happens 2 or 3 times per event. That's on me. i could have that fireproof on but i'd rather have ironclad. 
---
Position yourself better. Make sure you're not gonna get feared into a hazard. Don't stand in shit on the floor. Watch for stuff falling on you. Don't get cornered. if you're bloodied have 40% health or don't use bloodied.
---
I dont want to Set the World on fire by ink Spots. Best Song since fo3 haha 😂
---
But i totally agree they should fresh the playlist up from time to time. I love listening to it but after the same loop for hours my ears Start to bleed.
---
Bethesta you can do this Better.
---
And here I am with about 500 pics saved. 
---
#pcmasterrace
---
The biggest problem is ferals, making them non aggressive would be game breaking in a lot of places just like it was in F3. Now that I think about it you should also heal like crazy inside a nuke as a ghoul...
---
It didn't always do it.  Back when they first introduced vendor machines for players it was perfect if you had a lot of items that you were selling.  I could just go back and forth to whatever I was carrying and what I had for sale and easily compare so I didn't create duplicate listings.  
---
Now it reverts to the top of the list every time.  I've tried all the "sort by" options and that didn't do squat.  
---
Maybe there's a on/off setting somewhere in the game for "make shit as annoying as possible".
---
I'm not sure that shooting one wolf is conclusive evidence, but I haven't had the chance to test it with shotguns.  Maybe it's only fixed on heavies.
---
Games trash
---
There's just Todd man. And Pete.
---
&gt;I'm not sure above tarberries but perhaps they should create few dense zones with them around the world.
---
If you run through the trenches around prime there are a bunch of tarberries. There's a bunch more in the trenches south and east of Watoga.
---
Stuff like that just-makes to much sense.... it just works
---
I want a backpack for power armor 😁
---
Anyone else pair it with the Engineer's outfit?
---
Why do you need fusion cores at level 10? 
---
power up a power plant and you can make them. but people can come and kill you and take your power plant from you. You find fusions cores in fusion generators sometimes. Or actually in the power arms that spawns.
---
Not as lazy as releasing new content without performing even the most basic qa tests on them.
---
Ok thx
---
And has splash damage and can shoot further than a scoped lever. How crazy is that? A shotgun that has more range than a ranged weapon. I dont think that it was supposed to he this way. I'm pretty sure it was added without it being tested
---
there's a 24/7 fallout radio station on youtube you could play in the background 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzBGEqkwCoY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzBGEqkwCoY)
---
Eh, I sometimes launch nukes that miss FSP just to troll the server lol
---
Yes, I always have to delete something and sometimes miss great shot because of that.
---
All the other types of flowers found in the wild too.
---
I was able to fix it on my PC by copying the files from a windows 7 system.
---
You can follow these instructions but for the bt file instead of the ir one. They're are two files you need to transfer.
---
Well some Times i can do them one after another some Times it says error dont know Why. Havent figured it out myself yet. I think when there is an active Cargo bot on the map you cant order another... But really dont know im just guessiing.
---
Imagine if they increased the Vendor Cap to 3000 and Scrip Cap to 350.
---
They doing the best they can huh?
---
&gt; Pardon my grammar friend
---
The amount of people who use then instead of than on reddit is so astounishing that I feel like sonner or later I will also be part of that  group, sooner or later. Since I was responding to your  quote, I fixed this mistake on the way. I did this mostly for myself than for you. BTW english is not my native language.
---
&gt; and I beleive the strength floor is 11 in fallout 76 it was 8 in Fallout 4. 
---
My bad on that one.
---
&gt; This doesn’t change the fact that power armor has utility and depending on what options you select then that utility may be redundant, but that is a deliberate aspect of the game’s design. Not all items and mechanics are as important to different builds as others and that’s okay!
---
I would agree with you with that until they released jetpacks for non-pa which doesn't require fuel. For me this is a middle finger for PA users who need fusion cores to use them.
---
&gt; Now on the other hand I do have firmly disagree that a strength floor is “punishing.” That’s not how that works, points in strength allow you to equip more strength perk cards and I’m not here to discuss the value in that, only you can decide that for yourself.
---
I will tell you then why I decided it is punishing for me. You don't get fixed bonus strength for wearing PA. Your strength stat is set to 11 if it is lower than that. Naked character which put 11 points into strength shouldn't have same weight capacity when he is using PA.
---
saw the same thing earlier when i went there as well
---
Bless their hearts
---
I can't complain either... today, I scored a Responder Fireman outfit, matching the white Responder Fireman helmet I got 6 months ago 😁👍
---
I have made a western town near new gad  looks like a desert.  I have a sheriff office and a saloon called The Anchor. Must be a popular spot as I cant log in a lot of times.
---
There have also been a bunch of outfits and a few reskins for the tent depending on when you signed up.
---
I built up on the monorail so not only do I have a great view but it attracts a lot of attention to my camp, therefore my shops.
---
Sorry, that sucks
---
It looks pretty good with metal armor, or robot armor.
---
And the first song you hear when you start the game! :D
---
Not sold there anymore, just very rare reward for some events.
---
If you have space, throw a collectron on the roof too. Might as well get some bonus junk (or food/chems) while you're at it.
---
Cosmetic, but the light on it works and is really bright like a power armor headlight
---
I’ll stick with the swimsuit and CBBE ;)
---
Oh no the roach of legends you were right to back away from him
---
Yeah, definitely annoying. I'm glad Bethesda gave us the ability to scroll down or up much faster than the normal speed.
---
Hold up on just stick and the d-pad at the same time, that's if you're on console.
---
Yeah, but I only have one speaker, a soundbar. So then I wouldn't hear my game. I'd rather they added some new songs
---
Without FOMO, they wouldn't have paid the salaries of people to create the run itself, the art, the textures and effects of new items. Money, dude. 
---
The bug sucks, definitely. But Beth has released so much extra score it evens out at this point.
---
Only a few have run PA...more sub-50 players than SBQ, but nothing really out of the norm. I wish I wasn’t this unlucky lol
---
I'm just glad for the double SCORE days and additional challenges,  I might not have to buy the last ten levels or so. Miss a week or even two dailies every day and you're way behind.
---
I don't know if I'll be able to handle another Legendary Run though, even 10-30 minutes a day is a bit much. I haven't even used anything besides one or two lunchboxes and I rarely build my CAMP.
---
Everything looks good with the Officer's Uniform
---
and cranberries!!! WE should really be able to plant any fruit/veggie we find...i don't get why we can't
---
Really!?, that's not want i want to hear. I don't ever recall seeing anyone sell either. Most be really rare drop from event.
---
Yeah it's pretty broken for a PVP environment. No skill needed, you just have to see someone first and spam the fire button.
---
Beckett has good things to say about the Mire too, but I think the Savage Divide is his favorite.
---
I haven't heard Sophia say anything about my Mire camp, and I haven't taken her anywhere else yet.
---
I think gramps likes the Forest region. He has a line about wanting to retire to a cabin in the woods and your camp is pretty close. I'm not sure if he says that in every region or not though.
---
Personally I'm not a fan of the whole cross-play idea don't want a bunch of PC hackers going to Xbox or ps4
---
Would love to purchase one or possible trade. Can someone provide what events might drop the mask?
---
Btw, the ink spots did a cover for "we'll meet again" so maybe they can use that one.
---
Life could be free...
---
If i could take you to paradise up above...
---
Are you really defending this
---
I couldn't for the life of me tell you the last time I saw a squirrel in-game
---
Had this issue when I stayed on during the reset.
---
My exact outfit 😂
---
That’s it, but realize the Xmas presents were duped by the millions, literally.
---
normally like 4 spawn around the whitespring resort. assuming they are not pushed to the bottom of the spawnlist on that server
---
If you’re planning on recon and infiltration, commando. If you’re planning on charging in guns blazing, heavy guns. They both have similar boss killing power when done right.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Are those lyrics from the song? I don't know it that well. I just heard it on a TV show, and thought, this would be perfect for fallout!
---
It’s a rare drop from Uranium Fever among other events. They quit selling them at the enclave bunker quite a while ago. What platform do you play on?
---
Google can.
---
but they can still catch diseases somehow lol
---
Yes, not just a song
---
THE song
---
Savage divide events can reward it. Very low chance. Its a very rare item now so its pricey
---
Did you manage to fix it at all?
---
See what you meant to say was that anybody that duped the presents has a bunch they cant sell now because millions of people duped them.
---
Thanks for the quick reply! Figured as much.
---
Honestly would love a actual usable chainsaw. 100% needs some love the chainsaw does.
---
absolutely. Like i said. This is not a new thing.
---
Soon to be spoiled food is a good source of caps
---
Is this you?!
---
Sniper worth running ?
---
What're you - fucking 12?
---
Racism isnt new either, so we should just ignore it right?
---
Me 3, 7 events zero issues so far. Some frame drop, but thats to be expected.
---
I wear it with The Mechanist’s outfit and Corvega hardcase backpack.
---
Everything you said matches my experience, was actually going to write this myself xD
---
Gotcha, thank you. I'm on PC.
---
On xb1.  Never had this prob
---
[XB1] Some runs I have MAJOR issues, and some I have none. Maybe some players are using magic weapons in that run? But I don’t think it’s purely the event itself, and I don’t think it has to do with the time it takes to complete it either. (I’ve had runs that take longer to complete have less issues, so I don’t think it’s accumulation.) I wish I could offer some better advice, but all I can say is that I’m with you!
---
It's a bug, it's an old bug that hasn't been fixed since...since...since before the  Wastelander dlc. It's beyond us bro, there's nothing we can do. Today i set my alarm to alarm me 5 minutes before the daily reset. 
---
This is how i fixed it lol...
---
No, because it's not classified as a creature or animal. It's the same reason you can't take ghouls or mutants.
---
Did it take you long to apply your clown makeup before posting that comment? Or did you already have it on?
---
Yeah, I like it. And it fits fallout very well, hoping to meet someone again that you lost.
---
Right! Thank you.
---
aw man, that's a shame.
---
.50 cal fire rate, ammo craft ability, rarity and lack of spin up compared to the minigun is a no brainer. 
---
The plasma caster and minigun are sought after due the ability to craft and create. You can finally get a god tier weapon without having to stumble across it. Energy weapons aren’t as powerful as ballistic though, which results in the ability to make what you need until you get what you want. Rock that 50 cal and dump hours farming flux for the ultracite ammo and melt anything that is unfortunate enough to spawn nearby you. Bonus points for bashing legendaries so you don’t instakill them (looking at all you mfkrs who one tap the dary and keep bunny hopping around. Fk u, u cucks) Have fun and then turn the volume down cause that 50 cal is loud as a mfkr.
---
How long did it take you to Google: "reddit responses"
---
I hate farming so much.  I typically just use regular ammo.
---
mmm shrimps...
---
Sittin at 318 and just finished the main quest last night. Finally launched a nuke for the colossal problem. Definitely a long time comin.
---
Why at level 10? Most effective way is to join the trading forum, they can be bought for 50-75 caps each.
---
Next would be learning crafting plan for Gatling laser and crafting a bunch, you get 1 free fusion core for every one you craft.
---
It just works...
---
Also a couple sheepsquatch quests give them. 
---
And scorched earth.
---
There's not much. Got them all in a week.
---
So annoying, to complete the event, but not get the only thing you came for.
---
Just curious, any chance were other players glitches threw the rock barrier before event timer runs down??
---
I heard mix reports on this myself. But yet to see any other players do this. That being said every event has been fine for me.
---
Are you that same loser from Twitter who's always posting the clown meme on every BGS tweet?
---
As long as they change the way items look, I don’t mind them returning. I know there are certain items that you can’t get outside of the season.
---
No!
---
You think bethesda would respond to a ticket?
---
With all the nukes that get launched there would be an actual nuclear winter going on.
---
The machine from that industrial farm workshop would be awesome to have, even if you need to feed ingredients into it.
---
Also, it's posible he filmed his video before today's PTS update that you say fixed the magic effect.
---
Could've sworn the vault raid power armours had legendary effects, and you can buy the plans for them from the Secret Service on top of the vault steel required to craft them from Mama Mumbles.
---
Who?
---
Personally they should get over them self and just remove the cap on all ingame currencies.
---
I've been told to get back in the kitchen and that I'm a fat bitch who gets no dick. All because I beat these dudes at their workshop by myself.
---
That's true as well.  I'm not claiming 100% that it's fixed.  It just seems like it to me.
---
just admit your reply was absolutely idiotic and move on.
---
I would like to think that their is more to our fuzzy idol, but it is an interesting thought. Any ideas on it exploding into ash/dust and moths on its death? From my perspective it borders  on the super natural...at least a little anyways.
---
1) What rumor?
---
2) But sometimes it tells you to kill the queen... (sometimes not)
---
Also the stings and things daily will give mounted insects.
---
That's what I read too but I have that plan. Even found it elsewhere and it's marked as 'Known.' (To make sure I wasn't INSANE, I even bought the damn thing and tried to learn it.)
---
Do you want to become a mole miner? Because that's how you become a mile miner.
---
I have picked up over 1,000 mounted plans someone dropped and sell them quite often for 10 caps each to new players at my camp by the wayward.
---
A lot of these plans have 0 weight.
---
What is sad is that someone will post an 'exploit' of the timer and PM will havr Dev fix right away.
---
  Never mind fixing the Challenges that are broken/cannot be completed.
---
Yes, the items that have a unique function, I’m fine with them allow other players to have outside of the season. However, armor skins, weapon skins, and camp items that serve only as aesthetics shouldn’t be obtainable outside this season.
---
I've seen one guy glitch through but we still finished in plenty of time
---
Indeed, thanks to everyone who keeps the nukes flying! Also, I just verified last night that it isn’t enough to just put on power armor, you really DO have to evacuate the nuke zone to avoid dying. In case you were ever wondering...
---
Now, I’m gonna go run with scissors. I will report back.
---
🐐
---
I have a house with a waterfall, a rowboat, and an acid pool near a train station. I built a spiral staircase and a loft and I love it.
---
Clean your vents
---
Doubtful anyone will trade it. They are worth more than cap limit.
---
&gt;Go to  https://fo76market.herokuapp.com/temp select filters at the very top, then select this "itemsmod.ini" file and click upload

* Go to  [https://fo76market.herokuapp.com/temp](https://fo76market.herokuapp.com/temp)

---
What directory is itemsmod.ini stored?
---
Yeah, I’m level 101 and don’t have remotely this much trouble with silos. I use a Chinese stealth suit and an I/E handmade. Zero stims, zero RadAway, maybe a couple hundred rounds of ammo but that’s replaceable with the lead you get from the silo residential area weight room. I view running silos as a courtesy to the server since it’s just a time investment with my build more than a chem or ammo investment
---
.5% I think?
---
I run PA on my new alt ( only one I've run this event with) and almost every other person is in PA but this is xbox maybe different on other platform's
---
My camp is right behind Fort Defiance. As long as there isn't an idiot there provoking the scorchbeast when Line in The Sand happens, it's survives the event, &amp; becomes a convenient place to scrap loot.
---
Yeah thats true i know you get the wolf mounted head for Wolf. Lol. And i dont think ive gotten one from scorched earth, but there are a lot of things on that loot pull. Its usually just prime weapons i wont use. Lmao
---
I don’t mind things that serve a unique function being obtainable outside of the season but items skins I do mind.
---
I wonder what the instence interior will be like... Will it be like a house from the single player games a place where you you can store stuff? That's kinda what I'm hoping for
---
How do you know?
---
Someone probably say that you can complete the event quickly if you let the mirelurks get to the island to spawn the queen, because the event completes when you kill the queen. 
---
However even though the event completed you do not get treasury notes as a reward, which is why most people attend the event in the first place. You only get treasury notes by completing it the long way.
---
I’d be happy if we could just have an on/off switch.
---
Edit: I’d be happy if the on/off switch worked.
---
Pristine miner outfit.
---
I agree with you and hopefully this is what they do
---
I've been in one , when I clicked in there. 1lwere 3 people and 3 min left, nuke had just dropped. Another time 6 went in 5 dropped. I cant quite solo him on the char that was on but did 75% before ammo and time ran out.  It's frustrating.
---
Ah so the queen only spawns if they reach the island?   I never noticed why/when she spawned or didn’t.
---
I feel like this post title is misleading.
---
Clickbait bastard.
---
;)
---
When I get it in gonna wear it with the pristine miner outfit
---
Is that confirmed?  Last I heard, they were removing the health drain from being dehydrated or starving, nothing else.
---
Yea I’m fine with those things being obtainable outside the season.
---
Well with the Covid-19 pandemic, they are less active. But it can't hurt to make a ticket. Do not expect anything as return tho.
---
I dropped a nuke for the first time 2 days ago as a lvl 123. Don't know why it took me so long, it's not even difficult, just time consuming. And then I found out you don't even need to go after the codes as you can just look for the code online. Lol
---
The while game is called "Elder Scrolls Legend" or "Elder Scrolls Online?"
---
I don’t mind items that serve a unique function to be obtainable outside of the season but items that serve only as cosmetic, I think should remain exclusive.
---
In an event with nothing but wendigos fears and rubble don’t die? Lol kind of ignorant to say. Specially when the event has so many low levels join and you have to focus on Earle. My thing is just cap the respawn time at 30 seconds it’s not game breaking or anything it’s just a better experience that’s all.
---
There are tons of switches in the game where you can set it up to be turned on and off.
---
If the mirelurk leader makes it to the island then the event fails, but if one of the other mirelurks arrive then the queen spawns.
---
How is your wife sending you an email vs talking to you different?
---
Id give it a shot. The new human npc quests are pretty great.
---
I never use them, but isn’t there a button on them?
---
30 seconds max I think that’s more than reasonable and not ruining the experience
---
Bethesda, whatever you're doing for my event, do for this guys. Because mine works perfectly every time.
---
Yeah, I think it's good. Means if you miss a season you only miss cosmetics.
---
Thank you for using pictures and not a youtube video.  
---
Nice work.
---
in the sense that she is giving me information? it isn't.
---
 I just had all the mounted plans and they all weigh .25 which doesnt seem like much but 4 is 1 pound. So if you ever are wondering why your stash is full its the plans
---
You can attach it to a power switch.
---
Oh, the BoS is clearly a threat. Right now the balance of power is relatively stable, though the three way balance between Settlers, Raiders, and Vault Dwellers would fail at some point. The BoS upsets that apple cart badly. The Raiders can't afford a potential enemy that powerful, nor can the Settlers expect to maintain their autonomy. 
---
The Vault Dwellers are the wild card. Who knows what those lunatics will do?!
---
I’ve had this issue but with water purifiers. I don’t think it’s a common bug, but it does pop up sometimes. That was the only time I’ve experienced it in 1200 hours.
---
Since you have to log in to any Bethesda game to look for your username i would recommend elder scrolls online cause it's the smallest Bethesda game i know of. I hope that helps you.
---
when I can get on game I'll double-check and make sure exactly the requirements for it and also where it is on the build menu. Cuz I remember there being a long and a short version of it.
---
I use the dragon while doing a stealth attack
---
I'm like, 2.5 ranks away from completing it. Trying to grind mine out to completion so I can focus on doing my boyfriend's last 9 ranks while he works. Definitely need a break before season 2!
---
It’s clear Bethesda was influenced by other games that have seasons. I’m fine if certain items that serve a specific function returning like the ammo converter, but not cosmetic items.
---
Yes! Give us something to do with all the mason jars around. Canning fits perfectly in a wasteland, even moreso in Appalachia.
---
Honestly, I'd like to see it become the new Fixer. Remember when they weren't max level or legendary? Do the grey fisherman's overalls with a bog wanderer mask and a flaming chainsaw too...worth the look!
---
Basically make camps great again update it seems
---
I hoped this would bring my wife back but this game is too scary for her. So instead I ran both accounts mostly spending time on mine and I have her’s to level 85. I’m not sure I’m gonna get hers to 100 without spending some atom.
---
Exactly.
---
If you take over a power plant, there's a machine which creates them. Also I have too many so if you really want some I'll give you some.
---
"inter account trades"... some serious NSFW shenanigans there...
---
Yeah but there is an actual button on it they controlled it. No reason why we have to add more to our limited budget to control something that literally has a button on it.
---
There is but it doesn’t work.
---
When you dont have enough money to buy a halloween costume so you make one yourself
---
I went straight here to comment exactly this! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
---
Simple, every mothman that has been encountered was simply a  puppet made of ash/dust and moths glued together. After enough damage was dealt to the structure, the surviving moths are able to break free of the glue leavening not but ash behind. 
---
Now might I intrest you in a top quality aluminum hat?
---
Pretty much anything that isn't the upmost worship of our Lord and savior Todd Howard is downvoted. 
---
Whether it's a bot or a actual people I have no clue.
---
Mounted wendigo is from a sheepsquatch sidequest also.
---
Yeah, it's the same with the SBQ. You have to do a certain amount of damage to be able to loot said boss.
---
Has it been consistently happening to you every time you boot up the game? If not def try to restart the game and that should work
---
How positively modern!
---
I accidentally scrapped my tenderizer from meat week (you don't get squat for doing that) so I was sitting on my plans I received for upgrades.
---
Today I helped kill Earl and received a lvl50 Vampire 3 star tenderizer /agility/reflect50% damage.    Now I can finally try the plans -  looks like the peppered one give the highest damage rating.
---
Get in there with the power armor or camera glitch and claim that bounty!
---
Or perhaps...the Mothman we encounter is a mecha. Crewed by a legion of sentient moths. 
---
I will take a hat.
---
Westek, Uranium fever, one violent night, burrows, whitesprings golf course, basically the same as always it's all rng whether there are legendaries at any location.
---
yeah. Don't die. It's not exactly a wacky concept. If things start falling on you move. If wendigos are there kill them. 
---
Of course it's a better experience. It's half of 60 seconds. And then people would be all 'cap the respawn timer at 15 seconds it’s not game breaking or anything it’s just a better experience that’s all' and then it would be 'why do i have to wait to respawn at all?'
---
I prefer the coldness of ultracite on my naked body so no thank you.
---
is it worth the effort for 10 caps?
---
Yes. The bots only have keycards though.
---
Thought that only worked on doors???
---
Plus it gets stuck and I can’t do much until I gun bash to free up the controls
---
You’ll have a better chance just looking threw vendors and buying if off somebody who sells all the heads they got from presents
---
Nope, works on any walls
---
Im getting that same bug too im assuming everyone else still is too
---
Here is my melee VATS use case. During Primal Cuts, there are usually mole rates around that pop up next to or behind you. I would use a deathclaw gauntlet, or sometimes a bloodied swing speed cultist dagger, to turn around, hit VATS, and swipe. This allowed me to aim and kill each mole rat in well under 1 second.
---
Nope, but it's about out-smarting them and sending a message. :)
---
Thank you, that should do nicely!
---
Nice! I forgot about that one. Appreciate the info.
---
I understand what you’re saying but I can imagine a lot of people would much rather have the 30 second timer instead of a whole minute and yes while it is a simple concept to not die it’s not so simple that people understand that wendigos also need to die and they have to do damage to Earle before the timer is up. I mean I don’t see the problem in changing the cap to 30. I mean I’ve been in too many groups where it seem like I’m the only one doing damage to Earle and the wendigos while everyone is running around doing god knows what.
---
I would say 50 cal
---
The backpacks at neighborly are a nice addition, and the gauntlet plan is neighborly as well, it's more that the top rep rewards are far and away more enticing. Gauss minigun and shotgun are perfect examples.
---
I tried it and it didn't let me do it a second time
---
&gt; and only one Earle Williams
---
Careful now. There's some nuts out there who swears that Earle can regenerate.
---
&gt; gameplay and story segregation. that's all. if your Motherlode died, then for your canon she's dead
---
Supposedly, the Motherlode in the Settler questline had the model number 001 and the ones out in the world have different numbers
---
Then thats your choice. But us that don't want blue balls should have the choice. 🤣🤣
---
One of the many times I've brought this up I remember being told that it's not something Bethesda can fix and is a console limitation.
---
Data
---
Did they happen to mention PTS for Steam or was it only about consoles?
---
Ah, gotcha.  Thanks.
---
Okay, but then we need to remove notifications for who launched the nuke and instead have a few dozen air raid sirens placed around the map that need routine maintenance every so often to function, and instanced fallout shelters.
---
Do you only need the nuclear key card? I got all of the way through to the end, and then tried to activate but was missing the card. Felt like an idiot.
---
From some of today's posts, it looks like the magic effect *may* have been patched with today's update of the PTS.
---
Not trying to be negative here but:
---
Considering that you could technically just chug serums over and over to supress the negatives semi permanently I'd say that a drug like this would be way to costly.
---
There are 19 mutations in total, you can have 18 of those as Carnivore and Herbivore are mutually exclusive.
---
Each serum costs a specific amount of 2 different scrap items (9 lead and 5 oil, for example) , 1 ultracite and 1 flux to make.
---
If you have all 18 and want to supress all the negative effects you'd need 18 serums, costing you 18 flux, 18 ultracite and about 200+ junk scrap.
---
All of that for 1 hour without negative effects. And no hangover.
---
Your drug, while coming with a bad hangover, would have to be in the same range since you could just wait for 10 minutes for the hangover to go away.
---
Again, not trying to be negative here but chugging serums is basically what you're suggesting minus the hangover. :)
---
I usually fight Earle or the queen so if you ever need help with them I’ll gladly help but if you need ammo I can also gladly share some just shoot me a message Thatonedumdum-
---
Give this man a medal. 🏅
---
Damn, what a moment. Wonder if next gen will have limitations too.. also I swear if they make us buy the game again for the new consoles.
---
I just dropped my first nuke at level 180 lol same thing happened to me early game and I never tried it again.
---
Honestly I have yet to have any realm issues with the event, as said slight frame rate drop most of the time. Had one run which was quite bad but it was a busy server and 5 of the 8 people where using explosive plasmas which always tanks the performance. 
---
I even run it with 30+ guns on me and still no real issue.
---

---
I actually recently found a bunch on the floor in whitesprings yesterday. I used the ones i didnt have and dropped leftovers to new players. I was just curious if there were any ways to get them besides the presents to get em.
---
Are you using it in VATS?
---
With the right legendary effects, the Gauss Shotgun can shred damn near anything.
---
That's true ty.
---
Huntersville has a lot of high level supernatants and I think is a high prob that legendary enemies appear there
---
Or monogah mine
---
Awesome
---
I share rank 2 magnetic personality on a role play public team. Up to 10 bonus charisma to everybody and legendary enemies spawn like popcorn
---
Awesome ty
---
No you can probably buy some by pm people in trading subreddits since you’re not allowed to say presents in there other than that they’ll probably add them around Christmas or anytime in December
---
I really hope it would be like Vault 88 but man can dream.
---
Is it true that today's PTS updated fixed (i.e. removed) the magic weapon effects?
---
Wow dude this is amazing can u post a video of this build.
---
“Prrrrrttttt! He dead now” was my reaction
---
It doesn’t even make sense why they even have these plans lol
---
I wasn't aware they were broken
---
I agree. Even though i dont wear it and have been in power armor for like 2 hours total since beta play time. Its one of the reasons I dont.  I feel like get more benefits from not because of the underarmor, and legendary effects.
---
Success!  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/WjjJDja](https://imgur.com/a/WjjJDja)

Not bad, hopefully you don't encounter it again.
---
I heard enclave events in the savage divide I’ve been trying for a month solid now no luck yet
---
Ah explosive weapon. No you don’t need demolition, however it does help speed up the process. 
---
I recommend you use an automatic explosive weapon. Aim for the thrusters. If damaged enough it will be completely broken and it will fly a lot slower. Or if you damaged it enough it might force it to float in place for a minute or two. Giving you enough time to damage the other thrusters as well. 
---
A bloodied unarmed build, and I can down those things pretty easy with my level 35, one star explosive submachine gun.
---
There's also another version performed by the Ink Spots.

Yours doesn’t get stuck after you fire it
---
Ah, yes. You made me recall this. Perfect choice to fight aliens. 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
+1 
---
I take screenshots (ensure to hide the menu) and download them through the Xbox app. At least something 😊
---
Yes it’s a 3 star and two of them are vats perks
---
Could use my new double barrel and a chainsaw and legally rip and tear scorched
---
People tried with No Man's Sky and it never stuck. I seriously doubt anyone could successfully do so against Bethesda
---
Just got a .308 explosive Machine gun is that any good?
---
Thanks so much! Don't know how to lol not got the software needed I guess
---
Moles. I'd bet that Samuel and mortimer are both plants by the secret service, smiley too. So long as they can keep playing both halves against the middle the secret service can keep benefiting from both factions.
---
Just got a .308 explosive variant
---
i feared it a while too but its really easy to do, i have a vampire gauss shotgun and a t65 power armor and a very not optimized build and can solo it easy.. :)
---
Corporations can just slide out of anything. It’s the little people who always get punished. It’s disgusting.
---
Same here on ps4. Enough lag to justify letting my Fo1st expire. Also worse since last update.
---
Are u on x box? I have some to spare
---
What do you mean no? Im saying i have them because i found a bunch on the floor of whitesprings yesterday. Yeah thanks for the tip but my luck stat irl is impeccable and dont need to.
---
I never had this problem with my Quad Tesla Rifle until the last patch that broke the arcing visual effect. The game normally spawns invisible objects (arc generators) next to enemies that are hit by tesla rifles, emitting additional bolts of electricity that seek the nearest friendly or hostile character, but right now those objects don't despawn properly.
---
even if Earle can regenerate, there would only be one.
---
and i wasntnaware of the different Motherlode numbers. that's interesting
---
Since when was Bethesda a “self respecting company”
---
And nothing keeps up with them.
---
BoS science scribe uniform
---
Long Coat
---
Insurgent
---
Those guns shoot extremely quick. The second you press the trigger until the second you let go of it. Ammo is pretty cheap and easy to make. At enemies carry that ammo (super mutants/scorched) so you’ll never really struggle with getting ammo. 
---
Give it a try. It’s not going to instantly down the cargobot, but you’ll notice it’s better than shooting it with a  Regular weapon.
---
Why is everyone assuming the damage changes are coming in the next patch? Bethesda has not confirmed that they will be live with the next patch, nor have they even mentioned the change at all really. For all we know those are just the beginning changes to damage output and there are more to come before they push it to adventure servers.
---
Could someone explain?
---
What's a battle pass?
---
I would purchase a clock or personal terminal from the atom shop that showed all resets..  All, as in everyone.. updates too.. hotfixs , sure... even if they all reset at the same exact time.. it would be cool as a clock so you could put it by your vending machines.it would be cool as a terminal and sign for making announcements like, I need tanks for encrypted.. or I have this ledgendary for trade... What do you think?
---
“My mom said you have to give me back the workshop or she will contact Sony and tell them you’re bullying me”
---
I dont use twitter
---
Oh stupid me I thought you meant presents lol but yea you can get the from certain events and there’s a quest for the wendigo plan I forgot what it was called but if you want I can get a yt link for you
---
All the cursed weapons have the same roll. Nice damage though.
---
You've just given me an idea. What if it gave you points, but instead of leveling up it was a store like the atom shop? This would make it possible for people to get the things they want, without necessitating excessive grinding. Which is of course why Bethesda would never consider it.
---
Nevermind you just have to make sure you really get all the codes
---
 I wouldn't call 'Hello Games', the small indie company with only 5 games under its belt, a corporation that could slide out of anything.
---
Unless Sony stepped in for them for whatever reasons, back then.
---
He still loves his other family more than you though.
---
Nice! Congrats!
---
Shutdown imminent could mean a few things 
---
The game is going to be updated. So the servers will be offline for everybody. The update can take between 1-3 hours. 
---
But it also means that the server you’re currently playing in, is about to be closed. Just go to a different server.
---
MODS!
---
The pickaxe is the only bloodied. The others are executioner's.

My Camp Alpha is just across the lake of Site Alpha. I made the base there before I know what Site alpha was. I was around lvl 50 while I was building some did the silo run and from my porch I had a great wiew when the nuke left the silo😁  500 hours later I'm still there and oh boy what a traffic often people drop by before they go for the silo run, 
---
The place have  Water, a lvl 76 Yao guai that spawns as in the middel of the lake often is a legendary 1-3☆, there is a lot for glowing resin, blueberries and fire cracker berries in the area. People often cone by to hunt foxes with the syringer. The place is just great and feels like home. And only 5 caps to the nearest vendor.
---
I thought about moving yesterday but couldn't do it so i made a new character so i can build elsewhere 😅
---
A battle pass is when a game has a load (normally 100) rewards and you need to level up tiers to unlock them.
---
In Fallout 76, Bethesda decided seasons would be a better way to refer to their battle pass.
---
Here is what a Titan II (9 Mtons) would look like if detonated over Washington DC. The ICBMs in the game look like Titan IIs.

---
Lol true i think its called unsolved: best of intentions I still have it on the character im playing on right now.
---
"It depends." But, for me, I like it for certain purposes.  For Primal Cuts, I switched to a non-stealth high AP Junkie's unarmed build using Bolstering armor and other defensive/offensive perks. This enabled me to solo the Primal Cuts easily - my best was a solo completion with 3 minutes and 23 seconds left on the clock. Now, I would usually bust out an OP heavy weapon to finish off the Alpha Boss quickly.
---
With Born Survivor 1 on, and two armor pieces with poison resist, I would hardly ever die.
---
I prefer it over Vanguard because the more I get punished, the harder I am to kill. Versus, dying more quickly than expected because I took too much rads or damage.
---
Elder scrolls online has no limitations on the economy,  and look at their player base vs. 76.  You can make a million gold a day if you wanted to. Just from the selling/ laundering stolen items, you can me 20/30k a day. That's 76's cap limit.
---
Why can't you hook up the sink to a water purifier then?
---
Really sad that they didn’t make it more appealing. X01 and strangler heart should be at like half a rad a second if not lower because those sets have the highest rr and it stinks that someone with raider PA experienced nearly the same thing
---
Lone Vault Wanderer did a few videos on farming legendaries. You should check them out.
---
Having players low and high lvls distract him and make it a bit easier.
---
Why would they bother with this?
---
Season 3 maybe xd
---
Be cool if you could get a skin that makes it look like a bathroom shower.
---
Lmaoo I’m lvl 90 and that glitch still happens to me sometimes when I try dropping nukes
---
Drop a nuke on their ass....
---
To be all "Nyah nyah, I can be bad and you can't get meee!". But it turns out I CAN get you, lol.
---
&gt; I have on good with salt, but I still feel the sands of time slipping on my food as I run around and it’s not great. 
---
I think you might have a hording issue.
---
There's a reason poison-type moves dont affect Steel types lol
---
Thats the outfit I´ve been rocking since wastelznders, previously with Secret Service Hekmet, and now with the gas mask
---
It iw by far best combo in my opinion.
---
Works well with désert NCR ranger helmet too
---
Thanks for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
All you need is the card and a bookmark for [https://roguetrader.com/#/](https://roguetrader.com/#/), that's where the codes are at. 
---
Just make sure you pick the codes for the correct silo. On my first run I was in Alpha and used the ones for Charlie. Felt like an idiot and logged off in shame. :)
---
I use a two shot explosive 50 cal melts them like butter
---
Good idea, but turns out I didn't need to. :)
---
My friend has their camp there solely for those reasons haha
---
That’s fair lol. If only it would do some damage to level 1 scorched
---
Heavy weapons all the way during leveling you can go for any weapons as you will pickup heavy weapon sooner or later. Also save up ammo And convert it to fuel since fully modded non legendary flamer can do 200 dmg. Also go for PA you wont need to hunt for legendary armor
---
Thanks I will
---
Mmm can't wait to produce glowing meat chili
---
Overall, the .50 cal for daily use.  Dont get rid of that mini gun though, you’ll like it too.
---
Can get you banned but ppl do.
---
Yeah I get it.  Once i saw that video I just remade my excavator to level 50 and roll around in it all the time.  And I use my Ultracite if i want to jet pack.  I got lucky and calibrated shocks dropped for me for the Ultracite too.
---
Thank you for reading my broken english ! :D   
---
I love the community, people seem to care and share
---
Yeah all that stuff is cool, but you'd go nuts trying to get it all.
---
I have one
---
I think I have heard Gramps say that in the divide as well, but I certainly think the forest is his best fit, based on that dialogue.
---
I use it with no perks in shotguns. And only 1 level of grim reapers sprint...and it's pretty powerful as is. Usually normal shots will either do alot of damage, or sometimes very little, depending on spread.
---
With vats all projectiles can hit the same point. Resulting in a powerful snipe shot that can 1 hit kill most high level enemies.
---
Mind linking it so I can have a look?
---
I really enjoyed it as well.  I recently bought the game (via the Steam summer sale), and have had loads of fun.  I just finished the run, too.
---
My favorite line: “It makes no sense.”  And giant irradiated moths and sloths do?
---
raiders
---
Yes let me look
---
Me too! 🤞🤞🤞
---
Are you using the machine?  You can’t sell to the vendor at rusty pick.
---
Thanks! I've only ever played rifleman and commando so I know nothing about heavy card setups.
---
Rather have food without lead in it. :p
---
U get it from the Raiders I believe.. max out..
---
*looks at all the children toys that have lead*
---
Uh yeah about that.
---
50 cal hands down. A fast firing gun with faster fire rate? Even after the nerf you'd likely still do a lot of damage with it.
---
Idk if people actually buy things but it depends on what you sell I think
---
BOS Science Scribe uniform looks great with it
---
If its dirty water how is the sink clean.
---
It would be cool if we could have the entire map in nuked form. It would make the game much more interesting instead of stale.
---
Not only is it always a miss even at 95% vats, it moves though the bodies of its victims keeping free aim shots wasted! Then the death spiral!
---
It would be cool if the clocks in the stations worked and at midnight it reset caps and scrip limit.
---
How long did it take you to get the recipe?? I have spammed every event and quest that supposedly gives it every day for weeks, not to mention the hundred of times I’m sure I did those events incidentally before I started “trying” to get the recipe, and I still don’t have it... I just keep getting duplicates of various healing salve recipes I already have.
---
I had two gimps unloading their plasma mini guns but a thumbs up works wonders.  Turn on passive, makes life easy.
---
No matter how many votes Flatwoods gets
---
It's gonna be Morgantown
---
Once you learn the plan the weapons are added into the loot pool!
---
You don’t sell legendaries to the Purveyor.  You have three options:
---
1) Grind them in one of the yellow workstations that are at all of the rail stations.  You will get scrip in return for grinding a legendary piece of armor or weapon.  You can grind up to 150 scrip a day and can hold up to 1000 scrip.
---
2) Sell them to a robot vendor for caps
---
3) Sell them through player vending for caps
---
Are you PC? Cause that sounds like what I’ve been doing. I realized my melee wasn’t doing damage and had to switch to whatever gun I had on me. Went through a huge number of stimpacks just on myself, but I managed to get a few guys. I also didn’t have a radiation suit when we made it out of the mine and almost died from rads..
---
If you know the plan they drop for you.
---
By the time you gather enough maps to force yourself to go dig some treasures, you prob have 90% mods learned via world drops, for me atleast 🤔
---
It’s not a giant, largely empty, wooden cube.
---
That’s roachy you met,, Pam will follow
---
I can kill most mobs with one or 2 shots with vats and no spread but when it comes to scortchbeats I barely even touch them. When I was using it on Earl I was getting 1s pop up for damage and 2s for criticals on him lol. So idk what's up. I was watching YouTube videos and everyone was killing scortchbeats in one or 2 hits so I didn't know if something happened to it from when those were made to now.
---
Ok I’m gonna grind
---
Its part of the game and is unfortunate you trusted them. I don't trust people in these games straight away I am willing to lose what I have as a consequence. 
---
Just know you thought you did the right thing by helping him but let it be a lesson Nd know not everyone is like it x
---
They added that on the ACP patch. Most events now have a chance to give you a 1* from the Mystery Pick list. Scorched Earth gives you a 2* . ACP can you give from 2* to 3* . Free Range is the only Public Event that may give you 1* or 2* or even 3* Mystery Picks.
---
Dude, you're the best, thank you!
---
From any event?
---
It is common knowledge, yes.
---
Level 4 legendary perk. Food never spoils. I'd buy it.
---
It looks better
---
😎 Good times
---
Ah shit :) I got all site bravo codes, derp :)
---
If we get one, we better be able to drink out of it
---
Idk but assume so, it's in your loot pool
---
The raiders
---
&gt;- Everyone will get an instanced interior for camps.
---
&gt;- Build limit's increased, snapping rules are relaxed.
---
Is that just for instanced interior camps or for both?
---
4 of them from the van lowes taxidermy quest (wendigo, adn I forget the other 3).
---
One from SBQ (SBQ head).
---
2 in an atom shop bundle (SSQ, and SSQ horns)
---
the rest were xmas gift an miner pail items.
---
Some events now drop purveyor legendaries
---
How do I get this, was it limited or is it still available?
---
My bloodied combat shotty is better than the gauss.  Shame really.
---
It’s funny how this game can bring people together both in &amp; out of game regardless of platform.
---
I’ve made &amp; lossed a few friends through this game,&amp; am stoopit thankful,regardless of which way the wind blew.
---
Good on you for shouting out &amp; appreciating the people that where there for ya when ya needed em!
---
Stay Blessed
---
Snapping rules are overall. I'm not sure if the budget expansion is referring to instanced interiors or overall camp budget.
---
so does grafton monster &amp; snallygaster tho
---
I think it’s so they can quickly replace that windows for solid walls if they are about to hit the 30000 cap
---
did they make it so you can use double walls again?
---
To be honest until they let us mod the lamp color this thing has zero value to me.
---

---
I have switched 5 point demolition expert for 3 point ricochet an 2 more points in tenderizer.
---
Or add the ability to have our favorite foods "canned" by an NPC for a decent amount of caps? Would give us the non spoiling food we have been asking for and introduce a much needed cap sink into the game...
---
I'd rather just everything resets at the same time (0900hrs PST).
---
Dailies, missions, vendors EVERYTHING.
---
I like it. Ingredient shopping is quite fun for me and I feel accomplished being able to get everything together to make something like seared venison or firecap soufflé. If it spoils well, its not like you dont have a billion other raw ingredients to work with, not to mention prewar food. I like to think its a mechanic to cut down on hoarding, that is to say only take what you need.
---
Yes, they undone the "fix" when the colossus problem dropped! On PC btw but I assume they did the same on console
---
thank god. literally my favorite thing about this game is building, i haven’t really played much since they “fixed” that
---
There's a lot of places where you find these. Some of them you can pass through and run around out of world. There was one in the nuke silo that allowed you to get to launch prep in 1 minute
---
Good tactics, going to give this a shot!
---
Wive and I have been so busy and stressed lately I feel like we have no "quality time".
---
Bethesda ffs......
---
I've never seen a spot in the mire that doesn't get covered in enemies every 5 seconds.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Yes! I Allready told it to the person above. IF Bethesda would add this song, it would probably be the ink spots cover. At least 2 other radio songs are by the ink spots
---
I drop nukes all the time because, let's face it, there ain't much else to do. :)
---
I do have a question, though.
---
Anyone ran a silo on the PTS recently? The legit way, I mean. Are the bots in there affected by the One Wasteland streamline?
---
I always nuke 6 times every morning with my alts mainly for repair kits off sbq. Dm me for good times. Would be glad to take the nuke cards off you. @Mr_Saytan
---
Ayyeee that sounds like fun let's do it!
---
I'd be interested in using things like that but I just can't get past the "always listening" aspect of things like that.  I get that that's how it has to work but still....
---
Yeah
---
I have a flaming chainsaw I keep more or less for meat week. Does good killing all them huddled critters.
---
It’s a known bug, something that’s going to be resolved with the upcoming update. I’m greatly looking forward to it.
---
Solid advise.  I just took off the top of my PS4 and the fan was very dusty.  I really want to get at the heat sink but leaving for another day.
---
I would love to go walking round looking like ed gien from Texas chainsaw massacre. Just imagine being a new player leaving the vault and there's your character wich a blood soaked leather apron. A human flesh mask big army boots and a chainsaw.
---
I built my CAMP next to the cat house in Morgantown.
---
I didnt realize that you had to scrap your junk to make bunldes so that helped me
---
Sucks no pets any time soon everyone got excited when they accidentally added the pet related emotes thinking that ment they were working on it.
---
Once you learn the plan, that weapon gets added to the loot pool
---
Are you on Xbox? And yeah those repair kits are golden.
---
Upvote for the post but content deserves a downvote. I'm so glad that I didn't bother watching the interview.
---
Thanks for taking a bullet for the team.
---
Do you use Power armor and Energie ammo?
---
What should I give you for the fusion cores?
---
Umm, you might have arrived after the timer ran out?
---
Explore.  There are at least 12 PA spawn points in the forest, plus a number of generators.  Each may (or may not) have a partial core.  There are several more in the toxic valley area, but I suggest you not go there until you are about L20.
---
There are at least 3 in and around morgantown.
---
There’s up to 5 at Camden park.
---
Potential for 2 at grafton dam.
---
at least 3 at wade airport
---
There are at least 2 static spawn points (core just sitting on a table) in a couple places in the Forest.
---
Some events reward them, but you are not yet high enough level for most of those events.
---
Until you get the batteriesincluded perk, you probably don’t want to have but so many on hand - they are heavy.
---
No prob. Ever since that incident I'm hunting cargobots for sport just so I always have at least 1 backup card in case I get another brain freeze. XD
---
Lazy to farm for resources? Stealth commando
---
Lazy to farm for legendary armor roll? PA Heavy gunner
---
The one advantage Sneak commando have over PA heavy gunner is the Unyeilding armor that you can farm for. Not hard to get a non-matching set, but a long way to go if you’re looking for a matching set armor plus 3 star god roll. Give +15 to all especially intelligence which contributes to faster levels.
---
It’s cool
---
Ill be on in couple hours its fine ill just hook u up with a couple i dnt really use my power armor
---
Insurgent outfit matches it nicely
---
I'm only lvl 29 rn so I'm not really using much yet just getting some insight on what cards I should use, but eventually I will use power Armour
---
Yeah me too am glad they changed it back
---
you can buy it from Le' Grande Gourmet at the whitespring's shopping area
---
I liked the engineer outfit but the tank that comes with the outfit clips through my backpack.
---
Using Mountain Scout outfit myself.
---
good point
---
So the mining lamp color mod jammies I have work on what?
---
Just the mining helmet itself then?
---
If so,that’s kinda bogus...
---
That Reclaimed Helmet has a decent unique look to it though,&amp; as a “collector/hoarder” of sorts,
---
I dig the way it looks.
---
sooner they let mods in sooner the game is fixed
---
Its a heavy raider chestpiece
---
I agree
---
What about using backpacks on power armor?
---
Got home and checked, it needs Demo expert rank 1 to build it at your camp. they are under power connectors
---
Whether this is new or old info; good on you for trying to help.
---
They don’t drop too often. You would need to wait for them to pop up. They usually have the event labeled “Enclave:” Most of them occur in the south half of the map. Good luck future general!
---
So you see a benefit with bolstering on a full health build, not just bloodied?
---
Hahaha awesome!
---
Explosive bait.
---
I’ve had a heavy raider chest piece, it didn’t look like this. Is it modded?
---
I’ve done it three times. The only issue I ever had was when the Wendigo Population of Monongah Mine reached hella values and frames dropped like a rock
---
Do you know witch mutations do you want?
---
Yup good on that stuff thanks!
---
Posting someone's in game game is witch hunting you idiot
---
Try it with the fire breathers outfit, looks like some wolfenstein shit
---
Yup, it says it's not learned for me. I have everything else. Which is why I am confused.
---
I really wish they would add more or unlimited  space for stash boxes.
---
I think it depends on the mod you put on it buttressed will make it look different and try sturdy I can’t remember well which one has this mod
---
Cranberry cobbler and grilled radstag for me. Need xp boost and sometimes need something to help with weight.
---
5$ and its yours/s
---
Cheers bud
---
I'll burn my surplus rubber balloon bombing my buddies camp, sucks you can't do it if you're on a public team
---
The ones in the ash heap are pretty good fun solo as well
---
Will have to look out for that. I still haven’t learned buttressed. I’ve scrapped a few trying to learn, no luck.
---
Very lucky
---
Camps should be immortal if you're on non-hostile mode. Workshops should be fair gamr tho
---
Yea I do this but I do the last two nukes on the queen so I fight Earle 1st then head to the queen after
---
"I got family over in Morgantown, just passing through, unless these damn kids go to Flatwoods.."
---
The wasteland equivalent of this: https://youtu.be/cCI18qAoKq4
---
So I found that using moltovs right in front of doors still does damage to whatever is stuck. Sometimes they will clip through the wall while on fire so you can finish them off. Still annoying as fuck but at least moltovs are easy to craft
---
I get this sometimes, and the only way I have been able to correct it is to completely shut down and restart the game for each person who falsely shows as offline. In this case that sounds like you would both need to do so. I hope that works for you.
---
Or at least my backpack...I mean I understand not having the legendary effects with the pa.  But a backpack or under armor is a much needed addition.
---
I dropped my first nuke yesterday.  
---
Hit prime, travelled to the drop site to watch it go down. Saw the SBQ for the first time.  
---
Then I popped my power armor to try my first go at an irradiated zone and crashed straight to desktop...  
---
Ah well, at least I got pics of the mushroom cloud with my trusty prosnap.
---
https://i.imgur.com/i2yYun3.gif
---
Or you can hang out in the Bog and kill/contribute to killing non legendary scorchbeasts. 
---
Got my commendations that way.
---
For the heavies: might be good thing. No more melting bosses. For the shotguns: too bad. Might turn my shotgunner into a mule (again). Sad
---
Totally understandable.
---
LAAAA LAAA LAAA LA LAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
if you snooze you lose 
---
timer ran out.
---
I meant, the rolls are fixed... so anytime you get the pickaxe, you get this ax.
---
Why would it be bad for heavies?
---
Yeah, you definitely did the right thing.
---
As a shift worker I disagree....
---
It would also be a very region accurate feature to highlight. Southern states, especially in low income areas, thrived on canned goods even after the advent of refrigeration.
---
Damn, man. Your next will be great!
---
I added the Prime mod for the larger ammo batches
---
Not worth it compared to all the wendigo drops
---
I’ll buy the fuckin thing if you’ll do that lol
---
Cause melting is fun. 😀
---
Or they could sell it on the atom shop so everyone has a chance to use the items who actually have jobs and families?
---
I wasn't aware and haven't seen anyone on here mention it worked like that. Just tryin to do my part lol
---
I did that twice today.
---
24,000 caps well spent.
---
I always wondered if that stuff spawned creatures if nothing was around, or just attracted stuff that was already there. I've been throwing it around before and could have sworn creatures started to spawn out of nowhere...
---
The 1st time somebody destroyed my camp was because the guy couldn’t beat me in pvp so he went in a silo to nuke it I just took it since my camp is literally only a floor all he did is just destroy my utilities which are easy and barely cost to repair
---
Have to agree the screws are more valuable...for now.
---
I mean you said it might be good that it's fixed for heavies?
---
And acid, and ammo
---
There’s an option to purchase the season levels if you’re short on time.
---
Settings, then turn on Pacifist. Avoid workshops.
---
Yeah. It’s not funny when something is literally impossible to get to.
---
Wow, didn't even know you could do that. Impressive, really !
---
I'd advise to turn pacifist mode ON you can find it on game settings :p
---
Same thing happend to me and my wife today. Its b.s cuz i want to finish and so close
---
Honestly people gotta stop complain about low levels. This is from a level 100  if you don't got stims just don't revive them. Honestly the more help the better especially when they are reviveing you my level 22 friend went around reviveing people.
---
I always keep it on as I don't like fighting people, but they really wanted the workshop I was at.
---
Yes, my collectron does this all the time, it’s super annoying, instead of scrapping I add a level 0 lock and then I add the level 3 again, seems to work
---
Oh lol yea I never bothered saying something I hope they don’t fix this if it is a bug but knowing Bethesda probably won’t fix it
---
I was doing one ACP with a couple of greedy level 10’s and when I killed earle there were probably 30+ wendigo spawns chasing me to the exit it was very scary even tho they do no dmg
---
Turn pacifist mode on. Other than that there's not much else you can really do except maybe join a private server on Fallout 1st.
---
Pacifist doesn't prevent people from taking your workshop and killing you.
---
Stay out of workshops.
---
Or at least able to create jerky meat out of my meats.
---
I don't think this will work like in a game  
---
Mods will most likely work in private world only, and you will probably wont be able to join a regular server with a char that was played in a modded world. This could put the community at risk at some point.
---
that's not a bad idea, actually. Does suck that to have a good time I have to pay though.
---
Gauss mini gun is fun but it’s a bitch to keep running you basically have to constantly grind but the .50 cal you can grind a bit use it on regular mobs and in boss areas with ease basically what I’m saying is .50 is best heavy gun
---
What are you dying from?
---
Environmental hazards.....be aware and move around.  Don’t run into falling embers or poison fields, and don’t stand in them while unloading.  Common sense stuff.
---
Enemies......Perks.  Fireproof, blocker, dodgy, serendipity, etc.  Power armor is fantastic if your build allows it.
---
The difficulty is perfectly reasonable, assuming you built your character well and don’t stand in place the entire event.
---
Fearing I’m going to sound like a complete moron, how do you charge it? 🤣 still relatively new to nuclear winter and I don’t touch shotguns in adventure
---
Some events are done too fast because of magic weapons. So yeah, fixing them will make boss fights a bit longer and more difficult on average. Which is probably a good thing. Melting is fun to do but you soon realize you just sucked the fun out of the event.
---
I mean, have you tried it?
---
Sacrifice your firstborn to mothman &amp; in a fortnight you will be able to put some ghille on it
---
Just a style preference
---
Im not finding much ammo its like for everyone 10 i kill only 1 has ammo on it.
---
They probably didn't want the workshop , they wanted to pvp bully , I don't advise taking workshop ownership on public servers , it's sad but it's the best way to avoid that toxic part of the community , there's many other ways to farm junk/other workshop related items around the map :')
---
It should drop different amounts based on the weapon used, cause that's stupid.  It drops the same for a minigun, should be more fine tuned
---
I have to say, this is incredibly disappointing
---
If you switch to a prime receiver in patch 22 the legendary ammo perk gives you 900 ultracite rounds per craft not to mention super duper kicking in
---
This is the right answer
---
I remember reading articles about that incident in arizona? with the titan II silo exploding. Would have been catastrophic if the warhead went off too
---
you heard the man, he said pls
---
Has anyone tried blueprinting this from the Workshop in the Forest?
---
It's not that bad. On a private server you don't have to worry about competing with randoms during events for legendaries and stuff like that. Plus you can have friends join you so it's not entirely an empty world. The scrap bin thing that comes with Fallout 1st is a handy thing to have as well.
---
After patch 22 it will probably be useless
---
Its what prompted me to make the post. I was in a perfect storm of the nuke being larger than the radius of the last circle in downtown Morgantown. Needless to say, I joined the skeleton inside. I feel that they are spread out enough and the chances of them being nearby during a nuke is low enough that it would be a fair reward
---
Sure, but it's just way too annoying to get flux
---
Just hold down fire. That gives you more range as well with the Gauss shotgun
---
the name makes me think it but i never even thought about the ramp part now i will always think that.
---
Put the flaming and long bar mod on the chainsaw, it needs nothing else. My melee character used one from level 20 when I could first equip it up to almost 70 just because nothing else could come close to the damage I could do. I could rip things twice my level or higher to shreds because of the bleed and fire damage.
---
But then how would I beable to still call it a Commando build?
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Sturdy_raider_armor_%28Fallout_4%29
---
That’s essentially sturdy variant of the raider armor
---
oh. I didn't think people would be that horrible. I kinda wish when someone over claimed a workshop you got things like generators back.
---
I know it’s bad but do you ever get to the point when you’ve dropped so many nukes you really want to do the event but you seriously cba with the silo 🤣
---
Since Atomic shop items tend to not be canon, then can we finally get Horse Power Armor in honor of the Bethesda's first microtransaction?
---
It will be interesting to see how modding works for Fallout 76.  Creation Club mods are pointless since they make far more sense as Atomic Shop items.  However, Bethesda could release mods in Fallout 76's version of the Creation Club that affects the environment or gameplay.  Mods would have to be limited to Private Worlds since there are a lot of mods that ruin balance like having a pistol that kills SBQ in one shot.
---
Is there any value at all to continuing to do the challenges after you’ve finished the board? It felt sort of... anti-climactic. What was the final prize, anyway?
---
Yeah flux is so annoying but it’s only one flux for 900 rounds and if you get super duper that one flux is worth that one nuke drop if you have problems with getting flux and have good or decently items to trade I’d just trade for flux but that’s just my opinion
---
I don't think the average person understands just how powerful thermonuclear weapons are. A war like the one portrayed in Fallout would completely destroy the world.
---
True to an extent. I have lowbie toons who are kitted out just as good/better than high level toons.
---
I'm level 175 and TIL that underarmor is disabled in PA.
---
... ^^shit
---
Fair enough, I'll look into it.
---
Guided meditation is never mentioned, but I usually get 2-4 spawned during it
---
It looks great with the hunter’s long coat, if you are lucky enough to find it.
---
You should drop basically all your old holotapes. They majorly slow the game down and you’ll never need them
---
If you knew the history of these then you’d know they never worked. They were a scam. I mean how many have you opened to find a skeleton?
---
Please let it be ally
---
Yep, he moves once per day
---
You might be right, but the 90% compared to 50% is night and day. I bought the fridge before knowing this and don’t even use it.
---
Considering that the armor has ports and such to literally hook into the chassis, yeah, it should stay on you.
---
But he is slowing down a lot from his initial pace.  I went from even with him to ahead very fast.
---
Jesus.. you ever catch yourself in a zipper?  Imagine powered armor pinching now.
---
With Atmoic shop not being Canon then it would be awesome for them to bring in stuff from other Fallout Games. Perhaps even NPCs for our CAMP? I miss Cait.
---
Oh man really? I'm still in the second part of it... guess ima miss out on alot of stuff lol
---
Use a flashdrive to back up your pics.
---
Thanks 👌🏻🤣
---
They could have starved to death! The shelters themselves are still standing after all
---
When fighting Earle, these things start glitching out in a way that makes my whole screen start to pixelate. It's like some giant Lovecraftian tear in reality is opening and my eyes are simply unable to process what I'm seeing. It's madness! Madness, I say!
---
Building structures inside your workshop doesn't take your materials , not always , let me clarify inside the workshop there's some materials you can use until a certain point after that it's your junk , you can see what materials are from the workshop on build menu when building something if the materials required are green it means you're not using your junk but the workshop junk , if materials needed are gray it's your junk used to build
---
No kidding! Especially on PC, it feels like as of late not too many players go for dropping the nuke. I don't blame them, it's a bit of a hassle. It would be much worse if it wasn't for the Nukacrypt website that provides the codes.
---
The funny thing is I see constant nuke calls on console when my son playing on PS4, it's all he does most of the time. Queen and Collossus almost every half hour.
---
I didn't know this, thank you.
---
There's another step called "Almost Ally, Ward's Still Missing Some Shit"
---
Yes! This would be INCREDIBLE!
---
You’re gentleman and a scholar 👌🏽
---
Thank you almost for got and seen you post while playing so I did it straight away. Thank kind person.
---
Nice, thank you. Hopefully this comes in legendary vanguard also.
---
20 runs so far. Had him glitched into the floor and the ceiling 3 times just today. Failed event event each time because he simply can’t be hit.
---
Change Ward’s pathing back so he’s all over the place again and apply his update to Earle instead.
---
Well yes. The shelters only provided air. Anything else you had to provide yourself. The only instructions were “Wait for radiation to clear”
---
So these where sold as a cheaper alternative to vaults. But they did nothing. 
---
Also no major bombs dropped on Appalachia so that’s why their still standing. Like a lot of structures
---
There's also been double score challenges and extra challenges the past 2 weeks...so you are probably just advancing more quickly than before.
---
I'm fairly certain he moves once every day when the dailies reset.
---
It is if you've already gathered 2-3k+ screws and wendigo drops.
---
I didn't know either until recently when a friend told me ... And I'm lvl 500  :'))
---
And let not forget* Ghoul Skins for our Fallout 76 characters
---
Oh yeah. He hates her. Something along the lines of I HOPE THAT WACKY ROBOT QUITS BLABBERING OVER THE RADIO. 
---
I’ve had my camp here for over 5 months so I couldn’t say what the other dialogues are
---
I very rarely find ammo, and it's once you've ran it about 20 or so times, you have enough screws/acid to last you a long time. I think I have like 10k acid stashed and well over 3k screws. I don't really need many anymore. The caps are more valuable and I've found MANY don't even know that box is there.
---
I cannot like this post enough.  That's a fantastic idea!
---
Dunno about you, but my potato PC had never experienced any troubles with Tesla
---
You will drop 300 of this...
---
Not worth it. Doesn't have anything special outside of some ore and caps. You're better off looting any wendigos for screws and ammo.
---
&gt;but I doubt we'll ever see NPCs in it
---
When I first entered the secret base from the Foundation questline, I'm pretty sure I encountered an officer in Chinese PA.. Probably unique to that instanced area though.
---
Goes really well with long hunters coat.
---
We should have Ghoul Skins for our Fallout 76 characters and they should stay on aswell
---
The chainsaw used to be extremely broken, by an exploit. I used it until it got patched, I'd get over 100 dmg a tick without being a bloodied build. Then they patched it. 😔😔
---
Dropping nukes takes legit like 7-10 minutes.
---
Not terrible with SS either! 
---
Especially if you don’t want to spend so much on the darn helmet (again!)
---
What if Beth actually let us actually play
---
None what so ever. I stopped doing because of it.
---
The final prize was a light with little stars in it, black cosmos PA Skin and jetpact and apicture of the board for your camp and 500 atoms. The atoms are honestly the best thing...
---
That would be the icing on the cake 🎂.
---
Hopefully, tip for the settler daily if it's a radir thief if you chose the pay me caps your raider rep will go up don't know if settler gose down or stays the same, It's a little difference for the settlers if it dose go down. For the retirement plan daily if you are trying to get settler rep you can say go to foundation bring settler rep up then lie to rocky and say you killed him bring up both reps.
---
I'm old and remembered that there was something about nukes and radiation in the Fallout 1 manual. Dug it up (yes, I still have that) and, yes, the info is in there.
---
Basically, when talking about warheads in the Fallout universe we're talking about low yield warheads. 200-750 kilotons, with some exceptions, notably those that were dropped on D.C.. 
---
Low yield was deemed "better" as high yield would blast too much of the radiation into the stratosphere and would not radiate the environment as much as low yield blasts.
---
For your reading pleasure I found a link to it online.

---
Pages 1-6 to 1-7
---
Not sure how that helps your case but it's a good read anyways. :)
---
50? It looks like half that to me??
---
You need to craft a better backpack and then apply the backpack skin. The skin does nothing to the bags level. The armor workbench will let you craft a new one.
---
Dirty Water only tho
---
Floor decs, same tab as the stuffed gorilla :)
---
Explosive miniguns also glitch out the audio for everyone during the colossus event.
---
Thanks for the heads up! I would have missed out otherwise.
---
This video is showing a glitch that they said they fixed in this last patch. Can someone confirm that this still works?
---
You can get the minecart planters with the settler/raider packs on psn etc, not floors but can be placed inside
---
You have been insulted.
---
Ally, but it takes way longer than levels before.
---
 &gt;  I feel big, heavy, slow, and stupid, and cant wait to get back to being small, smart, sneaky, and speedy again
---
That sounds like more of a testament to how strong unyielding is.
---
Thank you I checked there and it wasn’t showing up. I’m going to try logging out and back in
---
I am mildly confused on this topic, but what exactly are cursed weapons?
---
Absolutely...    it’s actually listed in alphabetical order in you pipboy but not in your inventory... or vice-Verca.   But it’s also glitchy.   I have been waiting for the Arachne holotape to “reload” back into my list forever.   The game glitched at the exact moment that I was to make the decision and now it’s gone.    That particular mission is now on hold.
---
On the first day of the legandy run this spaceship already started from the 30th reward, so he just got a really big headstart
---
The plans are limb dependent.
---
Definitely gets an upvote from me. I spend silly amounts of time &amp; caps fast travelling, only to find it hasn't reset yet. A timer of some sorts would be very, very useful.
---
I sell them for 450 and they sell like hot cakes!
---
I always have like 10 of them.
---
Easy sell.
---
As of this morning i can confirm it works
---
Ohhhhhh
---
That would be lit. I hate wasting the meat.
---
Watch them make the perfectly preserved pie a key ingredient. It would have the upside of making them useful for something besides display case decorations.
---
Seems a lot of people would of. I'm glade I made this post.
---
Backpacks go up to LVL50. You just need to craft a better one and re-apply the skin.
---
Or a golden one!
---
I’m not saying it was wrong of people to complain I simply stated what happened
---
I think you just have to be friendly, not allies to get the farmable dirt tiles.
---
You could fix the lore by having zax say he found a way to improve them...Yada yada.
---
🤔😏
---
Id rather just wait till I level them up or even trade for the recipe with another player then pay, thanks though. (I'm already paying for fallout 1st so don't wanna pay for that too)
---
As long as the radiation field is still up, a nuke at the prime fissure will spawn both. But if you wait too long, you'll have to nuke the mine again to get the event to trigger.
---
I thought this was real and got excited. Bethesda. This mans got the right idea.
---
I'll look into it, thanks
---
Edit: just checked and your right, thanks man!
---
convenient AND canon
---
What are the rules on calling “This” on your own comment?
---
Campfire Tails
---
No specifics, gear, or tactics just showed up to the forums showed us how big your balls were and walked off. I guess I can respect that, whomever you are.
---
Think the problem might be running the game from an SD card.
---
this would be amazing for finally opening a restaurant in my CAMP
---
You cant trade any plans bought with bullion, nore can a player that has them learned build at anothers camp.
---
I hear some blame meat piles, but even when there are loads of meat piles at Line in the Sand, as long as no tesla rifles are present, I have no issues. It's only tesla rifles that cause issues for me, so when I see someone with it at an event like that, I just leave. Not worth it.
---
Idk about xbox but this happens to me every now and then on PS4, the solution for me is to start any other online game for couple minutes then go back to fallout and it does let me sign in! Idk what’s that about but it works 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Also check other posts in here there might be something useful
---
Dang, thanks for letting me know
---
Right now i keep nuking Monogah mine, i get about 3 legendaries every time
---
Any of the fissure sites. The easiest way to complete that is by doing events like leader of the pack and uranium fever thiugh.
---
Im trying another xbox acc to see if its a problem with my main acc
---
Fissure sites on your map, looks like a cracked egg. Spawns scorched beasts regularly along with their minions.
---
I see them a lot in that pheasent map area by flatwood. Super pacifist little guys.
---
Help us help you.  Actually tell us specifically what your problem is that you're having with the questline and maybe someone here can help.
---
Thank you for this!
---
ok cheater
---
Pacifist mode and stop seeking revenge.
---
Yeah.. don't worry the very interesting things like the ammo converter, the lunchboxes and two other items (I'm not sure which one) will return via the gold billion system.
---
If you hunt between Fissure Site Prime, FS Alpha and the unmarked Fissure slightly to the north east you can get this done with one or two rounds of those 3.
---
My friends cannot get the quest recruitment blues that activates the whole other part of the quest line
---
Just run around at the fissure site prime, there will be spawns. Also the fissure site at the Pumpkin house usually has one beast flying around!
---
I know the power armor glitch, what's the camera glitch? Is it the same principle?
---
I’ve gotten box twice but caps don’t mean nothing so I rather have everything else
---
I like hunting irl. I enjoy seeking out certain critters in games.
---
If your cursor is over the prize when it unlocks you have to drag it off and back on again in order to unlock it. Just further evidence that literally everything in this game has bugs. 97 unlocked fine for me.
---
I like to make my kitchen outdoors, with a toilet on the table and that bowl of alcohol right next to it
---
???
---
Lol that's great!
---
No. Share hard bargain 3 if needed, but nothing should change player to player interactions regarding caps, lest exploits be made possible.
---
lol
---
Damn.
---
I don’t care if low level players are there , I seem to be carrying high lvl players through it so what difference does it make . If I’m going to be doing the most dmg  anyways what difference is it if the lvl 30 is beside the lvl 100 not  barely scratching him. all I ask ,is for damn revive when I go down so my revenant procs. Then I can kill him  so much faster and we can go soak up some rads outside.
---
That’s the problem. I’m usually the guy doing the most damage to Earle from where I sit, because he can’t pathfind to that location and no hazards spawn there, ever. If he fears me, I just run into a plain bit of wall. But the Wendingo Spawn can get to me, and will always fuck me up first, unless there’s someone doing more damage. So I end up having to spend 5 minutes taking down spawns, while I’m either alone or with one other dude, who 7/10 is competent enough to do it with one other competent person, but not quite enough to solo. I can’t solo it consistently yet, but I can survive the entire time and bring us health down to half after he’s already mutated.
---
Canned goods just taste great too. Sometimes I'll buy canned goods instead of fast food.
---
If i get it I'm gonna wear it with the hunters long coat and Secret Service backpack
---
Yup, it is a sad situation. I really really like my Tesla... but I have had to switch it to another weapon during events.
---
Now it makes no sense for me to scream 'ULTIMATE POWERRRRRRRR!!!!!!!' everytime I attack the Collosus...
---
Eh, you have a cell phone in your pocket and a social security number so they already know everything about you.
---
If you have any perk or weapon that staggers it will interfer with the beast landing.
---
Is this just guns or are unarmed/melee doing the same?
---
Ayyee mad respect for that one my dude! I guess I'm old too then as I did also start with the original Fallout 1. Imma defo read that manual one day.
---
Have some [reddit silver!](https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/img/gold/badges/award-silver-large.png)
---
One moment that made me laugh was when I was going to the cranberry bog for well, cranberries. After getting ready I had to remind myself to take my exterminator’s Gatling plasma, and the absurdity of taking heavy weapons to pick berries hit hard.
---
AWOL armaments, the SBQ and the WC. I basically only do those three things when I play and I pull so many legendaries I have to dump them on people or put them in my vendor for free to free up inventory space
---
Yeah they escaped from West Tek and people saw them. Mothman wasn't created by West Tek though.
---
Yup, once he reaches the end of the legendary run, he will feel the same disappointment as the rest of us.
---
He will then stop playing the game at which point we will never hear about Zorbo again....
---
Big rock candy mountain should be in this game , I’ve been mad since I realized it isn’t
---
If you’re on Neighborly, you need 6000 points to fill the bar and hit ‘Ally’. That’s the same amount as going from Neutral up to the crossover to Neighborly. 
---
[This resource](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations) may help. There are a few hidden tricks on how you can speed up your progress, like donating the pictures to the opposing side instead of giving them to Davenport. You can still get the associated Treasury Notes by going back to him, and also some caps if your Charisma is 8+.
---
The thing is that they need a very flat area to land and even then they are most likely just stay in the air just to fuck around with you.
---
Better get her some Bird Bones lol
---
Same. I've been wanting that to happen since Fallout 76 came out.
---
Ah well, at least 'it's high on their wishlist' so that's a good enough indication they could potentially surprise us.
---
Do they make faster Xbox's than other ones? I assumed consoles were all loading in the same time.
---
I've done it three times, about to be four. Burned through about 4k 50 Cal. There was also two Scorched Earth's in there as well.
---
From Urbandictionary:

**"Commando**
---
(v.) To not wear underwear. The origins for this are either "out in the open" or "ready for action". Maybe others."  
---
I was making a Pun. I agree 100% with your post
---
You can actually kill the defector *after* telling him to go to Foundation, and then not have to lie to Rocksy about killing him, and that will boost Raider rep a little bit as well.
---
Damn. You got 6 downvotes for that? Tf????
---
I think the least they could do is faction public teams.  Shouldn't be too hard to implement imo
---
It should, but he might be off by a space last I checked. The season will end at Noon ET on Tuesday, September 8th.
---
Can't have your cake &amp; eat it.
---
Yeah that's what I normally do give the photos to the radiers and then lie
---
Oh fucking bless you
---
Maybe sign into reddit through the xbox
---
No, you did see one. They're in T-60 though, not the Atomic Shop Chinese skins.
---
It's a pretty cool encounter, all the same.
---
If they become a more common enemy, depending on development goals, it'ld be neat to see more of those.
---
Couldn't disagree more. There is no incentive to hunt Plans if that happens. Instead I just go see Random Person A and they give me all the Plans and I give them back.
---
I wouldn’t mind it if there was a little more time to loot the wendingos...get back some of the lost rounds
---
It's arguably more beneficial than the queen, and easier IMO.
---
-at least 1 guaranteed 3* legendary, another legendary from Earl, and of course chance for cursed weapons (which make for amazing scrip haha)
---
-the mining mask makes for a halfway decent trade item
---
-last but not least...tons and tons of screws!!
---
The Ghoul Mask from Fallout 3 would be neat to have again
---
I only tested these, but melee should not be too different
---
My buddies wife is in a clan called the wasteland wenches , they are an all female crew with like 500 members and they love that sorta thing. I’m sure you could find them if you look or I could introduce you to her if you like
---
My name here is my gamer tag , I’ll be on tonight after my kids are in bed
---
Not entirely sure. But i think it might be the name of legendary loots from Colossal Problem
---
Timer runs out or someone else completed it or, in some of my cases, bad connection causes a long ass load screen and the event fails.
---
I finally finished TLR and while I’m exhausted from it I’m super excited for the next one! I’m still playing for Fortifying Atlas: Project Bravo so that’s something to tide me over until next season (plus the new event is great!)
---
No, both of those are the larger bush sized meshes for razorgrain. At Silva Homestead there are small scaled meshes for the razorgrain plant that we can not use at camps but would save so much space. We need those.
---
Bro. I don’t take workshops but you gotta remember this is a post apocalyptic game.  I personally play like a good guy but we need the bad guys too lol.  Workshops are a waste of time anyways.
---
Thank because I normally tell him to go to foundation and let him be but now I can get even more rep
---
Is that even possible?😂 sorry I use Reddit solely through the iPhone app lmao so I just never had to do this lol
---
Radstag meat! I'm *always* on the edge of my carry limit. Being able to tin some to keep for those "I've-just-collected-a-good-haul-of-stuff-to-sell-but-i'm-miles-from-a-station" moments,would be a quality of game addition. Bethesda,are you watching? Lol.
---
I'm new to the game and thought underarmor stayed :( that's why I'm wearing BoS underarmor...!
---
If you can't select it to move it then yeah you will need to move the camp to get the camp module to move.
---
Hey there big fella... Why don't we let them fix the tesla rifle first!  ;P
---
Hopefully the chicken coop, that's the thing i want the most on the whole run and im so far from it that i highly doubt ill get it in time.
---
Too bad I'm on PC, otherwise I'd help this person out. Wanted to say I agree on the delusional bit. I sell plans for 10 caps, drug ones amd disease cure for 25. I'm not greedy. Would you say it's worthless selling the healing salve ones though? Had some spares and threw them in there.
---
This is 100% unimmersive.
---
Not too mention the possible ammo gains. If you make it your only goal to kill wendigo spawn, you should make more ammo then you spend.
---
You can't have your **fancy** cake and eat it too.
---
Negative.
---
Plans that are Atom based have to remain bound to the buyer.
---
Plans that are not should remain consumables as there is a market for them. Not just in caps, but also in the value of doing quests.
---
Get the xbox app on your phone or tablet then sign into your account then go to your clips and you can save them from there then put it in a Imgur link
---
The T in CBT now stands for tetanus.
---
Idea was so unpopular they deleted their account
---
Thanks for the input i'll build a raider camp next time :)
---
As the others have said, fissure spawns will do the trick.
---
But recognize that generally if a fissure has spawned a scorchbeast you’ve killed, it won’t spawn another for a while. GENERALLY.
---
Good point, i mean hell: 'Daily Ops' Public Teams already look like a Brotherhood of Steel Public Team as it is. So it could be extremely easy to do: Simply put: Get so-and-so amount of XP for Faction Events. Simple for them to do.
---
It'd be a step in the right direction at least.
---
The whole site is devoted to cash trades for rare in game items.
---
I use the Xbox App on my phone. The Xbox clips get recorded and uploaded to that app, and then you have a variety of ways to share and store them. This sub won't allow direct posting of video, so you have to link it elsewhere. 
---
Some people [suggested this site](https://gameclips.io/) but I haven't used it much, despite seeing how a [bunch of my clips are there](https://gameclips.io/somewherein72/7514e683-5099-41f6-942c-47751ff737c4)
---
That's the whole end game. Burn ammo and time and hope to get something cool. 
---
I really like the event. Pretty consistent 3 star drops, decent drop rate on cool plans/the helmet. And the event itself is interesting. The fear mechanic, environmental hazards, and the mad dash to the exit. Compared to SBQ it's a blast.
---
Looking forward to it
---
Nah G its consistently happening
---
How would anyone who matters find out?
---
Awesome, thanks!👍🏽
---
Yea I took a peek at the prices but wonder if how much people actually buy them daily or weekly
---
Fricken sand people !
---
yeap. the chicken coop will be available for purchase with gold bullions once the season 2 starts.
---
unless they change what pc players have on pts.
---
If you bought the scabber backpack skin the clipping looks almost intentional.
---
*Corrected by the Redundancy Department of Redundancy
---
I'll give that a try next time the issue pops up.
---
I have an obsession with trying to copy really cool builds that others post. I always wanted something with a modern mansion look. I'll be trying this one tonight. Where did you build it?
---
Wow. That’s super Raider behavior right there.
---
I’m on Xbox. Add me “crunchtastic” I’ll give you 20.
---
Got a thing for gatlins...huh?
---
I do the event because I enjoy it. Did it today on a level 15 character and it was a blast.
---
Its between 25-500 caps not guaranteed 500.
---
You're absolutely right.
---
I don't know why people keep saying they HAVE to do the challenges. No one has to complete the season, you either want to or you don't.  No one is missing out on anything that changes game play either. I like my moon monkey backpack, but it is the same as the vanilla backpack I had before.
---
Yes, just to survivability. If I'm going to run a bloodied build, I usually do stealth with 4 unyielding and 1 chameleon. Or, I'll be in nerd rage territory while using Power Armor with Emergency Protocols and either a bloodied or vampire's heavy weapon.
---
Canning is neat, but the Fridge needs buffed to 95% spoil reduction. And the Freezer should be 99% spoil reduction.
---
&gt;	He will then stop playing the game at which point we will never hear about Zorbo again....
---
Right. Because people who no longer the play the game don’t continue to give full-throated assaults on the rest of us.
---
Lol does it even give you protection?
---
Ah you are right, Ferals would be a challenge
---
Damn well done!! I knew someone would probably find a way :)
---
What bothers me the most is that it seems I have a higher carrying capacity without the PA.
---
I mainly use the Excavator PA.
---
I think I've finally settled in a spot, just down the cliff from Lucky Hole mine next to a pond. Got some purifiers going and can easily take my Excavator PA into the mine to gather lead. Surprisingly peaceful spot most of the time, minus one day of a legendary scorchbeast, a vengeful mothman, and a couple of plagued rats all spawned at once 😂 
---
I've moved a few times already after only playing about a month, think I'm content for awhile.
---
Ya with one Wasteland enemies will be higher level anyway so more variety in older stuff will come back.
---
Just give each faction a generic boost and call it good.  It would make finding like minded players so much easier.
---
*”It’s about sending a message.”*
---
Power of the pen, has been lost
---
I've mostly done the event as a melee character. Do you get ammo back from the Spawns when you shoot them? I just like all the stimpaks. Really makes it easy to tank Earle.
---
I have a new tactic to try on my other half. Maybe she'll end up liking it. Thanks!
---
For me it's really putting in the effort to gather materials that spoil to then make an item that spoils. Some of them don't even have that great buffs and even if they do you are pressured to use it quickly.
---
Intimidation factor
---
That's what I said in my original post.
---
I’ve been getting SCORE almost every time I exit PA
---
Ahhhhh ok :)
---
Just going off of the information I was given here lol.
---
I've done that pretty religiously over about 30 or 40 runs. I got plenty. I'd rather have caps.
---
No you mention it, it would be cool if a certain NPC was wearing Chinese PA juring one of the main quests...
---
Been wanting them to do a viable chainsaw build (with viable legendary chainsaw drops) ever since they nerfed the original damage exploit (the only thing that made it playable).  I'm still hopeful they will someday hear our pleas and make that whole category (chainsaw, ripper, buzzblade) a playable category with it's own set of perk cards to be honest.
---
Does chucking the explosive bait not cause them to want to land?
---
That’s fair, though I do notice that prepared food spoils a *lot* slower.
---
Yeah. I know why I get that one, but I have no idea why I get SCORE when I enter it sometimes.
---
Well 'someone' did mention getting tracked down in that same questline so who knows, they may show up some day..
---
&gt;!If it's synthetic meat does that make it Vegan!&lt;
---
The spawns have a high chance to drop ammo for the weapon type that killed them. Melee makes them drop random ammo. 
---
I run a magic Shotty to clear the spawns while the team focuses on Earl and I always make tons more ammo then I spend, even when I DPS Earl when waiting for more wendigo to spawn in
---
Had a kid literally do this like 6 times in a session. Had my camp close to the OS camp, and his was right there too. Came to my shop to buy whatever (dudes like level 15) and asked me to follow him doing whatever. When I said no repeatedly he began freaking out on the mic, and shooting my cow. I didn’t care and repaired it. Every time I went back to my camp in that session I noticed he came back and killed it. He did it 6 times, and after sent me a message talking about how shitty I am as a player. Good times.
---
on your right as you're just about to leave. Don't bother. stay and loot the meat piles for those delicious screws.
---
Same with all the guns I have equipped when I log out, it’s been happening for about a week
---
Very true plus it'll fully revive Roleplay opportunities. I mean that's one of the things we (the players) were originally meant to do: Make up our own stories. I find it kinda saddening how barely any people do that now. But if Bethesda adds in Faction Public Teams there could be plenty of opportunities to go by.
---
100% quake outfit is legit with it
---
What other rewards do we get from the community event? Is there a list anywhere? Ive been out of the loop
---
It's a virus shh
---
You can see it right in the beginning of the mine, but the door is not open. It will be on the way out. Just before the exit.
---
Dunno why you're getting downvoted for helpful information. People confuse me. Thanks!
---
Yeah, that too.  I’ve been running 4 pieces of unyielding + 1 chameleon heavy combat armor for...50 levels now?  Just starting my SS unyielding grind.
---
I just wish we had more time to complete it. I have been getting my score points almost every day and I'm only level 70 or so
---
yes allow us to can all foods/drinks so they don't spoil and selling food in vending machines can be a thing.
---
This was super helpful. I’ve been doing it wrong for 6 weeks lol I hate this grind and ward
---
👍👍
---
That or placed straight to the Atom Shop

---
Location here, included my other two camps for ideas - Hope you come up with something nice
---
After the fatigues i think its bonus score challange and then a another meet week
---
Happened on ps4 today.
---
In real life the high yield thermonuclear weapons create comparatively less fallout than fission only weapons. Tzar Bomba was considered a very clean weapon since it derived most of its power from fusion.   Fission is where all of the nasty fallout comes from.
---
That's awesome! That makes it even more manageable/rewarding. Melee gets about zero ammo from them though. Stimpaks or Radaway and then the screws and teeth I think.
---
I’m dropping some in an hour or so after some ammo runs.  VocalLaser#7201
---
Usually see squirrels at Fasnacht (sp?) and Grahm’s Cook-out.
---
This is great! How do you build the steel beams in a curve like that?
---
I would like to have a functional stable game
---
Think about all the fun stuff you could set up. Defending a workshop against a raider team with a predetermined prize everyone decides on, or a million different things. Hope they implement it!
---
I thought they were like a "holy crap thats a nuke I better hop in and survive the blast" sort of thing rather than a vault alternative where you hang out waiting for the end.  I've been in a few cities where certain (large, stone)  buildings have little plaques (rusted and clearly defunct) indicating a fallout shelter where you could presumably survive a blast.  I figured it was similar.
---
I assumed the idea behind the pulowoskis is that the military or pulowski people would come rescue you after a blast, so you wouldn't need many supplies.  And then the military/pulowskis just didnt hold up that part of the bargain.
---
Welp, I came across a quad double barrel today, and yeah, that fire rate holy shit. Gonna need to know what mods are good
---
I'm adding u
---
So, to the right of the exit?  Is it in a room or something?  All I usually see is laggy rock piles falling around me and cryptids spawning.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
Looks like the fatigues come first, then a BOS collectron, purveyor sale, and 2nd meat week
---
5 caps? FIVE caps?
---
You hade me thinking you were going after some big time outlaw!
---
That quest bugged out on me a few times. I just reset the game and tried it and it worked but i dont know if theres a more recent glitch with it
---
Thanks for the link👍🏻
---
Awesome thanks for sharing!
---
Laughs in atom shop*
---
As mentioned you need to kill legendary or a scorch beast, legendaries would be easier. But if you want one, the one below white spring spawns a level 50 consistently and fairly easy to kill
---
Floor decor I think? Next to the gorilla taxidermy i believe
---
well if you see a random one them yes. otherwise there is a 24 cool down if you are searching from the enclave bunkers computer.
---
Now the bees are going to get you.
---
It's there since the game released, did took a photo and still seeing it on my loading screen once a while, always bring me a smile because I knew it still broken. For some reason, this thought comforts me
---
Ty for reading my point of view.
---
Just +1.
---
How about focusing their resources on bugs and glitches instead?
---
You need to complete the enclave quest line, get a nuclear keycard, get the nuke codes for a silo (use nukacrypt to get the codes).    
---
Complete the silo dungeon and launch a nuke.
---
Edit:  watch a video because there are many small steps inside the silo, you will need a hazmat suit/ power armor etc, you will need ammo, stims, and circuits to repair mainframe cores.  It may take you a while your first time, the silos are quite large and not the easiest to navigate.
---
Thank you - Start with a simple foundation and snap a metal beam on the side then another on top of that then blueprint them. Once you have done that you will be able to place the blueprinted version anywhere you want without them snapping
---
You don’t have to run for the exit, if you stay looting Wendigos and the mine collapses you respawn outside with your loot and the event rewards
---
Don't need those just keycard. https://nukacrypt.com/ has the codes.
---
Kinda surprised they haven't tried finding a way to monetize a fix for it like the scrap box with fallout first
---
https://nukacrypt.com/
---
I know Bethesda will never put any of this in the game, but I'd love to have a stable and functional game instead of this gimmick
---
To confirm,
---
1. Completed the Free States story up to the point of finding Fort Defiance
---
2. Went up to the 3rd floor of Defiance and used the terminal there and attempted to register themselves
---
These are things that need to be done in order to start recruitment blues.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Recruitment\_Blues](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Recruitment_Blues)
---
NOT THE BEEEEEEES!!!!
---
Or you know, just make the fridge stop spoiling instead of slowing it down.(and not use camp budget for each item)
---
I give them to my beginner friend. And sometimes into my vendor shop for cheap caps
---
That's awesome. Thanks making me laugh cause I needed it.!
---
could be... interesting? don’t know how it would work... could you give more context?
---
West Tek, The Burrows, Uranium Fever, The Whitesprings, Leader of the pack, Any Event: Hoard, Guided Meditation, Huntersville, SBQ, I come across a lot of legendary SB.
---
Lots of people use them to tag instead of one-shotting everything.
---
Floor Decoration is correct.  I couldn't find it either, had to look up on here.
---
I am sure some people still have no idea the sudden choppy pixelated mess the game becomes is due to their tesla, but man it’s frustrating to see those energy arcs and know your event is doomed. It makes the game unplayable. The guns need to be disabled until they are fixed.
---
yeah, happens to robots alot too.
---
Just wander around Watoga or the Enclave bunker, you'll hear the sound of dying robots frequently.
---
I saw a settler die mid conversation
---
Berkeley springs also?
---
Cool.  I’m on now.  Swing by my camp whenever
---
We also need a skin for the death claw gauntlet
---
I can protect you if you would like
---
I just read the manual and they seem to be using data based on modern nukes which would have smaller warheads but they would be MIRVs with about 10-12 warheads per missile. During the Cold War the strategy was MAD, mutual assured destruction, where you throw everything you've got at them.
---
Floor decor like the the others said. Looks awesome. 3 heads on a post and they seep their element.
---
I can think of lots of skins for that... Wendigo Gauntlet, Mega Sloth Gauntlet, Scorchbeast Talon Gauntlet... Tons of possibilities.
---
Exactly. Uny is OP. Thankfully it's getting capped to 20 SPECIAL atm in the PTS.
---
That’s a great point. They already get us with the unlimited Scrap. If they removed these time restrictions, and increase maximums for Caps, Scrip, etc for First, it becomes more and more of a value-added proposition for those that balk at the fee.
---
I like to use handmades for scortch and robots because the fire rate is good if there are groups spawns and the clip holds just enough for 5 to 6 enemies at a time its useful because the scortch and especially the robots can do some serious damage to you in groups. 
---
I like a primed Gatlin gun on supermutans and ghouls, with the proper build it takes two shots per kill. If you use adrenaline perk then after your first or second kill it's just one shots kills, saves on ammo and puts down the ghouls before they are within 6 feet of you and I suggest I 25ffr for mutants but it drops them like flies, and it's a life saver with out wasting ammo when you face a mutant with a speedy minigun. 
---
I love the LMG on scortch beasts and other huge creatures. When you hit up a fissure site and a one star legendary bat spawns, at the same time like 5 scortch also spawn so I kill them with the handmade then the bat lands I quick swap to the LMG and with the perks for heavy guns and stacked adrenaline kills the lmg takes like only 26 round and less then 2 seconds to drop the thing, on head shots ofcourse.
---
I like hearing the boom as a level 12.
---
Best you can do is use the game DVR to save the photos. I make sure to do that to my favorites Incase the console ever gets damaged
---
I've never had that issue. Might of been worth its own post.
---
But I was pointing out a helmet got added to the Cosmos Bundle and if you have redeemed it before it was added, you have to redeem it again for the helmet.
---
Im thinking it will be used in private world only
---
Scorchbeast gauntlet sounds dope
---
Let’s hope
---
My main camp, Cliffside: I've been working on it since beta. It's a cozy bar/diner with a PA garage and it's my home. I've spent the life of 76 refining it, and once or twice doing minor remodeling. It's got a beautiful view of Whitesprings hotel from the porch, great for watching nukes go down.
---
My second camp, Mayhem Arena: A raider arena with a chem bar. The arena doors open simultaneously to the arena floor, with obstacles, barbed wire, scrap walls, and sharp scrap metal. It's got spotlights, a viewing area for the whole family to enjoy, a throne for me from the upper viewing area, and even an amazing view of the monorail elevator for the combatants as they plunge to their death from a misstep (the arena is also on a cliff). The chem bar provides you with all that you need, from shelves full of chems to racks full of weapons. Between matches, you can chill outside and watch the static on the TV, or practice your aim on a deadbeat who wouldn't pay up in the targeting range.
---
At this point pleading ignorance doesnt fly. Teslas have been broken for almost a month now. Seeing "chain" everywhere was kinda funny but now it makes the game unplayable. I agree fully they really need to disable the guns or something.
---
When you spawn in at the very start of the event not where you fight, theres a concrete wall on your left with a closed door. To the right is where you see lockers and the workbench. That door opens when you are escaping you can see the chest from the hole in the wall.
---
12 inches in your mom heh heh heh
---
I got all the way to the end of a silo, it was extremely stressful, I'm not very good, I used up almost all my ammo, my melee weapon broke, and I ran out of stimpacks, but I finally put down the last robot and everything went red.
---
I put in the keycard, and got out my (manually prepared) code.
---
It didn't work.
---
Luckily I had two keycards. I tried again. It didn't work.
---
Turns out those codes expire every week.
---
I haven't tried again.
---
It shows up for me (I think; "Taxidermy Wendigo Colossus," or is that a different thing?) but not for my boyfriend.
---
You did. My  bad!
---
That's how electricity works plus they should fix VATS, how bout them laser guys get a couple of big heavies together all firing, no comparison to the light show and aftermath/FPS drop compared to meat piles. jmo
---
Would explain how you can kill him. When he is seemingly supposed to be the only one in existence and how there are glowing and scorched versions of him
---
Oh yeah, now that it exists, they could certainly go back and swap the model.
---
That would be pretty neat.
---
I haven’t seen it in-game yet, but I bet you it doesn’t look too bad with the Chinese Stealth Suit. A lot of things do.
---
Make sure you put Wine In it
---
It's certainly a possibility. We'll just have to see how everything shakes out over time.
---
You can post pictures and videos in r/fallout76settlements, just FYI...
---
I don't know if you're serious about that theory or not, but the fact the cultists also seem to worship the Interloper adds another layer to it. What if Mothman isn't even real and has always been a projection created by the Interloper? There's no reason to believe the Interloper wasn't around pre war and since it's completely inactive there's also no reason to suspect it's malevolent.
---
As much as they suck,I do appreciate em for just THAT reason alone...
---
Did Uranium Fever earlier,&amp; there was more people then I’ve ever encountered at said event,
---
I didn’t get one shot on any one legendary,but kept in The fight hopin for the mask,jumpsuit drop chance...
---
But no one used a Tesla,just one shotted the shit out out of everything...
---
Where as when I did ACP someone did indeed bring a Tesla,&amp; it funked my FPS up real bad...
---
Sometimes it happens,other times it doesn’t...
---
But when It doesn’t F my frame rate to hell,I def appreciate the folks who bring them,to give others a chance.
---
Should be looked at by Beth regardless
---
Don’t see anyone else who’s mentioned it, so just so you know, intelligence doesn’t affect xp gain in 76.
---
I know. Will post mine when complete but with all the people disappointed with the bunker I thought this may reach more people. 
---
Thanks though 🙂
---
Oh sweet.
---
I’d love a second Meat Week
---
24 what not hours I've done 3 on different servers
---
I hate using my tesla rifle. The only reason is for tagging instead of killing things. It does work great for that.
---
- do explosion dmg = end game bosses are immune
---
- every first shot in vats do not hit
---
- sometimes bugged reload 
---
- shooting faster in 3rd view
---
- do less dmg than random magic shootgun
---
yes, thats end game weapon at the finest
---
I don't see how....the first plans for a "Modern Home" was all the way back in 1922 almost a hundred years ago. It's not stated when exactly the Fallout timeline deviates from our own, but it is known that it is sometime after 1945/WW2. Sure Art Deco and Futurism remained prevalent in the Fallout Universe it doesn't mean all style was exclusively such.
---
I've solo run radiation rumble and had something like 100 meat piles on the ground. Meat piles dont drop fps from what i can tell. Also rather have 10 people using whatever gatling energy weapon they want than 1 guy using a tesla weapon. Never had the laser gatling and plasma gatling drop my frame rate at all.
---
Did he use a nocturnal pool cue?
---
Absolutely gorgeous!
---
What where the others,the Beret &amp; flag right?
---
I didn’t end up gettin either as my live/1st where down at the time...
---
As much as I’ve donated,&amp; being back in the game,I don’t wanna miss these ones.
---
Are the others tradeable,anyone know?
---
Thanks so much!
---
I see them black ops 2 guns, in all seriousness a gatling mini nuke launcher would be kindve insane
---
Would like to see the final product. It's hard to grasp it.
---
I've got a camp that's about equidistant between the wendingo cave, the sludge hole, and Seneca gang camp. There's a water source to build purifiers and cargobots fly over all the time
---
I’ve done it twice today.
---
Agree, it could use a tune up, Ive noticed a similar issue when multiple people are using gat lasers/lasers/legacy energies.  I use a Tesla on my commando, but usually only solo for ammo conservation in low level areas when I’m running errands.
---
Technically they do have fall damage. Like literally 1hp damage from high up. But unless you get to 1hp it’s basically no fall damage.
---
Yeah man, no worry. I like the idea!
---
If it isn't required for a current quest or useable toss it
---
In a blank scenario, just firing bullets, automatic will always win.
---
What they should do is make semi-automatic weapons have increased V.A.T.S. Functionality: semi-auto weapons can target limbs by default. semi-auto weapons have reduced AP cost compared to automatic counterparts. semi-auto weapons have increased V.A.T.S. accuracy.
---
Make semi-auto weapons good by making their base kit able hit weak points more often than automatic weapons against hard to hit enemies through V.A.T.S. with less perk card investment.
---
Whereas automatic weapons are good against non-weak spot enemies or easy to hit weak spot enemies.
---
Semi-auto V.A.T.S for the fast critters (speccing into Crit for DPS)
---
Auto iron sights for the DPS sponges (Speccing into V.A.T.S. For critters, base AP cost increases would prevent auto/V.A.T.S./Crit surpassing semi-auto).
---
Sorry but there is no building ever in any fallout game where houses looked like this.
---
Looks like a mini sentinel site from fo4 😅
---
Ha, all part of the fun.
---
It’s probably the person’s name on Xbox/ps4
---
Nuking someone else’s camp is spooky? If you say so...
---
I had something like this happen, it would start signing in, I would hear a click and then it would start buzzing and kick me to the xbox main page. I ended up having to go into my games, clicking the game to get to the saved files, and deleting them from the console. I also had to deleted the game "saved space" file, and then it worked fine. It doesn't delete your profile if you are deleting from CONSOLE, since your profile is stored on the cloud as well, but you will lose your pictures.
---
yeap. and a light
---
Awesome build reminds me of The Dukes palace from dishonoured 2. Half expecting to find a clockwork soldier in there.
---
Thats sucks hopefully you get this one
---
Had that happen to me last night in the same spot. It was pretty funny, but I'm not complaining about the free meal.
---
go to my games and apps,
---
go to FO76 game image,
---
click the 3 bar button for more options, 
---
go to manage game and add one,
---
go to saved data,
---
and delete all from console.
---
Hope that helps!
---
Still trying to get it and I’m kind of a collector any tips or it’s just random
---
The term is cosmic horror, ppl are dumping the lovecraft name because he was super racist
---
90% of the time now for me also. I went a combined 300 levels on two platforms not coming across a behemoth and now I see one every time I go screw farming 😅
---
Sorry I meant the secret service helmet
---
Then there would just be more videos like of everyone's bridge outside Sanctuary with the naked dead raider.
---
Warcraft is a huge franchise...
---
Fallout is Bethesda #1 franchise, they could easily do 2 development team if they wanted too (they can definitely afford it too)
---
i think its actually a console limitation rather than bethesdas fault - like with the mod size limit
---
This would be excellent
---
So with the davenport thing would i just be able to take pics of foundation and take them to the raiders and still be able to do the quest again without 8 charisma?
---
Thanks man
---
That’s it
---
I always did the same. Just let me steal their 10 .45 ammo without having to murder them at least.
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature
---
Yes. He acts like he’s mad but the daily will reset at 8pm ET anyways. You just lose some caps, that’s all.
---
The excavation armor is the only set that lets you hold you reg armor on top of the power armor and doesn't affect you carry weight.
---
I bet people would use that to steal all the clothing off of the npcs in both the crater and foundation. It would probably be more uncommon to see those NPCs with clothing on rather than off....
---
I definitely would not complain...
---
Damn I forgot that the 4 fallout games that aren't top down explored every inch of America.... 😔 If the events of our world match up to the Fallout universe up to 1945 then technically a house of this style existed in the world till the bombs fell. Sooo....Not to mention the inhabitants of 76 were some of Americans finest it's not unlikely they'd experiment with architecture.
---
Think it works on the mr fuzzy mining helmets aswell but i dont have one so not 100% on that. Yeah i use it currently with the NCR ranged outfit and Waster tire backpack. Looks pretty good.
---
They were that. They were coin operated. But if in fact a nuclear blast happened. And you didn’t survive, well what were you going to do?
---
Nope. No one was coming to rescue you. 
---
As for real life buildings. Yes a lot were deemed fallout shelters. But back then, how would anyone really know if that was true outside of dropping a bomb with people in a shelter and seeing what happened?
---
America is is only country to drop atomic weapons. And trust me, those buildings wouldn’t have provided the protection you think they would.
---
There is a bug rn where if you nuke the SBQ both events pop, so people may be down there, since she is faster to kill.  You then join teams and ft to a basically fresh ACP
---
Oh really...I thought if you don’t make it out you don’t get the event reward
---
Wow
---
Thats fine im at the cap max with nothing to do with it anyway. I just need that sweet sweet gauss minigun
---
ah, ok. so
---
The max damage of furious is equal to the base damage of aa
---
I would love for my characters hazmat suit to work while in PA would make it easier for my bloodied PA heavy gunner
---
I get my Brahmin meat there.  Good looks boss.  Do you know where exactly they wander?
---
From what I hear from old timers this game does have 2 development teams on it.
---
I believe BGS Austin and BGS Maryland both work on this game. Supposedly one team focuses on story &amp; content while the other team handles everything else
---
I live in a hole in the ground because I figured once I came out if the vault and saw my house destroyed, I wouldn't want to build one. Is that immersive enough?
---
Oh shit I didnt realise this had started again. I want the protectron. Thanks for the heads up
---
I find them mostly around the obstacle course.
---
All I'm really trying to say (though maybe not eloquintly) is the pulowski chambers weren't inherently a scam.  They did hold up to nukes, and would have served their purpose had people been rescued in a timely manner.
---
IMO VATS is the magic Maguffin that makes things that are otherwise not practical, practical.
---
There has been a sorta bug last week or so "magic" weapons and I've seen a lot of folks exploiting it real easy to get crazee. But I agree, a auto Telsa with the right attributes causes issues due to bugthesdas' server stability issues.
---
I don't care so much about clipping. I just don't like the way some backpacks look with the jetpack. I welcome the visual glitch when the jetpack doesn't show
---
You're right, that was obvious sarcasm
---
TY for replying. However I'm still confused. In Enclave it says you need those code pieces to figure out the implied cipher And to get into the silo. I know RT graciously solves cipher but aren't the individual code pieces still needed to enter silo? I rarely nuke bc of this specific tedious point. Again thank you for info/help.
---
Mean, fun, just down right assholish, sure. But not spooky lmao
---
After so many years, with radiation destroying everything, to find material and paint in optimal conditions is very unlikely. Also, this just 100% goes against the overall feel of the game, and looks like a sims house.
---
The colossus does not get harder with more people in there.
---
Internet explorer is what is available for the xbox
---
I hope that's the case for me tomorrow.  I'm almost done with the season rewards.
---
Yes. It’s worth it.
---
Just today or multiple days?
---
Ooooh I love it! Sometimes these posts make me feel kind of uncreative haha. But as long as my camp has a little house in it, I’m fine with that (:
---
"march to your own beat. or waltz. or whatever. its your beat."
---
i love her quotes. XD
---
This is the first time it has messed up on me while staying on.
---
I 100% agree. I don't really care about immersion, I just suck at building. But the likeliness if being able to live outside of anything other than destroyed buildings seems unlikely to me
---
Agreed. I think people see meat piles and think that has to be the issue. But I am knee deep in meat piles after radiation rumble or guided meditation and I never see the issues I see from the Teslas.
---
If you use shotguns or melee weapons you can swap to heavy gunner at level 25 for the .50 cal or at 35 for the gatling gun
---
Me too lol
---
I’ll be happy to make one for you and give you the plan. Psn is Mack012166.
---
The nukes arent really realistic to begin with. Just one icbm could wipe out all of Appalachia
---
Exactly man :) Thank you
---
It would be nice to just have some consistency. If I picked a backpack that looks good with the jetpack and it only ever shows like half the time.
---
i gave up on that damn machine, and am back to just selling in my vendor for 1 cap each.  original version was borked, but atleast functional
---
No they actually didn’t stand up to the nukes.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Pulowski_Preservation_shelter#Characteristics
---
That is REALLY NICE!
---
That's rough! Don't give up. It's a Chilidog worth chasing;)
---
Love it. Where do you start when undertaking this complex design? Do you draw it out in real life or just start building and tweaking?
---
I don't know just thought it would be cool
---
Ah, whelp, there you go then, I stand corrected.  Have an upvote sir!
---
How do you get it? Completed the wendigo colossus event a few times now but I don't have that helmet? Is it a random reward?
---
"Server Connection Interrupted" is usually client side. "Server Not Responding" is server side.
---
I can't wait to see what that collectron will gather.
---
True freedom is having a choice whether or not to be naked power armor!
---
If you're with a crew that can genuinely do it and you've figured out how to stay alive, it's great fun.  Too intense for me to do twice in one day, though.
---
Thank you. Building and tweaking definitely! I started last night and my first couple of attempts went nowhere but eventually had something nice going and tweaked a lot along the way
---
Bots on parade is a guard the group of asaultrons an mr gutsies as modus programs them for recon happens at various botstops vendors 
---
Theres a make connections which ya go round adjusting dishes (3) to contact relay area info to the station in orbit it drops a supplies pod which you then have to take out enemies to claim 
---
The area effect bonbardment (dont remember the name) you go in adjust dishes (several of them) keep them repaired over heat bearings failing ect. from enemies swarming in once fully attuned you get clear an the station bombards the area killing near everything you may have to mop up one or two event done
---
The fissure site south of Whitesprings.
---
Thanks. The whole Pulaski protection is part of the dark humor of the Fallout world. The idea being that if you used one during a nuclear war, what rooks it really matter if it didn’t work. Society would be destroyed.
---
I run with an aa gatling gun and a furious fr25 .50cal the gatling gun hits 350 per headshot on scorchbeasts the .50cal hits around 120 on headshots
---
I don’t visit Berkeley that often so I’m not certain but there might be one or two there
---
THIS. IM ONLY OVERENCOMBERED WHILE WEARING MY POWER ARMOR
---
I use -20% armor weight legendary
---
I have a quad/ffr/vats cost tesla with an automatic mod, and it definitely drops the frames down to 2-3 fps in places like radiation rumble.  Outdoors and away from people it's not too bad.  Haven't tried it in ACP yet, because it's already laggy in there at times.
---
What weapons produce ash piles?
---
Yeah thanks to all the dupers out there lol.
---
Only today. And there's no way to fix it. I just lost a days worth of double dailies. As I'm sure many others did.
---
I remember in the Christmas event there would appear a lot of tier 3 legendary enemies
---
baited into pvp. lost 50 screws. exact words were “yeah we can go again let me just bank all this loot”. solo nuke run. dropped it dead on his base. thankfully dude was afk. my form of revenge
---
I haven’t done it enough to experience any afk people but a love that it is instanced, it’s made the lag a lot less for me and in general the event just looks better.
---
I'm sorry to hear this happened.     
---
Thanks for the warning.
---
Oh wow thank you I’ll send you a friend request
---
Take the core out of the frame and drop all your fusion cores and pick them back up.
---
LOL... i just got upset after constant bugs and crashes, i log in tonight to do the ONE quest i want to do, all the other crap is done, i want to get my Foundation Rep up and sure enough the game freezes when i fast travel... come back, foundation rep quest bugged, come back tomorrow lol.   
---
I'm just done, i quit before, i'm doing it again. Everything in this travesty is buggy, the quests, the map, group functionality, weapons, armor, you f'ing name it, even the atom shop weekly items are constantly f'ing bugged and i'm just done lol.
---
Yea I agree. The UI was bad at the beginning but they really didn’t seem to understand the complaints when they “improved it”.
---
I use both. 
---
I use sneak (bloodied) commando out of PA, and vampires Gatlings in PA. the perks are spread so that you can invest in both builds quite easily. 
---
I use the commando build for questing and heavy for bosses and silos etc
---
I mainly meant to make some unrusted tin cans, because you wouldn't be able to even pay me to use those rusted cans for my food.
---
I can agree. They gave us a lot of opportunities to catch up. The bug happened to me twice and I just finished the run today.
---
or salt to bring add more condition to it. a dehydrating smoker,  those are like 5000 years old
---
I think they should make all the refrigerators and freezers make the food permanently not spoil
---
Follow the main questline...
---
Did it 3 times and scaped, never saw it too, what does it contain?
---
But more experienced people say is better to stay and collect screws and fiberglass (these just to sell them), you can collect more than 200.
---
What is in the chest? I didn’t even know to look for it
---
I think this is a bug related to damage calculation and rubber banding/enemies regen- ing similar to FFR weapons but worse because your throwing several shots in an instant. 
---
May improve comparatively with the new damage calc update.
---
Thank you much appreciated
---
you know the sink has nothing to do with the plumbing right?
---
better off crafting for mods.. its that rare
---
Do you know where the holotape is?
---
depends on its sense of humor
---
I guess there's only so many times a roaches wedding ring can get stolen before shit gets real.
---
I’ve noticed on pc recently it’s gotten worse to the extend that it can take me sometimes 5-6 attempts to jump off a cliff in PA cause
---
I just teleport back to the top 😅😅
---
It’s the dumbest thing ever taking up my CAMP budget
---
I did not know that until now. I experienced this in radiation rumble so I thought it was an issue with lots of meat piles in indoor areas.
---
I would love a vendor with this function too!
---
It is scaled to the amount of players, if you do enough damage you can see a visible difference in the damage. Many of the fo76 events do this.
---
Amazing! I have been thinking of rebuilding my camp, and you have inspired me to take the leap and rebuild it. Great job!
---
If someone logs out they lose control of the workshop but the stuff stays there for some time after. You didn’t do anything wrong.
---
Thanks very much
---
You need to be a real life architect thats a great house
---
There probably are but you need some Luck to just get a mod on ultracite laser rifles
---
Holy shit I like that, what bundles were all involved in building?
---
So true
---
Sometimes I'll just jump up and down for hours for that deep vibration of the impact when I land.
---
I'd love to log in without constant bugs. Can we maybe work on those before we keep giving these clowns more atom shop ideas?
---
Check Atomic Shop they’re free for all players
---
Then after you start the quest, the first step is to collect 100 perfectly preserved pies from machines all over Appalachia.
---
Did these games ever explore M.R.E.s?
---
Meal Ready to Eat. 
---
Surprised there aren't a bunch of those lying around in a bunker somewhere.
---
Backpacks im ok with hiding.
---
IDK how i feel about hiding jetpacks, things are already ridiculous enough with half the playerbase able to jump 15 feet in the air. I dont really wanna see people flying without a visual reason to it.
---
Wrong sub. The trading one’s the one you’re after
---
Standing behind you for 20 fucking minutes while you “browse” , don’t complain about being one of the most annoying types of person in this game.
---
Would rather not be forced into using VATS all the time.  I have a scope on my rifle for a reason.  I have nothing against adding more for those who do use it but really they just need to up the damage per shot on the slow firing weapons.
---
Ok cool so now bad.  Just never know with online games . I feel anxious about doing the wrong thing or meeting other people. Like  earlier I opened a box and got a wanted label that meant players could PvP me and I didn't know what I did wrong till a player told me
---
It would be nice but I'd imagine it would have to be an offline mode. I've occasionally thought the same, or at least a peaceful creative mode that lets you build as normal without having to deal with being hungry, thirsty, not us, and whatever else the normal game throws at you when trying to build stuff.
---
All this QoL the community keeps asking for needs to cease until the bugs and stability are fixed in this absolute mess of a game. For 2 years iv'e watched you guys consistently ask for items and features that = DICK compared to the constant bugs and performance issues that have plagued this game from the jump.   
---
Part of why this garbage persists is because this community IS NOT serious enough about focusing on the core issues.
---
I only use it to exchange railroad spikes for the ammo I need. Less resources to make spikes, just steel.
---
Gatling plasma is easier to feed , ballistic ammo is a pain in the ass
---
Block+Server Hop
---
I hope not.  This would mean that lower levels who wish to play Rifleman would be screwed and earlier levels are often easier with non automatic weapons due to lack of ammo.
---
Boredom. Waiting for you to finish, probably, with a slight hope you may be loaded with junk with pacifist off. I mean, what else is he to do? He spent the caps to get there and wants to look.
---
At least the gunshots let you know someone is in fact in line behind you.
---
How else would you have known he was waiting, and becoming impatient? He communicated this to you.
---
You admitted yourself, you did not know someone was waiting until you exited the vendor. Maybe he thought you were indeed afk and he was trying to ascertain this by seeing if you would react?
---
Thanks man. Mostly just concrete, wood and steel with some atom shop items and wallpapers
---
No, that is simply not correct. Not a single event scales depending on the amount of people that joins it, the only changes is the amount of ads that spawn per wave. The stats remain the same.
---
For example, the Scorchbeast Queen has never scaled, she was buffed once which was a flat increase on her damage mitigation %. It's currently set at 70%.
---
Most people mistook the range = damage dropoff as the SBQ scaling, mainly due to alot of people standing on elevated surface with agro, which prevents her from landing, which prevents people from dealing full damage to her, Resulting in longer fights.
---
Earle does not scale, nor has he ever. Just like nothing else in the game scales in difficulty. It all has pre-set stats that does not change.
---

If you don't believe them - We can gladly help you get started on xedit so you can verify the information yourself. If you want an invite, drop me a PM and i'll send it to you.
---
This mansion doesnt belong in fallout
---
^ in action works the best. (Plus avoiding player based areas but hey :P)
---
It seems quite rare to find people who will straight out right PVP kill others in the normal 76 world. Generally the main combat in PVP will be contesting workshops.
---
Don't drink and play games, kids ;)
---
Really amazed at how clean everything looks
---
I have thought that some allies we can have at our camps could be "cleaned/washed" because at times I do think the dirty look does not quite fit the scene. Take above as a prime example.
---
Fallouts version of a brisk? LOL 😆😆😆
---
I can only recall two experiences that were especially creative, so here they are:
---
1. Went to a camp today that had a message written out at the front saying something like, "find all 6 hidden Mr. Fuzzys, send screenshots, win prizes" basically hosting a scavenger hunt at their camp. I found 4 before losing interest - but it was creative!
---
2. Another camp I went to had the vendors set up in a cave that was completely pitch black (don't know the location, but you dropped down in from the sidewalk or something but not in a glitchy way) and they had it set up like a planetarium with tons of mounted lightning bugs all over the walls of the cave. It was really cool. I hung out in there for five mins just enjoying the sensory experience. (The lightning bug mounts glow in the dark btw).
---
I think most people already moved over to Commando builds and only a few of us stubborn types are being affected.  Not enough people will speak out about this and so they will think everyone is ok with it and nothing will be done.
---
Every time I post there it says post wrong format so I figured I’d put it here
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14l9A4WzsnNnSoI4WM6PKFFcun396abvYcHrf7z8WVW4/edit#gid=0
---
I actually kinda like it. I totally understand why most people loathe it but as I rarely have anything other than explosives to throw in it I don't find it such a hassle and it does actually operate like every other terminal so fits in.
---
The top one for me. A camp made out of bear skin rugs to create spiraling ramps that each ended with various things, like a stash box, a crafting bench or just a statue. It was pretty amazing.
---
The second was a strip club. They had stripper poles and everything!
---
I have a Gatling plasma it dosent do enough damage and a gatling laser
---
This is why I avoided power armor in 4 as well. Your cool armor perks didn’t mean shit.
---
Even if it had mutants, it usually wouldn't have a behemoth. Used to be an extremely rare spawn there. I know even post-wastelanders this wasn't the case, it must have been the latest update. Hell, it feels like it could have been specifically the colossal problem activation that caused it because after the latest major patch it still wasn't happening
---
Oh hell yes. What a brilliant idea.
---
hopefully it is energy ammo like fusion cores, 2mm EC and fusion cells
---
Idk but im as curious as well
---
Go have a chat with one of MODUS' terminals, I forget which one.
---
This. Even if you have the charisma of Ward on a bad day it's still worth investing the caps over trying to loot them.
---
It was really cool and I’m hoping I *might* be able to set my camp up there
---
Items we get from the donor boxes probably lol
---
huh, sucks, thanks anyway
---
Spruce Knob Lake. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Spruce_Knob_Lake
---
It’s On PTS now, there’s a new location for blue ridge carven named blue ridge carven “ office “
---
Also Tree Village being settled down by villagers
---
I'd really like sited information, I'm basing this off of personal experiance. I've been in fights with the same crew of 4 players, with and without an additional 4 players, and each time we have defeated the colossus faster as a group of 4 than as a group of 6 to 8. If my xbox was connected to my PC I would take the time to record this but as it is this argument is not worth my time moving my PC to the living room or vice versa.
---
Try fighting him on a personal server, or build a heavy gun bloodied build and watch his life drain. There is a visible difference in damage dealt.
---
Well, what crazy things did you think they were made of?
---
So next patch we all get a vault where it will be our own instance and we can build whatever we want and have way more building budget and everything so hopefully it will be something like what you’re hoping for
---
If someone is impatient and does that to me, I'll wait a little longer, then kill them with explosive bait while they are shopping, and take their bag if they drop one.  Patience is a virtue.
---
All hail Roachor!
---
or better yet - the same scrap that we donated...
---
If slow firing weapons were on par with automatics, there would be no reason to use automatics given their increased resource consumption.
---
I don’t really see a slow firing weapon being end-game viable without some kind of fancy VATS Crit build, unless something with massive resource consumption arrives, like needing a crap ton of gunpowder and steel to create ammunition for a 20mm anti-material rifle round that isn’t feasible for handheld automatic use given recoil.
---
He told me it's because I unlocked a box that belonged to a player and it puts a bounty on me for doing so . He did give me a bunch of loot to say sorry for killing me
---
My friend you are doing gods work
---
Anytime!
---
If that's the case itd just be cloth- what it took to get him (pre war money, clothes with no value, etc.)
---
Would you still want it if it works the same as the ammo converter?
---
Mine is in the middle of the map and on an acid deposit so handy for fast travel hopping to save caps and I always have 10 acid ready when I visit it
---
They could do the exact same thing to you while you are shopping, what an idea.
---
You know, I figured it would maybe be made out of.. wait for it... Lead. lol
---
Last night I went to fight earl on Xbox and two guys at the fight had Tesla’s and nothing happened like everyone is describing
---
Thank you for the information we figured out what was the problem we forgot to check Abby's terminal about fort defiance
---
I was on a holotape hunt awhile ago when I discovered that area. It’s one of those locations that no missions lead you to. Maybe it will see some traffic when the Brotherhood content lands.
---
That sounds cool as hell
---
To put it this way, me and my friend kill earle in about a minute and a half, with a full team, it usually takes longer because the other people arent sneaking, resulting in us dealing less damage due to them messing with out sneak modifiers.
---
As i mentioned, we have the info available at the datamine discord, you are more than welcome to join, if not we're a public discord so you can find us via the discovery tab.
---
And once again, i can reassure you that no mob scales, this is based on what the game actually tells us, and loads of personal experience in soloing/duoing/lowmanning both earle + the SBQ on public and private servers, including the PTS.
---
Only if they add botulism
---
Sounds like itd be cool. Next time i play im hunting for this.
---
Cool!  That seems to cover the outfits.  How about plans?
---
It's kinda rare I got it once and have done the event 8 times
---
It's an ingame joke, they faked the weight of lead by filling a steel pipe with concrete.....
---
K, thanks.
---
Get some combat armor and make it reinforced and it just looks perfect
---
How dare you reply with a reasonable and logical answer that could very well be true.
---
We all know that player was obviously a raging dbag and deserves to be banned.
---
What is your build?
---
Steel Dawn it’s just 4-5 Quest , you meant Fractured Steel
---
Also charleston capital building, the burrows, riding shotgun event  and monster mash event
---
Cuz you're not doing the format right you just post it on the wrong page where it will be deleted? Smort!
---
Just because Ghouls don't fit Bethesda narrative we are made to hide and lerk in fear as you 'non evolves' (smoothskins) mock and ridicule us!
---
the hunting of the ghouls for spots is an atrocity and must stop! 
---
Continue to speak truth to power Legendary Ghoul we are with you!
---
Good news! Someone else found it
---
It’s spruce knob lake right below foundation
---
There's a mod for that on nexus mods
---
Blocked you ingame. Blocking you here. Also reported you for harrassing and inapropriate name, you know why, hope you get banned.
---
It would be nice definitely! From what I could understand about the fishing shack is that it seems like the raiders quest line brings you here but I couldn’t be sure as I never did that one myself
---
Used to have a lead and acid extractor in the same camp. Even came with a decent hillside view. The only problem was that the resource veins forced me to build off of a cliff so I couldn't build traditionaly.
---
they did fix it on console too
---
any update?
---
I see slow firing weapons as being better on smaller enemies but on harder to kill ones then auto weapons would be best.
---
If you're melee only then don't bother.
---
I don't know why you think he "just wanted to see my reaction" or "check if I was afk". Why isn't the fact that he was an inpatient kid an option? Also, he ASAP took the shop 1 sec after so no, it wasn't that. Also, there was a guy here in the comment talked shit about my 2 min browsing as if it was "20" min and called me the most boring person in the game or something, so there you have your answer.
---
Here a map to help you find a girlfriend 
---
https://soulmatesystem.com/how-to-find-a-girlfriend/
---
Gatling Flamethrower... what even... how would that... I think my brain just exploded
---
This sounds SO MUCH better and player friendly than what we got. Like you said, indeed because it's player friendly and not a frustrating grind, it would never have happened.
---
only if when you hide jetpack, you get jetboots
---
Or maybe report them to Bethesda instead of trying to start a witch hunt?
---
But then you couldn’t have the switch in another room to keep people from turning it off and on
---
Goes great with the Tattered Field Jacket, or Camo Jumpsuit.
---
Not the Raiders quest line, I’m sure of that, but the Wiki notes that the Tadpole Scout swimming badge occurs there. I did that mission just once a year ago and didn’t think to explore at the time. Glad you found it by chance, it’s a cool spot!
---
it has caps, stims, and some other stuff.
---
Not everytime. Usually the game teleport me to a random place and i get no rewards
---
I’m with you 100%
---
... Really?
---
But then people would complain that it’s a lazy reskin if they didn’t change the way the character plays, the dialogue you hear from all the characters you talk to etc. If they didn’t go all-in on it, people would carp all over it.
---
Yes yes. Set  equipped armor weight to zero and lose all effects would be fine if they're worried about people double dipping. That way you can quickly switch playstyles. Like in other fallouts id switch to power armor for hefty fights but use regular armor for perk and special bonuses.
---
What pheasant map area?
---
Thanks you guys I was ahead of myself in the Quest and needed to go back to Riverside and start it correctly.  
---
Thanks for both of your help I found the Analysts Terminal
---
