Nah, you getting mad and insulting me for having the money to be able to afford $13 a month is laughable. How is it a scam when I know exactly what I‚Äôm getting? A private server away from you lunatic fucks and my own stash I can hoard a shitton of material... while you can‚Äôt. Oh it feels good man... ya broke ass.

At least on PC, there is no reason why we can't just remove the daily scrip limit.  Getting a god roll means jack when everyone else has a cryolator beam splitter minigun monstrosity that kills anything, and legendary modules just get duped/sold/spawned out of thin air.
---
It hasn't, still an issue for all unarmed weapons. Not aware of any melee that it affects though
---
all the games nowadays are going belly up, huh?
---
76 Vault City build by community over time? Why not
---
Yea one time I was talking to myself and I hadn't realized. I think I said my balls itch and a guy on my team messaged me and said "we can hear you mateüòÇ" I quit and left
---
Do you mean melee as in 1h/2h melee, or unarmed? We've known that unarmed weapons are still affected by this, but I thought the regular "melee" melee weapons were fixed
---
Only 1 of my characters doesn't use it, and that's only because legendary armor effects are far better for VATS than PA. I'm good with the legendary armor/CSA/PA balance we have right now.

---
I'm not good with the odds of crafting legendary armor. It's a reminder that Todd hates all his children.

---
No.  They have a static spawn point.
---
They imagined dupers making 400 individual items at a time. And that is precisely why the scrip limit and weight limit are in place. Literally designed for that exact situation that OP willingly put themselves into
---
No, they are not rare. 50 caps in vending machine would be about right.
---
The optimal thing to do is to still have 3 players collect the ore and then just have them turn it in just before the timer is over, you get both the enemy loot and the better loot pool for the event reward but nobody seems to realize that.
---
There‚Äôs nothing there what are you talking about?

Spin up a minigun then burn them with the barrel! Of course you also fire that ammo at the wall, to burst their eardrums too!

Since lvl 50 or smth I'm using a Bloody Pump Action Shotgun and I was able to 1 Shot the ghouls at guided Meditation. I'm running around with full Hp, what I noticed is, if you are right in Front of an enemy and there's no way that bullets miss, it can't 1shot. But in vats it destroys everything
---
Yep it works for golf balls.
---
There‚Äôs really nothing anyone can do to you while you‚Äôre shopping. They‚Äôre either just being weird/creepy or perhaps, looking at something your character is wearing or carrying. Sometimes you need to get a funny angle to see things, which could be an innocent explanation.

Legendary effect. Now, I'm not certain how much of an influence on the results it has but most the medics shotguns I have came from Hogwarts. I can say lower damage weapons definitely have a much lower effect though.

Bro, whered you get the time to type out a 4 year long book? Or is it stuff that is in the game?
---
These are stretch goals for bonuses, not proper events outright and certainly not the full extent of the Fortifying Atlas events.
---
I dont know why it isnt 20 Legendary modules and 100 vault steel...
---
No problem. Hopefully they will do a tent for you sometime. I would bet BoS ones are coming. They haven't had a tent skin since those ones.
---
Modus' personality and the Enclave's experiments are much too reminiscent of a certain contemporary politician. I prefer the good old military approach of the BOS.
---
They clearly aren‚Äôt overburdened with legendary armor they have to mod to ultra-light just to fit in their stash(es).
---
Right, but you shouldn't have to be forced to level up the adventure mode character, then be forced to level up the NW character.
---
So it heals based off of damage dealt from VATs criticals?
---

This is just Volume 2, Volume 1 was twice as long.
---
I logged on this afternoon, worked at getting my dailies, tried to find some events to deal with, but the only things that were showing up were a handful of Defend Workshop where even the workshop owner wasn't present. Even The Messenger, which is running nearly 37 hours out of every day, was nowhere to be seen.
---
I lucked out after a few hours of gameplay to find Radiation Rumble start up, so I hurried over there. One guy camped on the roof of the decon structure with what I guess was a Gauss shotgun and kept shooting everything that came in from the tunnels, while I was left to roam them all by myself to try to collect ore and defend myself and the scavengers. Ended with less than half the ore collected.
---
From that point on, I did not see another event until I signed off. This is the problem - for some reason, events are not spawning or running at their normal frequency. There should be something happening all the time, so that when I wrap one thing up, another is ready for me to go.
---
B...but how...

She is hard to kill, but there are plenty of workarounds for this. Plus she can never be harder to kill than for 8 players who are playing the game properly(as that is the max for a private server). 
---
As for builds, don‚Äôt know why they haven‚Äôt made some of the easier bug fixes. Some of them I know it‚Äôs been discussed would are pretty deep into the perk card system and Bethesda just doesn‚Äôt feel the need to devote the man hours to problems that don‚Äôt directly affect other ppl.
---
It‚Äôs hard to say how hard these problems are to fix without talking directly with someone from their team, but my guess is that their game engine has just been torn apart and put back together too many times for a lot of their new assets and algorithms to work as expected. Just way too much ambition without the willingness to sink the time or money into making the project meet their expectations.
---
Yes! And having it timegated will also make a lot of us even less likely to keep doing the grind if they add more plans with the BoS faction because eventually it will be too much to catch up on.
---
I already got a beret during Fasnacht, and I will keep my junk. I agree w OP, that amount of junk would have to form a new ‚Äúmega-metropolis‚Äù

I'm not willing to give my hard earned scrap up either.  I'll be happy to farm some as the event goes along.  But im taking my current scrap through to the afterlife.

lol it's so weird you mention that, I literally just found those dumpsters a few days ago after a year of playing. I took a pic of the Mr. Handy sweeping up the area.

This will not happen. While it would be nice, don't expect any new "licensed" music.  And Bethesda are too lazy to find and add "public domain" music.

I believe so. I tried an ultracite auto pistol which was completely unnoticeable despite being a high luck, 4 leaf build. Tried a 44 which was a bit better but still not great. Dumbledore's shotty, on the other hand, will completely heal even from the brink of death.

This is super helpful. I know cutting fluid will be dreadful. But I'll end up doing.
---
Progress in this game is very subjective, though. For example, I wouldn't say any of the current limits restrict my daily progress. I stop playing after the daily challenges because there's no real content. The game desperately needs new activities and quests. Getting a perfectly rolled item doesn't mean anything if you have no use for it.
---
Clearly.

Huh. I also forget if it's a 1 or 3* weapon

Really? I hope not. I am using it to make trades but also gathering Intel. I'll get what I can in the mean time!

I have a non explosive bloodied one I bought and then tonight fighting queen she dropped another bloodied one. The automatic piston gives it the best damage even more damage then ultrice ammo. Only gun that does that. Crappy thing is I wasn‚Äôt explosive. Would‚Äôve been perfect. Went to purveyor to spend the 200 scrip I had then I got the 250 scrip from battle pass. First drop was bloodied omg. Not explosive which sucks but amazing none the less. Then I thought oh shit I‚Äôm going to get lucky like I did two weeks ago. Got two ghoul guns which stick then a furious explosive hunting rifle which is good also. But sorry got off topic. But if you can‚Äôt craft automatic piston I can if you‚Äôre on Xbox. My bloodied does 480 but furious I think is almost 300 damage
---
I'd agree with you, but the devs should always assume players will perform the task that grants the most rewards. It's mmo building 101
---
Just like how everyone is making build and events teams for the exp, or how people only nuke like 2 spots on the map constantly. The other options don't give an equal reward so they're largely ignored by the community.
---
Yes it would be nice if random people on the internet would just contribute to the event and work as a team, but it would also be nice if the devs designed the event to encourage players to work together.
---
I swear i saw someone wearing the green and yellow one before but i may be wrong

I actually have to stop playing if I reach the cap limit. I eat canned dog food with the good doggy perk so if I can‚Äôt sell my perishable goods, they just spoil. Wouldn‚Äôt really bother my but selling meats and chems are a huge portion of my income
---
Because the level of your adventure mode character means nothing beyond your special point allocation limit.  You don't do more damage, you don't get better guns or armor, you don't have level locked perks.  You also don't directly level your NW character in a way that unlocks special points.  The reason the current system exists I suspect is because of technical limitations.
---
BoS?

It says you have to pay but it doesn‚Äôt take anything I‚Äôm on Xbox

Yeah I always use to right out of power armor and stuff so when I would die it would put me in nuke and I had seconds to get something on before I died. But I would be over weight because I had all weight reduction armor. But now that I transferred a ton of my stuff even tho it‚Äôs building up again I just use power armor or Chinese stealth suit so when I die and it send me to the nuke zone I won‚Äôt be in a constant death loop
---
Well there is always hope

And that‚Äôs why I said, make a character for NW.

Ironically, in this case the solution to achieving equality with your husband is to get back in the kitchen?

Yes there is a way, you have volume options under settings to make your game silent and your speakers can also be turned off.
---
Not always as the second workshop I attempted to take over would demonstrate.
---
I'm a bit meta, I get more damage reduction from repositioning than tanking a hit or two. Faster outside of armor, which means faster farming, faster clears, more loot. You also parkour easier and for into smaller holes. Only thing i use it for is a babysuit for my lowbies or for my heavy gunner if i feel like doing sbq for plans (is you don't learn them you can farm them, or pick and choose which ones are in the pool by learning the ones you don't want) though  I do allways keep full excavator for fast travel/grabbing nuked flora.

There have been plenty of threads here about it.  The consensus is that stagger perks like one gun army cause here to reset her landing cycle, and that if you have her attention and are on a tent or fence, and she lands, she tends to take off quickly.

This explains the rip Galen memorial set up I saw in someone's camp. I didn't know who Galen was! I thought it was just something a player set up for their own cat or just a cat they had tamed in game and left a bunch of stuff. Poor kitty.

I was curious why they would want cork, so I looked up what it‚Äôs useful for. Apparently it‚Äôs good for both waterproofing and fireproofing, so I imagine they‚Äôll use it in both base construction and defences against the Scorched? It‚Äôs also buoyant so maybe they wanna make boats? (Though the rivers aren‚Äôt so amazing to justify it I guess)

Fast travel to workshops you own is also free on PC. It's just a visual error, you're not really charged for it.

Can I ask why?

I won a round without firing a shot or even seeing another player. Final circle ended up in Morgantown, shrunk so small I couldn't fit all the way inside it. The other guy must have gotten stuck inside of a building because I never even saw him. Or her

Man I feel bad for ppl that would leave a server or walk the whole way thinking they had to actually pay. Everytime this post comes up I say it doesn‚Äôt take the money. I think first time I saw it it showed like 17 caps and I was like oh well screw it. But then noticed my caps where the exact same. I said well at least it‚Äôs just a visual bug
---
Its tied to a quest which, it sounds like, you have not started yet while your friend has.
---
All i know is what i've seen and experienced with my own two eyes. 
---
The smoothest queen fight i ever had was myself and 4 other people. I fast travelled to the event and straight away i noticed none of them were shooting. They were stood in wide open space. The tents were out and but were off to the side. The queen landed straight away. We blasted away and took a good chunk of health off. She took off. We killed the minions and then we waited. Not a single shot while she was in the air. She landed after like 20 seconds. Same again. She was dead within 5 minutes. I don't think a single shot was fired at her in the air.
---
He doesn't have any quest
---
Just play with the settings and see if you notice it disapear without getting rid of anything else. I remeber i got tired of fasnact on like day 1 so i just cranked down the effects and blasted my pipboy radio all week. Unfortunately that got rid of gunshots and enemy sounds so that sucked
---
Again, it's laughable that you think I'm broke. That you think it's acceptable to pay for a game that requires a subscription to allow you privilege of paying more to access the game you already paid for, is asinine. Bernie Madoff would've taken all of your money. 
---
If you're trying to show off your wealth, bragging about lighting $13 on fire on reddit is a pathetic way to do it. You can afford to get ripped off for that paltry amount, so can I. Difference is I'm not dumb enough to actively do it to myself.

That would be a good idea that could be slowly added over time to make all events better.

I got handmade of both.  Its on my alt so its mostly super badly hunting but I use my Fffr over my aaffr or aae about 70/30 of the time. I keep one rank in tank killer.

You would think they'd be cheaper if they were duped, but they're not. Despite previous replies, the cost wasn't going down, and people are paying real money for them. That's just what I said. That's what I've always said. Tell me the market rate for B2525 fixers is significant cheaper than it was before, I'm gonna ask for evidence. I haven't seen it. 30k-50k? People are still paying this much, for a weapon that by all accounts isn't very rare anymore.
---
AA is max 28.8% increased damage (if the target has enough armor to penetrate)
---
Furious is 45% increased damage (at max 9 stacks each doing +5%)
---
For non-bosses that die from one or two shots AA usually would be better. But as for bosses that take a little while to kill, Furious is an better option. Also, dropping Tank Killer because of AA is not the best thing to do, as the penetration effects stack (but they are multiplicative, not additive).
---
What's the battle pass system?
---
I keep hearing people mention this but haven't seen anything in-game about it. Do I have to complete Wastelanders first?
---
So a JE the dragon is a legacy?
---
Sure... I mean, they all are not that "great" :'D, but I like collecting them. (And you can build one in each workshop). Once you buy it, it will "unlock" choices at collection terminal, so you can always use the one you like, and set it to collect what you want.
---
Sadly yes if your lucky to find a solo spawn creature in a random encounter and it‚Äôs legendary yeah you can get one
---
worst i can think of is walking in front of people that use explosive weapons so they die then take their loot

I dont think the nuke thing is true but tell me if I'm wrong

The handful of times that I have downed an opponent that has downed me at the same time. I've won a handful of times and usually with only one kill, my aim has gotten better in the last year, however I feel like I get crappy guns half the time. Saw a player with a big shiny Gatlin gun with a huge drum and he was one shotting everyone, have never seen that gun again. The toxic player that yells at his team when we weren't right behind him and gets taken out as well as the players that steal every box right out from under all of their team.
---
You know what, I wrote this post when I was angry. I think I am simply going to not do this daily from now on for my own mental health. Similar to how I skip the 'kill X creatures in NW' dailies.
---
The reset is 22 hours after you buy bullion or scrip, which can be annoying for people with limited time to play, as they can miss out on a day of bullion or scrip. As you can see changing the reset to the daily reset would all around help and resolve alot of frustration in the community. Sorry for not including that in the post I'm at work so kinda rushed it out.
---
Nooo! At least he's immortalized in game, I'll have to put one of his paintings up in my camp.

No :O
---
Yeah probably. I don't think the Communist collectron is going to come back anytime soon.
---
This all the way. There isn‚Äôt much in the way of things to do once you‚Äôve gotten through the quests. This forces things to slow down. You have to keep coming back to try and get that thing you want. Unfortunately nothing they implemented was/is worth the amount of grind they‚Äôre asking from me, so I stopped doing most of it. I honestly haven‚Äôt turned in Treasury Notes in over a month
---
I am not 100% sure but I am pretty sure grabbing that from the corpse will let you in. Hope that helps!

Ya know this shit really happens in the military
---
If you've been been playing long enough, your own weapon is about the only threat left in the wasteland.
---
If you run solo, outside of events, instigating is one of my favorites. even on commando. That first shot, doing double damage, on top of sneak damage, on top of vats crit damage.
---
Yeah the other day there was 3 people on the fence  in my lobby and she landed no problem
---
All testing is done with eye witness accounts, with small sample size. Nobody has calculated ‚Äútime to land‚Äù or come up with a solid algorithm.  So this is a good idea. But might take away from the ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù process of playing an open world rpg
---
It was never a static spawn, it had a chance to be there. I haven't tried searching for it for a long while but it would be odd to remove it.

I've heard some great stuff from public teams I've been on. One was 3 super high levels who were obviously all RL friends and voice chatting together. It was like a private group but they went public instead. One guy started playing a, I think, ukulele while singing I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire. 
---
Another group had 2 guys join at the same time. One asked the other about a 3rd guy and where he was and got told "He had diarrhea and decided to stop playing and go sit on the toilet for a while" lol.

oh I thought the people who all their members got killed by a mad AI said something. Ad Victoriam

I just want a laugh emote. I'm a lvl 100. Got to a queen fight, and 3 people turned toward me. 1 shot at me. And then they all gave thumbs down and other "no" type signs. I really needed to uproariously laugh in their faces.

It‚Äôs weird but I feel like fallout 76,  a game with an age rating of 18+(UK) is almost made more child friendly due to the younger player base

It‚Äôs funny you said that, I remember seeing it saying ‚ÄúLead ore collected‚Äù and thought thats funny I should be getting 4 at the beginning of it...but thought I was just wrong.

It's got the magic effect and it's over 200 fire rate so deffo demand high for it.
---
That's a pretty good weapon. If your character has no use for it, I'd suggest trading for something you'd actually use.
---
Yes, if you can get the fire rate a little higher through mods, the limb damage is one of the "magic" effects that lets high RoF heavy weapons kill the SQB in a only a couple of minutes

How exactly are you trying to make your character that it's been such an issue?

Have the card, just don't have the points yet. Currently using iron clad and adamantium skeleton.
---
So I did a bit of thinking and these are the suggestions I could come up with, hope it helps and feel free to ask any more questions you have, sorry that it turned out a bit long.
---
**So assuming you would use mutations I'd change the following:**  
---
\- add three in strength for traveling pharmacy because chems are really heavy unless you get the backpack mod for it, then use barbarian instead
---
\- to do this remove bodyguard as well as four points of charisma as you can get better value with barbarian
---
\- I would recommend removing healing hands seeing as bloodied builds are very common and that perk kind of fucks them over if you revive them, instead add strange in numbers
---
\- additionally I would add one point in intelligence for chemist, though you could also use it elsewhere and just swap chemist in when needed
---
\- for luck I would remove grim reapers sprint in favor of either three ranks of class freak or one rank of class freak and two of starched genes if you have trouble managing mutations
---
As a note I would probably go for the herbivore mutation and use things like company tea for AP as the regeneration you get from those is very significant
---
**If you don't want to use mutations:**
---
\- you may still want to remove grim reapers sprint in favor of pharma farmer as you have AP regenerating armor, which should compensate plenty, especially when you aren't anything like boss fights
---
\- again remove bodyguard in favor of 3 in strength but instead of removing four charisma just remove 3 the three and go for spiritual healer at rank 2 by once again removing healing hands unless you never revive bloodied characters
---
**General note:**
---
You might want to consider switching your weapon type to pistols so you can get away with investing more into agility for the larger action point pool
---
I guess I'm a creature of habit and play at same time so it doesn't matter.  Alt before work.  Main while I'm waiting for the baby to wake up at night.  I feel you!
---
Learn to jump and shoot or kill them before they get near you
---
They were only available right after wastlanders
---
It's all I do now. If we lose that's fine, but I'm hella not sitting and killing shit. I want that barrel
---
What are you enjoying most about FO4?
---
I'll sneak in there and leave something random on the floor just to let them know someone was there.
---
Can we never have seasons again? If the atoms rewards give us too many then lower them or something. But they don‚Äôt give us too many.
---
I'm always using up my Cork to ultra light armor I can't scrip yet!
---
Didn't work for me =( i've tried like a week ago and will try again after tuesday patch
---
Don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself. 
---
üòé
---
*Bunker Buster* is unique as well, it has a 5 star effect that increases damage by 20% or something. Same with *Civil Unrest*, which has an effect that increases AP by 10.
---
To be fair, I‚Äôve done everything in the game except all this time gated crap, and none of it is worth the grind asked from me, so I gave up and stopped. I haven‚Äôt turned in treasury notes in about a month and I stopped rolling scrip or turning it in. I just drop items I don‚Äôt want. It‚Äôs not fun. I just play the daily challenges then get off
---
Are you kidding the whole legendary perk system is one giant level up challenge.  You realize that right?
---
I keep a secondary weapon handy that's good for close up and when I dodge I go to the side either left or right first then shoot.
---
Perfect for the dude who just watched from the roof of a shack as I barely made it through 6 huge ghouls. 
---
Thanks for your help jerkass.
---
I only have so much time to spend on games. And si ce FO76 isn't showing any respect for that I've been doing other things. Sadly.
---
Seems about the same as leveling a 250 for me.  Maybe a little bit faster.  But I think leveling in NW as a low level is definitely faster.
---
yeh sounds like a bug neither of you can enter until you e got the card or done the quest
---
To be honest that would kind of remove the only downside to explosive weapons, as them not being useable in close quarters is their only weakness.
---
Though I guess that would help the traditional explosives like the grenade launchers and the like a bit in not being utterly useless.
---
[deleted]
---
It should not be one during a public event.  That's just stupid.
---
I do but if you're in a corner or something it doesn't always work though. Everyone knows that some of those enemies run up on you pretty fast, especially if you're fighting multiples.
---
Lol, rocking some new legacies?  Be wary of vats in tight quarters
---
What I tend to do is run through killing all the enemies in my actual armor then swapping to excavator and collecting after all the enemies are dead
---
Heart emote. 
---
This is the best use of pettiness.

You are a true hero.

It's all a part of Beth's awful game design choices. And poeple are surprised they don't test cosmetics

It is too small, unfortunately. I tried it last night.
---
I love all the event except the death flower one. They each have there own funnes like some are relaxing some are stressful.
---
Need help launching first Nuke. I‚Äôm a level 50 and have hardly and good weapons or ammo at all.
---
I just checked. It‚Äôs there. Go through the door on the right, and immediately inside turn to your right. It‚Äôs on a small bookcase next to a couple of cigar boxes and an ashtray.
---
[Take a look](https://imgur.com/gallery/hXhfd4g)
---
What are they actually worried about by uncapping everything? That people will play their game longer?
---
Why should he be punished?
---
Workshops are the only dedicated PVP zone one the game. You aren‚Äôt entitled to sit on the workshop and get those resources uncontested.
---
So, making them rarer somehow helps? 
---
They are everywhere right now. Just because no one is selling them for caps (which are inherently worthless) does not mean the prices haven‚Äôt gone down.
---
Yea, not really gonna go for a mutation.
---
As for the chemist perk, I was planning on getting it, along with a few other perks, but didn't show them on the perk build because they won't always be active. The perks in the list I posted would be almost always active unless crafting or whatever
---
Right üòÇ
---
Time to build a Galen memorial
---
Word.  Don't bother with fireproof,imo. Nothing can protect you from yourself.
---
We had Grahm help with a fasnacht once or twice.
---
After saying that, I want a SBQ plushie now. We have Mothman (technically backpack, but still) and Sheepsquatch , why not other baddies?
---
Any notes on my suggestions not related to mutations?
---
Nobody puts baby in the corner
---
Get a private server. That's the solution they put for you
---
Just open your map and FT to the bunker
---
You don't actually stan the Enclave, do you?
---
Exactly this. It's literally the only "true" PvP in the game so just take it back. When ever I take a workshop for dailies I put up signs that say just here for score. I don't care if it was someones or not cause that how the game works. If you want to keep it right for it. If your that concerned with it get FO1st and farm on a private server
---
So we have 4 days to gather the 200,000,000 cork, which at a rate of 340,000 tons per year means it would take almost 3 days to produce that much cork in the real world.
---
Where is Appalachia getting this much cork.
---
I never knew this cat was a thing.
---
Now I know, and I know it's dead
---
Thanks Reddit. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I'll have to look them over real quick, I did also think of doing a pistol build with the laser gun and the beam splitter mod
---
Full Star Bloody Mess Perk, 
---
3 Star Adrenaline and 3 Star Action Girl
---
9 Star of Full heavy weapon perks. 
---
These were the one that I have using Plasma Caster.
---
And also you need to have unyielding armor. Any parts will do. It'll boost everything except END
---
I struggle to grasp/understand this problem.  Unless I'm only in scavenge mode (and farming lots of plastic), I tend to level up by accident in about 2.5-3 hours of playing.  Semi-seriously, (throwing in some West-Tek and DMV runs) I level in about an hour.  
---
Sure - it's not something you can hop in and finish in 10 minutes (on a max level character).  But... is that really a bad thing?  
---
My only thought/suggestion would perhaps to be to add some small exp gain from scavenging somehow.  Just like there is from crafting food.
---
Then why are 90% of players still on top of tents and fences?? üò°
---
üòÇ
---
Take a shot every time you scroll past a post about cork.
---
I‚Äôm not saying that a person shouldn‚Äôt be able to do it but if I get a bounty for picking a lock in a camp than why is it ok to jack a whole workshop.     Any area is open for PVP if two people wanna go at it
---
Children of Atom all the way! Glory to Atom!
---
How about a "clash of the cults" dlc? Mothman and CoA cults
---
Adrenaline junkie? The perk? What good does it do? What about action boy/girl?
---
Take a screenshot and upload to Imgur. Post Imgur link.
---
I did and do.
---
Yeah, it's really not too bad. If anything it gets harder to find a way to maintain all the legendary drops you start getting with all the daily caps. Leader of the pack is a very easy challenge.
---
One or the other would inevitably find out one way or another.
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
It‚Äôs so annoying
---
So a person should have to have fallout 1st. Cuz this happened a lot recently because if legendary run cjallenges
---
It's a glitch they STILL haven't fixed. ALl the Prime recievers for the new Bullion weapons do NOT teach you their respective ammo types.
---
Beats 5 per day, like some people think, haha
---
And what would a Food build like yourself do with this bounty? The person taking your workshop would obviously wipe the floor with you, or you would just defend the shop against them. No, you want your buddies to be able to gang up on honest PvPers.
---
Saw 896 today on pc.  Idk if this thread still going
---
How about as an easy weekly challenge instead
---
Haven't seen it. There's a bigger atom shop figurine that has come around a few times, more of a small statue, like a 18 inches tall maybe.
---
Are they challenges or easygoings
---
It's a one-time reward from a specific quest afaik. So not legacy, just only 1 per character
---
But not all places have continuous water. There's more bushes and debries to hide in than water on average, at least thats what I found. 
---
What are you doing different that makes water better? Just giving up on matches where the circle doesn't work for you?
---
Eh. Don't give up. Get smarter. There's a million places to find legendaries; just go to the less common ones.
---
That's good info, thanks! That's exactly where I was, exploring an area I hadn't been to yet.  I guess I will go by there more often to see who else pops up!
---
Don‚Äôt have buddies just me and myself out here. I‚Äôll battle you for it cuz of principle but I‚Äôd rather not. Just wanna extract some lead in peace.
---
Then say, "What's up with the nuclear waste?"
---
I never realized how little cork I had until this event.  (I've had fallout first since I started - so I've always saved all my scrap.  Without it - I wouldn't have lasted 3 days in the game.)
---
I pay attention to things like screws, gears, acid - because I've ran out of those in the past.  Cork?  Was never low on it - so never really noticed.  
---
3,000 gears;  1200 nuclear waste.  Acid?  3900.  
---
But only 1100 cork.  
---
Steel on the other hand?  65k.  That one wont' be a problem .
---
Cool. Did not think of a beam splitter for the ultracite. I didn't think of pellet amounts being the defining factor but at least now I know. Funny we still came to the same result though.
---
Why were you downvoted for helping?
---
less than that. I nearly annihilated her in 10 seconds when I tried out one right before wastelanders... and it wasn't a Bloodied version either. A bloodied magic weapon? Yeeeeesh.
---
Yeah I saw that when I was trying to search for this figurine. I'm guessing they just downsized that model to put it on the desk. It would be nice to have that smaller version as well even if it was an atom shop item.
---
You say that like Super Mutants are intrinsically evil, which they (almost) all are in the world of Bethesda's lazy writing
---
I totally agree with this, the game is already expensive as it is, why is there a fucking paid membership that you need to have more junk? Why is there even a cap on the stashed in the first place? Are they worried that all that junk is going to lag the already shitty and bug filled servers?
---
Action Girl/Boy for quick AP regeneration since I use V.A.T.S with my PC alot. Adrenaline perk add up more damage everytime you one shot. If you don't like it, change it to Covert Operative. Sneak attack gives you more damage.
---
How did you find this?
---
I have a bloodied Gauss minigun with bash and it shreds her in like a minute but I do tend to accidentally hit another limb
---
I am Enclave, but I am infiltrating the BoS to takeover. üòá
---
He certainly spooked the bejeezus out of me!
---
I started tonight as well after I started speccing a teammate.
---
One game later I player walks into grafton dam....walks...with a gauss shotgun.
---
This would be ok if you could walk in the game underwater which you can't and you can't fire a weapon under water either.
---
Seriously not once have I done the mouse over on Xbox unreal amount of help there man, lifesaver ! So annoying on these at times!

---
Either start carrying a backup that‚Äôs non-explosive, or learn to move away from what you‚Äôre shooting before pulling the trigger. That‚Äôs about all there is to it.
---
That's just the way it is. What do you even use them for? Workshops are not worth the headache for me
---
Oh thank you. Is imgur free? Do I need to sign up to that also?
---
Happy cake day
---
Are you dealing 80/180 before or after taking armor into account, because armor messes up fast weak weapons something fierce.
---
Like, against enemies with 120 armor the difference between 80 and 180 is exaggerated to 30 (\~60% reduction) and 126 (\~30% reduction)
---
Obviously you can help mitigate this by taking anti armor perk for melee weapons, but that is 3 perk points you need for the weaker weapon to only catch up to the stronger one.
---
Unless you are seriously pumping the damage of fast attack weapons up into the 200+ range you really are going to have problems with the whole slew of heavily armored everythings in the high level range neutering your damage output, while the big slow heavy weapons don't really care how armored things are.
---
You realize the plasma caster is a heavy weapon right?
---
Its kinda like a raider cover 
---
Its good, but gets old really fast
---
https://www.kevduit.com/op-plasma-caster-v-a-t-s-crit-build-fallout-76-builds/

This is where I get my build from :)
---
Hope this helps
---
I solo'd a silo on LSD, was an experience
---
I just want eddie cochram
---
It‚Äôs random
---
Lucky hole is so much faster though
---
I was tempted to go for sneak, but it‚Äôs a heavy gunner. As I said to my mama, ‚Äúwhen I grow up, I wanna be a tank!‚Äù What happens to adrenaline if you can‚Äôt one-shot things?
---
Because telling someone to mute their computer instead of them telling everyone else not to use a feature built into the game because it bothers them is a horrible and vile thing to do lol.
---
Happens to me sometimes with Beckett but nothing in particular that I can identify seems to be the trigger, a server change always fixes it though
---
High enough fire rate and the first 2-3 hits count as instigating.
---
My proudest win was the time I took down a couple of creatures with a board, which gave me some stims and a nuka grenade. I hid in bushes until only a team of two remained. They were fighting the scorched beast and I chucked the grenade. I was pretty excited when the Overseer banner popped up showing I won.
---
Muteing the computer is more simple then messing with all the game settings
---
There are perks and mods to make it negligible. Learn to play the game and utilize the tool you are trying to, before complaining please.
---
In my opinion, even non explosive weapons should be lethal to self if you manage to get hit with a ricochet, or a plasma splash, that's gonna hurt.
---
They've already dumbed, and continue to dumb down this game into easy mode for people like this that whine about an easily mitigated, and realistic game mechanic.
---
Was fixing up camp and looked up plans and saw that he‚Äôs the only one who sells some so now I need to find him
---
I still hid in bushes, just try to spawn near and use the water as much as possible.
---
What is this bloodied build you talk about?
---
Vault boy giving the middle finger üòÇ
---
Shhhhhh
---
The only things worth killing with one shot would be the Queen or the Colossus, things that can be killed relatively easily with a handful of people. 
---
So that leaves destroying camps in one go. What reasons could exist that someone would need to destroy a camp in one shot?
---
I would think so too. Mute as soon as you join a NW game, unmute as soon as you spawn in game after a map is chosen.
---
That's what I'm doing. Instead of ending up there, though, I get dropped at some random point inside the nuke zone.
---
Personally don't find adamantium skeleton that useful I mean one stimpack is enough to recover 1 limb
---
I call that "The Riker Maneuver"
---
As a fellow water wookie, hiding underwater is a great way to hide. But you should always try to find a shotgun (not gauss), crossbow, single shot rifle, or grenade launcher. As long as you have them out in your hand when you go under the water, you can fire them. Automatic weapons don't work, and you can't switch weapons or go into camera mode when you do it. 
---
I've caught many a fellow water wookie unaware that you can fire some of these guys under water.
---
Oh, and BTW, it‚Äôs JJ
---
Dude... nexus has had features forever which should have been included at the very start.  It's fucking crazy how little Bethesda does besides make more bugs.
---
At least you didn't have a guy follow you from a public event and then kill your toads because you wouldn't PvP with him
---
So I usually take Poseidon I‚Äôll build a fusion reactor to power the fusion core machine then I‚Äôll build all the resource collectors. For others to collect except lead and core which I lock. I sell the cores wicked cheap. I also then build a lil hostel for travelers to use.
---
Haha xD
---
That comment though.
---
Well I guess they're refresh I think. I don't really know. But hey, you don't need adrenaline if you don't want to :)
---
Yes that would work so much better. They already have the technology to do it... lol oh well. 
---
Also had to rebuild my camp, not a big deal and made it better. One of these days I will figure out how the blueprints/placing homes works.
---
I was wondering where you‚Äôd gone actually... Now I know why I hadn‚Äôt seen you lately lmao
---
I believe crane kicking your enemies while listening to Joe Esposito is a good work around.
---
I have both, and both with identical 33 vats/25 less vats. I generally use the furious for enemies that need more abuse handed to them. AA for general wandering around and taking out random encounters etc. That said I think furious is more fun.
---
I mean I‚Äôve put only one bullet into tones of legendaries, but I guess I‚Äôve forgotten that every time I kill one I‚Äôm actually pulling the trigger twice. 
---
Or, maybe you actually can one shot legendaries. Which is way more likely.
---
Yup.  I log in maybe once a week now, buy some bullion and trade in some tbills.  3 months, and I'm already bored to death of the game.  Granted, with the pandemic I've played a lot more often, but still, FO3/NV/4 held my attention for much longer than 3 months.
---
There is a green and yellow one. It‚Äôs an Atom Shop version.
---
Game crashed loading for me yesterday, had 4 of 9 showing as complete, lost 1250 SCORE.  Bugthesda is worse than spyware companies.
---
Yup, Vir, carnage, Raxxes, and I are doing our own thing. Virs being a diplomat, carnage and Raxxes acces want to unleash on them, I could go either way, but I usually lean towards Vir so it stays even. A few others joined. More will follow suit. I‚Äôm about to PM you what Jarp said to me, feel free to spread it around the BoS, but do so at your own risk, he‚Äôs most likeley gonna be touchy about it.
---
Oh, but you can fire underwater. It needs to be of a certain weapon archetype (shotgun, crossbow, grenade launcher, single shot rifle), and it needs to be in out in your hands as you go into the water. It'll "disappear" as you start to swim, but the cross hair will remain and as soon as you shoot once the gun appears in your hand and you can use it normally. 
---
You can't switch weapons underwater or go into photomode though, this will take away your ability to fire your weapon.
---
And that's all I ever get - and it's not what I want.
---
Heh.  Y'all don't know how the Brotherhood really works.  At the core of their dogma is a distrust of outsiders and a belief that advanced weapons/nuclear technology is only safe hidden in their possession.  They start out a bit altruistic, yeah, but they're about to spend the next 200 years only coming out of their bunkers to occasionally confiscate or destroy any prewar tech they can get their hands on or crush any stick waving sub-human wastelander who stands in their way with overwhelming righteous might.  
---
We haven't exactly been responsible with our nuclear bomb factory, which is most certainly causing nuclear rain everywhere the wind will carry  the dust clouds from the repeated bombardments.  We also have the entire gold supply of the former US government, two self aware artificial intelligences, functional automated robotics manufacturing facilities all over the map, three? operational nuclear power plants, Mutants hopped up on FEV pouring out of Huntersville, giant bats that turn every living creature into zombie thralls, and a pristine vault full of tech specifically purposed for rebuilding.
---
And a history of being so tragically inept at cooperation that all human life that wasn't underground was _gone for like seven years._ 
---
Any one of these things would have the BOS ready for total war.  They'd do that over Thunder Mountain, let alone the silos.  They ain't coming to set up a lemonade stand.
---
No
---
You ought to just use them
---
Yeah, in just three days of 2-5 hour play sessions I reached level 20 on Red Dead's outlaw pass. I really like how you can just level that baby up to max in 5 days, I did that with the first one but with 76? You can only level up once per day, yeah... way to drag the season out.
---
Seasons have potential but they really need to improve some things, or just cancel until they fix the autocomplete crap
---
All of which got boring.  I hear Wade in my nightmares....
---
He showed up during Guided Meditation the other day too. It was great. More events should have Graham show up.

Well i took and learned 1 of each. Theres multiple of the same plan. So wanted to know if i should take all the extras and sell them, or leave them for someone else.
---
I'm down.  Let's call it the 76ers
---
What‚Äôs that? I don‚Äôt speak COMMIE!
---
All the good devs are working on Elder Scrolls 6. Mobile game devs who are only good at making cosmetics for cash are working on this "game".
---
This happened to me once too! Glad to see you had a cool experience. I thought it was so fun to do something a little different than the normal grind.
---
I would keep up with original owner's generosity and give them away/sell them for 0 caps
---
I guess thats what happened then.
---
They need to cork all the wine that they will be making. They have become wine makers in the apocalypse. They need start up supplies to get their kick starter business going. First 1,000,000 corks gets the starter sample kit of wine in a box.
---
Dunno how that person does it, but I have 5 pieces of -20% weapon weight armor and I always have to be wearing at least 4 of the pieces to be under carry weight. Most of the time it has to be all five. I also have almost all weight reduction perks active. High capacity backpack. I always join a team and equip strange in numbers to get a little more strength.  I have radicool and drink Toxic Goo if I need a few more pounds of carry weight. 
---
My build is "the pack rat" and I never stick to just a few weapons. 
---
So I've never been in power armor without being over encumbered. 
---
Guys...I have a problem.
---
My biggest issue is the scrip cap and how it affects my weight and gameplay. If I get a decent legendary I usually sell another to make room. 40 scrips is a good amount I guess, but 150 per day is ridiculous. 
---
Then when I‚Äôm full in scrips I buy a couple of 3 stars which obviously will suck 99% of the time, so I need to sell those too. I started to just sell them for caps instead but then I‚Äôm full on caps. If I spend the caps at someone‚Äôs camp to make room, I‚Äôm back to dealing with weight and inability of selling my stuff again. 
---
For a while a friend and I would help each other carrying and selling each other‚Äôs stuff but it‚Äôs too annoying to keep track of. I started dropping them for players but most people ignore the drops likely because they are full too. 
---
It‚Äôs a vicious cycle. It‚Äôs easier for me to just log off and worry about it when the vendor caps reset the next day. This is really stupid because I actually enjoy playing the game, but not being able to manage my storage and just be overencumbered preventing me from doing anything but walk sucks all the fun away. You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt want me to play.
---
Plans weigh a lot. A lot of players (myself included) will just drop the ones we know if they're common. Unless it's dozens of mounted plans, they're 99% legit. Do what you want with them
---
You could get an item that exists in the real world and game, like the army helmet and then compare items in game to it for size reference.
---
Confirmed? What weapons? If it's confirmed that's a valuable key piece of info there left out
---
Ill probably do that. How does someone get a raider loot bag? And does the player decide whats in them?
---
I work in props and customs as a career. I've often lifted images from games. What we usually do is take an item we want to make and superimpose it in Photoshop over an average body of a person. We scale said item until it looks reasonable.
---
If they're going to timegate everything to stop you from playing, they could at least have all the currencies reset on the same timer.   
---
I went on late Friday and during the day on Saturday, so my caps/scrip/bullion are now out of sync by 6-8 hours. It's a pain in the arse.
---
No, it was still a tourist attraction in Boston by the war, so Ironsides is probably responsible for putting on the rockets after the war.
---
Same. I pre-ordered and sat through the countdown on the PS4. Within a couple weeks, I left. The glitching, constant server drops, camp issues, lack of NPCs making it feel lifeless, all of it was just disappointing. Just jumped back in today and all I can say is, wow. The game is so much better now. Got 5 or 6 hours in today and now I'm laying in bed, excited to wake up and play tomorrow :)
---
How does this look? I also added in the current armor and weapons legendary effects

---
Are you on Xbox? I had the same earlier today, only 1 or 2 other players there. I noticed Grahm was there when I saw Chally running for dear life
---
Raider loot bag is presumably an atomic shop cosmetic, players decide what goes in a loot bag by dropping items from their inventory
---
It definitely is. I'm around 340s and the level ups don't take too long. Just repetitive hopping to the same locations over and over. Little bit easier if the right events pop up.
---
I'm actually very sorry that happened to you, but OHMYGOD I'm so friggin sick of these posts that at this point accomplish nothing but take up space on the interwebs.....
---
Yeah It not very fun to grind. All the good ones to bring are rare, hard, and take to much out of you to sever hop. And most of them don‚Äôt give much ie, 50 caps, one start armor, like 2 stims, and like 4 xp. Never killed scorched beast queen because my guns suck I never have armor, weapons all up to code and farming healing slave just isn‚Äôt worth the work. And I love the grind in some games.
---
Provably scorched cookies with FEV icing.
---
The difference is there are dozens of places to go and things to do in between them.  Yes, I can launch as many nukes in a day as I want server hopping.  Sure, you can kill SBQ as many times as you'd like, but you only need or can store so many zealot's missile launchers.  You can't sell them, 1400 cap limit, you can't scrip them, 150 scrip limit, and you can't even scrap them because too many idiots would scrap stuff accidentally then.  You may get 2 or 3 things in a month's grinding that you'd actually use, if that.  Oh wait, you get 4 treasury notes.  That you can only use 20 of a day.
---
So yeah, this is in no way like the raid lockouts in WoW.  You may have had to kill the same boss for weeks to get what you wanted, but at least you knew it was possible.
---
Get out a stop watch and time 10 swings and repeat this 3 times on each weapon.  Then you'll know for sure.
---
All these people talking shit, if a video game faction asking for resources in an in-game event offends you so much don‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs a game no need to get so butt hurt over it just don‚Äôt do it if you don‚Äôt want to
---
Cut the power only stopping your vending machine from broadcasting the goodies it contains from maps. Anyone interact with your vending machine can still make the purchase.
---
After encountered enough MAX caps scenarios with Wastelander update s, I've rewired all my vending machine to a single power switch for all characters so I can kill off the broadcasting fast enough. 
---
I've also moved all vending machines (and the kill switch) behind a lockable door in one of my characters recently, with a double side defense wall with "OPEN"  neon letters on the one side and "CLOSE" on the other side, so that I can rotate and move it to block access to the vender room when I want to shut my door. Using barrier will stop both random group members or lockpicker to access your vending machines.
---
Nice one Todd

PS4
---
Ooh. So its like a paper bag but permanent
---
I wasn't complaining, I was expressing my opinion. There is difference. If I didn't know how to play then I wouldn't be level 181. You can know how to play and still find some things about this game a little annoying.
---
I have no idea, you could google it though.
---
I have more than 500 notes to turn in, but I can only turn in 20 every day. There is no way I will be able to spend all of them even if there was anything worth the gold at this point. 
---
Most of my inventory is script items and I have 4 guns on rotation to not have to deal with running out of amo.
---
AMO converter is a joke because I never hack or pick lock because I hate terminals and mini games in online games. It will never be worth the effort to pick up 44 and 38 to convert.
---
Being forced to play NW every day is painful. They haven't done anything to make it fresh for ages and it crashes all the time. I also love spawning in 2 min after everyone else only to find out I was killed before I got in. This is common in popular spawn locations. I can't auto stimpack frequently and guns have to be manually equipped to use them. 50 cal and marine armour sometimes hide half of your screen if equipped together.
---
I fully understand why the board game is a thing from the company's perspective, I just disagree with it strongly. They need numbers to prove to the investors that the game is popular. At the cost of their reputation. Milking the fans of every dollar being the primary goal. Main menu literally tells you to go to atom shop when you start the game.
---
I have lost so many friends that were regular players every time a new edition comes. Manly because they keep hoping it gets better with a new update but it never does.
---
A lot of it is kinda meh to me but I agree there are a few things I'm glad to have, the wallpapers and sheepsquatch chief among them. Haven't gotten to the chickens yet but hopefully I will before it ends.
---
You really need the heavy gun perks to make it worth it. Mine puts out over 1k damage on my pipboy.
---
True. MODUS does have the Kovac-Muldoon, so I‚Äôm he‚Äôll notice them before they notice him.
---
Of the 30 or so times i've tried, only once i could finish the event. Most of the time the thing you have to pick up to initiate the event spawns underground or he gets stuck on buildings. With this you can confirm they SURELY test their game thoroughly.
---
Bloodied builds are a common kind of "glass cannon" build based on an effect which increases damage at lower health, basically they have at least 81% of their health as rads as to get damage buffs and trigger specific perks, so when you remove their rads by reviving them they would no longer be able to use stimpacks or other healing items until they get their rads back without loosing most of their builds strengths
---
Had a guy using stacked punji boards the other day.
---
really wished for it there.
---
Once, in the early days, Grahm kinda warned me I was about to be mugged by a deathclaw sort of like how the liberty prime armor does by randomly calling out when enemies are close. He truly is the unsung hero of West Virginia.
---
You seem to be implying that you can only level up once a day in the game which is not true.
---
Can the animation be the same as thumbs up but with the middle finger???
---
you can hit post, and image, then from there there's a camera option, you can take a pic of your screen, that's what I do for trade pics
---
that looks pretty good but I would probably take points from strong back and spiritual healer in order to add better criticals that way you can do a bit more damage and healing during fights
---
Oh wow sounds brill! Yes this sounds like an effective way, the gauntlet is so grossly big but bet this could work thankyou!
---
&gt;totally agree with this, the game is already expensive as it is, w
---
I paid 40 dollars for the game a year ago and that was it. Not really an expensive game.
---
I have the raider one and I love it. It‚Äôs hilariously rude and has many options to search for. Has given me scrap (ballistic), junk, food, water, chems, ammo, guns and grenades
---
That feel when I bought a fixer plan for 200 caps from a generous seller and never use the thing ever.
---
I wish! Would have loved to use it on a lvl 1000 player that brought his posse over and stole my workshop from me. I‚Äôm lvl 170 and it‚Äôs just.....why, why do that dude? Oh man, I would have used the heck outta that emote. As they killed me over and over. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
That's a good idea! Be able to translate it over thankyou!
---
Ok I see. Thank you also!
---
I really like that thunder pipe skin. I don't even care I have to use the smaller mag... It looks wicked.
---
Y'know you could just make caves..
---
Oops, I mean "mumble mumble mumble"
---
That they will burn out on the game. Limiting how much you can do in a day gives you room to not stress and play other games without getting behind in anything
---
Yea it really is! What I have done too is worn it in game and scaled the wearing body part with my own.
---
You should post progress and complete work as you create this.
---
Well, that explains why they explode easily
---
I'd suggest using it at full health as "just" a magic weapon.
---
I drop every plan I know. But there is plenty of times I pick them up when looting and later on just drop them. So unless it was a ridiculous amount maybe he did what I do
---
It's the same fridge that was on the atom shop before but at a discount
---
If you can cause a riot and you live in a bunker, come on in!
---
On the season, yes. Unless you feel like grinding away for endless hours
---
Inflation,  burning though content in a day while screaming about nothing to do?
---
I keep my robot, water, and lead unlocked as a goodwill gesture. I lock the ammo crafter.
---
I spent more tike grinding on my boosted Ark server in an hour then 5 hours of 76.
---
What if I tell you that I've been playing games all my life on arrows? =)
---
There was a chest somewhere that has a bunch of the figurines on it but I can't remember where. Sorry not much help
---
Change wall type may mess a few thing from the original decorations and / or power wiring. It also make it unaccessible to your alternative account (if you have it...)
---
I've slowly convert some of my camps to utilize hidden switch with powered door.
---
Perfectly said my fellow dweller.its mind numbingly tedious.
---
They need to give us full freedom to grind as much as we want or as little.with an online game like this they can easily keep things fresh and relavant with new content.no need to restrict players from having fun.that just blows my mind.pinko commies running bethesda..lol
---
A true gentleman doesn't keep count.
---
I took down my displays because of this. Sometimes when doing something at a camp it will use a junk item in display and not what's in your stash or a scrapbox. I hope this get fixed.
---
You do realize neither of those address the cap, script and bullion caps right?
---
Not everyone is robot.not every player has that capability.we have other things going on in the real world.
---
Just sever hop the fissure sites, there's a good chance the scorchbeast that spawns will be elite.
---
I know if you go to the frat house in Morgantown they have the chess set there of the robots. But I don't remember a T 60. I think there was one I found in (the Polly quest line has you go to a place to replace her body.) That's the assaultron in the Wayward.
---
No absolutely not. Do not change the times they reset. It's 20 hours after you first do it. I'm in a time zone where if they changed the resets of vendors I'd start missing out. Not to mention it'd be changing it from a 20 hour reset timer to 24 hour reset timer. Add to that how they haven't even fixed the daily auto complete challenges yet and you want them to mess with a system that doesn't need changing to put it in line with daily challenges?
---
You heretic.you heathen.how dare you go against the word of todd.
---
How about instead of a cap of 150 scrip we get a cap of SPENDING 150 scrip so I don‚Äôt have to carry all my weapons/armor and can turn it to scrip whenever I please
---
10?
---
10k*
---
Going through all fissure sites usually also net you the needed kills. Those SB have very high chance of being legendary. Takes max 10mins to find all.
---
The Raider one is Hilarious.  He talks about burning down your base.  Plus he collects chems and booze on one setting and guns and ammo on another.
---
Or you make a throw away alternate that is good for 3 or 4 easy level ups and finish that in 5 or 10 minutes.
---
So I was having the same problem, I only have fireproof to the second or third level, but I built the SS chest piece and it‚Äôs explosive and fireproofing mod has been a lifesaver especially for a bloodied heavy explosive build with all unyielding pieces. I haven‚Äôt killed myself once in the past few weeks with that mod on the chest piece and a few levels of fireproof and I keep my health always under 20%. Hopefully that helps, cause killing myself truly was the only thing stopping me!
---
Damn. I‚Äôm impressed. I guess I could see how the game would feel if you did a straight through A to Z play from the start. I think after a certain point in NV I just became incredibly bored with following the narrative and found aimless wandering to be interesting, I do quests whenever I need to find a new area or some new weapon I wouldn‚Äôt be able to pickup on my own.
---
They are extra and optional.  Nothing in the legendary run changes the game much.  Yay, free lunchboxes and scrap/repair kits.  Occasionally free atoms, bullion and scrip, but not enough to make me want to pay any attention to it.
---
Ah! Thank you!
---
Give me a break, the rewards are lame. I will give you chicken coop but that's it
---
I'm with you
---
Like a paper bag but cosmetically different, same rules apply otherwise.
---
Level 50, 3 days?! What the. I JUST hit level 50 after...8 months? I dick off a fuckton so there is that.
---
Gimme then cookies
---
Literally just finished my first match with it. Placed 9th.
---
This sub isn't for selling stuff, especially illegitimate items. Try someone's discord.
---
I'm a slocums joe coffee and doughnut guy.
---
The Legendary Run
---
Yeah Rule 10
---
I just use the powered gate door and hook up a hidden switch. All the doors open to let people in, doors close, nobody can unlock it.
---
Smh.you are such a tool.
---
That's an emoji.not an emote...js..lol
---
Either 
---
A. Max daily limit of gold to 400 
---
B. Make it weekly Max of 1400
---
Odd, I still play FO4/NV and Skyrim.  Bethesda knows how to make open-ended worlds with tons of replayability.  They just failed hard on this one, and continue to do so.
---
lol  i didnt see the comment above me.  pretty much the same.  My favorite one so far is 
---
"I have hobbies.  Raiding...mudering...raiding..."
---
When is this coming
---
Ya it came and went with a forth of July bundle last month.  It was offered once previously before that.  It‚Äôll come around again at some point.
---
As another has commented. Check out Angry Turtle on YouTube. Not just about magic weapons. He covers all sorts of angles of what works and doesn't work in the game.
---
Live by him for this game!
---
Yes
---
I can only imagine all allies on the field looking exactly the same. All at the SQB event. Bugs and all. I would be so confused. Tons of becketts tons of Sofia sheesh that would drive me insane. Lol.
---
You get to a point in the game where you have enough of anything and just can't be bothered playing inventory tetris, hauling shit to vendors for peanuts, or logging on and off to move stuff between mule characters anymore. So you learn to let go and just start dropping stuff in front of your vendor, in front of the Vault/the Wayward, or in the middle of the road wherever you are... if someone picks it up it's fine, it no one takes it and the bag expires it's fine, it's all good. 
---
The person who dropped those plans probably just doesn't care about micromanaging a billion plans taking up inventory space anymore and dropped them all to get rid of them, either to lucky passerbys or to the void of space when they log out. Learn the plans you don't have, leave the duplicates for the next lucky player who walks by if you're feeling generous. Don't feel guilty for taking them, you'll eventually get to this point of inventory exhaustion too and hope for a newbie to come by and take your drops same as you did back then.
---
In communist wasteland explosive legacy bombs you.
---
aahh okay tysm. i dont have the original - is it an upright fridge? i only ask because my fo1st expired and am debating if i want to re up it this week
---
Nah, just tired of the endless shitting on the game. If something is bad it deserves the hate, but it can reach a point where it begins to feel silly. 
---
Complaining about the horrible ammo converter experience, cool, great üëçüèΩ. 
---
Complaining about getting a bunch of free shit in the legendary run? Bro. It‚Äôs free loot for doing nothing at all. Yes, the ghillie suits have issues, I get that.
---
For me the only thing good about NW was that it verified I didnt like king of the hill.  Saved me a few bucks on buying PubG.
---
I had an opposite experience with Grahm. He started attacking my workshop and going ham on my resource extractors for some reason. I had to abandon the server because he was just going to continue until everything was broken.
---
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Bn7FD7ayUVQ/maxresdefault.jpg
---
thank you so much!!!
---
It seriously makes no sense that there isn't a settlement full of 76ers built around/inside the vault.
---
Ah, ok
---
?
---
Is his middle name Ryker?
---
What
---
No problem. Holds 15 items. 
---
I kinda like it better that the clean silver one. Also is a much better fridge if going for a raider vibe due to the bloody handprint.
---
I didn't think damage in VATs criticals effects the healing, atleast, that is how it sounded in the video I posted
---
Just lock on the lowest available lock so people get wanted and targeted by the turrets lol
---
Just for that, now we're moving YOUR camp there too!
---
Good thing I've got nothing more fun to do than spend an hour logging in and out of servers. Mech is dumb.
---
I have enjoyed everything so far and I am almost fully done with it. I just unloaded the captain cosmos power armor skin. And I love it. So awesome on t65 and my excavator. I need to put chicken pen down yet but I think there where like ten I like in this and most of what you named. I don‚Äôt care for the million ghille skins but whatever, it‚Äôs free.
---
Your mistake is thinking that they would ever prioritise player satisfaction over *player retention*.  
---
**Longevity** is the name of the game, and they will drag it out for all it is worth.
---
In that case I'm sorry, I thought it should just scale with the damage dealt but that might be wrong. I would probably still get the perk though so your damage output is higher but that may depend more on who you play with and whether or not your damage output feels too low
---
IMO it is more a way of getting rid of duped junk.  If someone has 1 million cork it really has no impact on the game but getting millions of steel and lead out if the hands of dupers will mean more people running LuckyHole etc.
---
That‚Äôs fine. Quality is subjective. I was specifically responding to an objective (false) statement saying that wastelanders was just two questlines. Wastelanders as a whole was a pretty large expansion.
---
you can easily complete the season without bothering with that one
---
I have been a deep Enclave Agent since they released me from my Raider captivity.  They left the collar on me as a reminder where my loyalties lie.  Should you encounter a cowgirl with a switch blade and a six shooter, look for blinking red light in her neck.  That‚Äôs me.
---
Also, the cookies are assorted and delicious
---
Golf balls. Lots and lots and lots of golf balls. 200 million golf balls to be exact.
---
Game Pass player that started a month ago. Today I hit level 60 and have nearly completed the main story and the settlers/raiders stuff.
---
I haven't launched a bike yet though.
---
Is there a way to show how long you've played on Xbox? Feels like 160 hours already.
---
Whats the deal with all the server disconnects?
---
Thank you, you get what I‚Äôm getting at and I agree with your point on time gating. 
---
I think I have a bad reaction when users are upset about a product experience and think a solution can be conjured out of air, on short timelines, coded perfectly with all use cases in mind. You‚Äôre not saying that directly but it‚Äôs becoming the vibe of this sub I‚Äôm starting to feel.
---
I oneshot everything but Scorch Beasts with a Stealth Bloodied Lever Action. Even they take no more than 3 shots, unless they're the level 80 ones in the bottom corner of the map. They take like 6.
---
Queen is the only thing that takes time, but I also haven't had the pleasure of running into the boss Wendingo.
---
I‚Äôm glad they made it so you can get the 5 without the legendaries.  It‚Äôs been a nice way to avoid frustration. I feel you
---
This is why the list was released as a whole. Bethesda wants us to start farming it all now and they want us to buy fo1st to store it all until we can cash it in. This whole event is just to use our fomo to drive fo1st sales.
---
Goddamn. Holy shrimp. 
---
Yeah man, you gotta watch those bikes. ü§ù
---
Excavator is better as you make it yourself and it's made of the mountains and will buff your carry weight but I prefer having my carry weight at 430 so I don't use it
---
Same bullshit happened with Destiny 2 and it's why I stopped playing. I have Netflix because I hate ads and want to watch **WHAT I WANT**, ***WHEN I WANT*** and if some game companies refuse to respect my time, I'm done supporting them.
---
You get banned, enjoy!
---
Because they are corkless
---
I love how clunky and cumbersome PA is in this game and Fallout 4, and it's precisely why I don't use them.
---
I play everyday, mostly just looting, some shooting and dailys but i genuinely have no idea what anyone is talking about with all the new resource demand?
---
This is fucking hilarious
---
I mean, I could be wrong, but that was my impression. It seemed like it is more based on crit farming than anything. 
---
As for my previous two chars (my main [lvl 120] is a PA heavy weapon user who also has all but Raider pa in her stash. No chems, alcohol or mutations and does a lot of BoS event quests. The other char is lvl 20 and started out as a bow/ crossbow build that I also am looking to be a chem user/ alcoholic and is gonna work with the raiders) have been solo except for public teams or events
---
Russel: ok Brothers, now that you're coming I'll organise supplies ready for your arrival. What do you need? 
---
Laser Rifles? Fusion Cells? Stimpaks? Radaway? A stockpile of rad free pre-war food? They say an army marches on it's stomach! 
---
Brotherhood: Corks. We want 200 million corks.
---
Not that we can do anything about it, but I hope rnjesus is never on your side, other than that play on lol
---
Ive had a SB drop near Vault 76 when I went over to drop off a starter package of Leather armor + Weapon ammo and stims. Seriously it was Drop a starter kit and WHAM scorch beast drops dead on top of us....
---
I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they have a small skeleton crew working on new content for this game while the other 80-90% of Bethesda Games Studios are working on Starfield and/or Elder Scrolls 6 right now. I guess it would make sense why the end game content for 76 is so lackluster.
---
That explains why the Brotherhood is after so much damn cork!
---
There is an community event starting on tuesday to gather supplies for the Brotherhood's arrival. Weekly targets with rewards for reaching individual donation levels and for community donations. Stuff like 250 million steel, 200 million leather and of course the cork.
---
I still have some random quests to do but starting when game pass launched I'm now level 110 and have the secret service armour minus the useless helmet.
---
I just used sometimes during quests to avoid RADS and get extra armor to survive. That was before getting my Chinese Stealth Armor.
---
I run a stealth commando with CSA and handmade rifle. Now I should be able to kill stuff fast without getting too much hits to PA make any difference.
---
What do you do with the modules on all those mules?  You can‚Äôt trade them and you are to low a lvl to do anything with them.
---
Nor kiss and tell
---
For my first 30 levels or so I kept my house in the same spot bc the veiw was amazing, Grahm would come through and clear the things attacking my turrets like clock work every other ingame day I adjusted my defences to this so I'd only have to repair stuff like once every 5 ingame days and he would kill anything in the aucword spots my turrets would ignore also made it realy easy to get plans as I progressed
---
I thought sneak card was a multiplier on top of the agility points?
---
He means he's carrying that much, not that he has the capacity to. He's absurdly overweight, I have no idea how people play like that. Only my mules are that heavy.
---
Yes I have a junkies which I‚Äôm guessing someone was trying to dupe the last dupe wave and I went to watoga and the vendor had that weapon and junkies gat plasma which I bought. But I also got a bloodied one from purveyor but never really used it. Then I saw angry turtles video. I have never been able to get the magic to work with the queen. I mean it does damage but not melt her in ten seconds
---
Those numbers are made up by the way. I think it's significantly less steel than that. Don't have the list memorized.
---
They never fixed the suppressor for the gold skin, this one will be just another screw-up that stays.
---
If you want lead just use an Excavator PA suit and go through Lucky Hole Mine. Takes about 10 min and you should get enough Lead ore to make 1000+ Lead Scrap with Super Duper. If you need acid just run up Tanagra Town in the Mire. Should get about 100 from the Crickets.
---
Regarding the automatically Dropping Nukes it‚Äôs only on PTS to Testing things more faster  .. &amp; this is a feature maybe coming with Wasteland For All update they mentioned ‚Äú Bomb drop event ‚Äú as a new event so probably it‚Äôs nuke dropped randomly on SBQ or at Monongah mine
---
Ok
---
In my experience standing on a tent will make the queen not landing. There's only 2 people on the event and they're both standing on a tent. The queen kept flying for 26 minutes until I shot her on the open ground. A mirelurk queen spawn behind us then we died and failed the event. üòÖ
---
She will also land if there's a non scorched enemies on the ground.
---
Secret service armor
---
Marsupial is your friend. üòä
---
The player put them there for everyone to use, not for you to take ALL of them you greedy fuck.
---
Please dont bother trying to grab and sell them all, just take what you need
---
God damn autocorrect. Must not like nukes.
---
Exactly!
---
There's 5 plans for crafting each part: RA, LA, RL, LL, and Torso
---
There's 3 Buttressed plans to maximize DR/ER/RR: Arms, Legs, Torso
---
Then various mods for Arms, Legs, Torso.  For torso, the jetpack is most popular.  The arms and legs don't really have any useful mods yet IMO.  I think the're supposed to release Deep Pocket and Ultralight for them eventually.
---

---
Honestly i still think the best collectron is the original one
---
I use it when not in a group and going to somewhere like west tek where I need the carry weight. Given that, the only one I use is the excavator PA for the extra carry weight. Otherwise I run around in my near costume.
---
I have had all good fun with graham.  Athena, on the other hand, attacked my camp for days.  My camp attacked my salvage bot for a week.   I set up in cedar swamp and NEVER see chally in that hood.
---
Ward. Ward never changes.
---
Because I enjoy it and people have different tastes
---
Yeah they're unique until the rest of the legendary effects drop. Imagine a Bloodied/Explosive/-90% weight/+20% damage/Incendiary Cryo weapon? Especially on a heavy gun? Any boss will not be able to do because of the cryo damage and receive massive damage with the rest of the modifiers
---
Where did ‚Äúbattle pass‚Äù come from and what does it mean?      
---
I only see it being called a Season or Legendary Run anywhere.
---
Not sure if this is what‚Äôs happening in your case but I‚Äôve had issues similar to this where I couldn‚Äôt delete a structure. To fix it, you have to delete the structures in the reverse order that you place them. For example if you place a foundation then stairs on that foundation you would have to delete the stairs first. 
---
It‚Äôs possible that one or more of the foundations you placed couldn‚Äôt exist unless they were attached to another foundation as an anchor. So you have to delete the ‚Äúfloating‚Äù foundation first before deleting the anchor foundation.
---
The last Colossus only had one...
---
That's why I dont play much anymore, finished the main story, a lot of stuff after seemed like a chore.
---
[this was pretty good](https://youtu.be/-Td1gP3wHOE)
---
Hello 
---
I am new to the game and wonder about what vault steel is used for?
---
Yaaass
---
Yes but is there a specific reason you play it? What do you think is fun about it ?
---
You do realize the plasma caster doesn't count as a rifle, right? It's a heavy gun.
---
I would use that for those who charge 2 caps for ammo.
---
You're out of uniform, soldier! WHERE IS YOUR POWER ARMOR?
---
Socthej power armor is called t-65 and the armor you're looking for is called secret serv8ce armor
---
Morning really fancy in the ban whats just what it's called
---
Hmm where was your workshop located?
---
How many cookies are you gonna give to each person? üëÄ
---
Honestly the worst one for me is the reputation. Even after beating the game and doing everything I can for the raider rep I'm like level 111 and almost friendly with them
---
I believe its used for crafting certain high level armor sets such as Solar, Thorn, and Strangler Heart.
---
I just found a clean globe and it's nowhere near whitesprings. I'm in the mire, I have a screenshot of it and the location on the map if anyone wants it
---
I have a wonderful "friend" who is just a random unused PSN account. Literally just searched for a random person and found someone who hadn't been online for a few years. I share screenshots to this random person who is never ever online, and then i open the PS Messages app on my phone and save the images. 
---
Then you upload them to https://imgur.com/upload but you have to view it in Desktop Mode now.. A bit more complicated, but still easy enough. So copy the link, paste the link and go, then request desktop mode, then paste the link *again* and it should work fine. Upload the pic, and then copy/paste the link to the pic into a reddit post (just not the title).
---
Done! (and without some unsightly phone camera snap..)
---
 Another option is to use the PS4 Remote Play app and just screenshot on your phone, or share the screenshot from your PS4 to like Twatter or something  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I have no idea why I keep playing this game.  I have hundreds of other games to try, and for some reason I keep coming back to this one, but not out of any sense of enjoyment.  It has almost become OCD at this point.
---
If all you did before was queen after queen you will probably find it boring TBH. There is a lot of great content but this game is always what you make of it. I think the wastelanders content is really interesting.
---
Indeed, I still find it absurd that at launch Bethesda was alright with the idea of someone potentially getting a two shot, explosive, faster reload, incendiary, +20% damage weapon somewhere down the line. Just imagine how broken that would be if they never nerfed two shot and explosive!
---
Yeah I just found 2 free CAMP things I didn't know about... I guess I gotta pay more attention to the store
---
So what fallout games do you like the combat in? Because this is a huge step forward. Also they are the best graphics in the series. Which game do you think had better graphics?
---
I agree the story isn‚Äôt amazing.

Anyway, best map in the series IMO. More content than other games in the series. More quest variety. More enemies than any other entry in the series. Better modding and customization. It‚Äôs just a nice world to explore. That‚Äôs what it comes down to for me. I didn‚Äôt think I would like an all online game, but I do. There are some things like seasons that I‚Äôm not a fan of, but the core gameplay is enjoyable.
---
Then you‚Äôd have people throw a hissy if picking a side had consequences.
---
Hello!  It‚Äôs called a Power Armor pocket Rowan!
---
Thatsss what it was. Gracias amigo. Was it a solo item, or in a bundle?
---
That would also explain how I get diseases through a supposedly impervious "metal" exoskeleton.
---
the cork milestone is troll, not there to be reached
---
but people look engaged i give 2 fks about cork i would do my part with the others only
---
Maybe they wanted to craft a lot of pipe pistols or .38 mini gun.
---
Purveyor's functional cap for legendary modules (LMs) is 3. I'll explain.
---
Assume you've got legendaries up your ass but already spent all your scrip. You hit up the scrip machine, get your 150 scrip, then use that to buy 3 LMs at 50 scrip a pop. Want to buy more? Get bent, scrip machine's dry.
---
So the next day, you've got legendaries up your ass but already spent all your scrip. You hit up the scrip machine, get your 150 scrip, then use that to buy 3 LMs at 50 scrip a pop. Want to buy more? Get bent, scrip machine's dry.
---
And so on. It's stupid start to finish. It's also why people dupe, because otherwise you'll spend months trapped in a poorly designed skinner box trying to get enough LMs to get the roll you want. I duped LMs like a mofo and haven't regretted it since.
---
430?  That‚Äôs cute.  I usually run at 525 (535 when I‚Äôm on the sauce) without PA.
---
I enjoy playing with random people through the new public team system
---
Trying to maximize my builds with the best and most efficient weapons and armor (almost there)
---
CAMP building 
---
I heavily enjoy a game or two of Nuclear Winter. And I'm pretty good at it always finishing in the last 8. Rarely do I finish worse than that 
---
Fully looting and clearing areas. Just kinda cathartic
---
Going from event to event and playing with small to large groups of players. While I can solo almost every event, it's fun to just sit back and enjoy the even then being on your toes the whole time
---
I'm pretty involved in the trading community. So I collect decent weapons and trade for other decent/gimmick weapons just to try everything
---
Getting every gold bullion item is a fun goal, pretty close there too
---
The new legendary run has some cool rewards and just a bonus reward to what I do normally in a session
---
That's a good list. There's more things I'm probably just blanking on, or not mentioning since this is already getting long
---
Agreed
---
also its giveing me a error :(
---
Fix comes post-50 if you don‚Äôt want that much str.  You don‚Äôt have to pick a perk card from the same... path you put your stat point, you can use keys to move the choice over, if that is what you‚Äôre asking.
---
Why the shit can‚Äôt they make it so your pet stays alive.
---
The graphics physically hurt to look at for me, the older games graphics I could tolerate. Yes the combat is better than older games, but they still aren‚Äôt the best   I expected a little more since combat is basically all this game has
---
Why would MODUS kill them? Especially when he‚Äôs the one who contacted the Oil Rig on the west coast.
---
*-fires corks at enemy-*
---
POP-POP-POP-POP-POP...
---
enemy stands there, confused and bewildered as corks bounce of them and gather in a little pile at their feet.
---
Kinda want to see this...
---
You think 3 or 4 have better graphics? Seriously?
---
Great I‚Äôm happy you had a better experience with the game then I did.
---
I have two play modes: Scorch Beasts, and Everything Else.  For SB and SBQ I use X01 power armor + heavy guns, and for Everything Else i run a stealth/melee with a 4 claw, instigating deathclaw gauntlet + 4 unyielding armor and one chamelon piece.
---
It requires some perk swapping, but both play styles are fun.  If you've never snuck up on a Mirelurk Queen/Deathclaw/Snallygaster and took them down with one sneak hit, you ain't living!
---
I carry a set of full Excavator armor, but just for mining, not for combat.  
---
I have never tried the bows or crossbows.  Should I?  What's good about them?
---
When you level up, you first select the attribute you want to rank up, and then you can select ANY perk card. 
---
So if you clicked str then decided you want concentrated fire in perception, you will get 1 str point and 1 concentrated fire perk. To prevent this, you want to be careful to select the Special attribute you want to rank up before clicking around on perks.
---
Doesnt seem to be sorted out
---
Weirdly its counted as casual under armor, and lining cant be properly applied so you just waste resources
---
I've got a question to buyers: does the lining the camo SS armor have, have the same stats of the lining of the regular SS under armor?
---
I know how perk cards work. I‚Äôm just wondering why when I pick a perk card in perception, it adds it to strength
---
You have to do it from the main menu
---
No I don‚Äôt think they have better graphics. But fallout 76 hurts my eyes it‚Äôs really painful for me to look at the game too long.
---
Thank you.
---
I wanna say the original use was Fortnite, and other games adopted the system after Fortnite saw massive success doing it, but where Fortnite saw success by making a cheap say $10 battlepass you bought into with good rewards basically every step, it also provided enough ingame currency that if you were careful you could afford the next battlepass purely off winnings through the first one, and repeat that every single pass. 
---
It made playing the game feel rewarding, and it only took a single $10 investment to keep reaping the benefits.
---
Try to report it to support. But you might as well try to create a new character to check if it is still happening. Or if you are too far in the game to restart, you can try holding the extra points in Strength until lv.50 and them swap as you level.
---
I mean, if it is a bug and they have a quick solution you should be fine, but if takes forever to solve I would just take it and restart.
---
Calm down, Saint Peter.
---
Power armor is really only useful for early game survival, and bracing heavy guns!
---
Never! I stand with The Brotherhood of Steel!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Okay, I actually stand with the People of Appalachia, but It turns out Appalachia doesn't have Minutemen, so BOS it is!
---
Thanks. ;)
---
As far as I'm aware, he never makes any moves to contact the Rig, but MODUS a: doesn't need people who will try and use him as a tool, and b: doesn't want to die, as evidenced by his murder of the Enclave when their civil war broke out. Soldiers and others may be more willing to listen to him and accept his authority, but people who *know* what his purpose was may have a different view on his more recent actions.
---
Are you on console? If so restart the game. When you go to the character menu on the main screen you can select new from there
---
Initially, I would only use Power Armor when I needed extra carry weight. Now I'm at the point where wearing it actually drops my carry weight by a bunch because I don't have the flux to upgrade it at all. So now the only time I wear my Excavator PA is when I am farming lead or going into a nuke zone.
---
Where‚Äôs it at?
---
I would like to see a system where we could offer jobs to other players.
---
I haven't missed one of those challenges yet, and I really am not having to grind for it.  But I make sure to keep "Lover's Embrace" running, along with Cranberry relish, cobbler, and juice for roughly %22 percent XP boost, along with being in an Event Team.  I'm level 210.
---
&gt;why when I pick a perk card in perception, it adds it to strength
---
That's not how it works. When you level up, you FIRST select the attribute to increase, THEN select any perk card that's available at your level. The two are completely separate. If STR goes up, that means you selected STR to increase.
---
What do you use?
---
It‚Äôs a special radioactive cork. That‚Äôs how the Prydwyn floats...
---
Last achievement for me too. I was So angry after reading the ones I already had (and have purchased from players over a year of playing) yet didn‚Äôt get the achievement. Honestly, I think I‚Äôve only found like 5 in the ‚Äúover world‚Äù since I started playing. Good luck to you and me both!
---
Now end game is farming score or xp for legendary run and doing all reasonable public events for treasury notes, so you can buy gold bullion stuff and craft your own legendary gear.
---
The mindless SBQ grind has been replaced with a mindless daily quest grind. They also introduced a mindless seasonal grind. But don't worry, in the next patch they'll add a mindless Wendigo Colossus grind, and I hear they're really going to spice things up after that with another mindless faction grind, but this time for the Brotherhood.
---
Boy delete this. This is a closely kept water wookie secret.

That was not a question, it was the answer

It can be helpful in a pinch, but there are only a few places where you can actually hide for a long time in the water and you're entirely at the mercy of where the circle lands. Plus if the water is shallow, you may think you're hidden but people can see and shoot you pretty easily. Remember if you're in a bush, you can be totally still. But swimming you're always moving, so you have to be in deep water or water with junk on the surface.
---
There are far better hiding places with strategic value. For example if you're in the mountainous area of Morgantown you can often find a good hiding spot where you are protected on a couple sides and can see people coming from a long way away.
---
Turn off fill team before choosing NW and you can already play without other team members.
---
Ok I will tell you exactly what happened. I made a new character that is going to be a bloodied commando build. I unlocked the perk card concentrated fire but instead of having two in perception I had one. Then it added that one special point to strength when it should have gone to perception.
---
Haha I realized that after someone said the same thing. Thanks
---
Ok thanks a lot for your feedback
---
No need for foundations, it goes on the ground
---
Endgame is now just grinding XP and doing SCORE dailys, many people don't even bother with anything except specific events they use as XP farms.
---
 Wastelanders content is worth coming back for, but once you get what you want out of it the fun of the game dries up quickly.
---
I can‚Äôt remember, to be honest. But my gut tells me it was a solo item.
---
I think what is obvious is that the developers never play on "normal" accounts.  I'm sure some of them play, but with god mode, unlimited caps, unlimited stash, etc.  If they actually played the same game WE play,  some of the most annoying little things would have been fixed by now.
---
Place only the stairs part on foundation
---
You don't enter the actual game world until you exit the vault. Before that you lack most of the game functionality, even the basic ones. As for example challenges. Therefore the first level to have any effect on level up challenge is level 3. This is normal.
---
Wtf they aren‚Äôt separate. That‚Äôs not how it works, the perk card that you choose determines the special point that‚Äôs leveled up
---
The first two mini events start next month. Then there is something coming in the next season, not sure the extent. But per the Roadmap they won't arrive properly until Winter season so 25 weeks or so.
---
&gt; build a free fusio
---
The new public teams have been a godsend in that respect.  Join one, so that when your game freezes or crash you can re-join the server you were on and get back your workshops.
---
It is a fun game. The progression of the character is pretty amazing. The perks cards system is awesome, customization of weapons, armor, building a CAMP... trolling people around or sneak shooting just for fun is kind of fun lol
---
There are a lot of stuff to do on the game to be honest, basically you can do whatever you want to.
---
The bugs are annoying sometimes, but I find out to have a lot of fun with it anyway.
---
I don't care if you have a fancy looking, perfectly made home. This is the kind of stuff I'll pull my camera out for.
---
I dont play fortnite, I will never know why that's such a common insult. Maybe pickup some better material
---
There isn't alot of tactics in the Fallout BR mode. Honestly rushing head first into a firefight is a better option than others. With how shitty fallout gunplay is compared to other FPS, if your even slightly competent with how to works you can kill others even if they have the first few shots on you
---
I also dont understand how removing flora limits tactics? Hiding tactics? Are you just mad because you can only hide? 
---
Basically, you're an idiot and cant fucking write a proper rebuttal without a major grammar error every sentence. As an idiot once said, "will get you dead"
---
All they need to do is tag it.
---
Isn't there a perk for sprinting, takes it to 0
---
On first read, I thought this was idiotic. Second time through I read it out loud using Rorschach's voice from the Watchmen movie. Slight pause. Sudden understanding. Immediate bliss.
---
This right here explains my problem, I'm trying to get into fo76 but i seem to overwhelmed and get lost in all this farming/grinding and events.
---
The level one you get from a quest is not legacy. The level 50 you used to have a change of spawning is a a legacy.
---
The last year? It‚Äôs not even a few months old.
---
All they gotta do is leader of pack. Three legendary wolfs low level and 3 legendary weapons of armor
---
There‚Äôs this thing called google and YouTube I‚Äôm sure they can figure it out. It‚Äôs not like it is some privileged info we long time players have üòÇ
---
You can't seriously expect the game to be developed and balanced aroung new players. You learn as you play the game and get better, that's the nature of things in games like this.
---
Maybe they just muted you
---
That would be awesome üòÉ
---
Wastelanders is a few months old, the base 76 game is almost 2 years old, and the nuclear winter mode is a year old
---
No it doesn't. You go to level up, the first screen is which SPECIAL you want to upgrade. Then it shows you a list of perks to choose from, filtered to whichever SPECIAL you just chose; you can then change the filter to pick a different perk. So you could upgrade STR and pick Concentrated Fire, if you so chose.
---
Galens paintings always spice up the camp. Rest in piece our furry friend
---
Yes this is on the top of the list for things to fix for sure...
---
Any particular source? 100% sounds like something they would do though
---
I think being too low and clipping through the ground is the issue.  
---
When I had 2 foundations stuck in place I had to extend the stucture out to lower terrain so the last foundation was slightly higher above the ground, then delete the first 2 "stuck" parts and delete the rest of it after.   
---
Seems like the lowest point the game lets you place foundations is actually *too* low in some cases, so it treats the foundations like they're "floating" under the ground instead of sitting on top of it.
---
Looks like the loader to the pin ball machine
---
They need all the cork to soundproof a room where we can all go to cry quietly, after our minds snap from all this pointless resource farming.
---

---
They are in fact separate. You can actually take a point in STR and then a PER perk card. You pick your point first, then when you go to pick your card there's option to change the stat at the bottom of the screen.
---
It's the safest way to great someone that doesn't spread germs.
---
Leader of the Pack is easy enough for newer players I think, plus there are three guaranteed legendaries right there. Though I guess if there are other people in the event one-shotting them they may not get a chance to tag them so that‚Äôs unfortunate
---
This sounds like the same bug I had yesterday which also prevented me from interacting with anything including the perk cards. First time it happened for me and I had to switch servers to fix it.  You have to get to level 3 for the level up challenge to work, this part is not a bug.
---
Short answer, no. It‚Äôs listed under the casual under armor group, so it will have the same stats as any other casual under armor lining. 
---
I believe most buyers thought, as I did, that it was a skin for the secret service under armor but it clearly states in the atomic shop that it‚Äôs listed under the casual under armor group.
---
Or you could lower the barrier of entry for the game mode by letting new players just assign whatever special allocation they want independent on the adventure mode character so they can just get into the game and start grinding NW perks.
---
Thanks, this sucks
---
Some days I can do them two/three times a day. Some days I can‚Äôt do them at all. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Hallucagen takes you places, but places you DON'T want to go.
---
This, and tbh I couldn't see myself using it often even as a joke 
---
Thumbs down is usually enough
---
Or a nuke
---
Instigating would be better
---
With just finishing the challenges, I believe you will not be able to complete the season in time.
---
To be safe, I would suggest that you will have to farm about 250k to 300k xp per day (for the repeatable score challenge) for approximately 5 weeks to make up for the 3k~ in score/day you would have gotten over the past 4.5 weeks.
---
6000 atoms would get you through a little over 1/3 of the run. If you want to do that i suggest completing the first 65-70 levels by grind, then finishing with atoms. DO NOT atom first, then grind.
---
Everytime I accept they always request the shit I use.. gets to a point I don't bother anymore
---
I'm pretty sure assholes know they're being assholes.
---
And you can't fix stupid, so...
---
Damn right. God bless America, and God bless the Enclave!
---
Do you have strength 20?
---
Ad Victorum
---
No, I'm saying there's bugger all recolors as it is. And the recolors that do appear are things that people are genuinely asking for. You're still getting a ton of new crap with every new ATX dump on the patch.  
---
You are getting a lot of new content with each ATX update, don't bring the 'The Atomic Shop stuff is all recolors' argument because it really doesn't make any sense.
---
I need Uranium Fever, man
---
Elton britt gotcha
---
Of course! Fresh from the Brahmin; so good it even cures your rads!
---
At around 30 Agl, I can't tell a difference when using or not using the sneak card.  If it is still doing anything, it is certainly a very diminished amount.
---
Oh cool, thanks! Should i take all my bulk junk out my shop then lol?
---
Level 270. I don't use it. I'm not clomping around like some giant goofball. I  wear fancy clothes, like a proper lady, while I sneak around murdering everything in my path.
---
Look, I don‚Äôt have anything to do with the dev decisions. Personally I‚Äôd have no problem with a ‚Äòclone‚Äô character that had all the level ups to spend but zero gear/loot. No game progress at all, just the level and perks. Assign your SPECIALs, choose your perks, and then go start the game.
---
Unyielding armor
---
Mmm, you can really taste the green...
---
A guess would be 30 - 35, but there are many factors, you have to test it with your build and playstyle.
---
I've seen him go down from lvl 68 Scorched (he gets back up).
---
Ah ok thanks
---
Possibly. Probably. They did one of those inside the vault things about it but I'm just too lazy to look up the numbers.
---
There are plenty of daily challenges to complain about (build camp structures!?).  This is actually a decent one.
---
Ive tried those ;(
---
It‚Äôll be tough, but it‚Äôs possible, there are people who completed it in less time than that. You‚Äôll need to boost your XP gains as much as possible and remember that the repeatable XP challenge is going to be more efficient than most of the Nuclear Winter challenges. 
---
If you‚Äôre going to spend Atoms, wait until the last day. Higher ranks take more SCORE to get, but still only cost 150 Atoms each‚Äîso it makes sense to grind out the low ranks and buy out the high ones if you have to. You‚Äôll also get a bunch of Atoms along the way to help with that in the end.
---
6000 Atoms will get you 40 ranks, so 30 days is plenty of time to get to rank 60.
---
The ammunition factory.
---
I would hold off on spending atoms on ranks until the last day or two and grind as much as you can. I wasn‚Äôt playing for the first few weeks of it either so now I‚Äôm playing catch-up (currently on rank 30). I‚Äôm hoping to get at least most of it done without spending atoms and hopefully what I have saved up from 1st will be enough to get the rest of them
---
Already bad enough that they removed the ability to loop the fo1st sounds because of whiners like you. Find an actual problem to complain about.
---
Exactly, sometimes followed by a tantrum for not giving them my best gun.
---
Meanwhile I have so many games on my plate that keep a daily, weekly or monthly incentive, plus work, that I can barely find the time to get on this game every day.
---
Social Distortion's cover from the Live at the Roxy album. ;)
---
I would recommend switching out a few SPECIAL points to upgrade your strength, because I think it‚Äôs safe to assume you will have a lot of medical supplies in your inventory. A singular stimpak doesnt weigh much, but when you‚Äôre carrying 100 at a time and even more radaway, it adds up.
---
Yeah, I'm not giving away any of my arsenal, you wanna buy? Go to my vendors
---
Oh hilarious-- people are calling a Bethesda product not by the name they gave it, but by an Epic name?
---
Guess we know which company won the culture war lol
---
No shit, you ain't getting my hard earned junk for some Colossus ball licking cosmetics. If there's not some serious weaponry involved, I'm out.
---
Even heavy weapons characters can get along fine without power armor. I did buy all three levels of the armor reduction only in PA perk for special occasions, but I hardly ever use it.
---
I‚Äôm confused. Are you genuinely getting nauseated? Or is that just an expression you‚Äôre using to convey how annoying the camp building is.
---
what console I wanna join
---
Great, now Poor Biv will be getting even less visitors.
---
This.
---
You can knife them to death they're all level 5 or so.
---
It ends mid September you have around a month and a half to go not 30 days. I checked the schedule and there is another double score event planned to. Don‚Äôt panic and use atoms yet the latter ranks require more score to get.
---
Because EEEOOOOWEWEEOOOOEOIEEE is just wonderful to listen to
---
 Just looked it up, better get those 300 cork scraps out my shops i have listed for free!

I like to tediously cook cranberry relish, one at a time, in between SBQ fights. Fun! So much fun! Oh, and umm, cork. There's cork, too.
---
As a Berserker build with a Gauss Shotgun I agree with your opinion. I die by my own hand more than by any wasteland creature

Oh why tf did they think that was a good way for it to work, that makes it seem like you can only choose the one in the point you‚Äôve picked

This is the latest iteration of the build

---
Wait until you try to hang something on the wall inside.....
---
Enjoy that busted piece of shit. I'm sorry Bethesda but to re-list that for sale knowing it's collision mechanic is screwed wasn't cool.
---
I've had that sporadically happen over the last couple of days. I just vats a different enemy and then went back to the first one.
---
It really depends on how you play.  I am bloodied ranged with one chameleon gear piece and no unyielding at all.  Agility from all sources but before any food buffs is 20 and I do not use the sneak card.  My main weapon is a suppressed pipe revolver and I use cover and move position frequently.  Enemies are dead before they find me.  Melee or holding one position most likely would benefit from more agility and the sneak card.
---
Not everyone want to trade, and some players are agressive with their requests.
---
That looks much better
---
I miss blowing limbs off ghouls, and I also miss the glowing ones reviving dead ones
---
God bless the Enclave.
---
We need the Plans for the Enclave Plasma gun and then we need a new Enclave Plasma Gatling!
---
Me. I hate it. I'm so glad it's not required.
---
Maybe if you no life it but plz don't do that yourself
---
No one thought that all that cork would be for blocking out sonic attacks?
---
So the nailer, gutter, civil unrest, and perfect storm?
---
Thanks I'll try
---
Me with the stone benches :(
---
Thanks
---
I'd assume the idea is so everyone is not a on a team so as to balance it out a bit.
---
That said, I doubt there's enough people playing NW solo to be worth the servers to do it.
---
TBH i'm surprised Bethesda is still pushing NW as much as they are, i can't see where their profit is, no ones going to buy 76 just for NW, and 90% of the Atom store is not applicable to NW - it is quite the puzzle.
---
Worth mentioning that's 60$ worth of atoms. Odds are all the rewards will be in the shop may be better to wait
---
Ya that's what I'm worried about
---
I wasn't saying don't use it I was just saying turn it down a bit
---
thanks im trying to put it on a 3x3 foundations under it i cant get it to work for some reason
---
They barely are though.
---
Well technically you can get another 50 scrip each day by doing dailies, so, you're limited to 4 legendary modules, but yeah, the scrip limit is terrible.
---
I swear I've genocided the ghouls 3 times over this season. Yeah let's agree for the high levels it sucks ( I'm a level 252)
---
Tell that to the Responders and Free States.  BOS screwed them over.
---
That happened to me today. . . PS4?
---
The AC Slater
---
And then a week later you get unbanned.
---
Any train station or red rocket.
---
Other player's camps as well.
---
There is one in Artisans corner of Whitesprings, and one at each of the NPC settlements as well.
---
You can make a stash box at your camp or use one at other players camps.
---
Ok cool, thx for the advice. I'll just start grinding and wait on buying unlocks until the very end.

Set up your camp over a lead extractor and visit frequently to empty it.  Lucky hole mine is even better.  Workshops are pvp zones, taking one is pretty much an open invitation nowadays since they made it more difficult for us to have proper pvp fights.  Also you don't have to bother with the defend mission, just wait for the retake workshop and go and kill everything when you feel like it.
---
I'm lost?
---
I think bushes are actually better, you dont always have water in the last circles, but the bushes remain usually until the last one
---
Ok. Sounds like I can do it. Thanks for the write up.
---
Yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs worth it, but it‚Äôs there.
---
Look, I just want to protect the gold. It's not you, it's me.
---
There at every train station
---
Almost every player camp has one too
---
Elijah is WAY scarier than even the Nuka World Raiders.
---
It's so weird when I can't find the basic things at player camps lol
---
If you dont turn in the importance of communication you will get retirement plan the next day
---
Yeah, that one‚Äôs tough for new players/low levels. Conversely, leveling up is hard for high levels. Most challenges are stupid easy, having one or two actually take some effort is ok.
---
In fairness, Maxson didn't agree with that part.  Too bad his decendants didn't feel the same way.
---
you can run through the walls and back of it smh
---
When you can only buy 3 legendary modules at max without dailys to doesnt really matter but its gonna be hell useful during the mega sale.
---
I‚Äôm moving everyone‚Äôs camp there now
---
I can solo defend a single NPC, which is all that's needed. I start most of this event. I watch as players hop on top of the safe spots and don't stop all the enemies running through. I'd love to pitch on the ore. But if the squatters can't do the bare minimum and protect ONE NPC, I go back to defense.
---
TLDR um, idk to read and pick a job
---
Time to move your camp to another location perhaps? As it obviously hinders your ability to play the game. My camp space was taken once maybe 3 months ago.
---
Because we're peasants and they are too busy hoarding tech.
---
I was honestly insulted that they announced a few months ago that they are planning on bringing perk loadouts near the end of the year. It took a single modder around 2 weeks to make a functional perk loadout mod. This has been a VERY VERY VERY VERY highly requested feature since the BETA of the game, and they only really start caring about it halfway through year 2. And even then, instead of something to whip up for the next update, it's something they shove off for another half year later
---
I know man bit it took me ages to build it.
---
Yep, just saw this in the discord. So for anybody else wondering this is indeed the real list
---
What exactly is the harm? Bethesda's openly endorsing cheating and duping, not sure why they would care about datamining
---
Much higher.
---
As long as he got traveling pharmacy I wouldn't worry too much about the carry weight, as even 100 stimpacks would merely weigh 10 lbs. But that's something he'll probably need to see while playing, as it may get a bit annoying depending on the weight of his gear, ammo and junk he wants to haul.
---
Take a bunch of pictures of your camp or even make a video. It's easy to rebuild and can even be better at the end.
---
Aww I didn't know that!! I thought it was genetic cat photos.. 
---
I'm adding this picture and a RIP Galen sign above it just gotta work around my lack of budget
---
Should really ask yourself this first,.. are the rewards something you must have? 
---
The next season may have better rewards you would rather use atoms on (being if you keep playing casually).   
---
Just a thought, that‚Äôs all, it‚Äôs been suggested the next season run may be more BOS theme rewards and if that tickles your fancy more u may regret blowing all your atoms on this run. Unless money no obstacle.
---
That's not a bug, that's a hacked .50 cal with a beam splitter and a bunch of hidden mods for damage
---
yep, I helped with some of the investigating, hopefully will be fixed soon.
---
And they literally knew, then listed it for sale again in the store.
---
I had a previous post about it responded to by ladydevann about the mechanic and within no time at all its for sale again.
---
Clearly the Devs and the atx team aren't the same peeps and don't communicate. It's a shame as I loved that damn thing.
---
Not a secret at all, there‚Äôs a bunch of y‚Äôall literally fish in a barrel just waiting to get taken out lmao I‚Äôll swim down and have a team mate shoot next to my indicator or simply wait for em to arise, hell some portions of the water you could straight see the player silhouette, especially in grafton dams water
---
Jokes on you you have kill 1,000,000 aliens in a sidequest to activate the event which you have a 0.00000000000000001% chance of getting the blueprint to move my camp
---
Plot twist. Each colossus has 3.
---
Level ups give you two different decisions to make.   
---
You first pick a SPECIAL stat, then you pick a card. They are two separate choices, even though the UI isn't particularly clear about it.    
---
The card you pick is independent from the SPECIAL you raised, so if you just bash the button to get to card selection you've raised Strength to get there, because the "Pick a SPECIAL" screen defaults to STR.   
---
People have had trouble with this since BETA. The menu could definitely be clearer about it. Moving a point after lvl 50 at least shows your current SPECIAL as you're making your choice, the normal level up screen doesn't. You have to back out to your perk deck to see your current SPECIAL stats.
---
&gt;immortalized
---
God that reminds me of the story of a guy that was a huge Fallout fan and had his own character in Nuka World DLC
---
Compared to getting one of those gorilla plans to drop? I like those odds
---
RIP kitty. Got a memorial up in my CAMP for him.
---
What level are you?
---
Lol. Of course!
---
I guess if the 3 star just happened to have three really bad perks. But what I would rather do is sell the meh one stars for scrip and then use that to buy another three star. Rinse and repeat until you get something decent.
---
I only roll 2 star. Idrc if my weapon has 15% rs or not.
---
I guess you've never played Fallout 4?
---
I love how much this shows about the game. The ripper is affected even though it was removed from the main loot pool before this bug originally popped up. The paddle ball is on there for some god forsaken reason. The gauntlet is up there, showing that they most likely just straight up copied the power fist and the bug along with it
---
I‚Äôm out of the loop. What‚Äôs up with cork?
---
Dude! You are hereby exiled from the brotherhood of bush/water Wookiees! Thou shall not fire upon your fellow Wookiees!
---
Yeah. I haven't looked at the game board closely yet. I only know about the ammo converter, clean sink, and PA. I never wear PA either. I will take a look at the board tonight.
---
What is the paint scheme you have on the armor?
---
I have decent rolls on my main guns, might as well try 3*.  
---
If you're still trying to get rolls to suit your build, probably best to roll 1 or 2* until you get a suitable effect, then try for 3 after you already have a decent setup.
---
I would expect a comment like this to get downvoted to all hell. Guess I was wrong.
---
The point of solos mode is that no one has teammates and everyone is fighting for themselves. It's pretty good in Warzone.
---
A serious answer buried in a sea of jokes. Thank you, good redditor.
---
It would be great to have a mode without teammates. It would even the score and be a real survival mode. As it is I usually make it to top 10 until a trio of frogleggers finds me.
---
After playin avidly for the almost the past year, (lvl 300+ now) I‚Äôve seen friendships and enemies form in the vault. Aside from the actual mode itself, the people i run into all the time are what keeps me playing. Rumors around the vault twist like a game of telephone, cliques started to form and people genuinely started to form relationships, good and bad. 
---
Playstyle wise somebody‚Äôs mentioned my role in the team is that of a facilitator, I like to take advantage of my teammates aggro and do some drive by shooting with my shotgun. Think of it as a power forward position in NW lol dirtiest things I‚Äôve done is straight up following somebody and emptying a whole clip into their back, which I admit I do a little too much. 
---
Nothin more fun than fighting the same people and getting their numbers.
---
Death is a preferable alternative to the Enclave
---
Idk about low spawn rate, or mabye I'm lucky. Killed 3 in a single day in fissure prime
---
Hello America. It's me, your president, John, Henry, Eden.
---
I will post this daily until bethesda patches.
---
His balls are always bouncing, to the left and to the right...
---
And each post will become more and more aggressive and assertive.
---
Do you remember where they "updated" a fallout game and removed music?  Yeah, probably not.  They didn't want to renew the licensing agreement and just patched out the music that was affected.
---
Hahaha thank you, this is the type of post other posts aspire to be.
---
Full unyielding combat armor, 2 pieces mixed with +1 Strength.  15 strength without bonuses.  I eat two soups right now ( brain fungus for int, corn for ap regen) and whiskey. I run my health very low to max my buffs. I also have all mutations except carnivore
---
That‚Äôs why I think running solo in NW is great, even if you‚Äôre up against whole teams. And to me, I‚Äôd rather be out learning the lay of the map, or combing the map for loot and other players instead of planting my ass somewhere and hoping for the best. To be honest after playing for a while winning isn‚Äôt as much fun for me as fuckin around and fighting with another player is, or finding new ways to approach a fight is what I now play NW for. The repeating rosters too. Wish we could keep track of our NW stats at least.
---
I've tried talking to him for several minutes in a row and he wouldn't give me the mission.
---
That's where your mistake is. Workshops and peace don't mix.
---
In my own personal opinion the rewards are not worth spending atoms on. Do as much as you can and call it good. Their is a few good rewards like 250 scrip and the blood eagle handmade paint but definitely nothing worth 6000 atoms. If it were me id save them and see what new things come into the atom shop / what the next season looks like.
---
One of the better decisions Bethesda has made of late is to have the ammo converter and clean sink be very early unlocks (level 4 and 5 IIRC), so you won't need to do much to unlock those.
---
Don‚Äôt you have a camp?
---
Well to create tension and a good versus evil situation on servers, also to maybe encourage a little conflict.
---
Another day older and deeper in rads?
---
What about cork and bos?
---
Apparently the sneak archer meta doesn't just apply to Skyrim...
---
There's a community event upcoming for the Fractured Steel lead-up which has us fetching resources for the person at the ATLAS Observatory.
---
One of those requests is: 200,000,000 Cork.
---
A resource with very, very little use in the game.
---
All
---
I suggest blocking everyone sharing the same place with you.
---
Nope
---
Cork does make for a good insulator, yes.
---
It's just hardly ever used in any of the crafting recipes in the game and generally just takes up inventory space.
---
You should instead post a ticket to Beth support. 
---
Not fill up this sub reddit with another "Queen 1-Shot Post". We have all been through it too many times before.
---
Naturally, we'll get a new Daily quest for Biv to have him sample it.
---
Go find some good public domain music, bud. I'm sure there's some great ones. Camptown Races and shit.
---
Imagine being so entitled to think Bethesda is going to fix a bug (lol) just because you‚Äôre big mad.
---
"40 caps" implies that you're high level (fast travel costs scale with level, up to a point). How have you not seen stash boxes all over the place by now?
---
"Starting to get sick of this game!...noobs,low levels"
---
You sound like an entitled elitist prick. Its a multiplayer game, you should cool your jets and take a break because the next step from here is you become just pure toxic and no one will want to play with you at all. 
---
Cheers
---
I never do these dailies at my own camp, just in case shit like this happens.
---
I'm lvl 19 and a level 125 came to a workshop I had, after being at another workshop for a while, with full power armor. I evaded him for a bit and got a lot of shots off. He leaves and comes back with a minigun. Then after claiming the workshop just goes to his shop on the other side of the map and just stays there for the whole time I was on ( over an hour and a half).
---
I keep seeing all these posts about the BOS being related to a shit ton of cork scrap. Can somebody please clarify?
---
why is everyone obsessing over cork all of a sudden
---
You picked the wrong aquatic monster.
---
When I was doing the purveyor I always went with 2 stars as I was after explosive shotguns.
---
Now I have Gauss Shotgun and SS armour plans, i'm only ever buying modules.
---
Sometimes when you first log in the ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù option doesn‚Äôt show up in the main menu, I have to go into adventure mode than back out to the main menu for it to show up. Kind of a pain when I‚Äôm trying to play my alt
---
Yup. PS4. Was kinda crazy.
---
i agree with your sentiment, but Warframe isn't a good example. maybe things have changed since i last played but that game gates everything unless you want to pay to speed up production. what is it like 3 days to craft a new frame?
---
I get that point too
---
Haha just sharing a few, so much stuff has happened in this mode and I wish more people had good experiences w it, especially PC players. Consoles have pretty healthy NW communities. 
---
Kinda funny, what I mentioned here has been a fun topic of talk between some groups and I, we feel as if there‚Äôs a side story w those who avidly participate in NW is pretty much a vault experiment in itself, meshing w the same people for weeks at a time letting things fester and build up, imagine having the same folks in a vault for a whole year and were basically like next wave of those holo tapes we find layin in vault 51 lol 
---
Sorry it‚Äôs random, another funny story I remembered was when my pal fell from the top of a cliff onto ground level, only to get snuck up on by a hesitant bush wookie who then thirsted her hahaha sometimes ZAX really just be handing you kills
---
Yeah two shot explosive is arguably the best legendary perk combo. Keep it, or sell it for a lot of caps. Don‚Äôt scrip it, you will almost definitely not get another gun as good as that. Can you go check what the third perk is? Might determine if it‚Äôs even more valuable than it currently is.
---
I only ever roll 3 star, go big or go home. After you reach a certain point it becomes harder and harder to top your best gear.
---
I'll assume Whitesprings. Top of the World. Something like that?
---
I built remote and I've not been asked to server change ever since.
---
Sound maybe but i am a normal guy that just want to have fun playing a game. Everbody is welcome as long there not acting like i said in my first message.
---
‚ÄúSome‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúAll‚Äù
---
Does not compute. Especially given the drops I have
---
They use too, this has been a recent thing for me anyways. Up until now i haven‚Äôt had an issue with people wanting to fight over workshops. The legendary run has made more people try to take them and I‚Äôll usually show up to challenge and get on the mic and tell them if they give me the thumbs up ill let them take it but I‚Äôm gonna take it right back. Usually not a problem. But if you start shooting the turrets or trashing the resource collectors i guess i have to fight over it. AND if people really wanna pvp why is no one eve doing hunter hunted.
---
This how I hope they are added. It allows regular drops to still be important and that is very important.
---
Whaaaaaa?
---
Or the scorchbeasts sonic attack
---
Why don't you look?  Anything older than 1940 should be there.  Half of the first 3 fallout games had music from that time period.
---
This topic was discussed on the fo4 steam forums years ago.
---
I discarded a comment that revealed how to replicate this because based off of community feedback thus far they are being assholes so ill be an asshole back. I will keep this a secret so bethesda wont ruin my fun :)
---
I will one shot kill any scorchbeast queen i see with the means i previously revealed. Thanks to the assholes below who ruined it for all of you:)
---
Fallout 4. Glowing Ones had an AOE attack that would revive other ghouls
---
Shit, i didnt know that
---
And btw you know how it feels like when you grinded youre ass of for the jetpack and a player with one comes to youre base an says : haha noob i glitched t.notes so i got it in 1 week! Thats makes me sick.
---
Really....u think they work on weekends??? ROFL....also, they only really update on Tuesdays, with the update 21 this week....maybe then.
---
Work on weekends...smh
---
Your original post doesn't say normal. It screams entitled elitest prick. The game isn't catered around you. Its catered around everyone. 
---
If you don't like that go play a singleplayer game or get over it and chill out.
---
Since when? Because I‚Äôve certainly got items on that list that don‚Äôt have limb damage as second star.
---
Uranium Fever. All you need to do is tag it.
---
My bad, it‚Äôs just two shot and exploding
---
Ubisoft goes steamworks bye bye always on DRM. Idiots suck and ruin everything bye bye always online.
---
Because sometimes people want an extra attribute point somewhere other than the perk they‚Äôre picking. For instance, say they got a good perk card in a pack for strength so they just need the extra strength attribute and then they pick a perception card because they wanted that too.
---
Whoa. I missed F4. I played from the PC originals through...
---
Thank fuck they can't do that anymore...
---
Thanks i will keep killing scorchbeast queens in fallout 76 game this fast :) assholes like you ruin everything, always on life. Bye bye always on DRM.
---
Explosive is nerfed. I got a number of them that I sold off cheaply. Preferred bloodied or Instigating for better damages or one-shot
---
You ruined everything always always bye bye bye bye
---
You know what the next step is?
---
You block them, if you can prove they cheated for it then report them.
---
All I'm hearing is poor me poor me. I just started playing mate 2 weeks and i only just made lvl 30 so spare me your tears. 
---
You can also take over a workshop and make a stash box.
---
I havent aeen one you are lying liars will go off on DRM
---
certainly a couple of months
---
Ugh. Thankfully the vast majority of players are not like that. But I absolutely infuriating to run into one.
---
I have a full suit of Excavator that I only use for mining and nuke zones. Otherwise I am full on stealth+rifles.
---
Any non chocolate? Am allergic?
---
Private server is just a server that is really boring unless you have a lot of grinding yo I want to do by yourself or with a group of friends the only thing worth while with 1st is the scrap box sadly everything else isn‚Äôt worth the money well almost everything the atom is kind of nice at times
---
I dont care what you think right now , i know i am not an ashole in this game.
---
Yes! I run one exclusively. 
---
I‚Äôm pumping out ~360 points of damage with each pull of the trigger. 
---
See if you can find a lower VATS cost or quad TSE, since those are my two biggest gripes with that otherwise awesome rifle.
---
What if they pull a bait-and-switch, and the "Brotherhood" that shows up is actually an Enclave invasion?
---
Played a game with my tent. Some level 350+ kept jumping on my tent so I started moving right as he/she Jumped for it
---
All normal things that affect stealth should help your CSS.   
---
My current char only has 4 or 5 AGI and no sneaky perks (i just use CSS under my PA) so I get spotted pretty easily when I move, no matter how slow.   
---
I don't know if you can get high enough AGI to make sneak redundant, but obviously take that into consideration. I'm just saying CSS doesn't automatically make your character good at sneaking, in my experience.  
---
EDIT: To clarify (because somebody is going to say it), I'm not talking about sneaking in PA. I mean my non sneak build can still get spotted easily, while being cloaked by the stealth suit.
---
Fair enough. I have to get through the horrible redownloading of the game. I guess I'll look for RPish group while I wait on the game.
---
the cork is a lie.
---
Whats to complain about with camp structures? I just build and scrap half walls until I'm done. It takes about 30 seconds and about 20 wood maybe
---
Hunter hunted is hard to find people for. Few people even know what it is, and it is an orchestrated event that forces a certain type of PvP. It is not a plain 1v1 or 1v4 or 4v4 or whatever.
---
Consider yourself lucky that most people are food builds. Whenever I see ANYBODY in a workshop, I immediately drop what I'm doing and rush over to kill them. Same for bounties, even if I am paying more than I make from the kill. I just enjoy PvP, and Bethesda as well as the majority of this community, have all but removed it from the game. 
---
Nuclear Winter is fun, but I don't typically enjoy battle Royale format, I prefer open world, repeatable PvP. With all the chaos that comes from the Fallout universe. 
---
Workshops are also bugged so sometimes you cannot see if someone even owns it. Or that it even is a workshop. 
---
Honestly us PvP players are just so tired of being ignored by Bethesda, and discriminated against in the Fallout community, that we don't care anymore. People will call you a griefer for attacking a lv 100+ just the same as a lv 10. They will call you a cheater and "report" you for "harassing" them in a game, even when within the confounds of the rules. They get upset when you take their junk and they feel entitled to own workshops without contest.
---
I have three trap bases, three characters including a lv 35 "twink" (specced as bloody commando with ass/sent armor and a BE laser) and all I do is harass other players now, especially because it is entertaining seeing just how sensitive some of these people are. They would be eaten alive in any other competitive online setting that isn't so focused on hand holding.
---
It‚Äôs more grindy than it ever was but a ton of new content since you haven‚Äôt played in so long I‚Äôve been playing since beta and have liked seeing the game change but some stuff did not at all change for the better.
---
Do you know how many caps it might be worth?
---
Better yet just give us score for each challenge with no time gate. at most a weekly max so people don't buy 1k shotgun shells from a vender.
---
 Example
---
For every level up 500 score(max 10 levels). For every legendary killed 250(max 30 kills). For every 10 camp items placed 50 score(max 10/100 items). For every item bought at another players(max 35) this would be a lot easier to manage too.
---
Holy shit that's genius. I didn't even think about that.
---
My character is level 250 and some random level 4 joined the public group I was in.  I had a level 5 TSE pipe pistol that I had gotten from the fasnacht event on an different account and a couple of 3 star level 5 armour pieces.
---
So I decided to be nice and gift this random stranger with these items and 600 rounds of ammunition.  I waited around and waited and waited until they levelled up to 5 and then waited more until they went out into the world again to use this weapon I would of loved to have coming right out of the vault.
---
After about an hours total time they ventured out again and they went after some ghouls that were in the area and broke my heart when they pulled out the same hunting rifle that they were using when I first came upon them.
---
And this is why PC gaming will die inevitably. Congrats OP, you're officially party of the problem!
---
Idk seems to be a new one spawning magically everyday.
---
Honestly I'd like for them to convert Sutton into the Vault 76 City, I mean it's where The Overseer is from so it would make sense.
---
Lever for range handmade or fixer for close up
---
So I guess. you‚Äôre planning on selling it? It honestly depends on how much you want to sell it for. Some people would pay anything for a two shot explosive, some people wont. By default it is extremely valuable, so I would say anywhere between three and five thousand caps is reasonable. Are you on ps4? I would definitely buy that from you if are.
---
IDGAF.
---
I bought that Samurai outfit, so maybe Samurai Santa. Doesn‚Äôt have the same ring to it tho. ü§£
---
Gast travel to whitesprings service entrance. Turn around. Will see small alley beside a bus. Lots of brain fungus too.
---
I always figured they were they whitesprings guests
---
I am on PS4 but I‚Äôm not sure about selling it, I was just curious on how much it was worth, thanks for the help though, and if I plan on selling it in the near future, I‚Äôll hit you up
---
Handmade makes a great semi-auto. 5.56 is generally plentiful as well.
---
Honestly though I was dead set on sticking with semi-auto until I tried auto, haven't looked back, and the SPECIAL requirements are basically the same, hell they can be swapped between relatively quickly even. Worth giving a try imo.
---
No but I want to. Please tell me you took a screenshot.
---
When I saw the change to max inventory, I gave up.
---
Its bull that they decided to drastically limit how much you could carry in a game series that has always rewarded our hoarding behaviors.
---
If I can find a group that cares less about getting to the end game, and cares more for running around with friends and RPing the survivors resettling the world. 
---
I dont want to grind towards the most powerful gear.
---
I want to equip what fits my character and dick around. 
---
Tend to muh farm and go all old man Jenkinson on people walking by my camp.
---
Good.  I've been looking for a place to put all these leftover downvotes.
---
Better gear gives you get a better recycling return on your script.
---
1‚òÜ = 20%
---
2‚òÜ = 30%
---
3‚òÜ = 40%
---
If you have nothing and are trying to find something usable then the cheap stuff is better. If you're trying to maximize your limited script looking for upgrades, go for the big rolls.
---
They should be treated like Treasury Notes.

Wow you are making this easy for us.

How to get banned from the subreddit 101
---
Noooo I was so upset with myself. However, I just found out others have as well. We have tons of pics ü§£
---
You likely had a good point. Poor delivery though will spoil any message. Food for thought.
---
No problem, and thanks for keeping me in mind!
---
Well Battlepass is used for any system that follows the same scheme.
---
Apex Legends one is called a battlepass, DOTA2 has one, League effectively has one, Fo76 has one, some mobiles games do one.
---
They're all worse versions of the Fortnite one though, less rewarding, and not self-sustaining like it was.
---
Sorry but two shot explosive is one of the worst weapon effect combos you can get. Both effects got nerfed early 2019 to oblivion. Literally almost any weapon prefix is better than two shot. Which is only 25% increased damage with huge accuracy and recoil penalty. Add is explosive and your weapon will break 4 times as fast as some other and better combos, on top of all other crappy things.
---
Cork
---
Haha yes I do, but that‚Äôs common for some people when doing first person camera views. I believe it‚Äôs related to motion sickness. It mostly happens when I get giant items stuck in front of me and I try to move around. The tip about holding the ‚Äúplace‚Äù button down and moving things away from you definitely helps. I was able to rebuild my camp no problems.
---
Their radio broadcast asks for supplies to be delivered and waiting for them.
---
When you leveled up and were presented with all the different attributes, did you select PER or did you select STR? Because I made the exact same mistake when I first started playing, the interface is not intuitive at all.
---
You aren't travelling the roads enough? There are several spots where he will literally spawn in via a sorta random encounter, and then follow a set path until players are away and he despawns. He's actually very common if you know where to look, and finding him isn't an inconvenience in the slightest.
---
I told y'all that seasonal content causes burnout, forcing you to log in every day!
---
That makes sense, like i said i dont want it them to make it so people cant take it but at least make it a bounty action. If i walk into your camp and pick a lock. I get a bounty. Even if I‚Äôm not seen. I‚Äôd love to be able to go around sneaking into peoples camps and  stealing from collectors but i can‚Äôt. If build up a rad workshop with defenses and crafting stations and water pumps for peeps it gets irritating when some dude comes and fights me for it for as a gas. I had a lvl 8 using my workshop today and that awesome. I ended giving him a bunch of stuff and making him some great low lvl weapons. Helped him while he powered up Poseidon.
---
Yesterday he was sitting perfectly....with a woman standing on his lap. Butt in face. Had to do a double take
---
Love your written work! Will definatly have to finish it after work.
---
Might write up my own file as well now...
---
oh my God I was just thinking this 2 minutes ago during line in the Sand where people use the to survival tent glitch to get them all to drop in the center couldn't get a single kill stood around feeling like I had a thumb up my ass really wanted to give everybody the finger
---
Yeah I understand why they allow you to pick them separately, but I‚Äôve always thought you had a to pick a card in the special point you selected because I didn‚Äôt notice you could cycle through other perk cards because it made it seem like I was locked in to those few choices
---
I feel bad for you, bud.   
---
I've had Grahm and Chally walk straight through my CAMP twice this week.   
---
He gets around. I saw him over beside the Freak Show one day and up at Black Bear Lodge the next.   
---
I guess since folks encounter him at random there's a balancing force that makes some *never* see him.  
---
Yin/Yang shiz
---
Yeah same I really got mad but now I‚Äôm used to the inventory issues and there are a lot of ways to help you hold more with perk cards and legendary armor perks. I‚Äôm on my third character both others were level 200 before I changed again one a rifleman commando not bloodied or junkies second is a bow/pistol junkie and third don‚Äôt know yet. I love just messing around and building camps making unique things at workshops to leave for the next person. It‚Äôs not that you want to grind or anything it just kind of ends up that way with most things locked behind becoming allied with the raiders and settlers and now with the new seasons thing you have that to now work towards so you get forced to do a little bit of grinding to get a good bit of things.
---
The limits to me say that they want people to play other parts of the game more than the grind. My problem is that it feels like world isn't designed to simply keep exploring and lore hunting. For me the questing and lore hunting are the biggest part of the game. Upgrading gear, collecting currencies, etc. all come secondarily from that for me. But covering every inch over and over again to find little to nothing new is kinda lame. 
---
They said from the beginning there wasn't going to be a big team working on this ( I may be misremembering, but that's the impression I got at least). I honestly think they just didn't put enough thought into turning a singleplayer game into a multiplayer one. String and pritt stick.
---
Well i know that having a full auto build is quite amazing   because i have a level 70 account that is in the mist of having a build transfer over to full auto but i just wanted to try something new on this account
---
‚ÄúI've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh√§user Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.‚Äù
---
Where can I get one of those? My highest damage weapon is a vampire harpooner and it's never up to 600 per hit even.
---
Alright, I‚Äôm in. Do you also have brownies?
---
I waited forever for to play 76 because its online. I love the fallout story and bethesda for all the silliness you have to put up with bugs still make a hell of a world but the idea of having to put up with other gamers shenagins is annoying. I actually have fallout 1st but I‚Äôm rarely on private servers cuz they are terrible. Buggy as shit. Plus some things in this game you just need other people to do like sbq or encryptid
---
Mannequins and PA displays.  
---
I think people have been requesting these since pretty much day one.   
---
+1 from me   
---
EDIT: It's stuff that was already in Fallout 4's Wasteland Workshop pack, IIRC
---
Wont be popular.
---
But i can see why the game needs a degree time gatting.
---
With none,the in game economy would disappear over night.
---
I think though the time gatting should roll over every 7 Days rather than every 20 Hours.
---
It would be better for those that work 5 days a week,or just work funny hours on shifts.They could binge play the game when they get the opportunity.
---
I dont see it having a major impact,Players would still have to put the same hours in to achieve.
---
Holy crap this made me laugh more than it should have. Go like... read a book. Or go outside, even given the current state of things I beg you to go outside.
---
Grahm is a real one, hope that dude stays around forever.
---
For what it's worth, I don't think quad and two shot are legit available. They're both primary effects. It would be QE or TSE.
---
Myself and some friends wanted to do the whole helpers of the wasteland thing, but as low lvl characters.
---
You have one high lvl person helping you. Cool.
---
4 or 5 low lvl peeps scrambling around you to "save the day" legendary 
---
None of them play anymore, so I'm stuck looking for a new corner to sit in.
---
Power Armor displays would be awesome!
---
Does that include the croccie backpack plan?
---
This is gonna get a yikes from me dawg.
---
I was just thinking this earlier, I have several outfits that I want to display.
---
Hes a pain to find and I‚Äôm starting to think the wasteland update messed with his route. Iv found him a few times around foundation by the gate and in the garden area. Also a few times around the whitesprings gate patrolled by a sentry bot near the train station. maybe try server hoping between those areas. 
---
Are you by chance on pc? If i happen to see him while playing tonight ill let you know and add you to my world.
---
2000h played , one guy destroyed my camp when i was lower level .
---
I just stood laughing cause it was hilarious when he went around with a powerfist smashing stuff üòÖ 
---
Personally i think its alot about your own attitude, got to remember its still just a game and there are alot of strange people out there and not to be over sensitive
---
Gotcha. Give the handmade a shot, or hell if you want ridiculous range (and definitely frustrating VATS) a gauss rifle. Instigating gauss are extremely powerful for a long range rifle character.
---
And what a food build?
---
no i wont.
---
Take off the sight.
---
Anything 1st person makes me nauseous.  How I build is to move everything slowly and when moving my character I stop moving before turning direction.
---
If your blueprint has more than one foundation piece it unfortunately won't place anywhere.  You will have to break it apart to place it.
---
Now we‚Äôre making strides. 
---
Watch out, enemies of America. We‚Äôve got cookies and intercontinental ballistic missiles.
---
The latter of which may be composed of cookies (neither confirming nor denying that).
---
I understand mate I have people who play for maybe a month or two and give up on playing and won‚Äôt try it out ever again and if they do they play for 15 minutes die and leave so I gave up on finding people to play with I just play with my wife and we have a good time normally. With the new public teams it helps a little bit we have found 2 people to fill up our team finally and we play together almost daily but those only last so long.
---
üñï
---
I believe they exist in the game. My friends and I have seen them. If you've ever seen a hacker camp chances are you've seen a functioning armor display, among other unreleased items.
---
Congratulations! Your comment has achieved the rank: "How to prove you are a baby 101." Fascinating!
---
Give me cosmetics and I‚Äôll join lol
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre joking or not. If you‚Äôre serious, I‚Äôd call you a piece of shit but it would be an insult to the shit.
---
I mean...shes a queen afterall...  chivalry is not dead.
---
Tell the BoS. They're moving in right next door.
---
Hmm... I wonder if it's possible to position the nuke zone so that it just grazes the mine, and the rest of it is aimed more towards the SE where the observatory is...
---
With Cork Inlays.
---
Punjay Boards become Skis.
---
I dropped 300 karma in 1 hour.
---
(Ôºç‚Ä∏·Éö)
---
I think he ment the number of items and total cost to buy them all with gold bullion. That grind is big enough not to have a time gate on top of it
---
im serious. im serious as shit when its fleek.
---
im a level 41 noob and have an obsession with plans that help me decorate my camp. i want the garden plot plans but man no one is selling them :(
---
Yeah I've seen it, I think they need to further develop weapons of that type before they give us the auto axe. Model is cool, though, and it would be a cool weapon to have.
---
 ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Also had this. Thought finally saved up for a full set. Instead of buying piece by piece. Thought yay my grind is finally over. Need 3 servers per armor piece. And that's just to get any set. Nevermind trying to get better legendary effects. Most people should skip it and go straight to secret service armor
---
You found a weakness of mine there, sir.
---
Shine on
---
Ouch.
---
You can‚Äôt sell those I don‚Äôt think, those plans are bought with gold bullion.
---
I heard him over prox chat very confused as to what was happening. It was pure gold.
---
all good, youll get there. Eventually youll be powerful enough in game to successfully complete a silo run to launch nukes. then youll launch the nuke to spawn the scorchbeast queen. then I will ruin your fun and proceed to kill it before you can even lay eyes on it. heres a video of what im talking about:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byXmFdFVc5M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byXmFdFVc5M)
---
yo, i recently completed the vault heist and have 1k of that, is that enough and where do i find it?
---
.... Try gaining Settler rep and looking in the store.
---
Now please you're detracting from the weirdness of this post....
---
Try pipe revolver.  It benefits from both gunslinger and rifleman if you convert a pipe revolver pistol into a rifle.  If you prefer a higher RoF then go for the handmade.
---
find my session first.
---
OP What about pets??? You forgot about how many pets you've killed.
---
He has surprised me at workshops more than I can recall. Usually during the defense event.
---
I wonder if they could just bring in music from older games.
---
I miss the fact that we could move the bodies in fallout 4.
---
No I'm not psychotic! 
---
lol
---
That guy in Foundation, I think his name is Samuel, he sells the plan for 500 bullion, but you need to have a good reputation with the Settlers. (At least Friendly).
---
Mofo is at Foundation constantly. Literally in the middle of it, then walks down the road. It's like a spawn point.
---
He sold me a clock. I liked it.
---
I recently moved there but just outside of the radius. I expect to get bombed a few times so I made my camp cheap af on mats.
---
Why are you posting this? Remorse, 12 step program, or just an odd flex?
---
Was it you yesterday, I showed up to line in the sand to join a team mate, only ones there. I got constant thumbs down so I left and kicked him from my group, which he rejoined them stole my workshop and when I didn't show up to reclaim it he came to my camp and just shot at me while I game him a very nice heart emote. I don't have time for this crap, I want to enjoy my time
---
Shit, this makes the random spawn NPC child mourning at her Kitty's grave even more sad. "Stupid molerats!"
---
RIP Galen &lt;3
---
I couldnt find him no matter how hard I tried.
---
Spent countless hours looking and finally gave up
---
Then he appeared during the fanschat event and got 1 of the items I've been looking for.
---
Isn't he stationary for meat week?
---
I usually find him near the Charleston Landfill whenever I have claimed it.  Not sure if owning the workshop or not makes a difference for him spawning though.
---
unfortunately I cannot defeat any player pets cause Bethesda doesn't like individuals like me. But as far as brahmin goes, I do kill player owned brahmin because im a SJW vegan and people eating normal food offends me. JK I slaughter the brahmin cause its fun as fuck.
---
Yup; I need the ability to show other wastelanders my dedication to our Mothman, via displays of PA I dedicate to Him.
---
Combat rifle?
---
You get the plan from the side quest 'The Motherload' in the Hornwright GQ building
---
On a different note, however, you‚Äôre an asshole because you took all of the gold bullion for yourself instead of sharing it. Shame on you.
---
With excavator and super duper after smelting I'm around 1,400 lead scrap. It can be really easy to miss some and there is a hidden passage which has a lot
---
I asked the other day because my things disappeared from my stash. But now my display too?!? Yeah this is really bad designed. I hope it doesn't take any of my fuzzys or I will be pissed üòÖ
---
You can submit a ticket but it won't do you any good. They can't or won't restore items you have lost. Be that by accident or bug. It's gone.
---
and no that isn't me. that was me a year ago but that got boring. I now ruin queen experiences for people.
---
And the past week and a half I've run into Graham about eight times up at foundation on the way in. One time he was stuck in that little creek under the bridge I just happened to see Moo moo.
---
How much would you be willing to sell it for? I might sell it for scrip or give it to a low level.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byXmFdFVc5M heres an example.
---
I‚Äôm not sure, I don‚Äôt really look into trade values that much, so I don‚Äôt know how much it‚Äôs even worth.
---
Oh yeah, Foundation guys came down from the Pitt.   
---
Perfect excuse.
---
Why wouldn't it be?
---
As you would know from my last post lol
---
Usually junk but I‚Äôve been rolling all 3 star ranged and two weeks ago only could do 300 scrip worth and got 3 bloodied weapons in a row. 1 bloodied lever 2 bloodied fixer( which I use all the time now) 3 bloodied Tesla. So sometimes you get lucky. Tonight I rolled 600 scrip best I got was a bloodied light machine gun. Everything else is scrip.
---
Is this a known bug?
---
TSE got nerfed, but it's still very good on certain weapons.  Anything spray and pray and anything you wouldn't use VATS with is still pretty good.  On a lever action, it's not too bad unless you are sniping.  Instigating explosive lever is my go to; but technically a TSE will do more damage other that a full health 1st shot.  Same with Executioners, which is severely underrated.
---
Again why? Who hurt you
---
It can dissappear due to a rollback.
---
If your game crashes and you got it before the it crashed.
---
The game will used the last save that was probably before the drop or purchase.
---
Sorry :[ same thing happened to me before with weapons.
---
I tend to now logg off safely to the menu which will initiate the save.
---
Also fast traveling or switching servers also actives the game to save.
---
i am now negative karma.
---
if meg can forgive me you can too!
---
Even though I hate the daily limit on caps, I feel if there wasn‚Äôt a limit people would start selling stuff ridiculously high at their camps
---
Today I did all the challenges using my lvl 20 character, as mentioned below Leader of the Pack makes it easy.  Plus almost always you get spawn the wolf heard quest and there may even be a legendary there too
---
look an example of a queen dying in 1 second  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byXmFdFVc5M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byXmFdFVc5M)
---
Great tip! And thank you for pointing out the blueprint issue with foundation pieces. Very helpful!
---
jerks online. I am a jerk in just game. but these jerks are jerk mentally.
---
they wont respond 
---
Bethesda goes steamworks bye bye always on drm
---
That's not even the least believable part.  400 crafts will get you something.
---
There are no more ghouls. 
---
Muties are next.
---
I see Graham every other week or so, but never any of the other things you've seen and I'm over 300 hours. I did see the bot with the cat parade last month for the first time tho
---
I always have this problem. I usually check Charleston station. And everytime I do find him he doesnt have the 1 plan I want - the mirror ball
---
I've had it for quite a while. My game hasnt crashed recently and I typically do quit out to main menu before exiting. Idk how this happened. :(
---
Sucks.
---
His spawn rate is low. Like 8%
---
Joining a match and sitting in water for 20 minutes sounds like a whale of a time
---
I prefer ground pounder because of increased accuracy. TS and explosive have terrible accuracy
---
Was doing a PP.  The level 51 glowing anglers were 1-shotting people in power armor.  Sometimes those things are buuuuuugged.
---
...ok, yeah, that (and indeed specifically that xD) also made me grind a little. But it still wasn't that heavy, and it's more a special occasion than the norm, as far as I'm concerned.
---
I get these awesome pistols as well but have no use for them.
---
Do their dailies and help them out when you meet them at random encounters. Also turn in Mirelurk meat at Ohio River Adventures
---
Ive been using a Bloodied 10mm auto for awhile now, honestly have fun with it. Is it God Roll? Hell no. But that doesn't mean it can't be fun. Plus 10mm ammo is everywhere /shrug
---
I want to know why I can‚Äôt sell floater grenades to vendors
---
The hot wheel is also bugged. It is possible you tried dropping something from the wheel?
---
Like in NW if you drop something from the wheel when its glitches in adventure mode it will drop something else
---
thank you very much
---
I have had this happen to me but realized later its possible I sold it and forgot.
---
This is a lot to do with micromanaging as well, as far as grinding/farming is concerned. The game is too easy to maximize these resources, and the limited functionality of caps, stash, script, gold, is simply because it is too easily acquired. This limiting feature is nothing new in mmorpgs, so far as to say people are beating the game, an mmorpg, pve-wise, when, by scope and definition, an mmorpg is supposed to be some endless borderline nihilistic grind. I seen this similar complaint staged by so many hardcore elitists, who are afraid they won't have anything new to hold over people, or that, with how games monetize valorization, like purchasing otherwise difficult items, will render those who genuinely invest their whole ego into this, meaningless. Like buying accounts. Like buying in-game currency. The whole thing rests on bridging the gap so that casual players can pretend to be more hardcore elite. The solution is fairly straightfoward. Have meaningful ranked tiers for events, pvp, etc. Make the game more challenging in other ways. Time-gating is an incredible manipulation tool for those with addictive personalities and self-esteem displacements of sorts. Instead of complaining about daily score, do more atom challenges and use those to advance across the board, for example. This whole thread blew up cuz there is obviously a lot of resentment in this community, but at the same time, ya know, we already knew all of this anyway, how the game is broken, glitchy, unbalanced, lackluster, too easy. Just another spinning the wheels. Find a game with rules that are more conforming to your expectations, seems like the most clearheaded way to dismiss this.
---
I see God is testing me here. I dont want to be an asshole and dupe you by telling you it‚Äôs not worth anything, so you should just give it to me, but I also dont want to pay a shit ton of caps for a meh legendary.
---
They would need to make a whole new ammo available for walther, likely 9mm, and maybe will release it with a range of 9mm guns in future. Hoping.
---
Unless they say it uses .380 and that is now same as .38? xd
---
I like the game because I can do what I want when I want to. Game's like COD are too linear, no freedom. Then there's the button masher games like God of War, etc. that I don't care for (although you mash the hell out of buttons when your crafting in fo76). 
---
I'm able to live with the bugs. If I encounter one on a mission, I just go do other things. I'm not going to let that get me down.  As far as the graphics, they look fine to me and I dont get nausea from them. I have played other games that did give me headaches, but fall out isn't one of them. So, in short, fall out allows me to take things at a slower pace.
---
No it is bad with all weapons. What ever the weapon may be the TS will do the exact same 25% increased damage with the other negative effects on it.  Which is very low.
---
"Anything spray and pray and anything you wouldn't use VATS with is still pretty good." quite the opposite. If you don't use vats you will miss most of your shots if you are not in melee range, because the accuracy / recoil penalty. And if you miss with TS it will hurt you alot since TS damage is calculated by adding the 25% effect damage to normal damage and dividing it to 2 seperate bullets. Meaning you are shooting 62.5% damage shots.
---
I mean, I know it‚Äôs not worth 30000 caps, but it‚Äôs worth a little, if I had to guess cause I know nothing, prolly around 500? I‚Äôm not sure lmao
---
Man I sure hope not. If I did it was unintentional. Didn't even know you could do that.
---
Yeah this is actually a great thing as for lower levels .44 is among the more powerful things they have access to, but are at low supply of.
---
I need more dislikes
---
VATS been broken for a while now, Bethesda has acknowledged this, but it'll take a long while for them to fix.
---
6-11k according to fed76
---
i guess they could just use 10mm like they did in fallout 4. idk bethesda is already fast and loose with calibers lmao.
---
Had the same thing happen to me. 2 foundations connected to each other. Not connected to anything else. Cant scrap move or even rotate and place it in same place.
---
I just built a new base that took many hours, and dont wanna have to build again. So I just got annoyed and decided I'm gonna play a different game
---
Why not auto?
---
Did you have an atom shop skin on it? Those skins can be dangerous, because if you accidentally drop one it gets sacrificed on the altar of Todd.
---
Eh, for a full health melee player a TSE shotgun or Minigun works just fine.  I agree not the greatest or godlike, but TSE works just fine on some weapons.
---
You ever played basketball with a Colossus‚Äô balls?
---
The problem is they're not worried about burnout. They don't Time gate to prevent people from burning out so that they'll play longer, they time gate to incentivize daily logins because they give them more opportunities to push the cash shop in your face and has been a proven marketing tool to get people to spend more money in the cash shop. It's the exact same thing mobile games do
---
At least as far as the Atomic Shop goes, it isn‚Äôt about addressing the caps. It‚Äôs just about getting repeated exposure to the Atomic Shop stuff by making people log in daily.
---
Me too
---
Because I'm dumb and thought it only worked on semi autos.  Very good for any rifle.
---
Yes it did have an atomic shop skin. Makes me not wanna buy anymore... :/
---
And IE sniper is horrible though. If your target is standing all by itself, sure, it‚Äôs good. But if they‚Äôre in a group the explosion from the first shot will get anything close to it, and that makes the instigating part useless except for the first enemy then.
---
Truth is the BOS is worse than the Enclave in many ways
---
Are you on ps4 or xbox?
---
Also, there is a very good reason why executioners is underrated. That is because it only works under 40% health. Making it "good" on only bosses that last a very long time. Why use executioners when you can use junkies which has the same damage increase but works 100% to 0% health. Or even bloodied..
---
We just talked about the 2 shot rifle lmao, PS4, it also says in the title
---
Did a Westek run and grahm, was kicking super mutant ass.. which was weird!
---
no. but it is if the colissions are set to off when the animation scoring projection system is supposed to be simultaneously be set to on. This is a common thing and is likely what your issue is.
---
Rewards are account based. If you're handicapping one or the other, that's your mistake.
---
Make a NW specific character, and reap the benefits of a leveled/funded alt.
---
Grab a brahmin tit during riding shotgun. Your milk is there.
---
i can never find him. lvl 180 and only seen him 4 times and the last time was over a month ago. Wish a Grahm emote popped up every time you were close to him or at least make different color dot on the hud when you're near him.
---
Ohhhhh that was you?
---
Yes, God yes!
---
I'm guessing you didn't happen to record this. Not that I'm doubting your story, it would just be easier for me to figure out the problem if I actually saw it.
---
Grind THEN spend atoms.
---
Yeah, and when fed76 prices the pistol at 5000 caps
---
Yeah it really does suck.
---
But it technically is Bethesda fault for the bug.
---
So I do hope they help.
---
But what platform are you on?
---
Screw Graham. Joined on a Cave Cricket Horde event where he was killing and completing the event by killing the legendary as I loaded in. I didn't get any loot :(
---
It works just fine but saying it is good or great is just plain wrong. Like i said, TS is worse than almost any other damage increasing prefix, except the ones like mutants etc. That is simple math and fact.
---
i mean i hope they have a way to track how much players scrap in 4 days and thats where it comes from? off the top of my head pipe weapons give cork but i dont know what else does...  but 200. steel vs 200m cork, my numbers in my stash dont add up tbh...
---
That's a good point.  I still run Vanguard/whatever weapons and have avoided junkies.  I wish Mutants stacked at least on weapons, up to Junkies level.  It doesn't really matter, there isn't really anything in the game a basic build can't handle.
---
Realistically it only is the camp items that are good. Weapon skins maybe if they worked properly.
---
The rest is 1 armor skin. 2 power armor skins. Then a bunch of filler. Gold, scrap, caps etc
---
You should send this to Bethesda, I believe every player in the game supports you. They should get rid of daily and weekly cap and should allow us to grind. Also, we should be able to start event at any time, when we please. There is nothing to do in between events, it gets so boring. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I'm on Xbox. Probably not gonna even submit a ticket since it seems they get ignored. At least it wasn't one of my best weapons but it still scares me that it could happen to any of my other guns.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth that much, but I might be wrong. I‚Äôm only level 80, so dont know everything there is to know about pricing.
---
Inventory tetris is definitely the best way to describe this.
---
I have enough plans between event rewards, enemy drops, and Xmas presents that I'm not muling the dumb shit anymore. I keep the rare plans, maybe a copy of regular plans I think I could trade in the future for semi-good items (stimpak recipe, weapon plans, etc), and the rest of the shit gets dropped. 
---
So yes, for the love of Todd, take the plans I drop. Learn them and either sell or drop the rest. Because every time I get a mounted animal head plan I want to fucking *yeet* myself into a fissure site.
---
Guaranteed Bethesda will introduce 'remove timegates for atoms' in the future. If this game becomes more fun due to more story or modes, players will want to grind the crap out of it.
---
You're such a bad little boy/girl.
---
Well doesn't base excavatpw with strength buff and bonus carry weight on arms along with the set bonus give +230 carry weight. I dont even use any specific builds or other major bonuses and I run around with 230 without PA and 460 with PA.
---
On a side note why cant we have legendary PA, I would love this expansion to the PA system
---
Good rant! They're pretty toxic, I don't mind that they want to issue a challenge for some pvp but if the other party/parties aren't interested it would be nice if they'd just move along!
---
The only faction creepier than the BoS is the Enclave.
---
Dang if you were on PC I could help!
---
But they best thing to do is go into the PitBoy and un-favorite all the times that have the heart next to it and redo your hot wheel.
---
Not sure if this accurate. But for me it ALWAYS happens if I play a NW match and go to adventure mode.
---
In the pit-boy for some reason favorites every other weapon that's the same type;not all, but a few reguardless of legendary or reg is favorited.
---
Just looks like he was swooping in for some sweet gear.
---
If you're not getting any download speed. Make sure to run all windows updates then restart pc.
---
Also install folder will be in a locked folder called windows apps you cant access. 
---
You can move where you want to reinstall the game in windows store settings.
---
Enemy takes damage from laughing to hard, turns out laughter is the strongest weapon after all
---
Its the exact opposite for me, i fucking hate Grahm. It seems he always knows when im going a workshop and goes out of his way to break all my defenses and turrets. Fuck Grahm.
---
Ground pound looks nice, but isn‚Äôt that good, also check your damage and do some math, see if it checks out
---
Lahh lahh lahh. whatever.  lahh lahh lahh. It doesnt matter. Lahh lahh lahh. Oh well. Lahh lahh lahh.
---
Well I maxed out my strength put on pack rat and strong back and used the excavator
---
The only reason I roll legendaries is to sell.  That 3rd star can greatly increase the price, so for that its worth it.
---
So by dropping an item in NW it can cause me to drop an item of that type in Adventure mode?
---
It's boredom.
---
...
---
.....
---
Fucking foodbuild.
---
Workshops are PvP zones! If a motherfucker is dumb enough to carry junk in a PvP zone, their dropped junk is free game!
---
Also, if people keep seeking revenge on me, I'm sure as hell "dragging out that fight." 
---
"I make myself known." Dudeee lmfaoo like. What's the point? Who has manners in the wasteland. You're not violating any rules by sneaking in and tapping in. If a workshop owner stays in their workshop zone, they're aware they're opening themselves up to PvP. You don't need to announce your presence.
---
I have both a punch bowls and nuka machine filled with nukashine, it is great. I also pass out a nukashine whenever I dump plans, ammo, PA or weapons on low level players.
---
&gt; ll
---
ok
---
Meat week is coming :)
---
As for the presence thing, I don't go out of my way to do it. I just don't make it a point to sneak fuck em. I like making an entrance if you catch my drift. Also bc the ppl in this game get pissy about that shit which I don't understand.
---
As a fellow shark, I approve. Most don‚Äôt know.
---
Thanks. Hoping they will fix it soon!
---
It's not bad, for a 3\* bloodied the most coveted second stat is usually 25% FFR or explosive.
---
My damage is correct although I should've been more specific that the 2400 damage was on a head shot which is my bad. Shame about ground pounder though
---
Ah, okay. I thought tap damage was still a thing for pacifist. Thanks.
---
if i have a acount on xbox and thats my gamepass acount and one on the microsoft store with out gamepass dose that chage anything
---
Wait it's possible for it to not show as locations? Ever since the update they've only shown as locations for me
---
An observant radstag approached me once. I tried to follow it, hearing that‚Äôs what you are meant to do. But it would only follow me. It helped me fight scorched. Then Graham showed up out of nowhere and destroyed the poor thing in one hit. I only ever saw him once before that.
---
Murder and mayhem. Also stealing your junk that you were too dumb to stash.
---
I know they used to post images on Facebook saying how much steel has been scrapped and how many hours of this and pounds of that. I'm sure they track damn near anything. 
---
Isn't the reward for cork a week of double score or some shit? No doubt they're going to make us work for it.
---
"Workshop griefing"
---
Motherfucker. Workshops are the last consistent PvP zone in the game.
---
Yup, still rare.
---
Me and three others were all on a single team. We were also the only people on the map. We got more XP than if we killed all 48 other people in a full map, and survived fifteen minutes.
---
no max limit at all imo, let people grind and spend the notes immediately.
---
If you get the VTU hat then yes about 30k. It can be the letterman color or the vtu jacket color
---
lol! it's still funny after all this time.
---
its literally the exact same
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
a few weeks ago i was ard level 50. While trying to setup the defends for a workshop, a level 100+ dickhead and gave me a 1 shot kill. I respawn and looked the map, the workshop wasn't claimed. i went back there and he wasnt there. so okkkkkkk...i then know that he just wanted to murder and robbed me of my junks. not sure of his name so i don't know where he went in the map after that.
---
The effect was toned down. Any explosive weapon doesn‚Äôt do full damage in the explosion anymore, only like 25% min. Now
---
Bitch, I believe in the preservation of technology!
---
Maybe it‚Äôs your tv or settings? I turned down the sharpness a little and it helped.
---
Finally a use for me collecting a set of each armor and a helmet for every skin
---
Lol I‚Äôve had the same glitch, was tempted before to post it.
---
Those were there early on but bethesda actively removed the stands from the game files and possibly of banned those accounts as it was easy to filter them out
---
Lol, someone on here was nice enough to gift me a plan so no longer have to rely on the clusterf*uck that has been the encryptid boss battle. 
---
Now, as far as using it, I‚Äôll probably roll all my scrip here soon and also never use one because the game has no interest in supporting my efforts to roll a good legendary version. So far all my great 3* legendaries couldn‚Äôt have less to do with stealth.....unless stealth missile launcher suddenly becomes a thing. In which case, you may not see it coming but you‚Äôll definitely hear that shit.
---
I would say so. Sign out of the store or disconnect your account from the pc. And sign in with the same account that's used on xbox
---
Lies! They look like chocolate chip, but they are actually oatmeal raisin.
---
It's not a new bug, had experienced it long before wastelanders came around.
---
People can do as they please, just saying what I do.
---
OH MY GOD, NNNOOOOOOOO
---
Dedicated pvp servers?
---
Ohhhh I did not know you could still buy from ones that weren't powered. Thanks for that, important to know.
---
If you decide to sell it, throw it in your vendor. You'll likely get up to 10k for it. Reddit people are better at scrutinizing prices compared to your average vendor shopper. Explosive stuff in vendors do well.
---
When I had my camp by the river, between helvetica and that crashed airplane, I would see him multiple times a week. So if you want to find him, I recommend checking around there. He follows the road into helvetica.
---
The explosive effect used to deal 100% base weapon damage.  So a gun that deals 100 damage would deal 100 explosive damage as well for a total of 200 damage. 
---
The nerf reduced the bonus damage to 20%, so the same gun above deals 120 damage.
---
The change was retroactive so it doesn't matter when a gun was found.
---
The one weird outlier was explosive energy weapons. Instead of nerfing them the possibility of them dropping was removed.  They still seem to deal the old increased damage. These are now legacy weapons and are coveted as some are amazingly powerful.
---
I don't even know a good way to farm glass. Maybe just finding a bar or house with a lot of glass bottles?
---
That is probably the biggest event, 1 out of three times it fails from bugs
---
Aqua boy is amazing on Morgantown. Combining that with bush Wookiee strats makes me feel like I‚Äôm in Vietnam.
---
Same:)
---
When I ran into this in game, I could tell he was in the ground because the quest marked showed him in the ground, then he pops up backwards in his chair.
---
Auto receiver, probably.
---
Semi-auto receiver, probably not.
---
Please keep doing this lol
---
Two shot explosive... 103000 caps according to fed76, wow
---
Oh I certainly will. He was terribly confused until the prox chat stopped because he proofed away. I can only imagine him waking up somewhere on the map like "What the fuck? Where am I? The fuck happened?"
---
After like 2 weeks of forcing myself to login to play at like 11pm or midnight and staying up till 2 I asked myself why I was doing it...cause I wanted some cosmetics? For a game that felt more like a choir? Don't get me wrong I have fun playing on the weekend with my brother but I was forcing myself to play lest I fall behind...then I decided to stop and it's been so much better. Everything is capped and you are punished for playing. Always over weight, always managing inventory zipping around the map for 12 different capped currencies. It's just not fun being made to play every day. Like even my job I get some days off.
---
Cream is better than milk ü•õ
---
Anytime lately on Xbox when I die multiple times quickly the game either crashes or I can't respawn.
---
I like the multi-player aspect of the game alot. But the execution of it leaves alot to be desired. I bought the game day one cause I love fallout, but the pvp just feels weird. I think alot of it has to do with the fact they're using the an engine that wasnt designed for pvp. When id Duke it out with other people over the god damn ammo factory it never felt evenly matched. Either I'd get one shotted, or the next go around I'd respawn and one shot the other person and it'd continue until usually id admit defeat and move onto grafton steel or something. The co-op aspect is great, but the pvp combat just isn't remotely satisfying with the engine they have and the mechanics. I've always thought that maybe in the future in this game or another fallout  they'd have events or something where the brotherhood would fight the enclave and people aligned with either side could fight eachother amongst all the npc cannon fodder. Im used to pvp games like halo and CoD where the aiming and movement is snappy and smooth AF. It just doesn't do it for me in the current state fallout is in.
---
Mad cuz mad &gt;:( haha Lusar.
---
Max rep with settlers and 4k bullion
---
At this point, asking for QOL improvements or bug fixes, much less content of substance, is like asking the last 3 people still working on this game to build a pyramid out of a shanty shack, while they're each busy trying to hold up a wall to keep it from collapsing.  Zeniscum is content to try to keep the customer base in a holding pattern while still trying to milk them before they all bail out.
---
It's not. Pistols are garbage.
---
That's a scrip gun.
---
Explosive effects used to do 100% additional damage, but they were nerfed to 20%. They are still good, and one of the two major effects that can affect your damage/dps. Other being 25% faster fire rate effect (which is considered best major effect by many). Since you are the same guy who was asking about TSE weapon.. Two shot got nerfed from 100% to 25% increased damage and still has the massive accuracy and recoil penalty. While TSE weapon is "ok", it is far from the top tier where it used to be. It's more of a mid tier weapon now. There are many effects / combos that result in better dps. Also TSE weapons breaks 4 times as fast as a non-legendary weapon. As TS shoots twice, and explosive adds one weapon damaging effect to both bullets.
---
No sorry for the bad explanation.
---
In NW, you start off with a blank hot wheel and everything you pick up will stack and represent the wrong gun or item.
---
Example
---
If you pick a radium rifle and pick up something else it will stack them at times, so if you click the a item on the hot wheel it will pull out the wrong weapon out.
---
Same thing happens to me when I go from NW to adventure.
---
I have a butt ton of weapons and it get them mixed up everytime i go from NW to adventure.
---
If I pull out my explosive gatling plasma gun it will pull out a furious gatling plasma gun, even though it shows the explosive galting gun in the hot wheel. Super annoying.
---
If you have Speed Demon mutation, i know that will boil through water  at a rate of knots. It does with me. That's why i keep those purifiers open. Can't miss them-the locked ones have red,flashing lights. Lol. If on PS4 drop by. I'm up at the bottom of the cliff face just past the ski shop on the road to Bolton Greens, in a direct line from a large power tower. Come grab some fresh ones. Lol.
---
I was thinking the exact same thing, I mean, the asset already exists from one of the fallout 4 workshop DLCs, why not insert that asset into 76, also WE NEED CEILINGS FOR OUR CAMPS.
---
That would be nice.
---
Scrip em. No one except people who don't know how garbage pistols are would want it.
---
Except for stuff like BE and JE pistols, some collectors would want those.
---
Does it effect vats?
---
Personally think Nuka-shining people is becoming a bit dull, unoriginal. 
---
Better, I think is perhaps, Radant lager, 2 minutes after they drink it they are suddenly over-encumbered or Nuka-Grape to piss off the bloodied players...
---
Oh ok I got ya now. Thank you for the explanation.
---
He has a screwed us all or will screw us all at least one point or another in the game.
---
If the stag doesn't lead and only follows it's because enemies are close that it needs you to kill. Once killed it'll lead you somewhere. Unfortunately some friendlies think it's a target.
---
Agreed, Time gating money, script, gold, I just don't bother even playing anymore, I came back for wastelanders, played through it, the season pass shit is a joke, I quit soon after again. This game could be soo good if they just let us play the fucking thing when we want, and fix fucking bugs
---
They probably thought it would bring in more players due to the success of Fortnite and other Battle Royale games.
---
It would be interesting to see if Bethesda introduces an Atom rank system similar to what they have for the Legendary Run.  For the low cost of 50,000 Atoms you can go from level 1 to level 100 and obtain your very own Inferno Mark III and Hellfire Power Armor.  PvE rewards always ruin PvP.  Then there is the issue of Score how there is always one NW challenge and 8 PvE challenge for each daily.  We should have each challenge giving the choice of completing it in PvE or NW like "Increase one level or Increase one Overseer Rank" and "Buy or Sell 3 items to players or Deploy Camp 3 times."
---
I used to waste so much time at workshops as a newbie... eventually I learned it's not worth it. You have a better experience participating in events and quests, earning legendaries and loot to sell and with the caps buy the ammo at other player's vendors. 
---
Progressing in the main story and doing dailies you max rep with raiders for the ammo machine, with atoms you get the collectron, on top of that if you place your camp at a resource like  ACID to melt ores you have way more lead in 15 mins than a day of workshop farming.   
---
Play smart, not hard.
---
I wouldn't call it dull, it's mostly to have some harmless fun with newer players as my camp is in the forest and nice and open for them to come use.
---
Nuka grape to piss off bloodied players though, that shit is hilarious. I need to remember that.
---
Going on the basis that RNG is going to say no (Because that's the odds) and thus whatever I get is going to end up in most cases as scrip, it will take 8 1\* items to equal 1 3\* item
---
Ya accuracy does
---
Yup no problem.
---
Best of luck fellow vault dweller.
---
Same to you. üòÄ
---
I do not get the reference :-(
---
But really, ten years ago or so, i got such a present at work. Sadly, i do not use wallets, i use money clips, so it is still collecting dust somewhere...
---
Still unknown, probably far off since we've only heard that they were more or less 'looking into it'
---
You guys should stop attributing a complex thought process to Bethesda. The Gates of AQ are opening in WoW this last week, which involves basically the same process. They're just copying things - but much like cells dividing, a little is always lost in the copy.
---
No, it behaves like Hard Bargain ("Adds" 3 CHA/level for calculating buying and Selling)
---
IIRC from a Stealth point of view, there is little difference between AGL15 with Sneak 3 and AGL 30
---
Not in the atomic shop just a plan Bethesda
---
no the 50 still spawns, and i just came back with waselanders
---
Youre not. Youll finish
---
Probably just leeching for the rewards and notes. Though encrypted is a tricky event if nobodys grabbing pylons ill hang back to see what we are working with no point in dying and wasting ammo if theres nobody being a conduit.
---
I have encountered the exact same thing 3 times now in the past week.
---
It will be improved with the new update on Tuesday I believe. Read the patch notes when they‚Äôre posted
---
Items that are for sale or on display don't count in your stash but as part of your building inventory instead.
---
Yeah something about it makes my eyes hurt in a way but also in the way you describe. 
---
Also, I should wear glasses but I don't so it might be that.
---
True the problem was my friends (they‚Äôre low level and new to the game) were activating the pylons with me I got a bloodied build so activating them were kind of a no no yet I had to since other people were just there watching it drives me mad about doing the event since I started it with my card
---
So I know it has been about two weeks, some perks I've been going back and forth on, but this is my main setup right now. For Endurance, I've been debating on Rejuvenated and either Cola Nut or the added health perk. Perception I'm debating if I should just call my dump stat and reduce to lowest level (don't use VATs much)
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e355e78&amp;d=sq2sx2s32sr2cm1cu1ic4ip2ih2id2a72a03le0st1
---
To move a single special point you need a level up. Once you level up beyond that of level 50 example level 52, you will have the option to either pick a new perk card or move a special point from one location to another. Currently there is no way to fully Respec your character in one fell swoop.
---
My first play through of the game was after Wastelanders.  Early on I decided to explore up North and discovered Point Pleasant.  I could see all the cultists around so I snuck around the outskirts, hiding behind one of the South-most houses trying to figure out how I could take the roaming ones down.
---
As I‚Äôm sitting there they start shooting at something.  I sit there hoping some of them will die so I can clean up.  After a few minutes I see Grahm charging over the rooftop bridge with his war drum, destroying cultists.  I thought he was going to turn around and destroy me next so I hid until I heard him yelling about stuff for sale and discovered what he was. What a great moment.
---
&gt;Cork Allies...
---
Why not rubber, at least...
---
I‚Äôd gladly donate 100 of each type of junk they require. Not hard to do, but everybody needs to do their part
---
Is there a specific spot at each location to check? I‚Äôve also been looking for a while and didn‚Äôt realize they got moved around.
---
Sorry already a member of the Appalachia Communist party. I only partner with the Enclave to redistribute the X-01s to the common worker.
---
So true!!
---
You don‚Äôt fight the Wendigo Colossus for the drops. You fight the Colossus because you have an excess of 1700 2mm EC
---
Maybe because they have yet to sell an atomic drop skin for a katana yet?
---
Same here. Iv seen it a few times this week
---
Turns out the ones i like are buggy, what a mess
---
Ok sweet guess I‚Äôll stash that one, almost scrapped it on accident earlier
---
I hate that event because of the pylon situation its the only public event i use my explosive laser in and idgaf how fast i kill the sheepsquatch, just give me my fedora and xp.
---
Another best thing is how those dupers and exploiters get a slap on the wrist (if that) - and are then welcomed back with arms wide open. Another best thing is how their stuff never (or rarely) actually gets taken away. And yet another best thing is how people unknowingly buying even just one or two items from them caught up in the ban waves. (Which - why are we even calling them ban waves by the way, if they're just temporary suspensions apparently??)
---
So, I've heard a few things. Stimpacks and super stimpacks as well as a combo of sentinel and cavalier armor can do this. It's all about the build.  Perk cards play a role in pvp too. It helps a lot to have found who are good at it help you out. With Bethesda glitches it can be a hard path to navigate.  And God forbid their are in God mode. You have no chance.
---
I think you have lost direction, man. Listen to yourself, you are complaining about not being able to grind enough. Where i came from that is the worst part of any game. 
---
Once you max out pve,  shouldnt you be doing PVP?
---
If that is notan option if minecrafting is not an option anymore than maybe just move on.
---
At the moment I‚Äôm running 5 Unyeilding for the increased intelligence.  I used to run 1 piece of Life Saving for the 50% chance to revive myself...seemed like a good compromise. 
---
Ive not used the Bolstering much.  Always felt it was an all-or-nothing type of thing.  Like, if a little defense is desirable, why not a lot of defense?   Just my play style/philosophy.
---
I'm going 3 unyielding, 1 bolstering and 1 chameleon, as a bloodied stealth melee build.
---
Ah cuz i thought they fixed it cuz i stopped having it after patch 19 or smth
---
Friends* not found
---
I assume it's for like padded armour or something? It doesnt really seem to have any use at all.
---
I would be happy with a skin for my Board looking like a wooden katana. But that's a good question.
---
Same for the West Virginia Day and the Bear mascot outfit. I really want a skin for my Mole miner Gauntlet looking like a Gigant bear's claw!!
---
I've only ever had one trade invitation. He just stood there, so I offered some stuff for free. Then he punched me in the face. I'm in pacifist mode so I just walked away. But a muddle finger would have been nice.
---
Alts also make little sense because of 76s inherently singular model of play. It‚Äôs not really a proper multiplayer game, so the traditional dam/tank/heals in various combinations doesn‚Äôt really work. I for one just felt like 76 was an unnecessarily difficult to get into Fallout 4.
---
I hated it before and I still hate it.
---
Not at all.... I am too. Thats the normal rank for anyone who has completed the daily challenges and did not pay with atoms. We have a whole month left. You're good!
---
Short answer is no, the extra tankiness isn't worth the lose of SPECIAL gain you'd be getting from all Unyielding. Longer answer, if you have a good Bolstering piece that has one or two minor stars that suits your build and you don't struggle much than use whatever works best for you.
---
That site is not great.
---
We kind of do have one - the shishkebab. It'll just have to do for now.
---

---
Not every MMO is just a bunch of tedious grinds. 76 was obviously intended to be an MMO, it's just unfortunate how its team doesn't really seem to know much about designing one.
---
I know! It‚Äôs so annoying and add a respawn glitch in which your alive but can‚Äôt move or do anything and that makes you uninstall the game because that happened to me
---
Current recommended milestone for today is 63 presuming it's a 70 day season. There's a couple of charts and calculators out and about if you want to look at them.  
---
  
---
By all reckoning though, if you keep doing all the dailies and weeklies you'll finish before the end of the season. You can even miss a few now that they keep giving us 9 dailies to do every weekend by looks of it.
---
Best I can I do is a Fanny pack
---
Ionized meat with carnivore ontop
---
I just drink for fun, hoping it's nukashine. I get disappointed when it's not.
---
Oh gods, Fallout has an "Everything is made of cork" phase, just as we're having our "Everything is made of cake" phase for jokes
---
It's called the shishkabob
---
It really is a great emoji
---
He doesn't sell the Nuka Cola clock. He sells the Starburst Clock. The Radiation Emitter and Mirror Ball plans too. If you want the Nuka Cola clock you will need to find the Responders Vendor Protectron with the pack Brahmin. He is a random spawn near Charleston station and a couple other places.

Also, if you are on PC, I do have one other set of plans left that I can give you. Just let me know.

Had the same bug. Was running around in the VCU building for ages.
---
Sometimes you see them before their world is loaded.  Froze in a nuke zone at WS today.Or maybe they're swapping perks and it times out?
---
Why are some people useless in real life? Just how some people are.
---
Sorry. I didn't realize we were just saying nonsensical things now.
---
Nah at least the lvl 300 was definitely moving
---
People in this game tend to be generous. A little too generous. I am practically assaulted with free stuff whenever I make a new character, despite my wish to avoid such stuff from hurting the feel of progression. No hard feelings though, they're just trying to be nice.
---
It's the casual players who can't accept they're casual. Not everyone is meant to complete the Legendary Run, but don't tell certain players that.
---
Grinding is a mainstay of multiplayer games. The caps are horrible. You‚Äôre the one that lost direction.
---
Why is that? Not asking to antagonise but just wondering what your opinion is.
---
Awww, nooooo!
---
I did not know this, and now I'm sad. I love the kitty pictures.

If you want something new, go melee. Fun as hell.

---
Maybe you shouldn't have had a baby if completing every possible video game daily is so important. Sounds like you made a choice and can't deal with the consequences.
---
Gotta be full proof to "prevent exploits"
---
Same thing happened to me last year, the day before Meat Week started. I provided security escort and he bought everything in Big Bend that wasn't nailed down. Good times.
---
I play regularly with 3 other friends.  2 of us can easily complete encrypted.  We piss people off getting it done so fast. What exactly is the problem here? Just start it and get it done. Sneak perks, stimpacks... good to go!
---
This discord server has a role you can join for notifications when another player finds Grahm so you can join them and see what's for sale. I've seen him 3-4 times in the last couple days just from that server.

I‚Äôd get a black paint skin for it, I want it for the armor too
---
In case you did not see it in your 3 weeks of playing, look around train stations for posters. There were 3 mini updates with the Nuka Shine, Sheepsquatch and Pioneer Scouts. You probably ran into their content through exploration, but I have found plenty of people who missed the content, so just gonna put this here.
---
I hated it, before, I still hate it, and I've logged 100+ hrs in the past 2 weeks.
---
Oh I didn't know that thanks!! I google it and said it was him, i want the starbust too tho üòÖ
---
Yeah I feel like the hate train really turns a lot of people away from a great game. Yeah it still has its problems, and it's launch sou ds like it was pretty darn bad. 
---
I started playing the December after launch and I never found it all that bad. I loved the game. And it's been the only game I've really played since I picked it up. I'm now 1.1k hours or so in and still get enjoyment from it
---
No joke I had 4 maybe 5 guys walk up to me while I was in the same bush and I just wasted them every time. Unfortunately did not win the match as I had to move. It was hilarious though.
---
I do this all the time. Once I found some dude who, for whatever reason, hooked every single turret, light and vendor in his camp up to a single switch inside the locked room with their workbenches. Needless to say I left the camp turned off.
---
On a sniping gun like a lever action, two-shot is not great.  Damage drop-off starts at much shorter distance, and you rely on both projectiles hitting to achieve 125% damage.  If only one hits, you‚Äôre actually doing less damage than a vanilla gun.
---
The only weapon where I‚Äôd still be enthusiastic about TSE is on a combat shotgun, just to use the double explosive radius with Enforcer to incapacitate large groups of enemies, not to kill them.
---
Shishkebab is the closest you will get. If you inspect the model it does have a disc guard.
---
Exactly. This is so easy - I build 2 foundations and build half walls around it till the score is done. Even the build up workshop is easy and takes maybe a couple minutes - build a floor or two, 5 walls with doors add doors then just pit down lights, floor decor and water pumps till the challenge is done. Easy.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt do more than 1star concentrated fire. The damage bonus isn‚Äôt much. Ground pounder isn‚Äôt actually a bad choice- when you‚Äôve only got a 20rd clip, reloading faster increases your total DPS
---
I think that's essentially kind of the point. There are already enough somewhat naturally occurring time Gates by way of legendary scrip limitations and RNG that adding another time gate on top of that by limiting bullion buy treasury note turn in limitations is excessive
---
I think explosive weapons break armor faster , not sure though
---
It gives you a dialog telling you that if you drop it it will be destroyed. That‚Äôs actually safer than not, because otherwise you‚Äôd just have dropped it and never realized it.
---
The legendary run is what‚Äôs killing it for me. I ground out that SS armor and faction rep and it took a little out of me, but every time I play now it‚Äôs to spend an hour killing super mutants at West Tek. And if I don‚Äôt log on every single day for that hour, I‚Äôm most likely not going to hit rank 100, as I don‚Äôt do about half the NW challenges. Not to mention for the NW challenges that are easy enough, I‚Äôm pissing people off because I hate battle royale and whore XP hiding in a bush. Unless some truly next level stuff goes down in the next month, I‚Äôm not gonna renew my 1st or even play until the seasons are done.

In a like manner, it bothers me when I have to just drop legendaries because I have no caps left at vendors and scrip limit has been met.   I can only hold so many on me or in my stash.   And if you just forward it to the next day, then THAT day's legendaries will become a problem, ad infinitum.  
---
I can understand wanting players to log in daily, but why theses artificial limits that limit rewarding playing?
---
Stupid question but what are they?
---
The cork must flow. Make it flow so hard that the Brotherhood NPCs outright talk about it.
---
Second the lever action. Pipe revolver isn‚Äôt terrible, but I‚Äôd take the lever over it.
---
You are about where I would expect someone who has only done dailies and skipped the Nuclear Winter content to be right now, so you are right on track, take a breath and relax, you are gonna make it. All you have to do is reach the end of the board before the other ship does.

Whitesprings guests all evacuated.  Theres a quest to collect the holotapes.  Basically, after the war most if the staff and guests stayed there and enjoyed the comforts of the place, until a scheduled maintenance/refit of the Whitesprings locked down the rooms and the guests/staff left.  Some could be, I guess, but the vast majority of those skeletons are more likely to be the people who were in the bunker and executed by the Enclave then the others who were killed by MODUS.
---
No, what we need them is to make sure no more duping/exploit is possible and up the lvl cap on weapons and armor, thus resetting the fucked up economy they created with their sloppiness. And either add a new area with lvl 100+ enemies or raise the level of the bog and mire if they can‚Äôt do that without bugging half the game
---
The longshoreman's outfit also hides the backpack.
---
Beneath Appalachia there is a cancer... known as the Enclave, a malignant growth that needs to be cut before it infects the surface. They are experimenting with dangerous technologies that could prove to be the world's undoing for the second time in recent history. But with your help the brotherhood could obtain this technology and use it to help the People of Appalachia. Ad victoriam!
---
Get ready to spend a LOT of time with Ward, completing his dailies until you get max rep with settlers.  Make sure you are collecting gold bullion along the way because you will need 4 - 5k to purchase it from them.
---
Well, there‚Äôs about 50 different camp items that act as a stash. They may not be using the generic one.
---
Well that's the Eurobeat trash right out.
---
Which is good, because this is AMERICA.
---
America for Americans.
---
I used to see him all the time.  Now that I really want him for some plans only he carries, he is hiding from me.
---
A daikatana
---
The survival tent is also really good
---
Sad thing is making a whole new character and doing the Foundation quests before siding with the raiders would probably be faster than this.
---
Is said enemy actually red? You can‚Äôt VATS something that isn‚Äôt hostile to you. It‚Äôs a problem with some quests where opponents spawn hostile to things you‚Äôre supposed to protect... but not you. So you can‚Äôt VATS them until you manually hit them at least once
---
Yeah, I have that one. Must be it. I'm on PS4 too, just at the highway sign south of WV Lumber on the river when you look at the map. Popular place though...this on the front of my house now.

Yeah, I know what you mean.  I'm coming to the end of the legendary run (93).  I have everything I want to buy with gb.   I feel no need to grind levels just for levels.   What's the goal now?  No-goal playing?
---
Did you do the side missions?   Those can be pretty fun.  Sometime different things trigger them; I'd have to search for "fo76 side missions" to know what they are again, but just thought I'd mention it.
---
Wait there is a nuke cola machine that acts like the punch bowl? How do I get one?  I put random alcohols in the punch bowl with one being a nukashine. I call it drink roulette (and label it as such).
---
I love how he has been woven into the in game lore. He visits your camp to talk with  Commander Sofia Daguerre while you are away doing events. He is mentioned by the scavvers at Radiation Rumble, and I swear I have heard him mentioned in a few other spots.
---
Yeah, that weapon is awesome.
---
I miss when you dropped shit actually was t he stuff not the bag
---
*advanced power armor  mk2*
---
I hate the brotherhood and all they stand for, I will join their opposing faction, or simply gun them down if Bethesda tries to force them on us. 
---
I've taken it upon myself to rob everyone of their junk to prevent the Brotherhood getting these donations.
---
Finally, the manager. Yes, I would like to complain because a nuclear war has destroyed my house, my car and my family.
---
That's not what I wanted you to do with my tax dollars.
---
I mostly agree, I perhaps have a slightly less cynical view of the purpose of the timegating in fo76. As to what I was saying before, and with dev teams have several choices these days, I think it was simply a quick and dirty method of getting a product out the door with as little time and effort as possible. Who knows, everyone working on it might have the deepest passion for what they do, there might just be not enough hours in the day for the team to have completed anything more substantial by the first deadline. And since it's been an experiment for Beth from the beginning, has yet to receive the resources to handle the overhaul needed to turn it into the original idea they had at the outset. Obviously this is entirely speculation, as far as anyone knows the game is exactly what was intended.
---
I don't really know what my point is, as you said this OP is hardly new. I guess it at least goes to show how many people are still disappointed at what could have been. I'm here more as a witness at the scene of an accident, I just enjoy ridiculous situations and schadenfreude. I got the game after a free weekend not that long ago and I've already "beat" the game as far as I'm concerned. I couldn't even say the last time I logged in to do a daily. As you suggested, I'm playing other games. It's funny to me that this is seemingly supposed to be an MMO, but I am back to games I have many more hours in, many of which are finite SP experiences
---
A non legendary dragon?
---
It takes real patience to deal with Ward every day.   
---
 "I've got my eye on you," he half snarls.     
---
"Buddy, I've only done your s\*\*\* work for you DAILY for months now.   And I'm beginning to have my eye ON YOU.  I think you're Black Market and killing your buyers."
---
Same, this is my exact problem. I‚Äôm a melee build in adventure, so my Perception is pretty trash.
---
Now, this collection of... items... is fun, certainly. But why can‚Äôt we auto scrap them?
---
A bunch of them took up residence in the golf club and turned into ghouls.
---
Are you in  pacifist?
---
Craniums for the cranium chair.
---
You can pretty safely ignore all of that stuff, it's just there to give people that have done everything something to keep working towards.  
---
The game is easy enough that you don't need any of the gold bullion (or vault steel) gear to comfortably complete. You don't even need any legendaries or mid-high end power armour either. All of that stuff is just for min-maxing.
---
There is two kind of tosters. BoS and Enclave. I already have my faction. But story looks cool.
---
Alright kids, let‚Äôs rap for a minute here.
---
Same. I hate the game, yet keep coming back for some unknown reason.
---
Damn. I got nothing. I surrender.
---
Literally a core complaint about Runescape when I left the game.was how grind heavy everything was. And yet just to complain people are upset the game limits the grind and lets you play other games rather then devote your entire time to one.
---
You can play when you want. This has never been a restriction.
---
I've never read a post that sums up my experience with FO76 so perfectly.  I realized I don't actually have fun doing anything in the game anymore, its become less of a game then it is a job you don't get payed for.  Log on, look at the score challenges, do daily quests in 5 mins, do score challenges in 10 mins, turn in your treasury fun bucks and log off.
---
Wait, what?  I didn't know that! 
---
*starts logging in to fo76*
---
Thanks, brother
---
Fuck BOS
---
All my homies joined Enclave
---
I snuck through the Deathclaw cave at like level 15 to join Enclave
---
A lot of MMO‚Äôs and Live Sevice games have timegates. They‚Äôre usually weekly for MMO and daily for Live Service. GTA Online and Red Dead Online give good incentive to log in daily, check the shop for anything new, etc. but aren‚Äôt as limiting, as you pointed out. As a matter of fact, RDO did an amazing job at it. 
---
There‚Äôs a marketing strategy behind it that goes deeper than keeping players hooked, though I forget all of the details. With Red Dead, you want to keep your daily streak going and their constant updates to the shop which uses a currency obtained through MTX or gameplay make you want to log in to check it. I think they looked at Rockstar for a lot of inspiration, not just in that area, though I know other games do something similar.
---
The problem with Bethesda is that they‚Äôve left their timegates and limitations thinly veiled while also being over-the- top. The players clearly see it and are punished by it, to whatever extent, and it grows resentment. If you were to not want to play for any other reason, you are no longer wanting to log in daily but obligated and you‚Äôre limited on what you can do in that day so you have tomorrow‚Äôs limit to look forward to, which is very sad.
---
I‚Äôm under the impression that they looked to WoW and other MMO‚Äôs for their reputation and currency (scrips and gold) limitations. Unfortunately, WoW has this same pitfall at one point as did other MMO‚Äôs and they‚Äôve shifted away from it, kinda.
---
Another problem, with reputation in-particular, is variety. There‚Äôs one or two daily quests for each reputation and some negligible ones for others. If they‚Äôd put in a variety of other daily quests in rotation, made it three dailies per rep per day but with a divided reputation reward which equaled the same amount as one of the ones we have now, or added even more random side quests and encounters which gave a negligible rep gain (more than the bare minimum there are now), players might not notice or complain as much.
---
Unfortunately, the grind and limitation is not hidden well. You know you‚Äôre doing that one Settlers daiy, that one Raiders daily, the Overseer daily, and that‚Äôs it until you do the same damn thing tomorrow. You know the time it resets by heart, same for your cap and gold limit. After getting that done, aside from SCORE and very low RNG opportunities as well as normal gameplay, you‚Äôre highly limited and your initial rush of dopamine and draw to the game is depleted. 
---
Now, I know they need more time to put in more content and that it‚Äôs not as easy as it sounds but there are other games with far better systems, which are still limiting enough to accomplish the same goal but perhaps less evident to the player or enough that the general player doesn‚Äôt realize the limitation and grind, which they could certainly look at.
---
There are other aspects of the game which could greatly be improved, no matter how many initial scowls I may get, by looking at other games. I didn‚Äôt play much of it but didn‚Äôt The Division 2 have the ability to swap out a legendary modifier? You‚Äôre telling me that Bethesda is more money/time/RNG centric than fucking Ubisoft? 
---
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs far better examples and far better ways to articulate all of this, I‚Äôm a rather newer player but it‚Äôs so obvious how limited the player is with *everything*. Stash? Understandable, the FO1ST benefit is justifiable, though it‚Äôs not fun for most people with or without it and I‚Äôm noticing that having a mule, the more I play is more of a necessity than how people benefit from bank alts on WoW or other accounts/copies of the game for other games. The vendor limit, how it takes stash space, and how things you display in your house take stash space, it all kinda makes me sit back groan at Bethesda when I think about it. You can argue that it‚Äôs incentive to buy FO1 but even with the sub, a lot of us still suffer because this is a looter shooter with two unique aspects: base building and customization as well as the typical Bethesda loot-hoarding of their singleplayer counterparts. There‚Äôs a problem when even people with a subscription are struggling or have to find other means (alts) to store things. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me started on the cap limit, though it is interesting that it incentivized us to complete dailies, events, and grind mobs for caps.
---
Sorry for the rant and going somewhat off-topic. This could also be articulated better. There are great articles and posts out there which break down these sorts of things, from things like the atom shop, limited storage, currency limits, etc. in MMO‚Äôs and Live Service games. It‚Äôs become way less fun for the player in the latter and it doesn‚Äôt feel like the companies have much to gain from it. I think they fail to realize that players can see past the thin veil and may just say ‚Äòscrew it‚Äô instead of being mindless hamsters running on a wheel and there‚Äôs nothing they can purchase to ease their inconveniences anyway.
---
Even though I objectively and consciously realize it, the main mechanics that keep me ‚Äòlogging in‚Äô (excluding fun, friends, etc.) are racking up SCORE via EXP (smart implementation there), grinding resources which I burn through, maybe earning a measly amount of caps past my daily vendor limit (why is there a total limit tho???????), the chance at legendaries via RNG and leveling up (at my level, around 140 or 150) for the upcoming legendary perks.
---
This is already long-winded but, on the last point, I had already told my friends that they would need to find more timesinks and layers for players to progress once they have their build perfected and all perks obtained/ranked up. Seems like they‚Äôre ahead of me with Legendary Perks. I‚Äôll bet we can look forward to more ‚Äòhigher end progression‚Äô to soothe the boredom of those who‚Äôve done everything, hopefully not at the pace of a trickle and hopefully not artificially extended by timegates or restrictions.
---
Oh yeah I've done some of the side missions, and I've done some of the wastelanders update. But overall it felt like there was no attainable goal, literally just playing to collect more things.
---
There we go :)
---
Not too much then, maybe a few hundred caps. They're rare but really a novelty weapon
---
Yeah.  I think you just basically have to enjoy having any excuse to hang out in it.  (clears throat, looks in mirror)
---
This, and can we possibly get them to fix display items in the CAMP to be tied to storage rather than CAMP size?
---
Either that or up the CAMP limit by at least 10%.
---
I love the game. I love multuplayer. I love the various biomes and the amazingly large map and all the great challenges. 
---
I hate the lack of concern by developers to fix bugs that have existed almost 2 years. I hate their lack of concern into balancing and actually testing the items they create. I hate the new grinds they keep putting in one after another. 
---
This game could have been brilliant. It could have been a one of a kind experience. IF they had simply listened to their own player base and put a little bit of effort into fixing whats wrong with it. I bitch about it every day... as i play. Lol
---
300 of 400
---
Maybe like 100 caps? I'd just scrap it personally. Not worth the weight
---
Every cryptic deserves at least one plush dedicated to them. I would 100% make a cryptic plush room for my cryptid hunter character.
---
Thanks for the help
---
Communists &amp; Enclave to sides of the same bad penny
---
4k?! Damn I'm so glad I did that quest with the girl.
---
I believe so. Haven't seen a full, all inclusive list, just that it uses the Gift/Pail drop lists.
---
These challenges are account wide.   If you get it one with any one of them, it gets checked off the list.   (Well, except for the tadpole and possum challenges anyway.)
---
Dam right I owe Earl some pay back and his little brother nephew cousin kin
---
Glad I could point that out, also there are 6 unmarked Sheepsquatch quests, 4 can be found by reading pinned papers in train stations or inside the Taxidermist building pinned to the conspiracy board on the top floor. 2 are harder to find and are found by reading a note on a table out in front of the hotel in the Mire where you can find Boomer, and the other is by listening to a holotape at a camp just down a hill from the Toxic Larry's Meat and Go. Figure I will point those out just to bring them up again.
---
And get your friends and family secretly turned into FEV monsters.
---
I regularly run around with bounties, and the amount of people who have accused me of God mode, cheating, stacking, etc. is just hilarious.
---
Generally, it is because of a super tanky build. That's the short version. Against a specced PVP player, you will NOT even be able to dish enough damage out to even outpace just "born survivor" and super stims. Combine it with field surgeon and first aid, now you have extreme healing. 
---
That is all before resistances are accounted for. Most PvP players wear Powered, assassin, sentinel armor, and the ones who truly fight other PvP players opt for heavy leather. This is the greatest energy resistance, and Teslas and legacy lasers/plasmas are the only real threat, so add on the energy resist backpack, the grounded and scaly skin mutations, and you have pretty high resistance. 
---
With VATS not working, and stealthboys being abundant, ballistic weapons tend to be a non issue if you keep moving.
---
Now one trick is that they will sit there with the bounty and wait for someone, but really they are in the pipboy (quick view) so you cannot tell, and ready to spam quantums. The quantum spam can be tacked onto any build (even bloody) but requires alot of quantums (like ~50 a fight) if the people you are fighting know how to land some damage.
---
Most people I fight I don't even need a single buff or healing items, they simply cannot do enough damage because of using a single shot weapon, thanks to the damage cap, or an unoptimized build.
---
So to sum it up all of the buffs, perks, armor effects, and mutations attribute to the "tanky" nature of another player, and with the damage cap of 110, you need a fast firing weapon that hits the damage cap (through their defense) to be able to outdamage the  super stimpacks and quantums.
---
The other thing is the glitch with life giver, speed demon, adrenal, and healing factor, where your health will bounce back up from almost dead if you aren't under direct, constant damage. Which again is hard because of the guy moving, his perks and armor, and your own damage punching through.
---
Guy probably had Brahmin Meat for sale in a vendor.....
---
There is! It's an atom shop item. Relatively cheap.
---
I'm that douche.
---
For sure bruh
---
So you joined Reddit three days ago to fire up some hate?
---
I'd suggest giving it an actual try. Or playing it to begin with.
---
I hope Ward's quest is updated so we sometimes have to kill brotherhood members.
---
Colosus Balls, it is written there.
---
On a serious note Wendigo Colossus Vocal sac.
---
Yeah I had no idea, thanks for the clarification.
---
Came across a wanted player but when I tried to kill him it said "pacifist is enabled" lol. Visual glitch where theyre not even wanted maybe?
---
Would be nice if she could like sell 50 Vault Steel per server instead of just 5..
---
Never have I been excited about getting a reskinned beret.
---
Or being able to drag and manipulate items in the world, I want to make a shooting range at cliff across from my camp
---
Preach
---
Hey atleast it's not a swarm of vertabirds stuck inside your house, happens to me about once a month
---
Ok that got me. Thank you üòÇ
---
Ah that bug, I remember when it got me. I died because I was a triple conduit and no one got me back up. I then watched 6 people, not a single one under level 100, run after the invisible and invincible imposer sheepsquatch and waste their ammo on it for 12 minutes. This was last month, it is why I do not run the event unless I see competent active people running events on the server.
---
You are 8 rank ahead, thats like 6 days. You are good.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs just wrong
---
Yeah I know just never really cared cause o never saw one at my house
---
Ps4, i usually price Junk at 1c-10c per bulk
---
I believe now it is a rite of passage. It is a reminder that you shouldn't take things from strangers/should never raid someone's fridge when you visit their home.
---
I don't believe Bethesda really needs that much to fulfill the milestone. All they really need is for the player base to be active. 
---
It would take absolutely no effort from them to tell us that the milestones had been reached in the end, even if that would be false.
---
Its glorious. I usually make like 200-400 score off thise runs
---
Yep. Fortunately while the bodies fly away, the loot poles stay around the audio generator. Huge loot.
---
Oh yeah, that was really cool.
---
This sounds great and all but uhhhhh my camp budget is always hovering around like 98% so I wouldn't be able to USE any of it because Bethesda INSISTS on slapping arbitrary budget limits on us, when I know the giant over budget glitch camps I have seen are not worsening server performance in any noticeable way. Gimme more space Bethesda. Or instanced camps so I can have as much space as I want.
---
you are agreeing with me don't worry! I quit Destiny 2 about 3 days into this "season".
---
Try to snap it to a 2√ó1 floor tile, just at the edge. Now fully float, but it maybe will work for you.
---
There is no legendary mob spawn in this event so we keep mortal all the explosives.
---
Agreed. I've been consistent throughout but you can't convince people there. Even funnier when they delayed it after they all paid!
---
Team Rocket's blasting off again\~!
---
As part of one of the daily challenges I took over lakeside cabins the first defend event pops up 3 waves of low level ghouls no biggie I hope up onto the roof to spot them when they spawn in and snipe at them anyway I‚Äôm on the roof and I see chally filled by grahm and he passes the ghouls spawn point and I just stand there watching as Grahm unknowingly defends my workshop. Was going to buy from him but he wasn‚Äôt carrying anything I needed nor wanted. It was a fun encounter to say the least.
---
That's possible too.  The holotapes in the club make it seem like it was a holdout spot, and one day a guy took a shot at a passing ghoul and suddenly they were swamped by a horde.  Not sure if the ghouls in the club are part of the horde or guests that turned.  Probably both.
---
What if some idiot nukes the drop sight? Ive seen it happen many times
---
At least he wasn't invisible! He was probably running a bloodied unarmed build which is very strong.
---
&gt;Unfortunately, the grind and limitation is not hidden well. 
---
The game is fairly anti grind at least were OP is complaining about.
---
*Nodachi or ≈çdachi is what you're thinking of. Dai katana is just what they call it in the Elder Scrolls.
---
For me, as a person who alternates working days and nights, the 20 hour reset timer based on when you purchase can actually cause me to lose a day's worth of gold. Not to mention that by moving it to a set reset time, the only way you would miss out would be if you can't log in for that full 24 hours. 
---
Yeah, a 24 hour *set* timer would cause those who can maximize it to lose out on 200 gold/week; but the consistency alloted would be a great QoL change for those of us with variable commitments. I also highly doubt that many people will take full advantage of the 20 hour timer for anything more then a brief period to get a couple particular plans.
---
Bringing up the auto-complete bug is irrelevant. If you want to go down that path, they've got a lot of bugs to fix *before* they ever bother fixing challenges auto-completing. The one thing this game massively suffers from other then bugs is a lack of attention to QoL.
---
Then they ought to increase that too. I worked my ass off for a lot of stuff I want to show it off
---
I enjoy the 2 new events, hopefully the colossus event coming tomorrow will answer our prayers for more endgame content
---
I've seen it, explosives guns that stagger Queen. One fight this guy kept stunning her mid air and she kept going around in circles. It's only temporary though. If you stagger her and she stops the cycle she'll land next time if she isn't staggered again... Or not high enough to do the landing animation, or gets distracted by random mobs 250m away... Or decides to p*ss for ten minutes.
---
This happened to me, bought and refunded 76 in the first day of release. What the hell? So can i actually play the game? Not that i want to...
---
vault steel going to junk terrifies me... is it possible to drop on death? I always run and stash it each and every time.
---
This is my play cycle:
---
1. The main story.
---
2. Events.
---
3. Updates that add new content.
---
4. Play a different game!
---
Join me in the MODUS fan club
---
Huh, I went in positive and after finishing Wastelanders realized the game and community were way worse than it seemed
---
They were duped anyway! And ARE sold on the black market...
---
I totally understand why the cap was there, but I feel like caps like those should only exist for the first month or two of the content.  
---
Having those limits in place helps keep hardcore players from gulping down the content in a day or two, but after a while it‚Äôs just prohibitive to new/returning players to catch up to everyone else.
---
Same endgame content as any other? Name one single MMO that only has 1 world boss and that world boss is solo-able like the SBQ.
---
 This guy fucks.
---
it has no trading at all though... ?!
---
I recently got the Atomic something paint on the Legendary Run and it looks great on it AND it doesn't change the appearance of the armor. There are other paints listed, but at least some change the model. The War rider, for example. Ruins the good look of the T-65.
---
I was like that(I had my reason) but the S.E.A.S.O.N system pushed me over the edge. I wrapped up my goal and am just waiting for an actual questline to dunk 6 hours into and then wait again...
---
I'd be happy to trade JUST TO MY OWN CHARACTERS! Rolling a Junkie god roll on a bloodied build is too much.
---
Join for what? To populate the moon?  Great idea! /s
---
No.
---
Go visit them. It will guide you.
---
Imo the red mask looks strange
---
Well, now we know where they get the power for those mile-long jumps...
---
Interesting.
---
After I clear the vendors... why bother? If I keep playing I just fill my inventory with things I cannot sell until tomorrow, I cannot get script from lengendaries I kill.... so eventually you can't loot anything... why keep playing?
---
 Golfballs and baseballs produce cork. 
---
Whitespring, Hemlock Holes, the two amusement parks and the other golf place which name I forgot is the places with the most of these.
---
Also killing low level scorch is a good idea because you get the steel and cork.
---
Agreed!
---
There was a point where I was doing sheepsquatch imposter event with some friends. It was going bad and we hadn‚Äôt felt damage to the sheepsquatch. All of a sudden we hear Grahm yell something out before seeing him rush in shooting the robots. We ended up completing the fight after a good laugh.
---
Oh he‚Äôll fit right in with their philosophy of taking everything they want from people and claiming it‚Äôs theirs.
---
Thanks for sharing, saved me 175 atoms
---
You cannot fight the sbq in the nuked zone or why are people who nuke the drop sight idiots?
---
I think people who drop the bomb so that mostly of the nuked area is outside of the map are idiots, because nuking is much more than just the sbq..
---
Btw: fighting the sbq in an nuked area brings much more ingridients for Flux. Not melting her down in 30 seconds brings much more scorched waves, legendaries &amp; xps... 
---
So I don't understand why everyone wants to kill her so quickly
---
The Atomic is the only paint out that doesn't change the appearance.
---
Joel "true the process" embiid
---
Wait, you can do that?! I just bought it for my dinner for the looks but now it's a perfect way to troll lol
---
i start it alone, i used to wait until the last 30 sec to launch it but usually nobody shows up so now i launch it straight away
---
I roll 2 stars and if I get what I want, Ill start roll 3 stars to "upgrade" it (like I want a Junkies faster fire rate 50cal, after I obtain it, Ill start to roll 3 stars to get a junkies faster fire rate, faster reload 50cal).
---
Two-Kick Rip...
---
So the geneal consensus is don‚Äôt waste my time. Thanks all. I really wanted it to be something. I‚Äôll keep my eyes posted in case there‚Äôs changes.
---
I think the spawns are weighted very hguhly to ghouls but can spawn other enimies, for me it has been liberators that have spawned there instead
---
well shit, im done with this game for a while. Grinding legendary PowerFist from a thousand  of mobs but dont get it. This wrong tag is pure gold, im done...

[A guy talked about how Fallout 4 helped him cope with the death of his father and brother, Bethesda decided to make his brother into a NPC that gives you a unique nukacola recipe.](https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-4/fallout-4-nuka-world-dlc-tribute-evan)
---
"Kid you're gonna be a monster"
---
At least when I left Telos Runescape. They were the literal end game boss and they could be soloed. Though your broad use of end game really doesn't address what that actually means. Because with Runescape again as my example King Black Dragon was once considered end game but is now low-mid level content that would require multiple people to kill unless you had the best gear and knew how to prayer flick perfectly and shit.  
---
Now it is a low to mid level boss that can be killed in  20 seconds by players using the new end game gear.

In fact a major complaint about a couple of bosses was the fact they could not be soloed as people in the game generally hate needing a group to fight bosses and has lead to a lot of elitism mentality in the game.  Everyone demands X weapon and Y number of Vorago kills before they will let them on the team but almost no one want to teach new players how to kill said boss.
---
I'm level 99 and I still make the mistake of drinking from punch bowls.
---
I‚Äôve heard that robots can spawn after a nuke zone has despawned there
---
Why he gotta neuter the poor thing
---
Most bugged npc bar none. Especially annoying when you go to hand in the equipment and he says a random line... Be good if you could return that equipment for us...... BITCH IM IN FRONT OF YOU WITH IT IN MY HAND NOW FUCKING TAKE IT PLS.
---
It's probably bugged spawns... I've seen eyebots, liberators and protectrons in golf club before.
---
I just googled how to even do that. OMFG thats way more work than I'd ever want to put into ANYTHING. I probably have tons of cork from just never getting rid of it
---
&gt; Gonna have to keep my eyes open for that
---
I don't think he means via in game camp vendors but rather by going to an unaffiliated marketplace website and making a deal with someone there.
---
It's even better when the bodies explode into pieces and everyone is just constantly showered in a rain of body parts after every wave.
---
I was state raised.
---
These threads give me hope. Thank you, Op.
---
No idea, because I rarely fight anyone with explosives, and I'm pretty good at spotting mines. It would make sense however, unlike some of the design decisions.
---
Exactly. Then you get the owner showing up with his lightning gun (seemingly the pvp meta) and zaps your ass in 2 seconds flat.
---
I got top 3 once because of rocks hahaha
---
I mean free 30 min buffs is free 30 min buffs
---
If people could do this they would try to crash the servers.
---
Yes, I miss this too.
---
But the glowing ones from fo4 are 200 years older, so maybe ours have to rank up some specials.
---
I've aggro'd the Queen plenty of times whilst being on my tent and she's landed plenty of times too. So tired of the whinging about this subject. The job gets done, who cares. People can play it however they like.
---
Bethesda lazy??  Fallout has giant bats because "we already have these dragon assets so why not?" Preposterous!
---
Ahhh fair fair, I'm glad that they have kept the simplistic fallout feel yet still make it feel like it much more
---
Especially after the queen fight. Pricks that purposely walk in front of you blasting her near her death to get the attacked prompt. If that happens kiss your flux goodbye 
---
Also it seems the Tesla rifle is the pvp meta, no matter what your level you will melt the other player
---
It was supposed to spell ¬´pork¬ª, they‚Äôre having a massive community barbeque.
---
Do you have the balls to make some balls?
---
Yeah I'm a little over 250 hours now i think. Also never seen the bastard. I'm guessing he sells something unique, but I'm too afraid to Google it for fear of feeling left out.
---
Looks like you are discussing jewelry or luxurious clothings, with have no real value besides rareness. 
---
Unique weapon must be the best weapon for one's playstyle, be it head-on attack with minigun blazing or silent one-shot from the pistol in the back of  enemy's head. This weapon must be obtained at the end of long quest (as it was done with the ally storyline) and be garanteed to be usable...
---
I heard he can lay pipes.
---
I was told learning the jetpack mod unlocks a camo skin gor t65. I can't confirm this and hope they don't oatch it tomorrow.
---
Indeed. This is how I keep myself stocked with shotgun shells. It means I can use my plastic for other things.
---
Say hello to at least 2K steel
---
The drinks machine and punch bowl should give a pip boy message like the vending machines saying "so and so drank your nuka shine!"
---
Interesting, thanks for the report.
---
One bolstering,or vanguard for the same reason,is such a small impact on your dr it is basically uselss. You meed at least 3 pieces to have some real effect.
---
He saved me and my cousin from blood eagles next to the top of the world. We were like level 15 and there was a legendary blood Eagle wearing power armor in charge of the place.
---
Grahm slid in with the assist and helped us clear it.
---
If I had to guess it'd be some form of bloodied + vats crits do 50% more on a legendary.
---
Nah, normal healthy peopel play for fun or satisfaction or whatever but this offers neither.
---
This is the perversion of what gaming is only made acceptable by years of meticulously engineered psychological manipulation and you are selling it as the new normal. 
---
This is like a bad additiction, you are chasing once gone high. it no longer offers any of the gratification you first started it but instead of letting it go, you demand more mind-numbing.
---
When offered the option of doing unfulfilling nonchallenging robotic labour for marginal rewards then even not doing anything at all is preferable to jumping into the hamsterwheel.
---
Play something else, read a book, watch a show, play music, meet up with friends, clean up, go outside, play with the dog fix the patio door! Almost everything will make you feel better so why are you choosing even more unfulfilling soul sucking work?
---
Yep. This is what causes it.
---
ahhh screw you \*hic\*
---
Yes.   Also, Whitesprings has some; stations always have booze bottles laying around.
---
Try having the camp device at the desired height and placevthe train on top of it.then renove everything below. Or do the same with a PA frame. Those are methods to have floating items,they might work for this as well.
---
But not everyone leaves it un-nuked. 
---
Just have it spawn you to the closest location outside the zone.
---
More friends to join our little Enclave.... &gt;;-)
---
Hey it's just free fast travel! To a random location... :)
---
I did not know that, thank you.
---
a
---
I usually find Chalky glitched out somewhere standing still but no Graham in sight -_-
---
It's an ammo sink. Have killed it 3 times. Definitely not worth it.
---
Found it about 7 other times but just farmed screws from minions and left.
---
Explosive was +100% damage,two shot was +100% damage.the demo expert perk was actually +60% explosive damage. You can imagine a shotgun with 8 pellets doing 400 damage each was a tad overpowered.
---
A few months ago there was a pack with basic paints for PA: blue, red, aqua paints.
---
It‚Äôs not just to complain it‚Äôs a fact that at a certain point the game actively tells you to stop playing because you hit all your limits. Not present in every other single MMO out there.
---
and that is what would be a good pet. tame him. feed him. unleash him. or a good new skin for mysterios stranger.
---
Shut up and give us your laser rifles
---
And here I was thinking it was just aesthetic. Party time. You know you're gonna nukashine.
---
Yeah tbh for me that entire aspect of wastelanders fell on it's ass a bit, people in the cavern barely acknowledge you raided a vault with/for them and Ward's demeanour ( or any of the significant Npcs for that matter ) does not move an inch from the first time he meets you.
---
What about a gamma gun?
---
&gt;It‚Äôs not just to complain it‚Äôs a fact that at a certain point the game actively tells you to stop playing because you hit all your limits. Not present in every other single MMO out there.
---
And every other MMO wants your undivided attention.  Were as 76 gives you a limit that you can then keep playing if you choose or play another game.
---
You are not forced to keep playing for no other reason then to keep playing.
---
Is the dudes lil rocket on the map not the indicator of when it will finish since were ‚Äòracing him‚Äô so as long as your ship is in front of his on the board you‚Äôre sweet right?
---
Wish we could use it without the RR prefab. Or maybe they could add doors to match walls that aren‚Äôt the corrugated metal ones.
---
I only use it at SE or if something is killing me repeatedly.   The latter rarely happens now.   But yeah....I never liked it for normal stuff.   Too  clunky and slow.
---
That limit is unwanted and unneeded and it‚Äôs not for any other reason except to disguise a lack of content.
---
Items for sale definitely still change your stash weight. You can see it go up if you put in a few stacks of ammo or such.
---
Levelling up is ridiculously hard for lvl 800+ .  
---
Give and take i'd say...
---
absolute mad lad.
---
I use power armor for hard enemies that would shred me otherwise. Honestly, it doesn‚Äôt make much sense. 
---
My set of vanguard armor has greater damage and energy resistance than my excavator armor, but I still drop health faster outside of the power armor. 
---
I also use a heavy build, so for super mutants and armored enemies, power armor with stabilized perk is the way to go. 
---
I have weapon weight reduction on most of my armor, so I can carry way more with my regular armor than even my excavator power armor plus calibrated shocks. 
---
Right now I can completely wipe out west tek, take all the guns and goodies, and have at least 50lbs left of carry weight on my regular armor, while my excavator power armor with calibrated shocks sits overweight at 650/440 lbs.
---
Pacifist is on your end... not theirs.
---
See I hated the game at launch. I felt rather disapointed, and I bought in to the hate train somewhat. But I also bought the Power Armor edition, so I forced myself to play to feel like I didn't waste my money, but that made me hate the game even more.
---
Fast forward a year later I noticed they gave me a Steam copy, so I gave it a try with some new friends I met who also had Fallout 76 and I am having a great time, a lot of issues I had are gone, yeah it is not perfect but the last few weeks I have been hopping on every day to do my dailys, get my 200 gold, and 150 legendary scrip, rank up on the Legendary Run, restock my shops and get my reputation quests done.
---
The game never had those features back in the day, and with the upcoming Brotherhood content I am very excited for the future of the game, I am excited to see what end game content comes our way, the Wendigo Colossus looks very interesting. It is a shame I missed out on the Vault Raid, I hope it gets reworked some day as a game like this is built for a good Raid.
---
Yep.   The whole point of Bear Arms.
---
DO you know you can turn off the power armor UI on the options? If you do that you barely even notice you are in power armor.
---
This right here. It feels like its all overthought out and the priority becomes limiting the player in their various systems rather than making the priority rewarding repeatable content. I cant imagine the in-game economy or really anything else would be different if they uncapped half the shit they have capped now. Maybe people would stack up scrip and create new items via the purveyor instead of turning to duping every chance they get.
---
&gt;That limit is unwanted and unneeded and it‚Äôs not for any other reason except to disguise a lack of content.
---
So if the limit shows lack of content then how would the removal suddenly make more content? 
---
Why are you upset that the game gives you an optional and arbitrary for each individual player cut off point that they can put the game down and play something else before returning the next day or so?
---
the ultimate vendor. after every high level kill. shows up and buys rolling pins. or other nocturnal junk.
---
be glad he only did that ive had him aggro onto me when i killed one of his commie bot brothers and then when he attacked me the full on bsod my entire system and ive had this happen to me like 3 times i steer far far away from the event now
---
I played for the first time tonight....4 hours playing and the only thing i got was this dude shooting me in da face non stop.
---
After 15 minutes he got bored and left.
---
At least i have a machete to kill some ferals.
---
Not patched. Maybe tomorrow. Hopefully they put it under SS catergory,otherwise it will just be my fancy NW underarmor.
---
I got a refund anyway,so win win.
---
A-come on and shiy-ne! 
---
(Dun dunna da nunna da nunna duna da *yeah*)
---
Because I login and hit my caps in 10 minutes.
---
Really wish you could plant a flag at your base to make it a stop for him, would love to see him more.
---
Yes but I've killed wanted people numerous times and always had pacifist enabled. Was I not meant to be able to previously? People who are wanted can be killed by people with pacifist enabled.
---
In ww2 the British made fake tanks from cardboard to trick German planes into thinking we were badass üòÇüòÇ
---
I donate regularly. Sometimes when I‚Äôm bored I make it a personal quest to find a set of the lowest level raider PA, give it some good mods and give it away. Sometimes I don‚Äôt want the hassle when I need to get rid of legendaries or plans I just put them in random boxes in train stations or Flatwoods rather than selling them. Most of the legendary items are too high for them to use anyway, so they can chop them up and hit up the purveyor if they want. I do it kinda because I‚Äôm bored and killing time or I want people to have a good time and keep them playing.
---
I'd say agility 30 could be the spot to drop sneak perk. You would be totally sure with one piece of harder to detect or a thorn armor set,or using a fixer.
---
The mob brings on the EXP, but not as much as the end event does. I‚Äôm in a group where we coordinate our silo runs. Well hit 3 queens in under 20 mins giving a total of 16K exp.  
---
waiting each one out for the mob just not worth it or efficient. 
---
That‚Äôs just player preference mind you. (And on private servers)
---
This is why I don't drink from random machines lmao even though I stock my machine with Nuka cherry and Quantum so people can heal up. Sometimes the odd asshat completely clears it out but it's still worth it
---
Wait the cola machine just forces people to drink whatever you have in it like the punch bowl? I figured it was a fridge
---
I agree on being able to show people our leader and make them become one with the mothman
---
I really think raising weapon level cap will do more bad than good. They should just scale enemies to make them harder.
---
Why do you care about cap limit? Shit I wish I could drop some caps to new players. I've been sitting at 29800 to 30k caps for 2 weeks.  I go to new players camps and buy their useless shit just to give them caps.
---
Because i know I will be back at 30k in a week or so without even bothering to hit the vendor cap limit most days.
---
Just use "your the dumbass" lol. 
---
Sure, they need to actually see the note, but it's better than nothing for the time being.
---
The point of the scrip limit is to control your earning. They want to ensure you're not making scrip faster than they anticipate, and more specifically have more than they anticipate when a purveyor sale goes on.
---
It's similar to why there are time limits on starting new missions in GTA Online.
---
The devs decide how well you can ultimately perform to keep balance and in some cases ensure you don't get too far ahead without some sort of monetization hitting you.
---
God Bless America. God Bless The Enclave.
---
Same. I have like 5 or 6 magic weapons that work great on normal enemies ,but they are just avarage against the queen. Ps4 anyway.
---
Cool that‚Äôs you and guess what? I don‚Äôt give a shit what you think or  how you play the game.... because you bought the game and you can play it however you want, so I don‚Äôt understand why you care that I don‚Äôt want cap limits. I‚Äôll humor you though...I care about the cap limits because I want to continue to be able to empty my inventory and make a profit and not at a certain point just hold onto things so I can sell it the next day and immediately hit my caps. Do you work for Bethesda or something? Why are you so against people being able to play the way they want to play it?
---
Expell them before they reveal our secret handshake!
---
Regardless of how you feel, Destiny is currently way more successful than fo76 and is at minimum pulling in quadruple the players 76 is right now on all platforms. On steam alone, its more like 8x. Hell, I have friends that still play Destiny after trying fo76 with wastelanders and being instantly defeated by crashing/bugs. Most of them didn't even finish Wastelanders. I love fo76, but its in a niche category and Bethesda has done a huge disservice to it. Comparing it to a game like Destiny 2 is unfair to Fallout. As for the game not changing, are you serious? Do you know how many queens I've killed since beta? Do you know what else there is to do besides kill queens? Not much, and if anything they've actually managed to remove content like the vault raids and replaced it with nothing but vague promises.
---
Honestly I love Fallout 76 and Fallout in general, but its in a bad place right now especially with going into a month of completely bugged out legendary run and adrenaline. Here is to hoping the new brotherhood content elevates it a bit.
---
Well cork is fire resistant.  Also when mixed with concrete it provides energy resistance.  Truth probably is cork is just rare and they are just trying to make it a challenge.
---
At the very minimum they should introduce an escrow system so caps and scrip earned when you hit the limit is not lost. Then it‚Äôs added to you as you go lower to the cap limits.
---
The enclave don't have cool cosmetics
---
What's the point of getting any powerful weapon or piece of armor if you can't kill things with it quickly?   Talk about removing reasons to play the game.
---
There's a huge wave of loot coming, brace yourselves!
---
I see him often, he appears at Whitesprings Station now and again, and have seen him multiple times at the House of Scares - never managed to find the roaming Vendor Bot though, so our experiences are flipped!
---
don't set up on his supply line. where that is idk. and don't sell beef in your vending machines . he don't like. Like ants finding spoiled meat In your camp in grounded. made that mistake.
---
Did you get your source?
---
I do use a less powerful weapon, but I didn't yesterday.   My partner walked into UF and said, "these guys are being dicks"....which means one-shotting a legenary.   So screw it.   They want to one-shot?  I can one-shot.     
---
Really tired of getting a legendary, barely damaging it, luring it out and calling others over.....   and then they do not do the same for me when another legendary shows up.
---
I know because I was on the receiving end of this. Very confusing at first.
---
If that happens I'll probably delete the game. There's already too many time gates in it. I will not make a third character. I'm irritated enough that I didn't get the stealth suit. And if you sided with the raiders there's nothing from them like that. No special thing you got while doing their quest. Then they sell it for 4k bullion.
---
It‚Äôs gonna get even more annoying if Meat Week gives you treasury notes. It took me a while to finish converting all the notes I got during Fasnacht.
---
&gt; I‚Äôll humor you though...I care about the cap limits because I want to continue to be able to empty my inventory and make a profit
---
Why do you give a shit about profit? It is literally pointless.   You don't need profit.  You can easily make all the money you need just playing the game. You can easily get all the junk you need playing the game.  You don't even need legendary gear to play the game.  And you can easily upgrade your legendary shit as you get better drops.
---
&gt;Why are you so against people being able to play the way they want to play it?
---
Because people make arbitrary standards and then complain when those arbitrary standards are not met.  And get really upset when somone else points out how arbitrary those ideas and concepts are.
---
You can play the game how you like. Just don't get mad at the game because of your made up rules you created out of fairy dust and unicorn farts.
---
Nothing beats that first Nukashine trip. 
---
I can still remember the mixture of fear and confusion that greeted my first shining. Good times...
---
I had two high-level unyielding armor pieces disappear.... and then reappear the next morning.   I even had a partner look at my stash to make sure I just wasn't seeing it somehow.   Nope.   It was definitely gone, and then definitely back.
---
Geez, I certainly won't be any atomic shop skins.   It seems like that create a lot of problems.
---
When I did the quest for it I woke up in the Mire and my buddy woke up somewhere in cranberry bog. We were in party chat at the time and we were both just like... Oh, what? Where the fuck am I? The fuck happened?
---
In this upcoming update. They state what some of the changes in this article as well as the said changes being included in the update projected for Aug. 4th.

---
Ad victoriam brother!
---
So what you're saying is dupers would have that ready in about an hour?
---
You mean starfield
---
as mentioned, the bashing damage legendary affix is what makes it so OP. limb damage and 33% VATS hit chance also cause this, but bashing damage is the most consistent.
---
You wanna sell it?
---
Yes.   I go to private server when I want to take (and particularly keep) a workshop without dealing with pvp.   I also use one when I have to kill "x".   Often, it's easier to find on a private one.   Scrap box is fantastic, and so is the tent for either fast travelling or having a way to store your scrap w/o using a scrap kit.
---
True story here: There was a guy at Uranium fever you kept one hitting the legendaries. After the event i randomly met him defending his workshop while i tried to claim it for a challenge. I killed him, took his junk and fast traveled away. 5 minutes later he and one of his mate started to hunt me. Fortunately PvP was off again. So ignored it for a while. Not much later his mate wandered off and he decided to initiated pvp with me alone. I accepted and insta killed him with my LMG and left the server... 
---
That's what you get for one hitting legendaries.
---
A camo t65 paint was leaked along with the current SS paint in the atom shop, other than that atomic onslaught and and any other paints that fully change appearance
---
Because gold would shorten the time we have to spend in Lord Todds Perfectly Working World^(TM) and thus reduce the chances that we might buy atoms.
---
So my 3 star Legendary Zealots Beta Wave ultracite gatling laser gun
---
\+30% damage to Scorched 
---
\+50 Damage resistance while aiming
---
Bashing Damage increased by 40 %
---
Is not the ideal weapon you say ?
---
Yes you are.
---
Now pass the butter.
---
They'll have to deal with 99% of 76s then, and we're a tough folks.
---
I do not feel the activation of submission routine, sorry.
---
Oh man, thanks a lot for making this post.
---
I knew there was something wrong about limb damage and (some) melee weapons. Made a post like 2 months ago ([https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gx98cd/is\_it\_me\_or\_23\_unarmed\_weapons\_are\_dropping\_only/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gx98cd/is_it_me_or_23_unarmed_weapons_are_dropping_only/)) and nobody believed me.
---
Was driving me crazy xD
---
Congrats you were played by your own stupidity. Don't craft more than you can exchange that day, else you'll you build up excess weight.
---
¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I have a 5 razor grain 5 corn farm, that's it. Every time I see a quantum I buy it or take it. I have a backlog of nukashine but no one ever drinks from my nuka cola machine lol.
---
Because of that, I always drink from people's stash.
---
"Ward and his fuckery"?     
---
ROTFL!
---
It‚Äôs not made up and again in most MMO‚Äôs unless it‚Äôs free to play and they‚Äôre enticing you to subscribe you‚Äôre not limited to how much money you can make. Why do I care about making a profit? none of your fucking business. The only thing made up of fairy dust and unicorn farts is your shitty opinions. Bye Felicia. Thankfully the majority of the community doesn‚Äôt think like you.
---
My favorite story time would probably have to be either when I killed an entire group, one with marine and a handmade, and the others with a variety of weapons, with nothing but a gauss shotgun and marine. Died shortly after, but still. So sorry if you see this TheWizard. Other time would have to be when I got a 13 kill game. Combat shotgun and a scoped lever. Just kept scoping in at medium range targets and kicking ass with the shotgun. Actually got a quick scope head shot. And I did it all solo. Made a new friend after that match. Probably my favorite NW buddy today. Probably not the most impressive number though.
---
Just survive somehow
---
Obivously because he's stupid. And now complaining about it makes him look even more ridiculous. OP made a low IQ decision and blames the game, because he can't accept his own stupidity.
---
Oh, good luck with that if you're not on a private server.   I swear 80 percent of players no longer to tag, lure out the legendary, and motion to others.   It used to be much better.   Now, it's very unreliable as a source of multiple legendaries.
---
Event is broken! ....always has been
---
Put on a stealth suit, hide somewhere inside the workshop radius, and don‚Äôt move. I like to pvp, but I‚Äôll get bored of hide and seek almost instantly. People want a battle, most of us will just leave if you don‚Äôt bother fighting back. I don‚Äôt want your stuff, I just want you to try and kill me.
---
They are in the game and are functional, the hackers that  back in the day had Murmrgm, The misterious stranger, NW briefcase and Preston in their camps also managed to get the manicans and probably still have them.
---
I think SH games did show them in a video I just don't remember in witch.
---
I'll be checking this out. Gracias
---
Yup, it does that. I thought you stock it like a fridge and people will have a choice what to drink (not that I gave them a choice anyway, but those are unnecessary details).. I once went to someone camp and opened the cola machine and it made me consume something suspicious, good thing it was just some nuka cola. But that's how I knew it's a bigger punch bowl :D
---
I get slightly nauseous during Line in the Sand.
---
And to repair the wall you will need more cork once again...
---
Every player except the two dummies in here defending the caps and telling people to play something else.
---
and where spawn? Bag under map? Sometimes bag spawn 5m high from ground or bugged inside map. Also when you have junk there should be mission about take your junk back and even tagged on map.
---
Damn I didn't snag it last time it was in the shop I still have my super sketchy punch bowl just sitting there are non suspicious
---
You deserve a statue! I once drank something from someone's camp being slightly worried it was nukashine, but it was some cola, which was very nice from them.
---
I‚Äôd rather there be a cap on how much you can sell things for than how much you can earn.
---
Most likely you might as well. I have the stealth suit, 3/3 sneak cards, escape artist, and 15 agility and regularly sneak through enemies I don't feel like fighting.
---
No problems getting right up point blank to them, sometimes even bumping into them lol, and dropping off enemy radar and getting back to [hidden] is really easy.
---
Sometimes I feel like it really messes with enemy AI though. Scorchbeast lands but doesn't attack me, it just sits there while I sit in front of it unloading into its face while I'm still in [caution]. Others seem to freeze up sometimes looking for me while my allies shoot them.
---
Were you doing an event? You don‚Äôt drop your junk if you‚Äôre in a public event.
---
Ik but the bag just doesn‚Äôt exist and on the map it doesn‚Äôt even say to recover it
---
I like this thing and I do the same, however after some time it gets old. Most of the times it works only if you put your camp somewhere in the forest where lots of new people are :p
---
Wasn‚Äôt in a event just died and no bag
---
How do you do that?!
---
I'm sure it will be back or something else will pop up. I think punch bowl was kinda a success, so they'll bring more. I also hope there will be something like a bowl with snacks that I can stock with prewar goodies, because they're too cheap to sell and I don't eat them.
---
takes too many perks to get it past a lever damage wise.  good on paper but not in practice, imo.  ymmv of course.
---
use atoms for the last levels. 150 atoms = one level and doesn't matter how big the level is. So spending atoms on the last levels is smarter, you get more score for your atoms.
---
Careful what you wish for.  Knowing Bethesda, I can see a katana skin being exclusive to the Atomic Shop for something like the machete.
---
A big ol bowl of Cram lol that would be hilarious
---
A bit late here but the reason is relatively simple really: Because the Handmade rifle is statistically the best weapon in the game at least as far as rifles are concerned and considering that almost nobody uses the standard Assault Rifle as a result why release a skin for the latter since nobody is gonna buy it anyway?
---
Besides the animations for the Assault Rifle probably wouldn't fit at all with the R91 too.
---
Some tip for you mate, collect strangler bloom during heart of swamp event, they pop every time during that event
---
I‚Äôm gonna put my blood in that too.
---
Yeah, it's pretty hard if you didn't do both factions all the way to the "choose a side" point.   However, if you really farm Tnotes and gb, that 4K happens eventually.   
---
You need that suit.   It's a gamechanger for things like Radiation Rumble.
---
Oh yeah, I was thinking just the same! I'd also like to be able to display different power armor. Like to show some skins, but I think that would be difficult to implement or you'll have to craft a few sets to show them off. But mannequins is definitely a good idea.
---
its highly impossible i would say, but its fallout 76 so bugs everywhere. Sometimes i also haven't bag when die, but then i realized i haven't junk at that time.
---
As long as people enjoy it :p It would be a good trend to share some kindness, since there's nothing in prewar food like nukashine in drinks xD
---
It‚Äôs a right of passage.
---
the solution for that is to nuke their camp
---
Bethesda is struggling to balance 3 star weapons. We all know the "magic" damage issue has been there for a while, and Bethesda either:
---
* knows but doesn't care -or-
---
* knows but has no idea how to fix it.
---
Either case, the pure fact that this exists suggests Bethesda cannot control/administrate a system with with more than 3 stars until they have a firm grasp on the current situation.
---
It is bad enough getting a 1 star item from a  supposed 3 star enemy/event. If I get a 1 star from a supposed 5 star event or enemy I am likely to cancel my FO1st and uninstall the game.
---
More trait variety would be a better addition in my view.
---
Items for sale do count in your stash? Even if you open your stash first thing you'll see is what you put on sale, lol. And same with display stuff, those take both the space in stash and budget of the camp. I wish things were different tho.
---
Maybe Biv could branch out and start making special brownies lmao
---
he is always and still always will be part of any base i make, i love cats everyone of them even the hairless ones (even if they look uncomfortable to touch) and always breaks my heart to know someones little kitty is gone :(
---
cats and dogs bring alot of joy to people and deserve the utmost respect for all the times they cheer us up
---
Same here. Done collecting on public servers unless more than one friend joins.
---
Yup, they are still rare and werent duped to oblivion.
---
Yeah I got one as well, goes well with the insurgent outfit
---
I wouldn't mind those *wink wink*
---
Like I said was on a mule character so I had a fuck ton of junk on me. Had a friend recorded what happen looked back at the video and when I died no bag was dropped.
---
Lmao if you focus entirely on the events and missions what count, I could get to level 50, do my build and then do whatever
---
Done my scrip and bullion for the day. Was max caps so no need for vendor.
---
Close to levelling up, so backed out as Id rather wait until the challenge pops up for levelling up.
---
Guess thats it for now for the game until 5pm when the challenges refresh. What fun.
---
Tbf when I did that, I‚Äôd say I was playing around 6+ hours a day cos of lockdown so being fair, it would probably take me a week once out of lockdown
---
There is always one, I wonder how long have they been playing the game for. I love fallout, but at the moment of feels like a job. üòû I have been playing grounded a lot, excellent game.
---
You can use all of universal paints (like plague walker, responder cop etc.) on t 65.
---
Todos los parches han sido los martes sobre las 4 de la tarde
---
Yep. 
---
Never used it in any FO game, I'd rather run around in a decent set of non-PA...armor üòÇ
---
Then when he wakes up he gets surrounded by 2 high levelled Honey Beast (I know from exp from drinking my 1st Nukashine)
---
Ostia pues mi memoria esta en la mierda entonces, gracias tio c:
---
For third you can zoom the camera out, but obvs no use if you play first person.
---
Unless he was dealing damage to you somehow, you could have FT'd out.
---
bad run. you missed a lot.
---
particularly little narrow tunnel obscured be shrub. has chem bench at end.
---
Thanks for that (I'll stop doing it now)
---
&gt; It‚Äôs not made up  
---
Is any of this required to play the game? No. So it is made up by your own mind and thus entirely arbitrary in nature.
---
&gt; and they‚Äôre enticing you to subscribe you‚Äôre not limited to how much money you can make. 
---
And introducing inflation were before end game gear might have cost 500k gold now costs 3 billion gold. Were entire portions of the game are ignored because another portion gives 1k more gold an hour. Even though both portions are offering 400 and 399k an hour respectively.  And each new bit of content has to give more gold per hour otherwise it is dead content. Thus further escalating the inflation rates and creating an ever increasing problem as more and more items flood the market devaluing them making it harder and harder to make the same amount of money needing double the work.
---
You really need to look up inflation and understand why the cap limit is great. It literally limits inflation. Otherwise a 2 shot handmade might cost 4 or 5k caps now. In a year without the cap the same weapon would cost 10-15k caps because of inflation.
---
&gt;  Why do I care about making a profit? none of your fucking business. 
---
You are complaining about the game based on an arbitrary ideology. And you are doing it on a public forum.  This now becomes my problem because throughout all of your replies you have yet to show that your entire idea and play style isn't arbitrary.
---
You might as well be complaining that Disney World doesn't give you special treatment because you choose to blind fold yourself.
---
Sounds like lagging
---
so it happens, you maybe learn not to play with mule and always put junk on box. People lost whole power armor sets or legendary weapons before. 
---
Maybe whole problem is you drop a "FUCK TON OF JUNK" and game just cant handle that on ground so game delete it.
---
He visits my camp every now and then and i feel blessed!
---
heres me thinking they planned to use it as sound proofing against scorched screeches :P
---
I'm tempted to do the same when I've had it with players trying to initiate pvp with me even after I've told them no repeatedly.  Sometimes you just get tired of other players period.
---
Same. I used it to bush wookie my way to the gillie suit. Now I doubt I‚Äôll ever use it again.
---
cork is also good for muffling sound and vibration, 2 things scorch beasts screams do well
---
I know. Plus the character I need it on is my sneak commando which sucks
---

---
When I didn't lock things, I'd regularly come back to my camp and find 0 left.  And I mean many days of it.   I didn't build purifiers so that I'd have to go buy it or boil dirty water.
---
Wow I thought she liked me, I wonder why she always came to me ü§î
---
I started doing this as soon as I got the perk. I refer to it as being a water wookie. Survive 10 minutes in NW challenge?  Hide under water, survive for 14, finish 9th place after the fire burns me.
---
That‚Äôs what most likely happen. I‚Äôm not really mad about since I have three other junk mules character just  was asking if this happened to anyone thx anyway.
---
Came to the game a few weeks back, and I'm enjoying it. I've deffo had my ¬£20'ish (Steam sale price) out of it. Though I never bought into the Internet hate-train. I just couldn't play it on Linux until recently, heh.
---
I gave a bottle to a lv 5, and he woke up south south west of the glass caverns near the large pink trees. I felt bad, but not bad enough to care as I also gave him a dected out huting rifle, plans and 1000 ammo
---
Oh, with thieves it's fine when they dish out horses\*\*\*.   It's only bad when they're getting it dealt to them.
---
I'm level 98 and I still make the mistake of NOT drinking from punch bowls
---
Thanks!
---
Your analogies are pretty shitty and speak highly to someone that doesn‚Äôt actually know what the fuck he‚Äôs talking about or play that game very much which makes sense considering that you actively don‚Äôt want people to play the game. Also 10 - 15k is already a standard for many good end game weapons. I don‚Äôt agree with you at all.
---
He regularly walks through my camp
---
Three would be fine.  There are actually around 7 currencies.  Scrip, caps, bullion, fuzzy tokens, miner tokens, legendary tokens, candy.  Probably others I‚Äôve forgotten
---
I started doing the same with my punch bowl. I've filled it twice so far and it never gets old watching these new, low level players stop next to it and then end up across the map in the middle of nowhere haha
---
Wow really? As a new player, I‚Äôm glad I learnt that from you instead of in the game...
---
Higher level pieces will have higher DR/ER but you also have to factor in the "grade" of the Armour, Leather, Metal, Combat, Robot come in three "Grades" Light, Sturdy and Heavy. (Trapper and Marine are listed under "Sturdy", Scout can not be crafted and Secret Service has it's own entry on the crafting menu)
---
It is probable that you had a Level 20 Heavy piece (More so if another player crafted it for you) and you crafted a level 20 light piece.
---
Perfect for randoms who keep trying to get your high end items when it‚Äôs obvious they should take the hint that you don‚Äôt want to trade
---
I love putting items up for display! Unfortunately they count towards CAMP budget. I wish it didn‚Äôt count towards CAMP budget so much. 
---
Ability to display junk items like in FO4. Making it count less towards CAMP budget. AND adding mannequins and power armour displays! 
---
That would make me very happy.
---
I'm doing the same now. I play maybe once a week to get some treasury notes. Might get a SS chest before Christmas..
---
Ah I see, that's probably it. Is there a way to check this?
---
Most crafted armor has light, medium and heavy versions.  Make sure you are replacing like with like.
---
This bug is going right from TES Oblivion. Incorrect npc placement on chairs and beds. It's been a part of that engine from the beginning and it's still here, 15 years later. Game engine is not war, it really should change at some point, Bethesda.
---
I think they did. the rep bar still shows up, but there's either no progression (until you finish the interaction), or it's so miniscule as to no longer be worth it - for me, at least:  YMMV.
---
First time I did it my character was massively overburdened so go transported and had to walk back. Wasn‚Äôt fun
---
Hehe, I made a post appreciating players putting ammo for 1 cap in their vendors. It is so neat to buy 3 times 1 ammo for 1 cap.
---
Would it be donated in like lots of 100? And would we be able to do it multiple times a day?
---
Very good
---
Feel your pain.  I‚Äôm stuck on rolling for right arm.
---
i think live ghoul bodypart removal was to A: reduce game stress and B: stop the exploit where you could just shoot the arm on the floor to kill the ghoul it came from
---
You should be able to "inspect" the item and it should give it's full description (Consoles it's RS)
---
Outside that, it's learning the DR/ER values.
---
No, because the accuracy drops off rather fast, so instead of being accurate at 100+ it has trouble hitting shit at 50.
---
Then there is the durability, both explosive and 2 shot will cut it by ~25-50%.
---
With a lever you want instigating, limb damage, with 25% less AP.
---
Never repair the Air to air turret it is so annoying.
---
See I started a melee then got sooo bored of it that with wastelanders I made a gunslinger and never looked back. Now I wanna go hit things with a ski sword again.
---
If it's heavy it should have that in the name. Same for Sturdy. Not sure if the light one has that in the name or just "combat armor". This was introduced a patch or two ago - before that we had to look at the weight to identity what it was.
---
All i need is sick PA and guns
---
Why use many word when few word do trick.
---
And a scortchbeast guano pile emote for the people that are still selling mounted head plans, crappy ultracite plans, and ammo for more than a cap
---
Great intel, had not realised this and I‚Äôm level 200
---
No it'd be too offensive to any kids playing despite it being an 18+ Mature audience game because you know how it be
---
Karen's kids are so well behaved and this 18+ game is great family entertainment, DID THAT CHARACTER SWEAR?! GET THIS GAME BANNED NOW! OUR KIDS ARE PLAYING THIS GAME!
---
Although I wouldn't mind a Driver Nephi emote that's just a clean and simple "Get fucked"
---
There is a point to the limit but no one likes to hear it. It's a time gate. It keeps you coming back every single day. If the limit was increased you'd have more scrip which means more legendary rolls which means you'd get to the weapon you want faster which means you'd get bored of the game and go play something else.
---
V9 is always the closest.  You have to run past it from the fizzure to get back to your death spot!
---
Dont worry about it we dont need to turn anything in and weel still get rewards
---
There's a couple of subreddits for trading so if you check those out you'll probably get someone who wants to trade
---
Fuck them both. Join us. Raiders are everywhere...
---
Yes.
---
I don't have one but it was duped heavily, I saw someone selling 20something of them yesterday so obviously the care factor is 0. I've seen them frequently in vendors (PC) so map hop and you should get lucky. Could also try the trading sub.
---
I want a washing machine too, giving clothes a temporary shiny effect, something like that
---
God Bless the Enclave. Die BOS scum.
---
This! So what if you lose one batch right? I would love to find someone picking locks and bullying my camp a bit. It feels too safe around the wastelands IMO. 
---
Not saying you can't be mad OP but it's not like its a shitload of junk or was it?
---
True to that, but it's bethesda ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è what do you expect
---
You're not the only one that would pay atoms for that emote.
---
Yes! I was running uranium fever and the legendary spawned next to me every single time so I got a few shots in and then used the follow me emoji. Out of the 6 players it was always one level 300+ asshole who ran up and one shot it. I hate those people.
---
It seems that if you got achieved, but not activated legendary run level stuff on your board and when buying next level with ATOMS. You lose atoms and do not get level.   
---
Fun.
---
&gt; Your analogies are pretty shitty 
---
That isn't an analogy that is an example.  This is exactly what happend with Runescape and still is happening. The value of gold has devalued so much and the price of items have dropped so much that new mobs have to drop even more items to make up for it which only add to the inflation rates. 
---
&gt; or play that game very much 
---
I think I'm at around 400 to 500 hours on the game. 
---
&gt; that you actively don‚Äôt want people to play the game. 
---
Were do I say that? All I said was that if you have a hard cap it gives you a chance to play other games as well. You can keep playing the game if you find it enjoyable. But If you only play to reach script or bullion or cap limit then it reduces grind and lets you turn in for the day until the reset.
---
And once again you are defining the entire game around those hard limits. Which again is entirely arbitrary concept made of fairy dust and unicorn farts. I regularly play well beyond the cap restrictions just for fun.  I will drop legendary gear and extra useless shit or give it away to another player.  Or if I'm feeling particularly mischievous I will sell it to a vendor even if I get 0 caps for someone to come along and buy it for real cheap.
---
Script, caps, bullions are a means to an end not the entire point of the game.  And you can act like they are the entire point of the game but you don't get to complain when the game treats them as simply a means to an end and nothing more.
---
Try another sub
---
No it's cool like it is imo. Blowing up camps out of proportion would create alot of issues like lag and server problems.
---
You probably just shouldnt play videogames in general
---
I am geared for heavy guns and explosives I just hack a terminal get the stuff I want and go ham. I killed 16 people in nw and won.
---
A few times I've trade requested just to see what weapon they're using, but I always give a few stimpaks for bothering to accept in the first place
---
I love everything about this but mounted heads still do well they're just everywhere is all
---
They were at their best in the Commonwealth. Arthur is a much better leader than Owen.
---
Based on posts, the main contributing factors could be:
---
* after the reset, you log into NW first,
---
* after the reset, you visit the Atom shop from the main screen,
---
* you crash while loading into Adventure,
---
* you get disconnected while loading into Adventure.
---
(On a sidenote, it seems the underlying issue is more of a lack of reset of the counters. For example, the previous day had "Kill a legendary (2/2)" and the next day has "Kill a legendary (2/3)" because the counter was not reset.)
---
A true businessman. Always ready to make a sale even with crazy dragon bats who gas everyone flying around. üòÇ
---
Important stuff, IMO; 
---
Stop/Wait,  
---
Sorry,  
---
Lead on/I'll follow you,   
---
The ability to point at or highlight stuff would be handy, too. But I can't imagine how that'd work
---
Why would I choose a light version over a heavy? If it's the weight then I don't see the point
---
There's isn't a scrip limit log out and back in
---
There is an ingame fov changer my friend
---
What was that? "Put in the Atomic shop not just a plan?" We'll gladly do that!
---
2400?!? I'm a junkies but I get nowhere near as much as that, maxed out at like 200-300 with my Gatling gun.
---
Nobody drink from my punch bowl.  It‚Äôs outside next to the door in a safe.  Maybe I need a neon sign....
---
Problem is they were duped heavily but people who have 1 of them seem to think it‚Äôs still worth 4 legacy‚Äôs a B2525 fixer and flux to top it up so they‚Äôre hard to buy
---
‚Äã
---
That‚Äôs an analogy... and it‚Äôs shitty.
---
It wouldn't even be so bad if the limits where a bit more forgiving and the way to hit those limits weren't so tedious.
---
‚ÄòBUYING THINGS!!‚Äô

Mine is on a table right next to my vending machines

---
Got a question about the event. How much do I need to contribute to earn anything, I don't give a fuck about bos and iam still leveling, but don't want to miss out on potential rewards
---
You don't necessarily need the highest DR/ER. It depends on playstyle and personal preference.   
---
Look at the weight/protection and decide for yourself if you'd rather have more defense or inventory space.
---
I can, there is one but under mods it gives you a boost while you sprint as i understand it
---
play in the open. no tents near the open space. don't stagger her in air. you can see when she wants to land.  It is not brain surgery.
---
We don't care who's nuke it is anymore. If people are on tents or fences go full bloodied gauss minigun, aggro her and draw the fight away from campers..
---
I hope you aren't a grown man. if you are this is pathetic.
---
Only if I can get an "I'm sorry" emote.
---
I need to get some nukashine
---
How
---
I found that one, i remember using the bench to scrap all the weapons and junk I picked up along the way.
---
Just wanted to share my story too - I started playing it in May and after a week or so I was convinced the game wasn‚Äôt for me. I hate grinding and was forced to do so because I essentially got level-locked out of progressing any further in the story. I also messed up with my build which made things difficult. It was a shame because I love Fallout in general.
---
Then I decided to only play on double XP weekends, that way I could still progress, albeit slowly as I was essentially only playing 4 days per month. I had fun during Fasnacht, and also bought a month of 1st to see if it improved my experience. However I still ended up leaving again after Fasnacht ended.
---
Came back again during the double XP weekend last month and became interested in the Legendary Run as well, so I played the double SCORE weekend too. During this time I was able to figure out an ideal way for me to farm XP (taking and defending workshops on my private server) so it‚Äôs less of a chore to grind, at least at my current level.
---
So now I‚Äôm playing daily and I‚Äôm finally starting to love the game. I‚Äôm still working on fixing my build and I don‚Äôt have very much in terms of good weapons or armor, but I‚Äôm making progress and I‚Äôm happy about that. I‚Äôm planning on hitting level 50 tomorrow so it‚Äôll be a milestone for me
---
Likewise

---
Given it‚Äôs been posted about in the data mining discord, you must be on the wrong one.
---
The source is Eckserah.
---
What event is happening?
---
And a thanks emote
---
I use the "let's nuke" one for those players.
---
Nope, this was added in a recent patch when a tag was added to weapons - a collection of them (mentioned elsewhere in these comments) didn‚Äôt get the tag and can only have limb for the second star.
---
OP, are you on console? There‚Äôs no FOV changer on consoles
---
Don't listen to this guy. All he does is go around being a jerk. Just put him on block.
---
It‚Äôs only on weapons dropped from mobs. Ones from the purveyor don‚Äôt have this problem unless they‚Äôre mystery pick.
---
I just got the plan for the ss jetpack. And realize that i am a little short on some flux. Enyone who want to trade? I'm on Xbox. Thanks in advance.
---
And not as a skin!
---
And Erik the slayer in Skyrim
---
Make sure to use the ghillie backpack skin if you have it. Makes a good "stem" for your pumpkin outfit. I rock that, the glowing skeleton hood, and a pumpkin paint combat rifle
---
Don't listen to Shmagmyer. He spends his time being a jerk to people on reddit to troll them.
---
That's f***ing annoying
---
This problem is still a thing. I want the gauss shotgun on this character but ward won‚Äôt trigger quest. So looks like that out of question. Server hopping does not help at all and hasn‚Äôt for the last month or so.
---
yep- its 100% my favourite game
---
I had the exact same problem -- I couldn't just fast travel out of there. It was pretty exciting though, suddenly thrown into this strange high-level area with a stinking hangover and no idea how to get home.
---
I know lol but I believe it‚Äôll reduce your frames drastically since I‚Äôm doing around 30 frames on average. 
---
Best you can do is go into third person and hold right joystick while you move the right joystick down to move your camera farther away from your character.
---
How will it reduce frames tho?
---
I have an exploding, instigating, Vats pump shotgun. 209 dmg pellet with shotgun and explosive mods. 
---
209 x 8 pellets x double damage on max hp enemies.
---
1672 damage per vats. 
---
 Dont forget crit and sneak damage. 
---
Range is shit, But when you need to rek something. I dont use it for pvp. Unless they are an asshole.
---
There's nothing to really fix, you're not intended to horde them or trade them really. It only triggers when you loot the item yourself.
---
DUDE SHUT UP, NOW EVERYONE KNOWS TO LOOK IN THE WATER
---
I will try that. Thanks!
---
Datamining isn't against the TOS, and the 76 dataminers have an establish history of working with Bethesda.
---
Wider field of view &gt; more assets on your screen &gt; more time to load the assets &gt; drop in performance or frames
---
Why would you buy Tech Data when you can find them at multiple tech centres for free? Why would you pay 5k? Why buy multiples before checking if you could hand them in? it's no secret you can only hand in the last one you find, any others are 1c scrap each.
---
The stories and exploration. 
---
The end game's completely open-ended. Once you reach level 50, which doesn't take too long, you'll need to set your own goals. Like hunting for specific gear, acquiring gold bullion or becoming a raider. Other than that, enjoy the stories and exploration that fallout games always offer.
---
I'm still quite new to the game, But I think if you need a hard-end to a game, you most likely won't find it in FO76.
---
A few of us have been adamant for some time, and finally got confirmation yesterday, which was wonderful to find out we're not insane and it's actually bugged.
---
I've played really detailed games with 120 fov on my original xbox one with no frames dropping
---
not always the case i have pick enought tech data that did not trigger the event at all.
---
The quest only triggers/updates when you pick up a *new* Technical Data in the world. That's by design, it's not broken as far as the devs are concerned. They've already changed the way Hidden Knowledge works at least once.   
---
But kudos to the guy who sold you them for 5k. That's a legendary troll.
---
Bumper sword needs to make a comeback.
---
The list is posted elsewhere in the comments
---
this bug is been in game for a long time, dont get your hopes up that this will get soon fixed.
---
Its not the spelling. He just maxxed his camp budget.
---
Which games? I feel like fallout is one of the worst games for frames.
---
On top of that... YOU GOTO FAST TRAVEL.. Booted out... try again... booted out... try again. . booted out....Till about the 6th try then you finally fast travel ...
---
Ye I dropped all 500 to my friend, it works if you buy it from a players inventory but when he picked it up they disappeared
---
Lever rifle.
---
Layers for in the power armors.
---
It‚Äôs still brilliant most of the time.  Ignore the haters.  Try it and don‚Äôt get sucked into the ‚Äòhaving to complete the daily score quests‚Äô
---
this is actually a great advice
---
The most I got was 525 carry weight. Without any chems. My strength was 50. BUT, that was once and all my stats where higher than usual. (My average capacity is 460 though)
---
I don't know how it'd work with magazine racks, since there's such a huge variety of magazines, but the Bobbleheads is actually a really good idea.   
---
If one of each Bobblehead is part of the crafting recipe and it removes the need to track and draw the individual objects then, yeah, that's a good way to handle it.
---
When I played last, I wasn't even sucked into grinding out nukes.
---
I was always setting up the non popular workshops.
---
I love the Ghille Wood Armour skin. My non-violent (mostly), berry-eater character loves it.
---
My camps next to the wayward and I‚Äôve seen him there more than anywhere else.
---
What is the purpose of that?
---
Cod Black ops 2 which was pretty detailed, resident evil 7 and a few others
---
That's also the downside with deep pocketed. If you get in a PA it's heavy. Ultra Light stays light
---
its been my experience that most people who have this particular outcome in a community are more likely to be the problem, not everyone else.
---
It‚Äôs the game‚Äôs engine that determine the performance and your pc or console setup. 
---
Not sure why fallout frames are bad
---
Whoops
---
Ok I understand
---
Personally I‚Äôm a fan of adding an emote for ‚Äúthank you‚Äù. Yeah, there‚Äôs thumbs up and heart, but I‚Äôd like something more specific. I like the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù idea too
---
He and mechanic best friend
---
It's a rite-of-passage for the noobs to get their first Nukashine mystery destination. You're honouring a 76 tradition.
---
Same happened to me a few days ago. They just all came rushing out of the golf club.
---
The hate the game got was and still is justified. Especially with jerky anti-consumer practices likr F*You First.
---
That being said it's good to form your own opinions on things instead of being a sheeple. 
---
I too thoroughly enjoy the game. Wastelanders has added enough stuff to do to keep me entertained and playing at max level.
---
not many, because when i would write: its your fault carrying tons of junk. Plenty of people would think im fan of broken game or something.
---
Never had any problems with fusion cores with PA. There's a perk that double it's capacity for PA and for Gatling Laser. Never ever had less than 20 cores in my pocket and I never even used a Poseidon plant fusion core processor.
---
What is with Bethesda's obsession with limb damage?
---
One run through west tek and the burrows and I can usually find three at least.
---
I regret putting a jet pack on a Ultracite pa leg. Should have done that before they patched it. I combined x-01 and ultracite and the torso from the escavator for the 4x mining yield. And then a skin that it looks the same.
---
A lot of Fallout 1st members have amassed a huge amount of junk that's sitting in a seemingly infinite pile so they want to drain a lot of it with a junksink, clearly.
---
Crikey,. What the hell are you even selling at that kind of price? That's brutal. 
---
I put a 3* Lightweight Vampires +AGI Gatling Plasma in my vendor for 1k.   
---
Felt bad about it, too. It was a purveyor roll, cost me basically nothing.
---
You mean insulator
---
Why don't you disconnect your machine from electricity?  That's what I do when I'm full or close
---
He did this to me the other day. I was messing around with my vending machine and all of a sudden heard my turrets going off so I exited to see what was going on. He went on to destroy both of them and then was so mad after that he also destroyed my cooking station. Then he just left like nothing happened
---
Well... They spent a lot of time creating those 'broken arm/leg' animations so...
---
My head canon is, the bugs are part of the atmosphere. We're all suffering from extreme radiation sickness to the point of mutating after all, so 'seeing' things and blacking out occasionally (blue screen) is part of the experience. ;p
---
Wait, you want a skin?? Lets sell it for 600 atoms and have the textures not load properly!! I like that idea.
---
Psychobuff is bugged as well and prevents people from dying from rads.
---
Yeah he just bails after
---
I got a level 1 bloodied hunting rifle after scripping for weeks and used that weapon to get all four other characters to 50.
---
Mainly Bloodied weapons since I don't run Bloodied build and they can move if the right person comes along. It was my fault for running around cap heavy. Should have unloaded on cheap serums or something that can be resold to players or vendor bots as needed.
---
I've been using my camp ally to show off any rare outfits 
---
(in case you didnt know you can fully customise their appearance, clothes, helmet, backpack, ring)
---
My favourite event by far ... ammo, mats, XP and SCORE by the bucket load
---
Yes that would be a great idea I tried to put them in a display case but it didn‚Äôt work only the hats went in. I really enjoy picking up different outfits and I sell the unusual ones for 10/20 caps in my vendor  it gives me joy to see someone buy one  put it on and come upstairs into my camp and show me with a thumbs up. I‚Äôm building a new character right now and it‚Äôs surprising how many I‚Äôve picked up this time that I‚Äôve never seen before.
---
I always try stay around 20k
---
Which weapons....
---
Yep, I also suffered the wrath of Grahm in my first week of playing. He‚Äôs a tough guy.
---
God mode is almost impossible to get into anymore. The only way I know how to anymore requires way too much luck and is time consuming. You'd have 2 or 3 hours spent just trying to get godded.
---
Those are fantastic FALLOUT RNG odds. This will be like getting a legendary Rolling pin.
---
It's a sign from todd. He will watch your career with great interest
---
Interesting dynamic on this thread. The person that relies on other people to tell him if he will have fun with a game posts a question. Other people who seem to be playing a game they don't enjoy (?) validate his already negative opinion.
---
You know that they can still buy things when they come across your camp right?
---
It‚Äôs a quest reward
---
I have a closed off key pad room where i will in the future move the machines to when approaching the limit. I figure it all evens out since i got a steal on the bear arms :)
---
I thought there was an exploit to spawn earlier in NW, so it's a random bug related to delayed spawn?
---
Yeah, the game sorely needs a proper caps sink.   
---
Thought Gold Bullion/Wastleanders endgame gear might be it, but they put daily caps on everything.
---
‚ÄúHow many camps can I hit at once?‚Äù
---
I would like to see ‚Äòstop‚Äô. As in, ‚Äòstop! Don‚Äôt start the event yet.‚Äô
---
I‚Äôve had this happen before...l lost about 4K in caps and it sucked, lol! My fault too. I‚Äôve learned from my mistake. I don‚Äôt have my shop open when I‚Äôm cap heavy. My vending machines are in a garage type structure connected to a hidden power switch, and in turn connected to a terminal which powers the entire garage, so it‚Äôs easy for me to switch my shop off...it was a bitch for me to wire everything properly...but it‚Äôs totally worth it! üòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
Weird, on PC the modules don't reset.
---
Why all that trouble?
---
Or, just make it so you have 10 seconds of radiation invulnerability when you respond so you have a moment to get your shit together
---
Yeah, I'm not trying to present it as a huge problem but rather as an annoyance. They weigh a lot, and I don't need another thing to farm for.
---
Tbh, the secret fireplace door pictures actualy show PA being displayed :/
---
maybe a rack for each series? Then they can even style the individual racks. For example a space kind of theme for the tesla science rack or a rack that looks like it's made by scouts for the scouts series or a repeat of the art work of the magazines on the rack. Would save less required budget because you need a rack for each series but would still help a lot.
---
Really? but at least no one teleport to it mine is near shelter 76 so only the newcomers player come by at foot
---
Not very well for sure...
---
Because he is strongest supermutant
---
I've been loving the game!  I heard all the hate and can def see some of the issues they were talking about.  If you think of it like an MMO instead of Fallout 5.   Still it has a lot of the shit I wanted in fallout 4.  Weapon condition a larger variety of weapon and armors.  There is so much variety with the weapon choice it's crazy. I carry 3 different shotguns because I cant decide a favorite. 
---
I haven't experienced the complaints that other power players have.  Like what even are you selling to the trading bots and scrip machines to even deplete them.  
---
Its great to move camp all over and build a house with a refinery that you need.
---
Are punch bowls still attainable? The wiki says it's in the Atomic shop, but I can't remember seeing it there?
---
Yeah they can still buy from it. The only difference with/without power is that it doesn't show up on the map without.
---
My camp has been on the tracks since like launch and I ain‚Äôt moving now I‚Äôm an old raider and stuck in my ways if I die so be it
---
The only one to have when you have only time for one, my favorite.
---
I'm pretty sure if the ancient samurai had access to a fat man they would have loved it
---
Who is mad? I thought it was funny.
---
I'm just south of it at the base of the ski lift to Top of the World. 
---
Pretty sure I should be outside the blast zone but will be interesting to find out!
---
Will the area be good for flux farming?
---
I got the T65 PA and Liberty Prime bundle and all can be applied üòä
---
If you have the right machine, yes. There are three: one is a decoration (does nothing), one is a secret door, and one is an actual dispenser.
---
We had limits since the release I think Bethesda has a lot of limitations to item capacity in the servers. Eg. the camp budget limitations &amp; future instance system. 
---
It's not just about making the existing content more "rentable", as players need to log in more and play overtime, rather than grind all in a few days. The game has a lot of technical limitations, and it works like a snowball. One thing affects the other, moving to the next :(
---
Just take relief in onowing that even thought they probably have a large stash of duped ammo, you are helping remove it from the game by them wasting it.
---
I would also love to see more historical weapons like BAR, FG42. But I'm afraid we would get to point where game felt more like COD than fallout.
---
Awol, hoard events, one violent night, distant thunder are all ones I hit when they're up
---
I don't see a problem with mounted head plans. I still don't have them all....TY RNGesus...but I also don't plan on buying them, lots of noobs will tho.
---
Pretty sure bos recon rifle was designed to be gifted to low levels haha. It takes the same mats as a hunting rifle but comes fully modded. That and a modded base ball bat are my go to gifts for low levels
---
I really want to see an Enclave DLC... It has been so long.
---
100% agree
---
That and the Fo4 Drugs sign
---
Good advice here.
---
Another thing I do is if I need to put junk legendary armor in stash, I'll mod the armor with ultra light so it drastically cuts down on weight.  It costs some materials, but those are easy to come by.
---
The only other advice I have for story legendaries to turn in later is to rename them. I name all of mine "1" so they are easy to find.
---
That would be.... AWESOME!
---
It is not even a bug...
---
Yeah, no. It actually counts for both. And that sucks. They should definitely fix this.
---
The boy saved your life and you can't even spell his name correctly, oooft! ;)
---
Alright, so to follow your logic I made a commando class with a B fixer and handmade. I was right this shits so easy to get ammo for. He's lvl 75 right now and I have a 160 heavy weps and a 160 bows. Arrows are still the hardest to get. Pm me for screenshots lamo
---
Grahm*
---
Why distant thunder?
---
Except when you are out of AP
---
It hurt itself in confusion.
---
Chance of dropping t60 plans. And it's normally a pretty dense population of scorched that you can knock out quickly for some decent xp
---
Only if they had their own storage budget.
---
Hm. I'll have to check that out.
---
It‚Äôs funny because I didn‚Äôt think much of it when I got it last run but I think it‚Äôs great now
---
No. All rise is a unique super sledge. There are bloody super sledges, but they cannot have that heavy mod on them.
---
My free punch bowl is full with shine
---
Remember when you were young...
---
Mushroom clouds against the sun...
---
Ah alright. Ty good sir.
---
I always do Manhunt when it pops up. 120 caps for the few seconds it takes to run upstairs and pop poor Mad Dog Malone is definitely worth it.
---
The worst thing you can do is put foundations in a hill/rocks/ground. It requires the exact opposite order to remove and God forbid if you remove the wrong one it will be stuck forever. I highly recommend doing the daily building challenges on a captured workshop for this reason.
---
I love Nukashine, nuttin bad with a free trip around Appalachia.
---
Well there are two main story quests. 1 associated with curing the scorched plague and the second with establishing a new currency/economy
---
Leveling from 100 to 999 has not difference in requirement so it's not really that hard.
---
&gt; ‚ÄúYou might as well be complaining  that Disney World doesn't give you special treatment because you choose  to blind fold yourself.‚Äù  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;That‚Äôs an analogy... and it‚Äôs shitty.
---
Actually is a very adpt one. You are artificially handicapping yourself and then demanding situations conform to your desire. 
---
&gt; What‚Äôs really disturbing is you keep talking about how YOU play the game  and it doesn‚Äôt bother you....but guess what? this game is not about  you. It‚Äôs about other players too.  
---
And yet you and many others declare that your way is the only way to play the game and are upset that the game doesn't cater to your specific wants and desires and thus it is a bad game.
---
And when someone points out that it is a bonus because it removes the grind and gives people a clear end point to be able to put down the game and play something else.  You declare that it is a bad thing. Because in your mind the only reason to play the game is to see those cap/script/bullion numbers keep going up and up. 
---
&gt; Over 1700 people upvoted this post saying that they too don‚Äôt like Cap limits.  
---
There are around 226k people subscribed to this sub reddit. And at least 2 or 3 million copies of the game has been sold. 1.7k people is an insignificant amount of people in the grand scheme.  
---
On top of that popularity of an opinion doesn't make it true or good.  Racisim is a great example of this.  In fact history is full of plenty of concepts and ideas that were really popular at the time but looking back on it now seems a little regretful that we actually thought that.

*Argumentum ad populum* is a type of [informal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy),[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum#cite_note-Walton_1999-1)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum#cite_note-Hansen-13) specifically a [fallacy of relevance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_relevance),[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum#cite_note-Rescher-14)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum#cite_note-Hitchcock-15) and is similar to an [argument from authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority) (*argumentum ad verecundiam*).[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum#cite_note-Hansen-13)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum#cite_note-Epstein-3)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum#cite_note-Engel-8) It uses an appeal to the beliefs, tastes, or values of a group of people,[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum#cite_note-Van_Vleet-11) stating that because a certain opinion or attitude is held by a majority, it is therefore correct.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum#cite_note-Van_Vleet-11)[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum#cite_note-16) 
---
The fallacy is similar in structure to certain other fallacies that involve a confusion between the *justification* of a belief and its *widespread acceptance* by a given group of people. When an argument uses the appeal to the beliefs of a group of experts, it takes on the form of an [appeal to authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority);  if the appeal is to the beliefs of a group of respected elders or the  members of one's community over a long time, then it takes on the form  of an [appeal to tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition). It is also the basis of a number of social phenomena, including [communal reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_reinforcement) and the [bandwagon effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect). The Chinese [proverb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proverb) "[three men make a tiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_men_make_a_tiger)" concerns the same idea.\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\] 
---
One who commits this fallacy may assume that individuals commonly  analyze and edit their beliefs and behaviors based on majority opinion.  This is often not the case. (See [conformity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity_(psychology)).)\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\]
---
I got banned for 7 days for some reason so this game will have to wait I guess
---
Rite
---
This. Why limit what you can earn? If you want to limit something, limit how much you can spend.
---
Why did you buy technical data in the first place???
---
This is the first time I'm hearing that they're replacing ATLAS Observatory and that's awesome because that place dumps ass!
---
Rule 10. Head over to the market sub
---
I‚Äôd be ok with that
---
Like with the treasury notes. They don‚Äôt limit how many you can earn, but the cash in limit it still there.
---
&gt;  Get in, get it done, and get out.
---
I don't understand why people do this more than 2 days in a row. Whenver I reach a cycle like that in the game I uninstall. As I did months ago after the wastelander update came out and I tried it out for a month.
---
They have openly  and with support from the community converted this game into a Chinese free 2 play game where  every mechanic, quest, reward is based around keeping you grinding and logging in in cycles to shove more atom shop content in your face.
---
They have locked any and all kinds of interesting base building features behind paywalls without providing functionally similar items for free but with shittier cosmetic. This goes directly against their claims of not selling in game content for money / only selling skins.
---
"Free future updates" is not a feature its their justification for not focusing on updates at all / only focusing on more mobile free 2 play features.
---
Maybe it was stuff someone dumped? It always triggers in my experience and only for 1 at a time.
---
I hope Grahm gets a spot Julie's Appalachia Radio, especially during Meat Week.
---
Lol this is great. I keep NukaShine in my punch bowl infront of my Mothman Shrine
---
Same can be true if you build into a cliff and get full foundation floating in the air. Or if you stack metal stairwells. The list goes on. While these are not bugs, per se, they are annoyances that need to be removed. 
---
A lot if not all of this could be solved with stackable/clipable foundations, non foundation floor tiles that can clip to foundations, and no need to have stairs to a second floor.
---
They can't. Pacifist blocks all damage to other players wanted or not.
---
I'm surprised the game even lets you sell Technical Data considering they're completely useless to anyone but the person who picks them up.
---
I think not... I'm not unsure how to get it now to be honest.
---
There's a roaming vendor bot?
---
Isn‚Äôt this already the case?
---
It is the exact same with this subreddit
---
Bethesda promised an MMORPG experience developed together with the community.
---
This sub defends every single one of Bethesdas decision to turn this into a mobile free 2 play game with "virtual chores mechanics"
---
Is there not one? I feel like I got one from phoenix. But am not 100% haha. Next time I'm on I'll have to craft a chest piece and check
---
My thoughts exactly...
---
Don't\* don't\* we'll\* üôÑ
---
Did someone else have access to your account? There was a ban wave recently for those who participated in duplicating items
---
I got burned for suggesting the same thing, people are obsessed with that think, they lose XP and it makes the event unbearable.
---
What I do for xbox is take a Screencast and the Xbox app tells me when its uploaded, i then share the pic from the app to reddit, idk if ps4 has something similar
---
As much as I would love more display items, The camp budget would have to be increased. I don‚Äôt have to space or the weight to spare for my PA or outfits.
---
They‚Äôre should add a lot of weapons from NV to 76, the bar, beartrap fist, service rifle. And not as skins
---
Okay just checked my old trade posts and you can 100% get the plan from either of the bots in wagona
---
This is why I make it. So people like you can drink it out of a shady machine at some shady camp.
---
I think it was never fully gone, it's just extremely rare now.
---
shouldn't\* üòí
---
I don't know for sure, tbh, haven't died that way in a while. If that's the case then we're done here.
---
Responders can
---
What platform?
---
If on PC make sure in Nvidia Settings you have set&gt; Fallout76 exe to Vertical Sync &gt; FAST
---
Ok thanks guys üëç
---
 "7k or more in caps straight to Bethesda... "  don't worry, they send them to hungry African children
---
I‚Äôve almost run out of plans to buy except for the odd power armor ones. So when I get near cap it‚Äôs a frenzy to find something rare to spend it on
---
Bizarre. Getting downvoted or not I have 100% killed wanted players while I have pacifist enabled. I've never played without pacifist.
---
Yes, not as skins!
---
On pc that is
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 so like my PS4 account got banned. My friend game shares off me but I got an email and it said I got banned for messaging someone something rude or vulgar. But my 3 day ban just expired and I logged on didn‚Äôt message anyone or anything and got banned for another 7
---
Yikes dude
---
Another fallout 3 fanboy? Yes. Does 3 dog fit in Appalachia? No. Why? He wasn't even alive. Does 3 dog and literally any other DJ talk to much sometimes? Yes. I think my work is done here. Does 76s DJ fit? Overall yes whether people like it or notü§£. People seem to forget that fallout 76 takes place only 25/26(wastelanders) after a massive war almost wiped humanity out and the dj came back to help give people hope and she can actually relate to alot of people because she goes through the exact same thing everyone else did. I think she fits perfectly. But tbh. If you don't like the radio, don't listen to itü§£. Plain and simple
---
Yeah seems like this will be the best way, get my mate to wear it, seems to look massive on the woman's arms! I'm afraid progress will be long! Biggest thing I'll have tackled and never used the sheet foam before! Thanks for the tips
---
If you got everything you wanted ,then you would stop playing ....hence caps
---
We already have that. When I get respawned in the nuke zone I have plenty of time to pull up the favorite wheel and slap on the Stealth Suit.
---
The liberty prime headlamp doesn‚Äôt work on T-65
---
Literally easy to test as I just have with a friend. Out of team. Friend wanted. Pacifist on for me and as expected. Cannot damage. Sorry matey you might not have had pacifist enabled when you attacked the wanted player.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure why they changed everything to be so restrictive. Even vanilla Fo4 allowed free placement of walls, floors snapped to the top of walls, non-foundation floors placed directly onto the ground, free placement of stairs with wiggle room for sinking them into the ground. All that is gone now.   
---
Is it because of the blueprint system? Whatever, it's bloody annoying.
---
Its fvcking stupid.  Its a junk sink.  Collecting a given amount of resources is a challenge they used to have and makes for a much more compelling challenege than building and deleting a few walls.
---
Leader of the pack is good for farming low-level Christmas gifts.
---
I rarely use it... I hate to give away ma 500 carry weight xD There are not a lot of benefits of using PA sadly.
---
I'm happy to be proven wrong if that's the case, but I am absolutely certain I have never had pacifist turned off. Ever. First time I killed a wanted player was at fasnacht, they became wanted in front of me and I took the opportunity because I wanted the trophy for it. Bizarre.
---
Watoga mall trading bot was kicking ass since release, he is strong too
---
Can you put the .38 barrel on that? I like to give .38 hunting rifles because .308 is hard to find early in the game.
---
Hey I have a pipe pistol on sale at the moment only 3k caps lol
---
Okay at Fasnacht? So when did you last test this. The most recent Fasnacht or the previous year. If it was the most recent Fasnacht. 
---
How did a player just become wanted in front of you during the event?
---
I cant seem to switch what he's looking for? I could with the original collectron switch between junk/scrap. No longer tho. Bug? Anyone knows how to fix this?
---
Yea I dont get it either I'm almost to 1000 hrs I'm lev 260+ and this happens all the time then they get mad when I kill them ( dont even take there junk).  Then even worse they seek revenge and I kill them again, and they get on the mic and call me a griefer.... no bro you came at me you should've know better.
---
If you can put it on a hunting rifle you can put it in the recon rifle
---
I dont know that, i never picked more than one, or bought it from a vendor. Everything I picked up i found it on the wild and sometimes it did trigger the event and sometimes it didn't. So I dont know either way I'm not worry about it, I got everything I want it from that event.
---
I woke up in the ash heap next to the rusty pick, it was weird
---
Todd: well I think we can make it work.
---
Also Todd: hey get a hold of the guys I need you to implement 25% of camp budget for each of these mannequin and PA displays.
---
Do you refer to the mod or plan? I already searched Watoga. Both at the station and Phoenix. It does not appear! Is the probability not low?
---
It doesn‚Äôt actually charge caps despite saying it does. Tested this myself yesterday.
---
The sales never affected modules so far, I wonder if they will change that now?
---
The plan. It is very rare for it to be in their inventories. But it can be there
---
Most recent. It was while everyone was waiting for the robots to get in line and they were griefing people shooting them, guess they killed someone?
---

---
You are good.
---
I'm hoping they have been building up to this, due to camp budget restrictions. It's a gradual release first we get the all in one structures, that take up very little camp space, soon we'll be getting instanced interiors which extends the build limit by my understanding of allowing enclosed camp structures to have separate budgets. this gives Bethesda the opportunity to release more decoration elements as we can put them in the instanced interiors.
---
What are these things about the BOS and resources? Did I miss an update or is this a feature and haven't found out about it yet.
---
I really hope this is sarcasm...
---
In order to protect your flux just switch to passive mode, I do that in general on public events.
---
I'm set up similarly and I definitely feel like it messes with enemy AI, scorchbeast in particular. I've had issues doing events like It's a Trap. Never thought I'd be spending time in stealth armor trying to be seen
---
Exactly. I always feel like they think they‚Äôre invincible and say ‚Äú oh look at me and my powerful gun.‚Äù Then they get dropped and get mad. How dare my oh mighty gun not take down this weak link. So annoying. If I wanted pvp I would go play fortnite, call of duty, destiny 2 and so on and so on. But nope I‚Äôm here for the fun of fallout
---
Look up the Atlas Observatory Community event
---
Also the hellfire from NW
---
Right.. encouraging players to build up their camps is just not a good idea right? Give me a break dude you're complaining about nothing. It's meant to be a quick and easy S.C.O.R.E. challenge
---
Got my first 4 UNY SS pieces in about 10 total rolls. 3 of them damn near God tier. Last piece took probably 150 rolls. Maddening.
---
Then this is all bs. You cannot just kill someone outside of pvp. Even using the bypass tricks with syringers and nuke mines didn't make you wanted as that was the whole point the game didn't recognise you as the aggressor. Only way to go Wanted is to pick a lock. Hack a terminal. Or destroy an item in a workshop while a member of your team claims it.
---
Thanks. I'll try then. Hundreds of server hops await me ü§£! It is the only plan of the regular armor mods that I don't have.
---
cool, couldn't remember, thanks
---
I really don‚Äôt like you üòé
---
thats a nice action shot :D
---
Again, you sidestep what i actually say in favor of the narrative you prefer. We can both afford 13 a month. The issue is not can I afford it. The issue is will I accept being handed a plate of shit by Bethesda. I will not. You, on the other hand, ask for a bigger spoon. I pity you. 
---
Oh and btw, wise decision deleting all the posts you made earlier where you made yourself look like an idiot.
---
The thought of hungry african children eating bottle caps is not that reassuring.
---
Yes, PA displays are way overdue.
---
Nah man not if done right. The game is about killing, and surviving! We need more guns. Classic fallouts (fallout 2, fallout tactics), and New Vegas had a boat load of guns, definitely more than we have now. A B.A.R, M1 garand, FN FAL would all be sweet additions and they‚Äôve been in previous fallout games. As long as bethesda keeps the rpg character building elements in the game I think we‚Äôll be a good distance away from COD. The second all our skills/perks are just gun related, maybe we can worry.
---
Lol

*flashbacks of Skyrim living Mannequines* :v
---
How does Mad Dog keep escaping so often?   The warden does a terrible job.
---
I have only been rolling for a chest piece (so far!) and in 40 rolls have got these:
---
1* unyielding 
---
2* unyielding AP
---
3* unyielding agility fall damage 
---
I feel pretty happy with those, considering.. and also got a chameleon PR sneak one which I will be keeping.
---
If people will report you. I try to mute, because I am live streaming most of the times. It suck to get content id strike of even get banned from stream service or even worse. (Not likely, but still)   
---
But I can also disable voice chat completely, but then I might miss something nice, like getting 2 new online friends, because I have enabled voice chat.
---
Read your own post- 99% of people build then scrap.  No one is using the prompt to add 10 new structures to their camps.  Its mundane, lazy and not a challenge.  The only challenge is in deciding what parts of your existing camp you should destroy if you're already at or near max camp size.
---
Typically, you wouldn‚Äôt at least not if looking to actually use it. But, not everyone can build heavy, also, a god roll Sturdy piece will frequently be worn while waiting for a heavy piece.

Earned the new photo pose at a hilarious profitable line in the sand event this week. 450 40mm grenades and TONS of scrap.

the people stood on the wall, aiming at the generator like a firing squad! every BLOB of scorched lasted only 2 or 3 seconds. took me 10 minutes or so to "clean up"...

Depending on where it spawns, The Messenger

I've only been able to change settings on them when they're built at my CAMP.   
---
In captured workshops the terminal never shows any options, so they're always stuck on default settings.
---
Lol honestly I'm laughing to myself that it comes across as bs and that I'm lying - I know exactly what happened. Maybe I've unknowingly exploited some weird glitch that makes people wanted and lets me kill them, who the fuck knows but I'd put my life that I've never had pacifist turned off and I've killed numerous wanted players.

Hey man, if you want a full set of heavy combat, msg me in 10 hours. I'll hook you up.

I have been fast travelling alot lately. "Seasons" meh. I miss Chally the moo moo. I need to walk more often. I miss wandering throughout the wasteland.

It is working as intended - no joke.

You can only hand in one at a time.

Only Data retrieved as loot from boxes/cabinets/etc **that the game spawns there** activates the quest.

Dropping/retrieving or trading does not activate the quest.

It's done this way to stop people delivering a load all at once and obtaining rare items with ease.

My first two rolls of the arms and chest I rolled 3 star unyielding. I said oh shit I‚Äôm going to get lucky and this is going to be easy. Well with both legs it took almost 80 rolls I feel like. I know I used at least 10000 scrip. Then I finally got them. But none have weapon weight reduction. But I‚Äôm not rolling anymore legs I don‚Äôt care it takes to much time and you just get crap after crap. So I feel your pain even tho I‚Äôve gotten a full set. It still took me a long time. From this experience I don‚Äôt even buy legendary modules anymore because I‚Äôm not rolling anymore.

I got that plan last night as a drop from a scorch beast. It was in the big right after a queen fight.

I‚Äôve scrapped way too many of these by accident

I found it recently on the responder bot at Camden Park.

Thank you so much for your help
---
Ok thank you for your help I appreciate
---
I like to do the enclave events.    Those are usually pretty easy if you have at least one other player helping.   
---
I don‚Äôt do ‚ÄúThe Messenger‚Äù event in the The Bog or the Mire unless I have a lot of extra ammo.    Some times it spawns a ton of high level enemies.  Plus it‚Äôs a slow event.  
---
Queen of the Hunt I will do if nearby.    Good chance to see the Flatwoods Monster.
---
Sometimes I do Pop a Squatter without going anywhere near it!  
---
I‚Äôll help kill the queen if I‚Äôm stocked up on supplies.    That one is fun with all the creatures running around.
---
i guess that hurts...

Gun runners DLC please, no skins, all new weapons. That's what the game needs.

Very detailed and clear, thank you so much!
---
there was a skeleton in a recent datamine we can display a hat on, like the anatomical model ones in classrooms and dr offices
---
You have serious issues.
---
Just wait and finish all of the Qwest's and all you have left to do is grind
---
Why not? We have ghillie everything else. Might as well go all the way.
---
Odd Job ;)
---
Indeed you do. I can not fathom somone who only plays a game to see numbers go up and not simply because they enjoy the game.
---
how much were you carrying? past a certain point you cant use/drop/trade anything, and can only delete it, so maybe you were over the limit and since stuff cant be dropped they just deleted it all?
---
There is loads to do. Besides the two main quests (pre and post wastelanders), there are A LOT of other quests.
---
When you have done all the quests (will take a lot of time), there are still daily quests (you rarely get them done all) and random events that popup. These can give rare drops.
---
Then there are loads of grinds that basically all boil down to getting the best gear for your build and rare drops. (bullion, legendary scrip, caps, reputation, pleasant valley tokens, mr fuzzy tokens, plans, maybe some I forget)  
---
There are also some collections you can try to complete and display at your camp. (bobbleheads, magazines)
---
There is camp building which is nice. I can easily spend hours adjusting my camp.
---
There are roleplaying communities.
---
There is PvP. Once you think you have good gear, you can test it against other players (workshops are PvP areas).  
---
=&gt; basically you play how you want. There are level 200+ who haven't done the main quest, there are high level players totally disregarding the bullion grind, there are low level players that live in amazing mansions, ...
---
I feel 100 percent the same is I wanted to play cod I would've bought it but I didn't I bought fallout. I honestly think there just no good at pvp (where there a level playing field) so they come into adventure with there duped legacys and meta biuld to only start fight they think they can win. Jokes on them I grinded and traded my ass of to get all my gear legit and I still smoke them. (Stealth bloodied cammando with B2525 fixer)
---
I've tried this game so many times, but still fell it isn't for me. I love the Fallout setting, but the multiplayer mechanics simply kills the immersion that made me fall in love with Fo3, 4 and NV.  
---
Honestly I'm jealous of you. Wish I could get into it to live in the Fallout world again.
---
30fps?
---
Dafuq how are console versions even playable, must look like a slideshow. No way I would ever play a shooter below 50fps at all.
---
Yes, you can play both sides up until you have the choice to do either Siding with Crater or Siding with Foundation
---
Join our discord for further commands,  https://discord.gg/fUQe8E

Yeah, there's an explicit point of no return. The game tells you once you're about to cut off the other side's questline.

Oh man how true!! ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ

Excellent work!
---
I wasn't even going to bother looking at 76 after the wave of hate it got at launch. Just chalked it up to a wasted opportunity and wrote it off. 
---
Last year my friend gave me a copy for my Bday because he was hooked on it. I really didn't want to bother, having heard so many horror stories, but felt guilty enough to give it a shot. 
---
I played as much as I could daily for the next 6 months. 
---
As luck would have it, I burned out right as my main hit level 76! So I just decided to leave him there. 
---
Yes this game has many flaws, but imo they merely add to the atmosphere, the entire experience of 76 is *better* because we share the pain, we have a community full of in jokes because of the bugs that would be lacking if it was a perfectly polished product. 
---
I took 7 months off but hearing about Wastelanders pulled me back in. I'm now hitting level 40 on my alt and loving every minute!
---
Outside of the quest it no longer spawns from my knowledge. I could be wrong and it could be super rare but I've spent weeks farming for one and haven't found one.
---
Just because that's what I do doesn't mean ither people do that. In fact I only do that when I am being lazy. 3/5 of my characters don't even have their camps fully built because i tend to move them often, and when i am on them it does encourage me to use the building aspect of the game. Its funny how you think 99% of players have their camps fully built and have zero interest in progressing their camp. If you want more demanding challenges just do the legacy challenges for atoms. Again this challenge isn't meant to be grindy like others. I honestly don't know what you're complaining about. Im done arguing with you dude. If you don't like it dont get the 250 S.C.O.R.E.   I dont care either way. Take it easy
---
And tradable! Lol
---
I got formula P solo just by maxing out the deathclaw one and keeping it alive.
---
It‚Äôs even worse while going through your inventory or trading in vendors/people. I don‚Äôt wanna talk about how slow it is while fighting the SBQ
---
There should be damage caps because otherwise it wouldn't be fair at all. Maybe they should make an exception/raise the damage cap though for bolt action/lever action type weapons because right now they don't stand a chance at all.
---

---
Just came across that post while looking it up. Guess it's not just me.
---
Todd says: It just works
---
Dude try getting in to heavys. Using bear arms you can carry as many as you want. I've got more guns than I can fit on my fav wheel and I love and use them all
---
Pretty much what you said, it's not the damage but fire rate that kicks ass making explosive heavy guns useless. I hate it as a fatman should kill someone at 20 percent health but I cant see how they could make them good without making explosive rifles even more op as they have explosive damage too
---
I‚Äôve never seen in work on bulking.
---
Yeah I was also not thinking that removing the cap could be the solution, I'm just looking for peoples thoughts, a dynamic cap seems to make some sense
---
PC I'm betting.
---
I have more than 1k notes and have no idea how to spend it. I either log in to get gold bullion and play for a while or do not log in at all. My treasury notes never reduce because you can only spend 20 a day and you can easily get 20 notes from the game.
---
Nice. I just got lucky with the purveyor and got my first bloodied fixer it‚Äôs not a 2525 but it‚Äôs 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage. Also she gave me 2 other bloodied weapons all in the same night. Literally only could do 3 total rolls. I had 260 scrip rolled once I got bloodied lever action faster fire rate, roll two was fixer. I still could scrip for another 40. So I did and my last one after I walked back over was a bloodied Tesla. Freaking amazing. But I‚Äôm like you, I grinded non stop. I played during beta during launch. I would‚Äôve had all legacies too it when I beat main story back then I was using carry weight glitch being stash was shit and everything. Well when they patched that I just sold or dropped everything. They didn‚Äôt have trading so I could‚Äôve been cool and had all these legacies. But nope I don‚Äôt so when I came back around October I grinded, worked on all my perks and just prayed to the rng gods. Lol
---
Im always drinking out the machine to see the funky colours for a few minutes before I go cross-country. Too bad 90% of people just keep empty machines around their camps.
---
Thanks, I just bought 2000 steel off a vendor and wanted to see if I can make anymore from that
---
Well i'm talking about the one at my camp.. I did build a few at workshops but not for a while.. hope someone had the same experience and a possible fix..
---
the only way to get the stealth suit for free is to do the settler quests before making the final decision to raid 79 with either faction. you will now have to grind rep and spend bullion for it. it is not tradeable and the suit cannot be found elsewhere.
---
they could have the explosive damage of the legendary effect not be effected by perks or lower it in general but I'm not sure how that would play out, I'm just a bit bummed out because this means I will need to flee 100% of the time as I don't want to change up my build just for the rare PvP I encounter
---
I hope they will fix the exploit, tho; 
---
the event is not really funny these days...
---
That would be perfect or bring back the hardcore mode. Then let it happen.
---
Grahm has a simple philosophy; you trade or you die. Ever seen a turret trade?
---
DR / ER is relative....I solo Encryptid as easily with my old scout armor as I do with my SS armor....both are full troubleshooter sets. The biggest difference is durability.
---
I find that weight is a huge concern for most players, more so than resistance.
---
So why don't we get cork when drinking a bottle of wine?
---
You don‚Äôt find Graham.   He finds you!
---
I‚Äôve had him walk near my camp, and other times I‚Äôve just found him walking around on one of the roads.   
---
It would be cool if an indicator popped up when someone made a trade with him.
---
It's great when I have a weapon that can take advantage of it but sucks when on a sniper with a bolt action.
---
That paint looks awesome, but it‚Äôs bugged. It takes up a mod slot, not the paint slot.
---
I don‚Äôt mind either, but when me or level 30 that was hiding behind me aren‚Äôt fighting back please move along. I got Tesla I could go at it, I already put my flux into the scrap box. So I had nothing to lose except caps. But I wasn‚Äôt trying to pvp. I was trying to find the fucking legendary rat I killed before we killed the queen and some how that rat fell off the face of the earth
---
"Great content" 
---
Tell me which?
---
He thicc
---
Possibly a perk card could fix it that doubles pvp damage with snipers with low fire rate. Wouldnt be too op as would still take 2 or 3 shots for a full health but would take out bloodied builds which makes sense since they they only have a bit of health left
---
Pfhuahahaha.  Really the moron who wrote that wiki should be banned.
---
Anyway for any newb who still don't know, xp requrired DOES increase for each level.
---
You've made a really compelling argument for build/scrap of walls and floors.  The passion is palpable. I'm on your side, now, and hope bethesda does this challenege everyday so you get the direction you apparently need to build 10 walls or 20 campfires at a time.
---
The fairground ones, some if the quickest dailies to do for scrip
---
Isn‚Äôt there one in the Dyer Chemical Sewer?
---
Me too. Easy score
---
I these players got friends that plays Fallout 76, then I think that they bought these for use with friends. Also Cobbler is great XP boost and INT boost also has effect on how much XP you get.   
---
These helping you to get more S.C.O.R.E with repetable weekly XP.
---
I'd like him to be an ally for our camps.
---
He constantly gives me gigs, last time i checked him I just entered bar and nuke countdown started accompanied by siren and audio warning message.
---
And BIV shouts from floor below : "What was that sound?!"
---
Ah yes another Reddit post from over a year ago when the game was running under a different patch and things worked vastly different. Solid evidence right there haha sorry matey you claimed someone went Wanted in front of you during an event recently for killing another player which isn't possible. (Player damage is turned off in events unless someone purposely leaves the event.) on top of that they then killed someone outside of pvp which at the time was only possible with an exploit and that exploit does not make someone wanted. The fact that some of your story is fabricated means any part of it is probably fabricated too. 
---
Or just simply you didn't have pacifist on during the time you killed the wanted player. Are you aware that in between patches pacifist status is reset to off sometimes and making a new character doesn't auto place them in pacifist.
---
Basically your grasping at straws about how many things it could be whether exploit, never before seen bug (a bug that if it did exist to exploit people into wanted status would defiantly have made this sub Reddit explode with complaint posts if it did exist) and how everything seemed to line up to fit your story. 
---
Not to forget it so easily testable. I'm good matey. 99% of your claim seems false and when you start digging up year old posts to try and defend your claims it really cements it.
---
Bloody brilliant read! 
---
Gonna start reading Volume 2 soon. Curious to ask do you create your own characters or look to other player Characters to fill in the needed roles?
---
You are so right about this. Cats and dogs belong to the family. And they see us as their pack and care for us. Also, i love your idea.
---
I have two bloodied Tesla‚Äôs but I‚Äôm not trying to spend time doing that I‚Äôm trying to get a god roll legendary to drop. Lol I got lucky from purveyor for a bloodied fixer 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50% more critical damage. Fallout is a game I play because I love the story I love the experience. I love killing a 3 star legendary and hoping it‚Äôs finally going to drop a god weapon and then you walk over and it‚Äôs a nocturnal combat knife. But there‚Äôs that chance it‚Äôs a bloodied explosive 2525 handmade. It‚Äôs just fun. I play fortnite and cod. So I can get my pvp from those games. If they would make a pvp server I would be down. I mean nw is kind of that, but they fall short. But when I‚Äôm in adventure I‚Äôm more so going to come help out then have to engage in pvp.
---
Can confirm they are dope, especially explosive flamer
---
Lol why are you getting so wound up about it? Are you ok?
---
Damn, this is really innovative and absolutely no one has recommended adding mannequins or power armor displays before
---
Well, what can i say except "you're welcome"? But yeah. Sry if i ruined anyones day.
---
I don't really like the idea of having to use a perk card in order to increase the cap of you damage which technically is much higher, for example, I have a black powder rifle which can one hit any non boss enemy in the game. So needing a perk to allow more damage when it really shouldn't be needed seems weird to me.
---
But I won't deny it could work to an extent, though just having that cap changed for certain weapons without a perk might work.
---
So say the max dmg per hit for automatics is lowered according to fire rate just as it is increased for slow fire rate weapons with a kind of max cap at maybe 200 or so to prevent those one shots from the early days, a min cap could be added too so the high fire rate ones aren't effected too hard.
---
Ever since I dropped the last set of technical data off I can never find any anywhere anymore. I use to find it every where now I can even get it to pop up. I posted about it a couple weeks ago. But I can‚Äôt ever get that daily to show up anymore and after I did it that one time because I use to just sell it. But right after I had 15 but I couldn‚Äôt drop I. Drop boys so I sold it thinking maybe that will fix it and still nothing
---
I do get a tad frustrated after traveling to a dozen vendors or so with 100/200+ plans listed, and they are all mounted plans. I‚Äôm by no means saying it‚Äôs not fair, but there is only so much I can do with all those heads in my camp lmao
---
Created all my own. In volume 2, I use several Wastelander characters.
---
It doesn‚Äôt exist because of hackers, though, it exists to keep players online. And that‚Äôs always been the point of soulbound items. To make them hard to acquire, and impossible to get for those who didn‚Äôt grind them out.
---
My bf was helping me lighten my load so I could fast travel, and tried to get me to drop the couple bottles I had. "No! I like not knowing where I'm going to end up!" Lol
---
Just informing other players that come across this post that what you are saying is incorrect and if they want to take down Wanted players they need to leave pacifist mode. 
---
I didn't make the claim about not caring about being proven wrong but then start searching for evidence and posting a year old Reddit post from a different patch to try and backup my false story. Haha
---
Are you okay? Struggle with being called out for bs?
---
I'm going to leave it here before you come up with another "one of a time" bug or exploit to help defend your claim.
---
I love when people put it in their punch bowls.

Ghillie eyebrows,ghillie holotapes,ghillie stimpaks.....I.Cannot.Be.Seen.

i wonder if its something that might come with instanced camp interiors later down the road.
---
Yeah i also saw some of our beloved pictures of her with a RIP above it, and it made me google it. Cause i at first thought its about an ingame cat or a quest.
---
Would not work, cod is a designated pvp shooter where fallout was always a roleplay game. Now with a semi well working battleroyal we have a pvp mode which is lmost worthy getting called as such, but looking into it its literally half or more afk bushcamper trying to get a daylie challenge done.
---
Having 52 solo players would end in at least 45 afk campers and a handful of cheaters since you can't perspect them as good or get noticed since only one player is suspicious instead of a 4man squad to identifie if its indeed a cheater or just a (un)lucky circumstance.
---
Also I would rather see a fixed nw mode instead of a new one. these aimbugs, rubberband lags, onehit handmades, cant move when deployed, ghost enemy which prevents to win or any other game breaking bug and flaw need to be fixed before adding more modes or content. I really cant understand anyone who want new modes when the available one is just not playable without having flaws each second round.
---
Is it pretty accurate getting bored of using the gatling gun
---
I salute to you, sir.
---
Alrighty then! Loving your work and make sure to give a hollar if you decide to add some new player characters!
---
When you roll god tier nocturnal instead of unyielding or  vanguard....
---
Yeah shit sucks. Im a lvl 323 with nothing to do after maxing out on scrip.
---
So that's why she always lands on me. I'm the biggest guy on the server üòé i had no clue that was the reason for her to land near me all the time.
---
Wow even though I've been following Bethesda for years I never knew about this
---
Thats a beautiful idea. I gotta get my hands on these candle light plans for my shrine as well &lt;3
---
I said I would be happy to be proven wrong, I never said I didn't care about being proven wrong. You're literally coming at me like I've been arguing with you and I haven't whatsoever. I also looked it up for my own peace of mind to learn more about pacifist mode, not to try and debunk you at all. Theres ways of going about informing other players without coming across as a fucking dick. Let's just leave it here then, I think you need to go get a hug from mummy.
---
I'd be happy with that. I would love to put the work in for a certain weapon. After I'm done woth the dailies there really isn't a lot that keeps me interested so having maybe goals or longer daily quests or even a weekly quest would fill the gap
---
Spell chucker got me, methinks.
---
Grahm
---
Got it
---
When I see those vendors I dump as many ultracite plans as I can in front of their vending machine. Nothing more satisfying than seeing countless pounds of crap turn up in their machine.
---
That would be pretty decent. Unless we can choose the effects I'd probably keep my 3 stars as-is
---
Last time I drank nukeshine I ended up right next to where I drank it. Talk about disappointing.
---
I think weekly caps would work so much better than daily.
---
Yeah, i didn't rly think about i gonna ruin everyones day. But i also think it is so great she got immortalized in the series. She will live on in the hearts of the Fallout community forever.
---
Okay thanks wasn't sure that's all as I didn't want to miss out on any rewards given out before choosing a side.
---
:( I have all the cat paintings in my blueprinted house section of my camp. Guess I‚Äôm never changing it....
---
 Okay thanks wasn't sure that's all as I didn't want to miss out on any rewards given out before choosing a side.
---
If you one shot it you can just stab the legendary, that's how i do it and no one's gonna complain. If you know that you can insta kill them then you should know to not fire on them. It's your own fault that he came after you.
---
Lovely shrine. The bush cat is the icing on the cake.
---
Reminds me of this time in copenhagen.  Waking up at the circus with a juggler and a clown
---
Suspect we'll see this with the instanced interiors.  The mannequins / PA displays will go in there to avoid server load.
---
Haha everything was going fine as a discussion until you decided to make up wild stories about how a player literally turned wanted in front of you during a public event for killing another player whilst under a patch that doesn't allow anything of what you claimed happen. 
---
You said you were fine to be proven wrong but when contested with known by the community truths about how pvp at events, pvp in general and how the wanted status is applied. You then made up that you must of come across a one of a kind bug or exploit to explain it. 
---
Simply you don't have pacifist on. Haha
---
I use the event to farm xp, nothing else so i'm usually on my own.
---
I'd love a unique mg42. That thing has been my favourite weapon for a long time. I feel like this should apply to preexisting unique weapons. Maybe we could have a PPSH-41 replacement for the perfect storm
---
You‚Äôre asking what I enjoy in fo76? Kind of a loaded question. I will just name a handful. 
---
Quests - mistress of mysteries is one of my favorite in the series. The Van lowe questline was also a lot of fun. The lore associated with the original main quest is well written. 
---
The map is also the best in the series by far IMO. 6 distinct regions make for a really enjoyable time exploring. 
---
I think some of the wastelanders quests, like actually fighting alongside the overseer were also fun. 
---
**now what do you like about fallout 76?**
---
Cork is lightweight and good temperature insulator, so I'm pretty sure they want to mass produce Prydwen ships so they can send troops to earth poles for some secret brotherhood business.
---
Thought you were leaving it there. Couldn't help yourself? Mummy gone out?
---
Hahahaha! I created a nice oasis under my CAMP (electrical tower build) complete with the punch bowl of Nukashine. Noticed one was finally missing yesterday. :)
---
So this works by dropping a load point at the front door, am I right? Seems like a bit of a hassle, to be honest.
---
My bad I didn't mean it the way. You have a shared pool of loot with your characters on destiny.
---
Those are called griefers, scum of a server. With these new pvp rules you can't even do anything when you see stuff like this happen. I used to get baited by such people when i wasn't even lvl10 and my camp was near poseidon for the fusion cores.
---
I believe it can have a small chance to appear at the vendor bots at camden and Harpers Ferry as well as the Watoga bot as others have said.  I
---
I feel your pain OP.   This is one of 11 plans I still need in the game and the vendors never have it for me!! I check the vendors at every server I go to.
---
This is what happens when everyone ignores the Jail Break event!
---
Playing Devil's Advocate for a moment: I keep seeing people who call the game easy, but I still get wrecked on the regs by L62 charred ghouls, and I'm L106. What am I doing wrong? Or is it only "easy" for people who come from games like Call of Duty &amp; etc.? My game background is primarily stuff like Legend of Zelda, Bioshock, Fallout 3/NV/4, WoW, and Skyrim. I love the game and the setting, but it gets a bit frustrating to hear everyone complain about how the game needs to be harder and I'm over here begging "please no, it's hard enough already!"
---
I am level 228 and I have never seen him.

Oh yeah, i member. Also thank you very much for the award. I never ever got something like this. Pretty cool.

AngryTurtle did a video about it as well, iirc, he had all the link info included.

Naw not a fan boy only DJ i have liked I Fallout so far, minimalist talk, decent voice work etc. I understand why they went the way they did with the current dj, but not fond of the talking to music ratio. I really enjoy the music, but having to listen to the same story 2 times per play session is pretty lame. Would love to have a music only option that isn't the classical station. I love the radio/ music of Fallout,  but haven't tuned in since a week after wastelanders.
---
Same brother.
---
But i glad i waited, so much stuf fixed and polished. 
---
Yet i cant deny, it has its flaws and problems(and alot more bugs) (and i wish atom Shop not a thing or much cheaper).
---
But overall i enjoying it.

---
Woah, that takes me way back. Yeah, there were some lines about the ingame paintings in the convo with that artists brain, right?
---
True, for that event it's best to use a grenade launcher if they do indeed spawn in the center. If you're on Xbox i can check if i can craft one
---
Superiority complex with you is wild. Oh it‚Äôs a plate of shit when you‚Äôre complaining about it in the first place? You‚Äôre the one who wants free private servers and free unlimited stash... so now it‚Äôs shit? Oh man... the hypocrisy.
---
There is a [keyword](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/0043C439) that blocks Super Duper from working on many items, including bulk scrap. So, despite the name, the perk does not actually make it possible to dupe materials.
---
I think if it had released in its current state it would have been totally different.  I found the launch version fun because I played with my wife but even then we tapered off before finishing.  It felt like every soulless MMO with NPCs who did nothing but assign quests.  Now with the people running around, new factions, and new content, it's far more engaging and it's all I've been playing the past few weeks.
---
It would be cool if players can host parties at their camps like events. We can do tasks similar to Meat Week and play games like beer pong and Nukashine Roulette.
---
West Coast Enclave in Control Station ENCLAVE has not contact whatsoever with the East Coast before John Henry Eden springs up sometime after the war with the NCR.
---
I pick them up from the desks in the Military Wing, The Whitespring Bunker. You can only hand in one at a time.
---
X-01 is not APA, and APA has not been designed yet.
---
Each weapon should have a different damage cap (based off of fire rate and damage done)
---
Gta is a 100% pvp game, it does literally everything it can to make people kill each other for no reason at all. Take nightclub missions for example or vehicle cargo, everyone in the lobby gets told to destroy it to get"rewards" the reward is worth shit and the guy you took it from is agro as fuck now because sometimes when selling things it's a grind.
---
So what happens next is the guy who was selling coming after you for some revenge and you'll have a server war for something stupid. That's GTA.
---
Yes I know. But when I went back to hand it in a few days later I couldn‚Äôt and it wouldn‚Äôt bring the quest up like it use to. Before I use to find it everywhere all over whitesprings but for weeks I have not found a single one. Use to sell it to bots all the time
---
You're going to love the Halloween event if they do the same one this year.
---
Yeah that seems like the best solution to me as well
---
The PA displays are already in this game too! You can see one of them in the office area where you conduct the excavator PA quest.
---
more like an entirely separate environment off server, similar to how houses work it other mmos.
---
its probably the only way that we will any more storage or more budget for camp items.
---
Its not a follaut anymore. Just not. So much lore gone to shitter. So much immersion breaking stuff.
---
NW is best immersion after 1,2
---
And i liked 4 for lore(and power armor) 
---
But 76 is not in this fallout unervse, its even barely fallout anymore. I like it, but truth is truth.
---
It's 18+ due to the blood and gore. Back in 3 you could shoot off an arm which is no longer possible but in 76 you still see corpses turning in piles of blood with bloody mess. That's pretty much the reason, take away all the blood and i think it will no longer be 18+
---
The pvp damage cap was an attempt to improve a broken system, it seems it was an improvement.  Won't increasing or removing the damage cap make things worse, you'll just kill  / die faster.
---
You can get a bounty by hacking someones "US Government Requisition" mission cargo box. You dont have to do it via pvp.
---
Next to the high wire for me.
---
White springs. From on top of the fountain you can hit the cars by the shop, the ones by the main doors, and the set in front of you.
---
I learned a long time ago to not play bethseda games at release - wait 3-6 months, for bug fixes, more content, and ideally 1 or 2 DLCs.  With fallout 76 - that wait turned into more than year and a half.
---
Now, I can understand - playing the game for 2 years - it seems meh - I have to say - jumping in after 2 years?  It's been a ton of fun.  If you subtract afk / title screen from my playtime, I probably booked in about 160 hours over 5 weeks.  I'm having a ton of fun - and while I know the fun will star to wear off... that was relatively cheap 160 hours of entertainment.
---
That said - there are qualify of life issues.  I could *not* be playing without fallout first (I'm a collector / hoarder - need the scrap box).  Same with a 2nd account for muling.
---
Yep... sadly it is just a MMO with a Fallout skin...
---
I would much rather have an indicator of a dead legendary body which in my experience eventually turns into a meat pile when there are clipping issues. Last thing I want is a vendor reminding me about that 1* Nocturnal Super Sledge that I may have missed that I will never claim back from them.
---
I would definitely not want the cap removed but as it is now high hire rate weapons have an extreme advantage which just doesn't seem fair to me as they have the same per shot cap as other guns which fire much more slowly, as some people already suggested a more dynamic cap would probably be better
---
Nuclear Explosions everywhere
---
There's reasons for that. Question is what were you doing that they had to thumbs down you
---
And now as a stereotype of a typical child that cannot accept the truth of something as it would embarrass them to admit they were wrong you resort to childish insults to make it easier. 
---
Thankyou for showing the true colours and try your best before claiming something and informing the community that your not lying about it.
---
In the navy I went to several countries where "thumbs up" is their equivalent to our "middle finger" gesture.  They must think this is the rudest group of gamers
---
I have a bad feeling it won't happen this year since it wasn't on the road map. I really hope I'm wrong. I loved that event. Just weird to me they didn't mention it
---
I only started playing a few weeks back, so haven't been able to do the Fasnacht yet. But my current characters a mostly pacifist tea-making berry eater. Wearing Ghille wooded armour. I would have loved to get the Owl mask for her to wear. Would have suited her personality and outfit so well. Maybe next year!
---
Yea man getting the treasury note grind itself should be enough time gate to slow us down... not every single player will grind treasury note for them to even think it matters
---
Level 15, but I suggest checking:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Handy to plan your build in advance and can easily see what perks open up at what level, by clicking the little "i" icon on cards upper right corner shows more detailed information about the perk, even some hidden data etc...
---
Indeed. Someone commented recently that they need to stop this *wait for months....big dlc.....wait for months....big dlc* strategy as it‚Äôs plainly not working, and instead focus on a stream of steady, but smaller content. As welcome as Wastelanders was, it could still be blown through in just a few hours (tedious grinding aside), despite being delayed for months, then we‚Äôre back to all these half-assed placeholders until Fractured/Broken Steel. Who knows if either of those will hit their release dates? Definitely not me, at this point.
---
Yes. Below level 15, you eliminate the Power Armor plans and some weapon plans from the loot pool.
---
Amusing is also when a SB comes flying by as part of a wave and randomly poops out Scorched while in the air making them instantly drop to their death
---
You title is basically everyone who ever trashed it.
---
The game looks bad at a glance.
---
It is absolutely amazing when actually playing.
---
The valid complaints come post endgame when all you have left is limits to deal with.
---
If anyone complains about shit before then it is likely they played for less than 10 hrs. Everywhere between 10-1000 hrs is amazing.
---
Yeah she's definitely gone out then. Go do something else for fuck sake.
---
People just can't help but open the door lmao
---
You can get them at the Whitespring vendor inside. They're included in the "Antique Lights" plan from the furniture vendor. You'll get some nice wall lights and a lantern too.
---
OH, I'll have to try that for sure!
---
Here are all the armors and what the mods do to them:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4sA-lJt2lV5r4NjkGNgyVUGNwjRMLN-ishup58v\_Qs/htmlview#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4sA-lJt2lV5r4NjkGNgyVUGNwjRMLN-ishup58v_Qs/htmlview#)

Mistress of Mystery build?
---
I've had people clear out my entire stock of Nuka Cola so I've just been filling it with Nukashine.
---
Having both completely breaks npc stealth detection. You can be nose to nose with sbq and she will not be able to see you. Even as youre shooting her in the face.
---
That is super confusing.  Try this:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4sA-lJt2lV5r4NjkGNgyVUGNwjRMLN-ishup58v\_Qs/htmlview#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4sA-lJt2lV5r4NjkGNgyVUGNwjRMLN-ishup58v_Qs/htmlview#)
---
I've had people clear out my entire stock of Nuka Cola. So I've been filling my machine with Nukashine for about 2-3 weeks now.
---
I don‚Äôt think gold bullion item were BOP to prevent players from duping them. They are the endgame reward it was done this way so they wouldn‚Äôt lose value as endgame gear
---
None of that will work without the new gillie wallpaper and floor pack.
---
Maybe it will end up like Fasnacht and we'll be doing it several months later than the year prior   ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Depends on the event, but other that the SBQ or rad rumble, the math is simple.  Take uranium fever, 8% on a mole miner is roughly 11 extra xp per enemy.  If you kill 60 mole miners, that 660xp plus 8% of event is another 112xp.  Total of 772xp.  As opposed to 1400 xp at 100% is an additional 1400xp.  1400 is greater than 772.  That is assuming you get hits on all 60 mole miners, which is unlikely unless you are there by yourself.  But hey, if you like losing an additional 600+xp, by all means, don't switch!  And that's just uranium fever, which is a decent mid level tier event.  Low level events like defending a work shop, campfire tales and path to enightenment, give you less enemies.
---
They didn't go through accounts, and they honestly probably don't know exactly what was duped they probably just looked at and compared accounts to server activity logs. It's a lot easier to see "this character sold an item to a vendor then immediately joined a different server. And continued to do only that for 3 hours."
---
If you cant defend it, then it wasnt yours to begin with.
---
Would be really neat and a big selling point for those who are still on the fence.
---
I could see supermutants having reduced Int with greater Str, while ghouls might get a nice con buff and rad resist at a cost, maybe Int debuff that scales with the buffs to symbolize you going more ghoulish, though more would need to debuff to bring balance.
---
The parking lot at valley galleria. Is one of my favorites.
---
Has anyone datamined any info on the "provisions" we will be awarded during the event and what they may contain?
---
They just need to ATLEAST up the freakin caps already. 300 scrip, 400 bullion and 2800 caps and be happy (kinda).
---
Its weird because I am l21 with my new character and I don't see commando perk to take it
---
Is this a troll? You can travel to your own camp or free, and there isnt a single reason to not have a stash in your own camp.
---
They can bug out and become unusable. I did one over the weekend, definitely still drops.
---
You're welcome:)
---
The drop zone for the SBQ fight is the fissure site.  When you die it automatically drops you there.  Open map and FT out of nuke zone when this happens.  Look at the map...the Scorched Earth event originates at  Fissure Site Prime...why would you think it should drop you anyplace besides where the event originates?
---
The Problem with the game is that it was released in Pre-Alpha and now two years later it's actually a release Candidate.
---
Oh man, do I need an "I'm sorry" emote!
---
Bear in mind, most of ATs magic weapon vids were made using the Adrenalin perk, which is currently broken. So that is a 36% dmg buff gone.
---
He also stacks dmg buffs from food/meds for his sbq fights.
---
Hahahahaha that sounds similar to most of our experiences I think, disappearing corpses and griefers! You know about using the camera to find corpses? Sometimes it helps find that one extra piece of scrip...
---
Yeah, he talked about how he was super pissed how he made those cat paintings on a lark, but they got WAAAY more at the entomology than his other paintings.
---
Okay I get all the bitching and whining, I get kicked off the server at least 3-4 times in a 4 hour session of playing the game.  The grind sucks trying to get caps, bullion and script.  Its obvious Bethesda has gotten over their heads and they are just throwing shit out there to keep people occupied while playing the game but hey, it works.  Here we are complaining and still playing because overall the game is good.  No doubt Bethesda needs to sit down and work on their road map because opening up the vault for free every few months to refresh the vault dweller base won't always work.  In the end remember its a game made by humans which are not perfect.  If its that hard for you o grind put the controller down and go outside and see the sunshine.
---
Oh I know I had my camera out that‚Äôs when he kept shooting me but after about a hour I still never found it. It was nothing good it was a gamma gun. Don‚Äôt know the star but I could‚Äôve scripped it and I‚Äôm a hoarder
---
Have you saved the level ups? Cause you need to actually level up to 15 to it unlock...
---
We all have our opinions, and many people think their opinion matters more.  Its human nature, I suppose, to think your own perspective is the correct position.   A bad press and a busy life resulted in me avoiding Fallout 76 until about a month ago (when I got it on the Steam sale).  Personally I'm not into stories in RPG games, I play for the character building and exploration.  This game does a nice job with both of those, while not bashing me with monetary transactions.  I dont feel pressured at all to spend money.  The tight inventory system?  That's part of the game - a big part of it.  Fallout has always been about scavenging, and a limited carry weight (with a monetary solution in the form of 1st) is a perfect for me.  Ya the story sucks, but again I dont like the stories in any of the games.   Fallout 76 does many things better than the rest.  The world is stunning.  The monsters, the scavenging, the necessity to use chems.  This is the first fallout game where I find myself needing to use chems.  And not fearing radiation.  And crafting, too.  Fallout 76 is a fantastic addition to the franchise.
---
Again, no. And again, you are pushing your own narrative here. I never advocated for free private servers. Go on, keep making yourself look worse.
---
Got it out of my system in FO3 (blowing up cars just for yucks).  In FO4 I was into using them as weapons, seeing how many enemies I could kill by luring them into groups of cars and igniting them.  One of my favorite moments in that whole game was getting a crowd of supermutants to chase me up an elevated highway, dropping artillery smoke along it as I went, and then jumping off the broken end of the highway as everything on it turned to flames and concussion waves.  Elevated highway + exploding cars + no fall damage with power armor is a useful combo.
---
Yea I started at launch and took a break for a few months came back a didn't know what legacys were and sold 2 very cheap
---
I mean I didn't took any cards because I know my exact build and don't wanna waste perk points
---
Gotcha, that makes sense I suppose.
---
Yes, this is so much fun.
---
Or, and maybe this is me being unreasonable, dont go to public events with the expectation that you will get to tag everything with your single shot pea shooter in a realm of aoe heavy weapons and explosive legacy guns.
---
Damage caps are a bandaid at best for tyring to add balance to something that at its core requires a hell of alot of proper balancong to make work correctly. It can be done, but i get the feeling it never will : /
---
Yeah, like I said, you cant do that unfortunately...
---
I havent tried it myself, but IMHO Two Shot should help you if you want to stay a rifle man. It devides the damage into 2 bullets, so the damage output of your rifle isnt wasted if both bullets hit.
---
on xbox, but thanks
---
Well, they better lay off my ass.  Last year when the scrap boxes got cleared I lost all my junk.  I had 4 characters and they gave me 4 replacement scrap kits.  I have like 12k cork from that.
---
Swarm of suitors. Lots of mirelurk meat for increased ap
---
Balls, this means I need to take useless perk cards each level? Freaking amazing
---
Yes plz and ghilli skin for the fixer
---
Does each pellet in a shotgun blast count as an independent cap? I've wondered this for a while
---
I think you're right.  I noticed it today at one point outside of LiS
---
jerkiness... think other poster may be right about lag causing it
---
To be entirely honest I don't think it can really be done, as players will never have the same kind of HP as the creatures do, meaning either you can't kill PvE enemys at all or you kill players almost instantly, maybe an inherit damage resist could be implemented similar to that of the SBQ for PvP instead of an outright cap, so all weapons get the same chance while also compensating for the huge HP difference to PvE content ?
---
You gotta reach top 10 for best xp and staying alive will get you xp based on time as well. Kills too
---
Something other than more chintzy crap from the 40-50s plz.
---
That might actually work to compensate it a bit, that's something I hadn't thought of at all, thanks !
---
If you dont know, when you level up and choose the SPECIAL point, you can select the card under different SPECIAL.
---

---
Haha you and me both... Scrip for days over here, literally!
---
Anglers are absolute bullshit. The range on their flamespit attack is stupid op. Anf setting things on fire does a lot of dmg.
---
wow i cant believe i had to find this post to get the goddamn game working  
---
what a load of shit, bethesda and zenimax
---
I'm fast traveling to Drop Site V9 (had to check the map for the exact name), which is outside the nuke zone but close enough to shoot the queen. Because I'm bloodied, I don't enter the nuke zone at all during the fight, but stay near V9.
---
When the event starts, I fast travel to V9, BUT it sticks me at various different and random locations inside the nuke zone instead. Prime fissure is just one spot where it might drop me, but it varies.
---
If I die, I die at V9, and yet I might respawn at Forward Station Delta or in a ditch way south of V9. It's different behavior than I get with any other event in the game.
---
Thanks to event lagginess, there's a good chance I'll be dead of radiation before I can even get the map open to fast travel.
---
Kills don‚Äôt give enough. If you can find a good team to play with and communicate, do some research into a good build and win that‚Äôs your best bet. Some people bush camp or hide till the end which is annoying but it works if you can make it to the top 5. You get the most xp for minutes survived and winning.
---
Yes! Valley Galleria is fun. Sugar Grove is a good one too.
---
As a Beta Player  with +2k hours playtime I have to admit that some quests have their moments, but they are one time missions which are not representing the game as much since they are one time only.
---
The map has some pretty nice locations indeed, but that's only about 10% imo. The rest is generic, empty and some kind of boring once you visited them a few times. Sometimes you walk around several minutes in any biome without seeing anything of interest, also there are still some floating rocks and trees, clipping textures or godrays out of solid material. 
---
To the endgame, which should be the main experience for everyone since fo76 is made as mmo, we only have the sbq for almost 2 years now which is also bugging and broken. First she spamed her sonic-scream endlessly, then she was unlootable along every other creature around and some ppl had always crashes once she died. Now we cant cripple her anymore preventing her to spam her to dive for 20min straight.
---
Other than that we had survival servers which are gone again, where people spawned and got instantly killed. We had the vault raids with unique rewards, the raids were more a rush then something to really enjoy plus the rewards are not unique anymore. Oh, and a buggy battle royal infestated with hackers.
---
If you ask me, the game is sometimes good, but 90% is either a grind, cashgrab or buggy mess. Content is more then some fetchquests acting as mainstorry or a single broken encounter. Sure we can see only the good things and ignore the flaws, but that would just a lie to myself.
---
Yeeeeeees
---
Lol. Thats a good one. All he says to me is the old joke about vault which is hardly an insult because it might be true xD
---
[](/kcozyglowhoofbite)I would pay good money to play as Frank Horrigan. If that counts.
---
My phone does not approve of that spelling, apparently. :p
---
Fake internet stats arent helping your argument.
---
So after looking on kevduit map and watching 4 videos of other people running the mine I have come to the conclusion that the info I was given along with the game info was misleading and that I did get all the nodes...but the power Armour effect was not working. Mathematically I got 100 ore...now if the pa had worked correctly that would be 400ish which is what you all say you get...so I will need to go back in and make sure the pa is working correctly b4 i start clearing the mine. Thank you to everyone for the help.
---
Yea thats what i mean. If they get a couple smart people together and really rub some braincells together there might actually be a way to have some legit balanced pvp in adventure mode but you know...
---
It's oddly satisfying.. Nothing's better than a chain of explosions!
---
Piss off. Ad Victoriam!
---
Become a Bush Wookie! Ignore the hate. Skilled bushmasters often place top 3 and even get lucky with a few first place finishes
---
Ultracite Gatling laser is better. Putting a prime receiver on it makes it do even more against scorched and generally higher base damage against everything also. It does stack with zealots but I‚Äôd go for a two shot, anti armor, junkies, or bloodied with faster fire
---
It‚Äôs not a perfect solution but if you pull out your camera it‚Äôll tell you in the top corner what creature the camera is pointed at, even if they‚Äôre dead. 
---
So say you‚Äôve just done Heart of the Swamp and of course that 3 star ghoul you splatted is now a meat pile submerged underwater, you can scan around with the camera and it‚Äôll help you find it.
---
He told me I must love being a raider because its the only time I‚Äôve ever been wanted...
---
Why does every beta player feel the need to call that out? Clearly if you have 2K+ hours in the game you must consider the game to have quality content, otherwise you would have spent that time doing something else. There are 2080 hours in a typical 40 hour a week work year. You‚Äôve played his game basically as a part time job. 
---
For how terrible you paint the game, you sure do love to play it. 
---
Point is the game is what you make of it.
---
Dude seriously me too! Can i plwase just get a good friggin ledt arm what gives? Also i think the 15% damage reduction while sprinting/standing still just doesnt exist on ss...i think i got maybe one exterminators with it....smh
---
He‚Äôs right, I places second one time, didnt pick up a weapon, armor, nada. Went out dancin the mothman... my finest hour
---
A bad workman blames his tools.
---
That's pretty much the only reason I keep any. Free overencumbered fast travel.
---
i'm glad this person found a use for the vocal sacs. i just scrap them.
---
Depends on the roll I suppose. I run with an ultracite gat with FFR and it shreds scorched monstrosities. I would test both out but generally I feel the higher fire rate is better for tougher enemies and bosses. Executioners prefix on either one of those I think would be the best for sbq if you‚Äôre not running junkies or bloodied prefix.
---
Thank you. The only reason I drink from them is for a nuka trip.
---
Power armor displays are already in fo76. Theyre in the Garrahan place where you make the Excavator Power Armor
---
I fill mine 1:1 with nukashine and the other Biv recipes. 
---
You might get +50 carry capacity with rad ant lager.
---
You might black out and end up God knows where.
---
Not as bad as reddit would have you believe.
---
It just takes some skill my guy
---
Sick burn. Would make me cry. Insult rated 12 out 10.
---
Didn't realise you could reach the top of that rock near the lead extractor with that camp setup, but it's trial and error how low down on the cliff you need to go to reach the acid node so maybe I was too low down. I was unable to build anything higher than waist height at the level of the lead extractor.  
---
Related 'Bethesda plz' then... as we're placing our camps it should tell us what resources will be within range before we click the place button.
---
You can only have one at a time but you can swap out which skin/personality you want and what they collect
---
Get the scrapper perk and break down guns. Buying steel is kind of a waste of caps.
---
I would settle for magazines and bobbleheads not contributing to the building limit.
---
I have an 3 Lasers - Anti Armour, Executioner and Furious, but they all seem to do around the same damage even with the 3 heavy gunner perk cards maxed out. Furious seems to be the best as it'll get to 7 damage per hit to the head when SBQ lands but, is it just me that feels like it should be doing more? Anti Armour is a constant 4 - 6 depending on where I hit her and Executioners doesn't top past 6 at all, its a strange one how different prefixes all seem to do the same thing. Any tips?
---
i rather doubt as many poeple like it as you assume. Keep your music to yourself.
---
Not obsessed with it but I always enjoy the explosions in this game.   Beautifully done!
---
No, it's not available to us anywhere in game, unfortunately. 
---
The closest you can find are miniature robot models.
---
Don't hoard all that crap.
---
toss the plans in the suitcase at Watego Station, for starters.
---
Yeah though even if it was essentially balanced without a cap, heavy hitting weapons would be frustrating to play against, causing people to complain just as they did in the early days so it's probably never going to satisfy the majority of the player base if there is no cap which makes it impossible to one-shot.
---
Both my PA builds use max travel pharm and thru hiker with calibrated shocks.  Seems to do the trick for me. 
---
I also have fo1st so my stash space isn‚Äôt much of an issue.  
---
For AP regen I just use corn soup with herbivore.
---
I meant to melee it with my rifle but I fat fingered my controller and hit the trigger, lol. Dont be salty. Mistakes happen and it's just a game at the end of the day. Sure, I killed it and he followed me. I may have caused it but I also ended it too. If you want to troll someone, be better at it than they are.
---
Well ... I have a Furious Regular and a Zealot's Ultracite. I primed the Zealot's.
---
Furious works way better than the Zealot's against the SBQ - probably due to the stacking damage. But when there's mobs to deal with I switch to the Zealot's.
---
Right on, this game needs more emote vocabulary. That‚Äôs for sure.
---
Im not certain the croc backpack plan etc will be included in the loot table for the donor provisions. All Ive seen mentioned is "Weapon and Armor" plans. Someone posted earlier in the week a screen grab of the datamine for the rewards
---
Pls gib coords for this nex BoS base so i can pass them to my buddy Kovac-Muldoon and he can drop some kinetic care packages.
---
I'm a newer player. But running a 2 strength sniper build taught me to get rid of stuff I don't need lol. Do you really need all those plans if your not needing to sell them?  All those guns or chems? I scrap them or drop them if I can't sell.
---
I can‚Äôt help it. I need those 47 mole miner gauntlet plans.
---
Uh, yeah there is.
---
The real MVP right here.  Nice find.
---
I didn't think of this!
---
Only lvl1 though.

Whenever I go to Garrahan Mining the first thing I do is lob a grenade into the parking lot.
---
I stopped playing on Vault 94 launch.
---
I came back recently, a week or so after the "season" launched.
---
I can't believe this still hasn't been fixed.
---
laughs in unyielding.
---
That's far from being salty, in either case you can say all you want. An excuse or truth, no one knows and no one's ever gonna know.
---
Raider Collectron looks for drugs and guns, Scavenger Collectron looks for scrap or junk objects. There's also Fasnacht, Santa, and communist Collectrons.    
---
If you own more than one of them you can set any of them to do the job of any of the others you own.
---
Havnt found one since radiation rumble changes.  Luckily I had picked up a couple before the changes.  
---
Tracking unknown will reward u with a lvl 1 though.
---
I run a lowish health heavy junkie build with no pa and i love it. Nice in between for damage/survibility if ur not runnin full bloodied. PA is is just to easy mode...if u run sub 20% with emergency protocols and lone wanderer u literally never die and if poison resist becomes a legendary perk itll be even more crazy. I do miss the accuracy/armor pen from pa when using heavy weaps tho....
---
Enclave is not America.
---
I won a match two days again. No weapons of armor. Nice amount of xp do playing hide and seek.
---
For me it‚Äôs the left leg. 0 unyielding pieces for like 4 weeks, then this week I managed two. Except they were only one-star :(
---
Make a recurve bow with the flaming arrows mod. One well placed shot will tag the whole group. Pull back, as soon as you see the group spawn let loose. ;)
---
Also of note is you can set another one up in any Workshop you own.
---
Wow I'm level 41 and have a screwed up special pt allocation.  I was wondering how I had high int but no cards. I thought the first screen with special letters were just to see what cards were in each one. My entire build is jacked.
---
Your comment about Power armor reminds me of training wheels on a bicycle. Once you learn to ride, take off and never need again.
---
I don't get crashes at that event but it seems that the majority of the time I go to do that event it does not let me interact with the lure and I cannot complete it.
---
Okay, so I run PA, have a Furious Gatling Gun, Final Word 50cal MG from Beckett's quest, I also have heavy BoS Combat Armor (Deep Pocketed) for being outside PA, and have at least 3k round of 50cal and 5mm *each*.
---
I have at least 50 Purified Water, 20 Brahmin Steaks, and 50 each of RadAway/RadX/Stimpacks.
---
I'm below 150lb weight.
---
I have Travelling Pharmacist, Bandolier and that one that reduces food weight, all maxed, and Bear Arms at rank 1. Don't have any PA reducing perks.
---
Have you checked your MISC tab? Stuff like Ores and Gunpowder stash in there and can take up loads of room.
---
I am sorry if it annoys you that I say how long I played the game yet, i just thought it would be a indicator if i have any clue or just bought it yesterday.
---
Sure I play this game alot, almost every day and the last few months even more. That's not because the game is so awesome, it's more that I have some friends to play together making it a cool experience. We're somehow addicted to fallout as a franchise, I played fallout4 for 3 years till 76 got announced.
---
But isn't that the best reason to have a opinion to the state of the game as it is compared someone who played a few hours? If so many people have so much criticism which have played for hundreds of hours shouldn't it be a sign?
---
I don't have to love something unconditionally to waste my time with it, I think it's more like an addiction. Someone who smoke cigarettes don't like the taste, the smell, the price or health deficit, also if they are aware that they are addicted they most likely wont reccomend it and criticism it aswell.
---
This is exactly what I‚Äôm trying with the fixer. Seems to work and now I have 3 pts to use elsewhere!
---
Yeah that's how it all works. May the RNG bless you on your endeavor!
---
Does the level do anything? Aren‚Äôt they all 1000 rad resist? Or am I missing something.
---
Id just like to see every weap balanced in its own way for dealing damage to players like nw, and no vats. Maybe not have perks apply any benefit when it comes to damage? I dunno....i know theres a solution out there somewhere but im not smart enough to figure it out lul
---
If you want to hoard plans just make an alt account and dump them on a mule.  That's what I do.  Every couple of weeks I have a friend go on their private server and I consolidate all of the plans my 5 characters have gotten over that time period into a suit-case and then go through them all individually with all 5 characters learning what I don't know.  Anything left over gets picked up by my alt account for friends to go through later.
---
I'll make sure to double check the water now  üòà
---
Next year enclave update comes out: Give us all your ammo and weapons.
---
A DPS cap so it takes into account ROF?
---
When u join a public team and u‚Äôr teammates complete quests u will be awarded
---
I'm on PC too,  and double checked with modules before I posted. You might have been loaded back into the same server when you checked?  I've never had that issue, but the top comment mentions it.
---
I'm new to game but have you tried destroying it then rebuilding?
---
I don't know how the weapons are balanced in NW so I can't really say much there but no vats would probably make sense, as that would nerf slow firing weapons in close quarters, as that's what's the problem in my opinion, a sniper who was jumped on shouldn't be able to instantly kill his enemy by pressing Q
---
Yeah I‚Äôm testing this out and with a fixer I can‚Äôt tell a difference. Think I just freed up 3 perk points. Put in a point of gun fu, adrenaline, and sandman each. Thanks for the reply
---
No. Can‚Äôt do it. It hurt my feeling to once toss 50 single action revolver ivory handle plans away.
---
No message and how can 3 people be completing a quests every 30 or so seconds?
---
Yes I have, good insight tho!
---
I greatly undercut everyone's prices once a week for clearance sales to empty my stash, i bulk my scrap,and only keep what I absolutely  need or know I can sell
---
There should clearly exist a STG44 so we could use than huge amount of 44 cal bullets in a deadly historical gun. The only issue is that It looks pretty similar to the handmade rifle as Mikhail Kalashnikov based his design gor the AK47 in german STG44
---
everyone who RPs enclave is so funny; any original enclave soldiers would gun you down without hesitation if you display any of your mutations.
---
Yes... best places for this, Valley Galleria, Whitesprings (though if you hurt one of the robots with a stray explosion they'll all turn on you), Garrahan Mining, Nuka Cola Plant... also the lorry buried in the ground on the Red Rocket forecourt at Seneca Rocks Visitor Centre is fun.
---
I would argue if you are a smoker, at some point you did enjoy it. 
---
Maybe after 2000 levels it all seems stale. I have a mere 900 hours in the game, so maybe I am unqualified. I think the game has a lot of quality content. It has its problems, but I stand by my statement. It‚Äôs not surprising someone with 2000+ hours in a game no longer is as excited to play.
---
Google
---
Forgot something:
---
The game is what it is. If we had real mod support the game would be what we make of it.
---
Clearing out all collectables, challenges etc. Is not content, roleplaying or anything else is no content. Content is what it is, content. The game lacks it for sure.
---
I've been wearing Chinese Stealth Suit under my PA. 
---
It only weighs ~5lbs and has resistances around the level of Sturdy Combat gear. Plus rad resist of a hazmat suit.   
---
Also Bear Arms maxed, but I rock 5 main guns, so I'm getting the most out of it.
---
Yeah, unfortunately the UI is bit confusing and its not explained well by the game either.
---
After level 50 you can move points around though, but will be missing on perk cards (you have a choice to move SPECIAL point or choose a perk card). Ive personally have moved quite a few points and respecced myself, but now the new Legendary perk system, that is coming is screwing people over, that has done it (unless they do something about it).
---
Definitely. Can't even guess why it was set to five. The illusion of rarity? An actual typo? Their favorite number? who knows.
---
Get a much unyielding armour as you can drop/buy; AP refresh, leather sneak and fall damage if you want to use the jet pack. Replace it with SS unyielding, this is a slow and painful rng process.
---
I have so much gunpowder. Started selling that for a cap rather than ammo and it sells. So I stopped selling ammo.
---
Lol release pvp gear RESILIENCE
---
Well that was a remarkably hurtful way to start the morning. Thanks for that. 
---
The point I was trying to make is that this challenge is not well designed. The level up challenge, in particular, can be very time intensive if done as part of normal play. But it‚Äôs very easily bypassed (with a quick alt). Which means the challenge level, will I‚Äôve you get over L50 or so, is either too much or not enough.  It‚Äôs not very well designed as a *daily* challenge.
---
I‚Äôd say it would be better designed if that challenge was designed to be equally lengthy for all players (‚Äúplay x minutes‚Äù ) or not so trivially simple to bypass.
---
uhh a game having specific features makes it a specific game type.... 
---
if MMO isn‚Äôt a specific game type then why does every specific MMO specifically list the game as ‚ÄúMMO‚Äù in the genre? Why does Steam have an entire ‚ÄúMMO‚Äù category full of specific MMOs if it‚Äôs not a game type? Y‚Äôall make no sense and need to go play real MMOs if you‚Äôre gonna call fo76 one
---
Watoga - for starters?! ü§®
---
I toss them in the overseers camp chest(s) and only keep the "good" plans to sell in my vendor.
---
I think it is also very easy to maintain heavy weapons thanks to bear arms - rifles are a PITA...
---
I'm selling 14 more by my camp, come around anytime.
---
I swear that if I had the option to do so, I'd throw them to a fire just to see them BURN.
---
As RadRatSteak pointed out, Ultracite weapons do not do more damage to scorched. Zealot's effect does stack with primed receivers, though, so if you have a Zealot's UGL and you prime that you'll be on to something. The Hunter's effect works on scorchbeasts and the queen, but Zealot's is more effective against more enemies at Scorched Earth.
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt run mutations.
---
And also, Frank Horrigan.
---
Is it just a visual bug or is your cap count actually going up?
---
Don‚Äôt think it does.
---
No one is unqualified for an opinion. It's just we have different perspective of views. 
---
I did not enjoying smoking, my brain tell me to do. Do you enjoy using the toilet, breath or sleep? It's just common since you have to, but you wouldn't do it otherwise.
---
Imagine if the game had not pointer where are you at the moment and ofc no fast travel.
---
I forgot that part lol
---
Don't tell me I've discovered a new bug! It would be such an honour.
---
Good thing I‚Äôm just casually chatting with folks on a phone, and not doing a job then, huh?
---
You're probably right, although I still don't really get it.
---
I have such a backlog of other games that I wan't to play (and indeed, other things I want to do in real life), that if I were bored, I'd go and do something else. It's not even like shooting an enemy that won't die and just ignores you sounds that much fun!
---
I know that some people also get their kicks out of making other people miserable/annoyed, so I think there's also a certain amount of that as motivation too.
---
It pops up in the middle like a sale and is added to my caps on the pipboy stat
---
Lmao maybe.  Are you on PC or console
---
It used to be that if you killed any enemies with a car explosion you didn't get any credit for the kill, no XP couldn't loot the bodies, then they changed that so that you get some XP and the bodies were lootable. So now I always shoot at cars when I see some enemies using them for cover. 
---
The not getting credit for enemies killed by vehicular explosions was patched out pretty early on I'm not sure which patch however maybe 5 or 6 maybe around the time Nukashine was introduced?
---
PC
---
Good point.
---
Nobody just starts smoking because their brain told them to
---
Higher levels have more durability.
---
Please no lol just increase the scrip cap . Adding another currency to trade for a currency is a stupid and lazy idea
---
Brother, I have 4 alts maxxxxed out with scrip weapons, thanks to treasure hunter and Fasnacht, ammo, armor, and assorted misc. One guy is done. He can‚Äôt pick up another Berry Mentats. One lady has all my clothes. Rona has had me playing way more than I should, like a lot of us I‚Äôm guessing, and there way too much inventory in game and in game currency limits are cruel. I need these game pass Noobs to level up and start spending caps. Another week should fix this.
---
Your teammates are probably PVPing. You get an award of caps every time they kill another player.
---
Is there a cap on much much you can earn? I though it was just the vendors 1400 cap daily limit?
---
I never said it was like that.
---
My wife blows up every car we see. I usually only do it when there's enemies standing near one.
---
Maybe they can add them in once they implement camp instanced interiors
---
the STG44 did not use .44 ammo.  But this is Fallout, so of course it did.
---
You on a public team? Check to see if any of your teammates are engaged in pvp. Each time one of them kills someone, you get a small share of the caps.
---
I've experienced this free cap thing too, but I eventually discovered that someone on my team was killing another player over and over again.
---
That's true! My bad
---
I got back into Warframe for now instead of Destiny
---
As far i know, nope. Nothing yet.
---
I run bear arms to carry all my heavies so I can free up space in my stash for plans.
---
I second this motion üñï
---
Good news.  That worked,  Bad news, my game has crashed about 6 times before I can even get out of the vault.  So I've decided to give up.
---
Damn, was hoping it might be fixed with tomorrow's update üòî
---
Dude.
---
If they made that skin for the Assault rifle, people would start to use it EVEN if its worse than the Handmade. Of course with some decent legendary perks the Assault rifle can be a useful all-rounder.
---
And about the animations. They could make it a "Legendary tier" skin and by that making it more expensive than the other skins, because giving it special animations would require more time and effort from the developers.
---
Of course they could also make it a brand new weapon. But we already know that it's a handmade skin, so there is no more point arguing about this.
---
Yeah that makes sense, 1 person left the team and its stopped. Thanks for your help. I may never have turned it off.
---
Well prepared for the wasteland, gonna kick some scorched ass!
---
I love Insult Bot
---
Probably dense on the chest and waiting for ultra lite to be released for the limbs
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Jet pack or dense for the chest.
---
Maybe, sometimes bethesda fix bugs without putting it into their patchnotes (which will be available as soon the servers shut down). Mostly they re-appear tho.
---
I've been searching for a way to display my sheepsquash mascot suit and regular sheepsquash suit as well as some Halloween stuff that I don't actually wear but looks cool.  I just got it sitting in my loot box taking up space and I think it would look really cool as a display in my camp.  In fallout 4 my bases were primarily armor displays and I was pretty bummed to find out I can display weapons but not armor in 76
---
His turrets need repairing...
---
I love that bot. I make 556 rounds from him each visit.
---
Probably go Dense since I run bloodied.
---
At the very least we need the sorry one. Much like the embarrassed shoulder shrug in everyday life when driving, we need the ability to quickly say my bad I know that was dumb.  We all do things in this game instantly realized was a dick move and we didn't mean to be rude.  I don't use my mic much and I pretty much have to dig it out and remember what key I have assigned to push to talk just so I can say sorry.
---
Usually in the bog or swamp which usually means some big ass guy coming after them.  At least that's been my experience on the shine
---
I used to be like that as in every other fallout game I kept EVERYTHING.  But it was so liberating when I dumped almost 100lbs of absolute trash plans, though I wish they would give us the option of scrapping them instead if we want.
---
By alts do you mean characters or accounts?  I'm talking about making a second account to store stuff.
---
If you do have 4 full alt accounts then.. Idk lol.
---
You will see when someone either got attacked or killed someone or done vise versa.
---
You probably just had a visual bug where the notification didnt show up when someone either was in pvp or completed a quest.
---
Has BGS mentioned at all if it's coming?
---
I only hoard TP. This might be a difficult event....
---
I mean u started the event knowing ur running bloodied and u had new players with you.   So u basically used ur card hoping other players would do the hard work?
---
No idea. You would think its a pretty safe bet though
---
You are an idiot
---
Thanks for the offer man, but I'd rather do it myself (just for the feeling of "I did that", if you know what I mean?) 
---
I appreciate the offer though dude üòäüòä
---
 [https://nukacrypt.com/devtracker](https://nukacrypt.com/devtracker)

First post

Thanks for the replies guys, I'll give the spreadsheets a read when I'm not at work. Much appreciated ü§òü§ò
---
I swear to God he is the Preston of this game.  every time I talk to him I feel like he's going to tell me there's another settlement that needs protection. instead he just tells me how he incompetently lost the most important thing he ever had.... again
---
Like I get the point if having certain limits, but if they could set it up to be one or the other or not at all that would be great. It makes no sense to add to your stash if its on display. Like that should be part of the display piece and until you alter jt, stays that way same with vending machines. Like those should be part of those objects. The polygons exist already in that space and thanks to the scrapboxes we know that render isn't dropped when you have (9999) items are in inventory just taken out understandably because thats no longer idle data.
---
If you up to play stealth, you most likely want a thorn armor as best in slot for that playstyle. They are Easyer to craft and roll more 3*
---
I run to the nearest STASH and drop everything but a Bowie knife to see if I can make it back to my CAMP without fast travel or vendors every time I get 'shined.
---
Ok, I'll have a look when I get home, although I'm sure mine just says "Combat Armor" to be honest. Could be wrong though.
---
One alt account, technically it‚Äôs my wife‚Äôs account but she only uses her main character. I have 3 alt characters on my own account but I play them different styles and don‚Äôt want the over-encumbered. But I #never play PA so I was really trying to get some tips on running tank.
---
I‚Äôve noticed when I‚Äôve blue screened before it tries to join me back to my original team almost like I‚Äôm still a part of that team. I wonder if you‚Äôre not fully logged out, it‚Äôs still earning you team rewards. I realize you‚Äôre not getting a message that a team completed an even but seems like that‚Äôs what could be happening. Nice problem to have though lol
---
I have had this issue on Xbox forever. I‚Äôve only been able to interact with the lure a total of maybe 4 or 5 times.
---
I posted this a week ago and my post was removed in 15 minutes for being a repetitive post because someone mentioned it in a comment six months ago. But this one is ok. I don't get this subs mod team.
---
If you can, use something like Nvidia shadowplay to record these events.  It'd make a hilarious youtube video.
---
Yeah, neutral good is about the best you‚Äôre going to get after a nuclear war.
---
Gatling Plasmas can‚Äôt have both +Agi and 90RW. Are you sure about those rolls?
---
I wouldn't underestimate the jetpack.....I have it on my main and I miss it a lot on my others.  I recently switched my stealth sniper to a stealth bloody commando, and with all of the extra AP and AP refresh from unyielding, it's almost like you can fly.  It has really transformed my game play on that character.
---
If you're on PC, then its hacked. As far as I know, PA cannot have Legendary effects.
---
OP isn't the one that made it an achievement.
---
Beth *has* stated that "I'm Sorry" is on the way..
---
Or a "You have all these weapons for 10,000 caps and you wonder why they aren't selling" emote.  I don't know how it would look, but we need it.
---
Sometimes I'll setup my tent outside of hopewell cave.
---
I fast travel over.  2 shotgun blasts at the cars, whole rows goes in flame.  And I sprint threw it to get to the cave and the tasty deathclaw.  
---
Just a fun time all around.
---
Yes, it'll be fixed in the next patch.
---
Did the exact same thing but in reverse, some friendly high level player offered some mystery liquid in a punch bowl, being new and him being friendly I indulged in a little bit of a drink, screen went really funky and i eventually passed out and ended up on a cliffside with a fellow dead traveller enjoying the sun in a chair, grabbed myself a ski sword thingy lvl 50 (still cannot use yet) and a chainsaw, not to shabby for a night out on the piss.  Never again will I accept a drink from a mysterious punch bowl, who am i kidding i will do it again
---
Yes, power armor displays FTW. Massive thing of mine in FO4 was to collect as many PA sets as possible and display them, cos I never used PA anyway, and it's the same with FO76. Don't understand why this wasn't a thing in the first place.
---
Oh thanks. I thought I was missing something. Definitely don't want that.
---
Luckily Game Pass got me in, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have touched it otherwise. I like it enough now that whenever it goes off the pass I‚Äôll buy it.
---
Oh my gosh,  I am too! I love it! My boyfriend gets pissed tho because he always happens to be running near the car I'm kerploding mwa-ha-ha!  The chain reaction at valley Galleria is so much fun, especially when you can get scorched bodies flying thru the air
---
THIS! I didn't bother to buy it due to its outrageous GB cost for no benefit other than cosmetic. If they don't add any affects to it, then they should lower to cost to something more reasonable, say 200 GB?
---
It wasn't Photoshop if you saw it on PC - some hackers made those armors and duped them. There aren't PAs with legendary effects (only Strangler Heart can be consider that way, but it's an unique set bonus)
---
No. I love it. It keeps the game a challenge
---
I think we need a separate "Come Here For An Event" emote, rather than just the "Follow Me" one. I'm not sure if everyone knows/realizes that when on a team, a teammate using that means they are wanting people to join for an event. Even better if it automatically adjusted (visually) based on the event you are at, so you can even tell what event they are at.
---
Oh, man, now I feel like I gotta get the Jetpack. I only have two pieces of unyielding SS pieces, so I'm sure once I get a few more it would really be worth it
---
Yeah. I haven‚Äôt really embraced playing this fallout as an MMO and I still play it as if I‚Äôm playing 4.
---
Unnecessary, but griefers are going to grief.
---
Yeah, hit me right in the pride lol
---
Win. I leveld up to 100 from scratch within 1 month, like alot of our comunity did. But I have to admit we are well organised and have badass players, good stats and so on. If you cant find a good premade or win solo, the best way to start is hiding and kill npc's with a crossbow or mele weapons if they aggro you. Try to get a high ranking and survived time.
---
yeah I am on xbox too for what it's worth.
---
It'll be in the patch tomorrow.
---
You're basically a Robinhood for the noobs except the players who die still didn't deserve to. 
---
I'm not against them
---
Those paintings do bring me joy.  Galen reminds me of our new kitten, who has a similar tabby and white pattern and likes to play fetch 
---
He made a lot of people happy and will continue to in the future.  Thanks for posting this.
---
Deep pockets is coming for the arms - I'm not sure about the rest. Personally, I'd love Ultralite for the legs.
---
I mean Calibrated shocks are the backpacks of power armor, and thats all thats ever gonna be in fo76 so I mean keep dreaming OP but this is your asnwer
---
That's actually a really good question, it would make sense but at the same time be kind of weird, as it would allow the same thing that used to happen with high powered rifles, that being one-shots, which were the main reason for the cap as far as I know.
---
I really wish the cars did more damage, or had a greater AOE. They seem like something you should be able to work in tactically but they never seem to kill anything when they go off.
---
You‚Äôre a dick. I have spoken.
---
Oatmeal raisin is delicious.
---
Do not besmirch oatmeal raisin cookies, lest you wake up with an orbital strike beacon under your bed.
---
The Teapot.  There's only 5 cars, but you shoot one on the end and they go off like dominos, except one, which waits about 20 seconds.  Those 20 seconds bring me such joy in anticipation.....
---
They're so fucking crazed and irradiated, they're like jacked up athletes destroying their bodies by pushing them past endurance.
---
Honestly, gaining 1 level per day is not the worst challenge. Killing 3 legendary ennemies is the worst one. Outside of some events, there's only a low chance to find one, and in the events that are guaranteed to be spawning them, you're lucky if some players don't blast them to hell before you have a chance of getting a hit in.
---
This is a valid argument.  One of my main weapons is a AA ffr handmade.  Over the weekend I started messing around with a fixer that has 33 vats and less vats cost.  Even though the fire rate is slower I feel like it kills faster because of the increased hits while using VATS.
---
would be absolutely awesome. i could see it as being released as a fixer skin or something though, knowing them. guess i‚Äôd take what i can get haha
---
We‚Äôre kinda in a setup phase rn, it‚Äôs only about 8 of us, getting the ranking, setup, and logistics all set up before we start recruiting, or even just letting more of our friends or people who left the other server in. Unless you were talking about that BoS group, then yeah, no, I cant invite as I‚Äôm not in there anymore.
---
Oh, and both are Xbox.
---
I can see the dupe now....
---
Junk will definitely sell. The most needed things like springs and screws will fly out of your vendor.  If you want it gone, I say 1 cap each. Some of the harder stuff 2-3 caps. You can always start higher and see what sells. If it doesn‚Äôt then lower the price.
---
It‚Äôs great for flux!!  Great job
---
It couldn't get to me while I was inside my camp. So it teleported into my sitting area.
---
Is that 1-3 caps each for one piece of junk or a bulked item? and do you think stuff like acid or nuclear material might sell? Because I am practically drowning in them.
---
You can actually still blow the limbs off feral ghouls. A charred feral ghoul without arms is a pretty common sight when I watch NPCs fight them.
---
exactly
---
I love trap bases. I will go through them several times just to figure out what you did. I always dump my junk before I enter a camp so no worries.
---
Not at all. Must not have been +AGI, I just remember Vamp + Lightweight specifically because I figured Furious (which I've got on the one I use) is better suited to me and Lightweight is kinda useless to me since I've got Bear Arms maxed.   
---
Point of the tale is 3* for 1k
---
Yea but tbh I almost always give it back to anyone that asks for their stuff back and most of the time I tend to give them extra xD I'm a very bad raider lol
---
Thanks to everyone who commented, when I first got the shotgun I thought the quad part was pretty cool, but I now know that that bashing shit be pretty poggers, hope they never fix it
---
I basically live in my PA. On average I‚Äôm at 233/345 so I‚Äôve got some room to pick stuff up. I use 5 different heavies on a regular basis, usually about 10 plasma and fusion cores. Couple thousand .50cal, few thousand 2mm emc and roughly 200k 5mm is on me at all times. Bear arms grants me variety of heavies with almost no weight and bandolier makes 5mm weightless so I can retain my lead trigger finger. Maxed traveling pharmacy allows me to keep far too many meds on me even though I rarely use em. On average I have about 400 stims and 150-200 radaway on me. Through hiker let‚Äôs me keep enough water on me to sell everyday to clean out the vendors when they reset.
---
I had a J 33 handmade for a while, it rarely missed.
---
Does displaying magazines take up camp budget?  I thought just the rack itself does that (one flamingo).  Any documentation for that?
---
Players will buy almost anything if it's cheap, experiment with prices and find out what works. Look at other player venders to see what are regular prices.

I have a table with the cask nukashine keg from a good while ago so at least they know somewhat what they‚Äôre getting into
---
I like when when I see a nuke zone and think "what the hell were they doing?"
---
Nice idea, also thought about something like a stash or something (vendor) that shows all loot you would get as drop and quest rewards.
---
It annoys me to sort my inventory, all this missiles from nuking or radaway as bloodied build totally has no place in my inventory.
---
If a chest, vendor or something would get this items I could pick what I want and with every log out this inventory get deleted to avoid exploiting it as endless container.
---
I play a 100% stealth damage  sniper build. If I'm not sneaking it takes like 4 slow ass hunting rifle shots to kill 1 let alone the usual 5.
---
I fast travel to Freddys house of horrors and get ganked by a swam of em.
---
When I did Miner Miracles, those cars are what helped me destroy the two robots that were way too OP for my low level ass.  =)

LIGHT FOOTED
---
Griefers are usually the ones out stealing kills and hogging legendaries or ruining events lol
---
My thought is I never have more caps than the difference of the three most expensive things in my machines can be sold for.
---
When the meat piles start popping up, I start looking and listening for flies. They can be seen above that shallow water at Heart. Now if only robot junk piles had something similar, like electric crackling/sparks.
---
Honestly, I never buy into the hate for games like this, or for instance No Man's Sky, or even Anthem. It's probably because I'm a huge Destiny fan, so I've been there üòÇ
---
No, the real reason is because of games like Call of Duty. Modern Warfare is absolutely the worst, most unfair, most unbalanced COD game I've ever played (and I've played nearly every single one from the first ever release on the PC, St Mere Eglise for the win!), plagued with problems and devs that seem to not know what they're doing or what game they're trying to make/improve/update/whatever (that latest Ground War map, for example, proves to me that they haven't got a clue on anything), and absolutely rip ideas off of other games, even down to the 3 man squad BR (hey, Apex!) that's about to have trains added to it (PUBG, anyone?).
---
(And don't give me that "oh same devs as Apex" crap, it's still the same shit.)
---
Yet everyone seems to think it's the second coming of fucking Jesus. It's crap, it was crap at release, and it's crap now. And the same people that sit there and play that shit all over games like FO76 because some YouTuber told them it was shit. 
---
Yes, by the look of it, it had its problems. Yes, it still does indeed have some problems. But at least Bethesda are actively trying to improve their game, and same with NMS and Anthem. What do people like Activision do? Shove a shitload of "content" into their game, and not do a whole lot about the issues. That's probably wrong, but that's the way it was since Advanced Warfare.
---
I've got just over a day played, and I'm loving it. Picked it up on Game Pass and may well actually buy it when it comes off. Currently at lvl31 and I'm not stopping soon.
---
Valley Galleria... if you shoot 1 truck most of the lot will explode in a nicely timed chain reaction. Nothing like choreographed pyrotechnics. üî•üòà
---
One piece of junk and yes acid and nuclear material will sell very well. Constantly see it in demand in the fb group in in
---
Okay ! I guess I might go around with pen and paper noting down prices for a day soon \^\^
---
There is a chemist backpack mod. That‚Äôs what you need
---
That‚Äôs the downside of your choices which is what the game is about.
---
For stealth builds the passive on thorn armor is better than the improved damage resistances on secret service armor.  Thron armor you can just flat out buy mods for too from the enclave bunker, no need to waste GB on them like you would secret service mods.
---
But regardless of which one you choose the RNG will become frustrating at some point or another.  Especially after your third 1* exterminators piece.  Just keep at it cause the feeling of getting that 3* piece with exactly what you want on it is priceless and well worth the aggravation.
---
Good luck bud.  May RNG be forever in your favor.
---
Okay that's great, thank you !
---
I get the motivation to do them, but they do annoy me.
---
Yeah, I think they're funny and try to rid myself of junk prior to visiting any camp. If I don't and lose stuff, oh well...that's on me. Trap away!!! I would have one if I were clever enough...haha.
---
Semantics.
---
No skin! Lol! That'd be cool too!
---
It was one of the first things patched after release.
---
Also some bulks weight more then the junk itself, at least it was once like that. Aluminium and something else, need to check if it got fixed anytime yet.
---
Honestly, i'm just glad i'm not the only one! I was convinced this game friggin hates me. I did get 2 uny legs with ap regen and -fall damage tho....guess you gotta pay the piper in the end : /
---
All I want for Christmas is mod support with real private servers.
---
I've never seen them blown off, they only hang on their sides usually. I guesa they only apply to NPCs right now
---
2525 for standing in front of a queen and unloading clips. 3325 for the daily grind. I run a b3325 fixer for non boss grind (95% of my game play).
---
I only use it when I'm collecting flux in nuke zones
---
I just started noticing this trolling character.  I do like the other one who follows up correcting his grammar.  Funny.
---
Its pretty fun fiddling with it and making it better, mines not overly complicated but it is naughty, and if you power armour glitch around it 90% of the time you end up in a locked portable toilet xD
---
Very welcome =) I mean, it wasnt good news. But the story behind it is beautiful. And it should be seen because it kind of belongs to this series history now. RIP Galen
---
They were gonna add the Sten gun. Idk what happened.
---
Having a specific feature makes it part of the game but doesn't make it the sole reason to play.
---
Items rotate in the atom shop, the bowl occasionally shows up bundled or in the flash daily sale. It was in the shop just two weeks ago bundled with the futuristic portable camp iirc, but it'll come up again.
---
It's the Pristine Nuka-Cola Machine, but sadly it got vaulted last week.
---
no docu that I know. My experience from months ago did point to more than just one FU.
---
I don't need to change your mind - you do you üòâ
---
However, consider the following:
---
1. A lot of (most?) folks running a stealth commando, will be using an unyielding/bloodied build so their perception will be really high to start with, meaning vats will hit most of the time anyway. (barring vats bugs which effect 33% as well) 
---
2. Most will also be using at least one rank of concentrated fire, meaning even if they wiff the first shot the the second+ will hit.
---
3. Enemies which require sustained fire (ie. more than one or two shots) will die 25% faster (or there abouts) so yey for that I suppose :)
---
So in summary: 33% is useful for one shoting trash mobs (but then, you might want to consider a lever action for this) but ffr isn't far behind but for something which can take a hit or two the ffr is much better.
---
Definitely wildly optimistic.
---
Hate them and you if you got em..  simple..  im there to shop or for a purpose. NOT for your personal entertainment! Thanks
---
When the event is not going on you should be able to see Mad Dog locked up in his cell plotting his next escape!
---
I made Overseer by hiding in bushes never picked up anything. Watched people walking  by. 
---
Every time I actually try to play I get downed in seconds
---
I recently gave someone a Recon rifle in the interior building of morgantown airport. Might be a coincidence though.
---
I win often by killing ppl. Lot of them. You should try. Instead of being a coward.
---
I'm one of those people and I disagree lol.
---
Hey, ya never know. They've done some cool stuff like that already. Sorry if that aggravates you?
---
You get more xp for time than anything else. Just  play hide n seek.
---
It took me about 45 rolls to get a full set of unyielding, I think I was still pretty dang lucky. Also got a bloodied gauntlet within a handful of rolls too. 
---
RNG can be so harsh though, I've seen some people do 100+ rolls for gauss miniguns and not get a bloodied one for example. And I've never gotten anything that good from the Purveyor.
---
If it's a fair build then I figure it's just part of the game, but if you're hacking or exploiting mechanics, like making hundreds of impossibly-stacked punji boards spawn out of thin air, then I hope you get fucked by a gorilla.
---
Sounds great, why was it removed?
---
Me!!
---
I miss the deliverer and taking ghouls legs off and letting them chase me around!!
---
Personally I hate the damage cap and I don't even use weapons that are affected by it. Damage cap just pushes everyone towards faster firing weapons, snipers get completely left behind. 
---
I've given up on caring about Adventure mode PvP ever being balanced at all though. I'd prefer they add more to NW, including different game types (death match, capture the flag, etc.). VATS and legendary effects will never fit into a balanced PvP mode.
---
Morgantown is great for Flux farming, and it'll create quite the hefty amount of glowing ferals.
---
I also nuked Morgantown as my first one.
---
I usually hide in bushes and will last about 10 minutes. Gives me around 200 xp. Last night I found a perfect spot and made it to 3rd. I ended up with 600xp. I was doing a happy dance as I died!!  Lol
---
How can you sell mutations?
---
My computer thanks you guys everytime I teleport to the tea time event and it has to suddenly deal with rendering a truckload of explosions xD
---
They are cool to look at and hear tho tbf
---
Be the person to find out.
---
Ghouls are not zombies
---
Touch√©
---
I throw all sorts of stuff in my vendor when my stash starts to get full.   
---
Bulk springs, gears, acid, adhesive, aluminium, lead, steel.  
---
Ballistic Fiber, titanium, loose screws, ultracite.  
---
I set prices about 1/3 of the listed in-game value (inventory space is my real payment) and everything will be gone in an hour or two.
---
Sooooo.... 2 shots?
---
Most of the hate comes from people who don‚Äôt have any experience with the game
---
I have plenty of Brahmins milk for you!ü•õ

Turn on paacifist mode, then it is impossible to accidently shoot someone. Had these assholes going around queen fights and running into gunfire so it would force a pvp engagement.
---
No that was me! You were with another player thank you very much üôèüèª
---
The mannequin technology found in previous Bethesda Game Studios titles has been lost. However, if we deliver 300,000,000 Jangles the Moon Monkeys during Fortifying ATLAS Project Gamma, there is a 0.05% chance that the Brotherhood of Steel will find it for us.
---
Don't care. PvP in this game is so horribly bad that not even the damage cap fixes it.
---
Very much this. Just want to add something..  
---
\+33% VATS hit chance does not add 33% to your VATS hit chance directly. Meaning 50% hit chance does not become 83%. But instead the 33% increase is for the 50% the way that your on screen hit chance actually becomes 66.5%. So it is much worse than people seem to think. Add in concentrated fire and it is quite useless major effect. I take explosive, 25%ffr or even limb damage any day over it.
---
Fair enough - to be honest when wastelanders hit and vats broke for a while, I moved to ads and now rely on vats a lot less than I used to. For trash mobs I find it's slower but more fun :)
---
He gave me a double insult this weekend: The smartest thing about you is that pipboy on your arm. The dumbest thing is that you only use it for a flashlight.
---
You have a trap base, we have nukes.
---
* Explore the wasteland
---
* Collect stuff
---
* Play around with builds and perks
---
* Roleplay
---
* Make friends
---
* Complete the main campaign, wastelanders, side missions
---
* Unlock rewards from NW and also the legendary run
---
* Plan collect and build cool stuff.  Build a cool base
---
* Shoot stuff
---
* Become a wasteland vendor and sell you wares.
---
* Launch a nuke
---
* Complete the atom challenges and buy stuff from the store.
---
There are tons of stuff to do in this game.  Just go out and explore and do the main story.  From there you will come across a lot of things to do.
---
I run a bloodied build and have killed myself multiple times by shooting cars as I run past them expecting to start the countdown and inadvertantly oneshotting them. Death has not curved my car shooting habit.
---
Imagine if they start attacking camps while you're logged in lol
---
As the rightful heirs to, and the legitimate continuation of, the United States government, the Secret Service will soon align itself with the Enclave.
---
I get where you are coming from, though I don't really play NW and also don't care too much for the PvP in adventure mode but it not being balanced forces me to switch servers more often than not, as I have no way to defend myself with the playstyle I am going for.
---
I think doubleing down on NW for PvP and polishing it as much as possible may be a good idea, if they just remove it from adventure mode, though I don't know how workshops would work then, maybe have shared workshops to have it be more of a cooperative experience with instanced resource collector loot ? May also make defense events more interesting with more people participating, could also end in everyone having all workshops on the map though so there might be a need for a "workshop cap" then, I'm not sure.
---
No problem üòä i really like this community !
---
Same.  I play my bloodied heavy weapons + PA character when I want to feel strong and do events well, my bloodied shotgun + punch character when I want to feel strong but not as safe, and my junkies stealth sniper when I want to stop playing as soon as possible.
---
But yeah, at this point they pretty much have all the gold purchases they need, and that's...fine?  I don't mind logging in, getting the SCORE done, and logging out.  Sometimes I play longer if my friends are on, but I like playing a little of this game (so I'm not all rusty and outdated when BoS comes out, as I was when I took a year off before Wastelanders) and then being done.  I'm not sure why people get so angry about this.
---
Sure, it was a grind, and it would have been nice to have more variety.  But somehow...despite the repetition, glitches, lack of balance...this game is still fun to play.
---
I do have a 4th character now (pistols), but the rule is I only play it when one of my other characters won't hit a level up that day without trying (they're all above 100, two of them 160+).  Level 4 so far...
---
Yeah back when the game launched I never used vats so I get it lol
---
They aren't zombies bud.  They're very much alive and have been "super powered" by absorbing massive amounts or radiation (albeit over time) which is a theme found throughout fallout lore.  Unfortunately their brains were destroyed in the process.
---
Zombies as you know then from movies and pop culture are reaninated dead and the slow shambling is usually ascribed as a byproduct of rigor mortis and or decaying, dried out muscles depending on the film.
---
What bed layer? It doesn't crash for me anymore, it used to because of a few simple ini changes I made. The game overall doesn't feel buggy to me, at least no major bugs or quest bugs...
---
It doesn't matter if you give the loot away or don't take specific items I'm still gonna nuke your fucken trap.
---
I was sort of in that same position, then I sold all my camp plans on 20 caps a piece, and armor/weapon related plans for 50-150 caps. Got rid of most of the papers that way and of the rest I kept those with over 500 caps price and gave the rest to two lv 1 players fresh out of the vault.
---
Damn those are the god-roll legs I‚Äôm trying to get to really be able to make use of the jet pack with no restrictions. Congrats
---
As far as I can see, all platforms.   Plus, fallout 1st members have unlimited scrap storage, so they can have huge amounts of material.
---
Why the obsession with cork tho? I stopped playing months back
---
Guided meditation. Jump up on a pole between the parking lot and pond, or on top one of the roofs in the pond. I usually get 4 legendaries and about 30-40 ghouls. Plus a chance at the rare outfits from the savage divide events
---
I guess that makes sense to not get the points just for exiting the vault. I wasn‚Äôt sure that was connected to the bug.
---
May I ask where your camp is located ? Mine is in the south east of the map so most of the traffic is from people attending scorched earth or riding shotgun as an example, do you think I'd need to move it?
---
And thanks for the for overview that may come in handy.
---
They don't get tired and don't feel pain
---
Your nuke, your placement. Just after the Wastelanders patch I was bored and did triple nukes right outside of the safe zone over the overseer‚Äôs house, camp McClintock, etc. I don‚Äôt think the low levels were happy lmao
---
i should probably then just use another character and get some friends help then lol.
---
I have a 2handed melee alcoholic character who absolutely has to smack every car he passes until it blows up.
---
Been this way since level 2. Such a long journey. So many cars.
---
This is half of the issues resolved in this game.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a very low price. If that second effect was something like Faster Fire Rate, that‚Äôs practically a god roll.
---
It'd make things so much easier. No longer would the servers needlessly be bogged down by the armies of mules each holding thousands of pounds of scrip items.
---
u/shmagmyer
---
I mean, *Destiny* does a fantastic job at balancing PvE and PvP, but Bungie has some of the best first-person shooter developers in the entire industry, and Bethesda has a bunch of random people off the street who used to eat a lot of Play-Doh when they were kids, so I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
I had the same thing happen a week ago. Came back to my camp and two of my displays had everything swapped out to random things like spoiled meat, sunglasses, and wood armor. Not sure what happened or if it was a player or the game that did it.
---
"Proofed away" Nice.
---
What kind of bonuses do you have in mind, something like a more extreme lone wandere or something with a bit more specialization?
---
Flares scared abominations for a short time in New Vegas, but this is unfortunately not Obsidian.
---
Shit lie
---
Yesterday the messenger bot sent me to some guys house and the message was ‚ÄúUp Yours‚Äù I fell out laughing
---
Tell me more
---
ugh, I can't help myself from feeling similarly. It sucks, because a lot of us really love the core aspects of this game, &amp; are just holding out hope for bigger &amp; better expansions, which they've alluded to, but who knows what to trust?
---
The player base isn't small, they could make a solid profit if they said "alright, it'll be $20 for the next expansion." I'm just unnerved by the vagueness of the revenue model of the Atom Shop &amp; FO1st. Where is the money going? I pay in hopes of keeping the game growing, I just wish they could be more upfront with the future of the game. I'd buy expansions, I'd buy a sequel.
---
Actually sounds pretty cool, like a "Vertibird pilot" perk but as many people are saying, it would probably end up as a mess
---
If it‚Äôs something clever and not boring I don‚Äôt really care and junk wise I‚Äôm not stupid enough to be carrying stacks or junk and I don‚Äôt even care if I lose it I don‚Äôt even really ever go back to pick it up
---
I just made a second unyielding chest and put the jetpack on it.   NOW I can jump to the roof I want in Guided Meditation.  :)  
---
It only adds 10 lbs to inventory.  NBD.
---
Nope, I tried it once. It was...
---
https://i.imgur.com/C4MpYK6.gifv
---
Wow really? I never even caught that in NV :)
---
Absolutely! I love to see how many i can chain together. It got to the point that I now carry around a 10mm just so I don't waste my good ammo on this habit.
---
Lol! My husband used to do this to me...and he did it all the time! He made sure I was right next to a car before he shot it! The worst for me is when we are running a nuked Whitespring for some mats, and all I have on is my stealth suit. Needless to say, I was always turning out crispy...and then when I die, he grabs my loot. Lmao. The little prick!
---
Darn, that definitely would've been a cool add. Thanks for your help! :)
---
Let not try to carbon copy a cult classic.  I love the new DJ.  Positive and different.
---
I don‚Äôt know. I just can‚Äôt see it.
---
Yeah I use to have it on. I guess it‚Äôs times to turn back on. For a while I swear during queen fights when you hit someone it wouldn‚Äôt mark pvp anymore but maybe I just was more accurate. lol because I know last night it popped up a couple times. But most ppl will ignore it being they know you‚Äôre not trying to hit them. But yes I‚Äôve had ppl deliberately jump in front of me over and over again. If I die during queen fight no one wins. They don‚Äôt get my flux and I don‚Äôt. But I guess that‚Äôs a win for them because they will screw me out of my flux.
---
CAMP items I would like to see:
---
- Concrete bunker building set with "arrowslit"-windows
---
- Security bulkheads with yellow-black warning color as doors
---
- Raider decoration set with cages, spikes, corpses, barrels, etc.
---
- Fortification decoration set with sandbags, barricades, caltrops, etc.
---
- Proper appliances for bathroom, kitchen etc.
---
People playing Bloodied builds running around with minimal HP and not wanting to get hit by trash mobs.
---
I mean they could just run GunFu and Concentrated Fire to up their DPS more, but they don't.
---
Could be coincidence or maybe they thought they will get twice as many glowing ones, entertaining but can‚Äôt seem to see a logical reason to do this, esp silo run isn‚Äôt a walk in the park for their levels.
---
Are you planning on donating all the loot you get from your trap bass?
---
I was having the issue with the display after I exited the vault. I made it down the hill and was on my way to Flatwoods before I jumped servers to fix the issue. Since I hadn‚Äôt started a new character in a long time I couldn‚Äôt remember if I should have a display at that point. I wasn‚Äôt sure if the level up thing was a bug or not.
---
I wish the displays were seperated from the stash :-/
---
Smh I've never seen a single colossus, despite searching every time a nuke is dropped.
---
Well, he‚Äôs a pumpkin, so...
---
I don't have all of the math, but damage reduction seems to cap out at around 90%. 
---
Sentinel / Cavalier &amp; the creature-specific damage reduction pieces (Zealot, TS, Mutant Slayer, etc), cap out at 75% damage reduction,
---
DR / ER does also help, but it also caps out at around 80 - 85% (I saw a spreadsheet once that explained it in a lot more detail).
---
You also have to add in various attacks which ignore armor entirely (or have a fairly high anti-armor effect, like the Col. Gutsy's).
---
It's certainly complicated.
---
For me, I focus on a matched set - I find that a full set of TS armor is much better than a Vanguard's set, for instance.
---
Is that even a problem? You beat the game, it‚Äôs over.
---
I usually get top 2 or 3, once i won a match thanks to the bushes haha
---
It's a poorly planned out shit show of an event with limited payoff.
---
I can't do it without the majority of the weight reduction perks. Even then, I only have around 60-80 free carryweight on a good day.
---
I may get downvoted for this, but at this point I‚Äôd pay atoms for PA displays.
---
Did you read what he wrote?
---
Ok, so this is what I have:
---
Lvl30 BOS CA Chest Piece
---
Lvl20 BOS Ultra-Light CA Left Arm
---
Lvl20 BOS Ultra-Light CA Left Leg
---
Lvl20 BOS Ultra-Light CA Right Arm
---
Not sure if that helps but I'd figured I'd list them.
---
Congrats! Launching your first nuke is always fun :)
---
Why would I need to lie about that? I'm curious what you guys think but I don't give a fuck if you hate me for it xD
---
Molotovs are cheap and easy to use for this, and they don't instakill anything so you don't become THAT GUY.
---
Yeah, i have this to. Again.... Was fixed 2weeks? Ago. But with most big events this tends to happen.
---
wow, lots of salt here.
---
trap bases are ok if they are creative.
---
I set up in Toxic Valley. I figured I'd be in a place where lvl 20-40 characters might drop in. The kind of people who've reached the point where repairing their gear needs Ballistic Fiber, but they're not quite at the point where they've managed to get enough of a stockpile for themselves.   
---
Higher level players will just pay to fast travel to you if they see lots of junk in your vendor, no matter where you are, so it's probably more useful to try and catch lower level players and just let high levels do their thing.
---
That's what I do with every single thing I get, i donate it to newer player, but yea I'm gonna grind that BoS thing too
---
Yeah I agree with that completely, we can share atoms and atom shop items, why not the gold bullion as well or the plans from it. But then again, a level 15 with a set of secret service armor or a gauss shotgun would be a bit OP that early on
---
No you aren't xD I always check where nukes are. Feel free to try though haha
---
Its even better in 76 sinc ethe cars have hit markers and health bars. Something about that makes it more satisfying. Also its fun to do during feed the people, that event is mind-numbing.
---
You'll never nuke my camp lol I can serve hop before the 2 minute countdown so waste your time xD
---
Free teleport!
---
I carry one in my inventory. If I find myself overburdened, and super far away from any hope of scrapping- take a drink.  
---
Worst case- I wind up far away from any scrap of stash. No change. Best case- much closer. heck, I think one of the destinations has a craft station right there-IIRC.
---
Armor paint is different, that's more visible than an under armor paint cause most heavy armor hide it completely. I like how the SS one looks so I'll keep it the way it is
---
If you play NW, getting a kill with a car explosion is the best feeling as well!
---
It's a pretty chill trap kinda dumb but effective
---
Ikr lol yea it gets more creative over time I've done some funny stuff with it so far
---
At least make it so the underarmor stacks.
---
We arent stripping naked before we get into the Power Armor, even if there is a visual glitch showing it sometimes
---
You had me at cookies
---
 Those Charred Ghouls are out there, they cant be bargained with, they cant be reasoned with, they don't feel pity or remorse or fear, and they absolutely will not stop...EVER, untill you are dead!
---
But it will force you to stop what you are doing and move your trap base off the server. Well worth the nuke and it allows for flux farming.
---
And that‚Äôs what ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù told you had?
---
Can you add in the DR/ER values?
---
It seems to happen more common than being a workshop location, seems like a 60/40 type situation. One server you're fine and the next it's a new area location. I thought they did it in purpose at first when they changed The Rusty Pick icon so people could travel but no, just a weird goof apparently
---
That‚Äôs fine it doesn‚Äôt have to be advanced but I just hate the bases that you just remove the floor and you fall into the nail boards things
---
Well I feared as much, I really love the spot I am in rn but I guess I'll consider moving if I don't sell out quickly enough.
---
Few of them are creative. There have been a few that were cool but they are mostly time wash and repeat.
---
Does this mean the T-65 armor doesn't get crafted as a legendary?
---
I handed out a couple yesterday. Got lucky with Super Duper, so more to share.
---
I put refined .50 receivers on them, crafted a couple batches of .50 with ammosmith, and handed out the bundles to one lv10 sleeping in my bed, and a lv6 down the road from me.
---
They were only lv5 rifles, but the .50 will extend their usefulness a little longer, and despite being harder to find in the wild, it's more economical to craft than .308.
---
The C.A.M.P. items look very cool!
---
The outfits and PA skins... not so much... not very nice looking imo and some are down-right creepy.
---
Somebody probably got a good deal then. I wouldn't have even put it in the vendor if it hadn't been so light.       
---
Part of the reason for my current PA/Heavy guns character is that I don't really have the patience for grinding legendaries, so I don't think about it all that much. PA means 5 slots I don't have to fill.   
---
I don't even know what *really* good combinations look like. 3 of my guns (GatPlas, GL, LMG) are Furious, because I know it works well with high ROF.
---
Halloween for Christmas!
---
Doing the two daily possum events will get you plenty of badges.
---
I run 3 backpacks depending on needs. My combat pack is lead lined, very nice to have tight rad control when bloodied. I have a high cap for quick runs to a vender or camp. My new love is the fridge, went herbivore recently. Food keeps forever, actually makes crafting high tier food items worth it.
---
Executioners is a bad prefix, because it doesn't kick in at all until she's under half health, and the legendary health regen means she spends 2/3 of the fight above that. It's also a +50% damage boost which is OK, but not great. Furious is OK on a fast firing weapon and a tanky target like the SBQ but bad for everything else. It's +5% damage per hit on the same target up to +45% damage. Anti-Armor comes out to ~+30% damage at all times based on the way armor works, so it's better than the others most of the time, SBQ being the exception to that rule.
---
TL;DR All do 30-50% or so extra damage. 30%-50% of 5 is about 1 or 2, so each seems to do about the same damage. The prefix is significantly more noticeable on a gun that shoots slower but does more damage per bullet.
---
As an FYI the best prefixs are Bloodied and Junkies, low health builds do a ton of extra damage because of Nerd Rage, Bloodied doing +90% damage, Adrenal Reaction Mutation, etc.
---
Well said, I completely feel your pain here! 
---
I am tired of the control that has come about after the wastelanders launch. If there was a true desire of communism we have finally found it. 
---
It has also pushed me away from the game alate, especially after 3800hrs. I want to grind through the bullshit so I can enjoy the game the way I used to, now if I want to enjoy the game I have to make a choice between the legendary run or not play at all especially with me being back on my feet running my business 16 hours a day to keep it a float through this messed up time we are all facing with the pandemic. This has added insult to injury to say the least. Very outright selfishness from Bethesdas management on trying to force us to comply with there twisted monetization strategy that most of us sees through any way! Just one blatant slap in face after another.

I wonder if there will be a use for them in the future. I notice Bethesda likes to do that when you can make something with a specific junk item, so maybe that‚Äôs it.. and they just haven‚Äôt released it yet?
---
Yea they are kinda lame, I like the ones with hidden pits though , I fell into a confetti pit that landed on a pressure plate that activated radiation emitters that was pretty funny
---
"nice camp"

*flirt 100*
---
Ah yes, that too. Forgot about that one.
---
Without the cap, it would be worse. Like said here, it is not a very good solution to balance PvP, but removing it without any other measures wouldn't solve anything. The meta pvp weapon would just change and other builds would claim it is unfair.
---
The same place I pay them for extra character slots FeelsBadMan

Lol yea that sounds interesting

I'm not In a good spot for flux at all and I server hop a lot anyway I'm never doing very much just wandering. It wouldn't put me out even slightly lol I just find it humourous that people are this pissy about it :P

When I get I to their house, I turn off all the lights and signs. If they're selling common junk I can pick up for free and nothing good, I turn everything off.

Damn it, I thought these were actual new items.

I use power armor and heavy gun build. I use batteries included for plasma core and fusion core weight reduction. I have thru hiker for my food items weight and bandolier for my ballistic ammo. Also use bear arms for my heavy guns and their weight is about a pound each. I don't use stimpaks often cause of the fast healing mutation. My carry weight is 345 in or out of power armor and in armor I'm at about 150 sometimes, give or take (still carry stimpaks just in case) out of power armor I'm down to about 90-95 cause of my armor effects.
---
Hopefully they will pop up in qn unknown place and can open up more areas on his map for free. Lol

Landing spawns more adds, which gives more loot.

Don't underestimate people's willingness to pay to check your stock.

Seriously, if you list a high number of junk items you're going to get customers no matter where you're set up.

Any proof on that? Gained a hundred levels since 100 and definitely no change in requirement. A streamer‚Äôs already 600+ on 2 accounts and definitely no difference from 100 as well.

The invisible weapon skins are amazing

Yes.  It's just normal pa with very high damage resistances.

I just have neon letters that spell out ‚ÄúBath salt‚Äù above my punchbowl and its like an open invitation! I have to refill it almost daily cause apparently yall a bunch of fiends lol
---
This will hopefully be rectified by the instanced camps coming later this year. Not sure what kind of budget they‚Äôll have for that. You would think that since you‚Äôre in your own space that the budget would be much higher than what we have now, but that would make too much sense...
---
Definitely want that red communist PA skin and jet pack. Whatever the other PA skin is though the shoulders just make it look real odd. They don‚Äôt look all that well proportioned.

I love doing this, it's not my fault they love having nuclear powered cars and the booms are satisfying. Did it in Fallout 4 but 76 seems to have more less damaged cars. I blow up every single one I see

I have my punch bowl set up with a sign that says ‚Äúfree fast travel‚Äù lol
---
Pretty sure that's not true. Do you have a source? It doesn't show it on your current hit chance which is true. I'm fairly certain it is in addition tho. Since I consistently hit sub 10% shots
---
I'm tempted to make a set but that's a lot of grinding to get the 6000 or so gold required for it all
---
PvP is broken regardless, but this was a really slapdash "fix" to the problem because it incentivizes DPS over everything else.
---
There's just a fundamental problem with the balance in 76 where players run around with \~20-300 HP, but enemies can be up in the thousands.  To fix this properly takes time and resources.  Which is why, although I don't "hate" PvP, I see it more as a "If you won't do it right, let's not do it at all" kind of thing.
---
I've seen one of those it looks brilliant lol, idk how many rugs you can out down though
---
I'm secretly hoping Greloks staff will work like Sheogeraths from Skyrim... but I know it'll be a melee weapon

Idk but I got a couple down I think you can stack till you reach limit or ran out leather
---
I have bear arms, batteries included, ordnance express, and bandolier.  One time I took them all off and I had over 1k weight.  I have like 120 missiles, 30 mini nukes, 500 40mm grenades, 80 fusion cores, 60 plasma cores, 3k fuel, and about 15k .50cal/5mm ammo plus all the associated weapons for them.  With all the perks equipped it only weighs like 200ish.  
---
I would put some of it in my stash but the perks don't reduce weight for that so I have to carry it all around like a pack mule lol.  Its fun to pull out random heavy weapons whenever I want though, and I'm always trying to find new legendary versions of various heavy weapons.
---
Maybe level up a bit before you venture out East. Soon enough you‚Äôll be sneak one shot headshotting most enemies.

It‚Äôs almost like you should form your own opinion based on your own experiences, crazy concept I know.

---
Sorry for the spam, but I've just wandered into another player's C.A.M.P. and they've got an Unyielding Heavy Combat Armor Chest Piece for sale, albeit lvl50. They've also got an Unyielding Sturdy CA Left Leg, lvl50 as well.
---
How do I get the plans to make these? Is that possible?
---
Consider it addressed.
---
Yea it sucks. Oddly enough I had a hard time with the left leg as well. I think I might have rolled over 50 times just on that one piece.
---
guilty pleasure
---
80 and 180, as stated in the pip boy, without food or chems, but with my stated perks and mutations, in PA.
---
 You‚Äôre right, theres a lot more to it.  I use 80/180 for the reason you cite - actual damage varies because of enemy armor.  Weapon performance becomes a bit subjective b/c of perks, mutations, which vary person to person, plus  additional \*‚Äôs on the weapon or armor, Etc. 
---
 Ex: My char getting in/out of PA Changes the pip boy number (my under armor gives me +4 STR, and another piece of armor is another +1 STR, so the pipboy switchblade damage pipboy number jumps from 80 to 105 when I exit PA).  But if I am in WS, the Divide, Mire or Bog, I‚Äôm usually in PA, so I used it‚Äôs damage number.
---
   I presume the majority of people here know what high level ghouls are like, so I chose those as an example to show the weapons potential. 
---
  Another example - The Gutter (an assaultron sword) is pipboy rated at something like 123 - but hits mole miners with around 400, and a power attack on them deals a bit over 1000, which is 1 hit kill for a L40 glowing MM - conditioned I have both incisor and glow sight maxed out....
---
oh, I didn‚Äôt say I had incisor in my previous message... but I think thats rather common for melee players. 
---
The biggest problems are thing like super mutants with miniguns (Getting to them to use a melee weapon before the mini gun kills you) and yogis (my relatively weak armor)
---
L50 and 65s are no problem - I‚Äôve taken those out with the switchblade.
---
I never said anything negative about them. But I challenge you to find a greater sense of betrayal of expectations than thinking you're getting chocolate chip, only to bite into the cookie to discover oatmeal raisin.
---
What‚Äôs the easier way to craft if I may ask?
---
I have a complete set and while I love the look of it I will admit the increased armor suffers from diminishing returns.  Means I barely notice a difference from my old t51 set even while face tanking the queen.  Definitely not weeks of grinding difference that's for sure.  But I'm also the kind of guy who's a  sucker for a 1% increase just to say I have the best. It's more than 1% lol but again you barely notice it in the heat of battle.
---
I'm wondering which music/station the jukebox will play. Looks awesome
---
Ah yes, the Riker manouver
---
Thabk you all for your input. I giess it goes both ways. I never even thought that power armpr would help with heavy weapons. Looking forward to using it for the first time in the Nuke Zone
---
Junk walls? Hell yes, I've missed having that stuff. (Now give me stacked cars, like Junktown)   
---
Also, that "boxy" PA looks like something out of Cybernator, or Front Mission.
---
Yeah I told myself I don‚Äôt care if sets match. And I seemed to always get Right Arms and never left so I bought Left Arm SS and got a decent 2* and 3* so far. One is troubleshooter but AP refresh. I mean i like choices and my gold isn‚Äôt going anywhere
---
What are the break dance emotes?
---
Less mats I think, or at least less rare mats. Been awhile since I crafted mine, but i think they are cheaper. Also, i got only 3‚òÜ items crafting thorn and solar.
---
Secret service has only a 33,33%chance to craft 3‚òÜ.
---
Chemist mod has been a game changer for me. I have most of the other mods and barely use them any more because the three STR perk cards for Traveling Pharmacy mean I can do more damage on my melee or heavy guns build. I will say the armored backpack is really great for using with the stealth suit and is probably the only other one I use from time to time. I used to use refrigerated but just swap in the perk instead so I don't have to stash my chems.
---
I was hoping someone would call out Garrahan Mining. It‚Äôs amazing how many robots you can take out that way.
---
I love my X-01 suit, been my favorite since Fallout 4. I have sets of Ultracite, T-60 and T-51 cause I'm a hoarder and can't seem to part with them. I used the T-51 in a nuke silo but I don't use it anymore, no calibrated shocks, so it just sits in my box like a dummy
---
Lol. I get a kick out of it too...especially when he tells me he‚Äôs just picking up my stuff, so other players don‚Äôt take them....and you know what I tell him???? WE‚ÄôRE ON A PRIVATE SERVER!!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
That would explain why all my 2* unarmed drops are all lmb damage.
---
I have a biased toward it since I enjoyed it and ran them for fun for no reward multiple times a day.  I'm gonna put that upfront (ran from day1-&gt; last day every day).
---
By far the largest issue was server latency mixed with the timer.  To give you a ballpark idea, take the nuke silo terminal and pipe latency and ramp it up by about 10x, then add a timer for failure to it.  Server lag itself caused about 95% of the problems.
---
There are a few people that said the rewards were bad or it was to difficult, but I believe they were heavy gunners (higher ammo consumption in general) or just needed someone to teach them a few of the more/most efficient routes/jobs/tactics for clearing them.  As a rifleman spamming my handmade I profited over 100k 5.56 from ammo rewards alone. Then there is the best full hp armor and power armor that were rewarded from it.
---
Bug wise at raid launch for about 2 weeks there was a major one where if you follow an __extremely specific set of steps__ you could lose your carried inventory.  It was patched rapidly but not fast enough to prevent a blind hatred and fear for months after.  Beside that there were just very minor bugs like some bad ghoul spawns or the entry door not opening.
---
I've been killed by too many of my fellow wookies before adopting my shoot first ask later policy.
---
The deadliest enemy is the one you don't expect.
---
Yeah took me over 70 some combines over the past month to finally get just one decent SS chest piece. It is so poorly implemented it's sad.
---
What kind of spec are you running (perks, gear, mutations etc.)?  
---
I don't think it's really a shooter thing. Good aim certainly helps, but just being okay is fine too. There's always the option of running a vats build too.  
---
I think it's more so just learning what perks to use, which mechanics you can take advantage of, that sort of thing. Like with the recent public teams stuff, you can always have herd mentality up and almost always have strange in numbers.
---
I like fallout 76.  It's a decent game with a decent story and decent playstyle.  
---
Do I think it could be better?  Absolutely.  Undoubtedly.  
---
Do I think there's no game after end-game?  Somewhat.  They're trying, I'll give them that, but there's not a lot there.  If you don't care much for PvP or Battle Royale, and find Daily/Weekly Grinds to be obnoxious, as well as disliking "Glamor" based rewards....there's not much left.  
---
Do I think its re-playable?  Not as much as older games.  The way the leveling/card/perk system is setup is...clunky and doesn't lead to easily distinct builds/playstyles as easily as the older systems did until you're MUCH higher level.   The story is also a bit...stale...on later playthroughs.  Lack of options in story choice lead you to feeling badly railroaded the second (and more) time through.  Even though the railroad was present, you still had a lot of choices and the ability to shortcut or even completely de-rail "parts" of the story in the older games.  
---
All in all, I actually like FO4 and FONV better.  It's still a fun game, and if all my IRL friends played it too it would be even MORE fun....but I don't mesh well with strangers and its a tough game to meet people in and form any kind of lasting friendships.
---
A well organized team in NW is pretty much a guaranteed win.
---
The crafting interface is just one aspect of the game that needs a major QoL overhaul.
---
I agree that if I have 45 glowing meat I should be able to craft all 45 steaks at once.
---
Both Skyrim and Fallout 4 had armor stands/displays, so why is Fallout 76 missing out?
---
It's the best armor in every stat in the entire game that puts everything else prior to shame; not to say your luck doesn't suck but it should be incredibly difficult to craft good pieces to balance out how overpowered it truly is.
---
Any idea why sometimes the scorched spawn scattered behind the fence, and other times they fall from the sky as a large group right in front of the turret?
---
I mean... why? They‚Äôre adding new stuff that‚Äôs different from other weapons... a gauss minigun was brand new and did something no other heavy weapon did as default, it had explosive bullets. Same with the shotgun and pistol, and those 2 had a brand new feature for shotguns and pistols, having to charge up the shot. The plasma caster was basically a Gatling gun but with different damage types.
---
For rifles, we already have the handmade, combat rifle, fixer, assault rifle, pipe rifle, and more. The fixer was unique in that it had a special effect. There‚Äôs no reason to add another rifle to the game, all the ones I mentioned above are already pretty similar. If they do it should just be a skin like the new handmade skin a while back
---
if by "get some friend's help" you mean use them to transfer it to your main character, you cant. rewards tied to bullion cant be traded.
---
Yeah specially the ammo converter is a huge dick in the ass.
---
Wait WHAT. I didn‚Äôt know bows had fun mods
---
I installed the brewing stations in my workshop for the sole purpose of producing as much nukashine as possible to spike ppl with.
---
Use one of the crappy 40mm grande launchers they drop and you‚Äôll hit the entire group at once
---
Everytime I go into the parking area because the Whitesprings resort, everytime.

The plasma caster was from New Vegas.
---
[This](https://fed76.info/pricing/) is a decent site for getting a feel for what‚Äôs valuable and what‚Äôs not. The prices quoted are for PC, and can vary from the current market demand, but they‚Äôve updated it recently. 
---
Furious or Vampire‚Äôs are both good on high RoF weapons. It combines well with Faster Fire Rate, or course. Reduced Weight is always nice, but Faster Reload is handy too. 
---
And of course, Bloodied and Junkie‚Äôs are also solid prefixes for those builds as well.
---
The Super Duper perk says "But I rely on button presses per craft".
---
I wait until 2 minutes just in case people want to show, but I kinda hope they don‚Äôt. Crazy exp on your own and I got 11 legendaries on my last run

---
no need for emotes if you can type anything out. Seriously this needs to be in the game
---
i just want the damage reduction while standing still/moving...i had some poopy armor with those stacked and its.....kinda op ngl
---
I hate them, and I hate you.
---
Plasma caster is from New Vegas.
---
Been having this happen more here as well
---
Always makes me laugh when people mention or ask about being "the only one."
---
Of course you're not. Not even close.
---
XD fair enough
---
Only time I ever try to pvp is when it‚Äôs revenge. Some dude kept killing all the legendaries at uranium fever so I turned off pacifist and attacked him with my .50 cal so he thought I was easy, and then let him kill me. Next, I got my legacy Gatling plasma out of the stash and then initiated PvP again, then I fucked him up with it and he was acting all surprised.
---
After that I joined his team and started sharing the perk that makes your rads go away in the daytime (he was a bloodied build), and watched as he frantically started using glowing blood or whatever it was to get his rads back and eventually giving up, just staying at full health
---
Copied this from a old comment I found.
---
The math doesn't hold if you change the base hit chance: 70x.33=23.1 as an example.
---
I dont think 40% can be set in stone because Scopes and Perception both change the hit chance in VATs. Even if 40% is the max you can possibly get assuming scopes, perception, etc. if still falls short if you go under 40%
---
20%x.33=6.6 30%x.33=9.9
---
But if that is true, I don't get the logic behind the way they are advertising it. +33% should be 40+33=73.
---
What the pip boy really really needs is to show some base stats like literally every other game out there. Having to decipher everything is getting to be quite frustrating.
---
I'm pretty sure it just doesn't show the +33 on the vats since you would eventually get over 100% chance just like the stalkers mod
---
Not at the moment as I‚Äôm still trying to move all my 5.56 first but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll sell/trade it eventually as I don‚Äôt personally collect any outfits being a full time PA user
---
Haha that's creative
---
X01 and t51 is a tomato/tomato thing and both are good choices. One has slightly better physical dr and the other has slightly better rad resist but again, with diminishing returns you dont really notice the difference unless you live in rad zones or something.  And even then it just means you pop radaway one or two time less every 20 mins or so.
---
I'm like you though t51 has been my favorite appearance for a while now though the x01 is a close second.  T60 works just fine too if you like that purist BoS look.  Really wanted something new but 7250 GB in retrospect could have been better used in the short term and the T65 should have been a more long term goal lol
---
Kidding aside, it‚Äôs like old Diablo to me. Gonna do a lot of runs. And when it‚Äôs troubleshooter 3*, push on
---
I just turned level 30! I found a gatling plasma forever ago and I'm ready to go to town.  I still don't understand all the perks in 76 but in 4 I went all into Fusion core duration and had a charging gatling laser. Only thing to use when mowing down all of nuka world lol
---
Add in a few nuka grenades and an orbital strike beacon :)
---
Ghouls brains have deteriorated enough that it‚Äôs brain doesn‚Äôt care about damaging its own mussels. Ie your brain stops yourself from pushing your body to its limits unless it‚Äôs truly life or death

I chose the back pack to match play style. My tank/ Melee has two, fridge for flux and armored for combat. High strength and armor that has multiple deep pockets. So no need for large capacity backpack.
---
My gunslinger also has fridge, but also large capacity. My armor is configure for vats. Light weight.
---
Red Rocket MegaStop. Underrated locale for car 'splosions.

What does that have to do with anything? It‚Äôs also in fallout 76

Chances are your character is already a synth!
---
My play time will be very limited today and probably tomorrow.  When I quit last night my stash was at 800 lbs, my character was within about 5 pounds of being overweight, I'm literally at 30k caps and 1k script.  I didn't gain caps or script for the last two hours I played last night because I was already at max.  Most of the weight on my character and stash is legendary weapons.
---
Gonna log on just long enough to complete the SCORE challenges and I'm going to have to quit.  I'm at max rep with both factions and have over 300 treasury notes so there isn't a reason to grind for either of those things.
---
Nowhere.
---
Seriously, please stop encouraging/enabling them to nickel&amp;dime us for every single feature that should not even be an extra in the first place. (They're doing too well with that on their own already.)
---
For my main caps revenue source in the game ‚Äî making &amp; selling mutation serums ‚Äî I regularly (weekly) nuke-and-farm Morgantown solo, on a private server.
---
Morgantown has tons and tons of ghouls and scorched who, post-nuke, will drop stable flux components, and also tons and tons of raw flux, including cobalt flux that you can't find at all after an SBQ nuke, and only in small quantities after a Whitesprings nuke. 
---
White the nuke zone is up, I also run the airport cargo drop and the Officer Steelheart quest to generate even more enemies ‚Äî Steelheart stays level 14 or so, but the enemies can be level 70 charred ghouls, so the newbie event suddenly becomes very hard to solo no matter one's level, as is Mamma Dolce's.
---
Morgantown should be nuked regularly.
---
If we go by the instanced housing in ESO, the budget for the largest tier of houses is around 700 objects. Which seems high, but depending on how much manual building you do vs using prefabs, or how many decorative objects you like to use, never lasts as much as you'd like. 
---
Curious to see if they'll add some kind of tiers of camps too, in ESO you can buy from a teeny tiny single room just to crash in to sprawling mansions so big you don't even know what to do with.
---
The real trick is to convince your friend there's something super cool "just right over there".  Then, boom.  It doesn't kill anyone btw.
---
More often than not we load into Whitesprings and shoot every car we see because it's just a lot of fun.
---
I want that Fusion Generator.
---
It‚Äôs very useful. Honestly, I did several runs where I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd have even made it to the Divide without my flares, those tunnelers are something else.
---
I sold mine for 6k the other day
---
Absolutely NEED
---
You can't buy or sell Secret Service armor.
---
Troubleshooters is godly for silos, Encryptid event, and for AWOL armaments when you get the huge waves of gutsies.  It's really the only bane armor worth a damn imho.
---
Matching sets look like they are going to become a bigger thing come legendary perks and beyond but I think they just have to be all heavy or all light etc not the same type unless cosmetics are important to you.  Also looks like fully matching pa sets will be a big deal too.
---
I'm honestly more concerned by the fact that it's so easy for a lv10 player to run into lv62 enemies...
---
There are some niche uses for a few that's for sure lol
---
You buy the plans from the raider and settler non bullion vendors. (Can't remember their names offhand)
---
That happened to me once and I was so confused! Eventually we all just turned away from the outside land and just focused on the generator as they just fell from the sky.
---
Man, I'm really gonna need to replay it now, thanks for the heads up
---
Yes. This takes top priority and if we had it, might avoid the need for a middle finger emote.
---
I don't personally blow up cars on purpose but the two guys I play online with do lol its how I know where they're at in Whitesprings. I just follow the explosions üòÑü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
This game SUCKS at actually explaining things and how it‚Äôs all supposed to work. That being said I love it. But yea I am level 120 and still figuring out things.
---
Yeah, that was one of my first "selfmade" tactics too....... and then all players voted for Flatwoods!   :)
---
troubleshooters is your friend..
---
Didn't work for me. I reached that level and claimed the gold on an alt who hadn't done the vault raid and I have yet to get a single one. I just did the vault raid today so I could start earning them. Must be a temperamental bug.
---
Heavy Combat Armour plans are purchasable from Vendors once your high enough level I understand, however you can get Heavy Leather Plans at any level a Responder Vendor.
---
DR Wise, For limbs, Heavy Leather (at Max Level) can get to 32/77 with the Studded Mod, Heavy Combat with the BoS mod is 35/45.
---
However you can not make Legendary Combat armour.
---
I haven't seem him around lately, but the last time he got me he said, "You have a face only a mother could love, but your whole family died in the great war."
---
You yeeted that thing ! Loved the little "bye bye" at the end.
---
Just be glad you weren't there when the assaultron dominator spawns..
---
I knew a guy like you in college.
---
Bunker and chainlink fence for me!
---
Don't want to ruin it for you, but.. they probably were helping themselves xD It's a good event for a lot of  exp and it's hard not to tag a scorchbeast, especially a legendary one. But it's good it worked out in the end for everyone üôÇ
---
Was hoping someone would post this.   Nice.
---
Toss a few mines out there like dominoes in areas with lots of cars.  Get all of them in one go!  :)
---
Do you get a Windows Blue Screen?
---
Pretty common knowledge.. But i took some pictures for you. Comparing 2 radium rifles, one with 33% vats hit and one without. No movement between pictures.
---
https://imgur.com/a/K3qo91I
---
25% becomes 33%, the difference? Exactly 33%. All effects in this game are multiplicative, not additive.
---
If you still don't believe it, it's easy enough for you to test :)
---
WE NEED TEXT CHAT FFS !!!!!!
---
IT'S A SIMPLE FUKING MMO REQUIREMENT
---
EVERY FUKIN MMO HAS IT!!! EVEN FUKIN MOBILE MMOS !!!!!!
---
seriously why is bethesda like this??
---
Yes. 
---
Values are as follows:
---
Chest: DR 41/ER 41 (Lvl30)
---
Left Arm: DR 19/ER 23 (Lvl20)
---
Right Arm: DR 19/ER 23 (Lvl20)
---
Left Leg: DR 19/ER 23 (Lvl20)
---
I have a Lvl20 Painted Metal Right Leg, with the stats as DR 17 and ER 3.
---
I went to Whitesprings as a low level once.   Yikes!
---
The Sunny's at foundation near the gold bar vendor sells the plans iirc
---
Thanks, I'll try that.
---
YEEEAAAAA
---
You mentioned it with the gauss weapons, which are new and the caster isn't.  And 5he B.A.R. is from Vegas. So what's the difference?
---
i'm a level 20 and never heard of nuka shine, so much for being suprised now. not your fault though.
---
Yay more items I can't place in my camp because of the budget.
---
I‚Äôd definitely enjoy the not interested emote. I generally keep to myself, so if someone is following me trying to get my attention, it‚Äôd be nice to have that shorthand of ‚Äúleave me alone and just enjoy the bonus xp from my building team‚Äù.
---
I know, but they tried their best to keep me alive as well, gave me some stims and stuff too, which is why I thought they were helping.
---
Nice. lol yeah I‚Äôve noticed ppl now actually try and share the legendaries. Before when it was whoever could find it first would suck. Almost every uranium fever event lately everyone will makes sure we all get tags only last event I didn‚Äôt get the last one I‚Äôm guessing someone one shorted it when they showed up at end of event. But this story is funny
---
Ah, a man of culture. Also the back parking lot at the Whitesprings never escapes my wrath if I happen to pass by.
---
What is ATX?
---
Tried this, but it didn't work.
---
Yea, the other set doesn't even look polished. Pretty disappointed in these ones overall. Much meh
---
Oh, most likely they just joined the event and then saw your level and started helping you :p
---
Nope...best place is valley galleria chain reaction is so Fn amazing. Same happens in areas of Whitesprimg but Damn. You are screwed if you heart a friendly Robot.
---
There's a LOT of different guns they could add to this game, for variety's sake alone.  Good luck balancing them AND making them feel unique though.  
---
Personally I'd like to see more varieties of "Crew Served" weapons.  Specifically for camps.  Turrets are great but I want to setup a BUNKER.  Gimme a placement like the defensive sandbag walls....that comes with a mounted MG that you can jump into like any other "manned turret", has a 120degree field of fire on it and acts as an unlimited ammo turret.  
---
IMO that would be an awesome thing to add to a quick-blueprint camp.  Would also be nice if they ever give us a "Defend against waves of enemies" mode.  Create Chokepoints and add auto-turrets to back you up.
---
Holy fuck guys get a mic
---
Only bulk what makes sense to!
---
bugged (obviously)
---
from now on use a workshop to do these challenges even when it's "fixed"
---
Either way, it worked out and I'm happy :D
---
Supposedly the ammo converter will get a bulk option in the near future.
---
The plasma caster brought something new to the table, it was the only heavy weapon dealing ballistic and energy weapon damage (unless you mod the gauss minigun) and it has certain mods that make it unique, like the fusion core draining mod. We already have like 5-6 assault rifles in the game that are already similar to eachother, there‚Äôs no need to make a brand new one
---
This isn‚Äôt a secret but I‚Äôve been using this strat for awhile, never seen anyone else river wookieing
---
I don't see stairs
---
I have the exact same thing out in front of my camp now and cannot remove them. They are next to a tree in the mire region. It's pretty frustrating. Especially with my camp budget almost full.
---
Careful hurt a friendly Robot and they ALL turn on you.
---
They get to do a teleportation dice roll to a random location. 
---
It helps a noob find new fast travel locations.
---
I got lucky with my junk, decided to sell 30 stable violet flux and most people say sell for 50-100 caps each. I thought na il try my look at 300 each and pop they all get snapped up within a hour and I'm 9k caps up haha
---
everytime the game loads a new asset it crashes.  open eyes in bed, crash, next time it opens character creation, crash, finish character walk up to terminal, crash, open door to next room, crash, grab pipboy, crash.  It got old real fast.  And having to recreate my character everytime was fun.
---
Ok, thanks man. Sorry for the spam like I say, I'm just confused as all hell. I do appreciate the help.
---
Not for your type.
---
Why do other players need tension created for them by other players?
---
I use traveling pharmacy, junk rat, batteries included, and through hiker, all at max level.  Yeah, that's 12 perk points.  It's also several hundred pounds.  I use excavator with calibrated shocks, max strength, and pepperoni rolls or brahmin steak with carnivore for extra carry weight.
---
I hear ya there! On one hand it can be certainly frustrating, on the other hand it can be fun trying to reverse engineer and test things to discover how they truely work. 
---
A number of things are real wonky in this game and sometimes you can discover really interesting interactions!
---
I don't loot anything I kill anymore tbh
---
u/mrsblokeymon - one for you, y'crazy bitch. üòÖ
---
Same here.  
---
I'd claimed 2 different bullion awards on 2 different characters and the newer one didn't start getting treasury notes until after Vault 79.
---
Just like a crack head
---
Not really, guns basically out them all out of a job. Guns were more effective and could be taught to be used in weeks, making Samurai useless.
---
Trust me, if I can manage to build or find the plans for the calibrated shocks on my T-51, I'm going back to it. It tanks way more ballistic damage than the X-01 does in my opinion (gutsy guns jack me up) which is why I used it in the silo. I dislike the turtle look of the X-01 so I use skins with it (I'm a sucker for PA paints)
---
I agree but some people use party chat
---
Mobs try not to spawn ‚Äúin sight‚Äù of people. If you notice, when they all spawn in a group, someone has put their Tent in a certain spot on the road. That counts as ‚Äúin sight‚Äù of all their spawn points, so it messes up and dumps them all elsewhere.
---
No, goes full black and reboots
---
Have you guys noticed that he gets out of bed weird?
---
I have had the good fortune to have blown up things for real and, while not obsessed with it, I find it extremely satisfying to blow stuff up in all the Fallout games. Valley Galleria, White Spring, and especially any trucks I can find.
---
Oh had it on my secondary character, I missed and put a floor in the wrong place and this bug didn't let me to remove it.. same happened to me on my primary character when I was moving and rebuilding my camp. I got lucky that I could just move camp and those structures were added in stored as a blueprint where I could destroy those walls all together. If you're not planning on moving then maybe you could create a blueprint of those structures, store and then dismember? I mean you can try.
---
It's a good idea, but it's imemented awfully. Can never have too much ammo, but you can always have too much of the wrong kind...
---
I‚Äôm not a lightwieght player, but here‚Äôs a few tings you can try to make overencumbered life better- 
---
Actionboy/girl3 for faster AP regen.  One of the PA arm mods also gives faster AP regen.
---
Out of PA, a piece of armor for fast AP regen.  All Deep pocketed WR armor, high capacity backpack.
---
Excavator with calibrated shocks.  You can Carry just over 1800# (don‚Äôt ask)
---
If you are a gunner, the bandolier perk, and ammo WR armor.
---
As far as Trying to keep it under control:
---
Mats are easy to come by - no need to pick up everthing you see, unless your goal is raising caps and you intend to sell it all at the closest bot vendor.
---
scrap, bulk, and sell.
---
You really only need to carry a few weapons. 
---
fusion cores are heavy, and easy to get if you know where to look (not taking power plants). Get batteries included perk to reduce their weight. If you have power user perk, a 50% charged core can last 6+ hours (real time).
---
compulsive enemy body looter?  You really dont need 200 each stimpacks, radx, radaway, and the diluted versions thereof.  Sell them.
---
check your ammo tab.  How many missles and mini nukes are you carrying? (Without the corresponding weapon). What other ammo are you carrying for which you do not have a weapon? 
---
With a few exceptions (steel, acid, lead, screws, gears), you likely do not need more than 50 of any given material.  Bulk and sell.
---
Cummulatively, all those plans you know get heavy.  Sell off the ones you have 15 copies of...
---
foods like radstag steak ? temp provide +20 carry.
---
From my limited 'testing' ie. me messing about with vats - nothing formal as such, and this was a while ago (pre-wastelanders) - I think this is correct (and it works the same way as the stalkers prefix).
---
With regard to sub 10% hits - I believe this is actually a vats 'bug' (again just my experience - no formal testing). If you vats and fire quickly (but not too quick) then you'll hit some silly low % shots + you can often shoot through walls etc. which is just funny - there is a cockroach \*inside\* the house next to the lighthouse which I often shoot when going to the mothman event.
---
It doesn't appear to be on their radar.  I went to the official forums where they have a list of known issues, and when it was finally updated, this issue didn't make the cut.
---
I'm trying to roll an unyielding left leg... I checked my stash box and I'm up to 7 vanguard left legs
---
Ofcourse we sould not have to ask for extra budget. But im at the point right now that i really am willing to pay for those extra items/budget. But i get you tho.
---
The little cha-ching after every press is just salt in the wound.
---
One of us! One of us!
---
Blowing up cars is my jam.
---
Dude seriously just play the game and count. It takes me over 105k to level up. If it were as easy as lvl 100(15k) i'd level up every 5 minutes counted.
---
Now YOU prove me wrong.
---
The engine is horrible for PVP. You also have little to gain by PVP. This isn‚Äôt a full loot survival game. It‚Äôs clearly a PVE game with some multiplayer mixed in.
---
Oh.  You can just flat out buy all the t51 (t60 and t45 too) plans from either of the BoS vendors.  Theres a generic one at the whitespring mall and Phoenix sells them down in watoga.
---
I did almost all the damage while other higher levels than me did nothing I don‚Äôt get your point
---
Is it happening with other games too? Especially one that tax the system like Fallout?
---
Data mining lingo for items coming to the atom shop, or at least tagged as such.  They don‚Äôt 100% of the time make it.
---
Cant stop
---
Meh.  My guess those were alts.  Running silo in ur mid 20-40 is EZ if u know what ur doing.  
---
I ran a silo in my mid 30‚Äôs with no issues.
---
Someone already did. The other day I seen power up the ammo factory at Tyler county Fairgrounds 23/33. Seen stairs that had been half underground so I figured someone made an underground farm and got crashed LOL.
---
If we‚Äôre making requests, a ‚Äúderp‚Äù emote would be equally useful for the people who stagger SBQ while in the air. I do at least 3 battles a day and end up trying to draw her away from the pack just so she‚Äôll finally land.
---
My first shine dropped me off at the mothman camp with the 3 catapults.
---
And a lvl62 legendary patrolling below, trapping me, a level 30 up top.
---
I was encumbered, had to drop a lot of stuff in order to escape.
---
Lol what the eff?
---
A regular laser weapon modded with a prime receiver is best.
---
No, but to be fair 76 is my most modern game. I do music production and haven‚Äôt had any problems there, where my cpu is often running at 75% +
---
No problem man. I can respect that!
---
One of my greatest joys. Had someone do the same in my camp turned around and gave me the confused emote. Enjoy your trip brave soul.
---
Love it
---
If you want your post to be noticed using click bait titles isn‚Äôt the way.
---
I had to replace my camp, deleted the blueprint. It was alright because it was time for something new, I was pissed off at first lol. As the previous post said, if you need to build floors and walls claim a workshop that's what I do.
---
Your camp ally should be able to carry more as well
---
It would be great if it was a super mutant that took meat for exchange for your items... on second thought just make it Grahm.
---
Yeah that's essentially where I see the problem as well we need something that adjusts the damage for PvP to be in line with Health numbers if they want to keep that huge HP disparity between players and PvE enemys. And I can also agree with your sentiment at the end, thus the idea earlier of removing PvP from adventure and making Workshops cooperative instead of competitive.
---
My main reason to make this post was just that the bad PvP balancing has been detracting from my adventure experience recently despite passive mode.
---
&gt;But at least Bethesda are actively trying to improve their game, and same with NMS and Anthem.
---
Don't try to put 76 and Anthem (especially Anthem) on the same level of NMS.
---
That game's turnaround was legendary, with maybe only FFXIV pulling off a similar feat.  All while being done by a studio with a fraction of the resources at EA and Bethesda's disposal, and no design decisions that belong in mobile games.
---
Oh yea it can be done, I just didn‚Äôt see why put in all the efforts for no gain, if it was all on purpose and well coordinated.
---
If there's any part of the ground that dips lower down, try joining foundations over to it so that you get a foundation that's a bit higher above the terrain but still part of that structure.   
---
You should then be able to scrap the ones that are currently stuck.   
---
That's how I fixed it when it happened to me.   
---
The game seems to think the foundations close to the ground are actually floating *under* the ground, so they act like they're the only thing holding each other up. Having one slightly higher above the terrain gives the stucture an anchor point for you to work from.
---
I mean, the low levels obviously didn‚Äôt launch the nukes. No way 2 nukes does anything different as well, just seems cool to watch.
---
I play nukashine roulette. I put all spare nuka cola on that fridge. Sometimes your chance of getting nukashine is 10%, sometimes much more. I love coming back to my camp and checking what‚Äôs left in the inventory.
---
Is that a small TNT Dome? Are we getting new domes opened?
---
Yup, u/seafog here was one of those that caught the problem early and even in the face of being told it didn‚Äôt exist, continued to gather data and push; only a few of us did this, and getting validation from the data miners was a sweet victory for all involved.
---
If listing high junk numbers attract more buyers, do you think I'll get more traffic putting junk in individually rather than bulked ? Or does it account for the bulked amounts on the map ?
---
I have several stairs and floors doing the same. And the stairs are going up into the sky. Only way I know to get rid of it is by replacing your camp somewhere else. 
---
Pain in the ass but that's the only way I know of.
---
its just RNG
---
I‚Äôm not sure but I usually get 2-3 per scorched earth event.  They will show up with the event rewards pop ups on the screen when the event completes.  How many events have you done that you you did not receive any?
---
Trick or Treat takes about a minute. Anytime I‚Äôm near a dead SB I check to see if it‚Äôs got DNA for Heart of the Enemy. I try to maintain a stash of bug parts so I can regularly do Stings and Thins, and grab Dolly Sods while I‚Äôm there.
---
Always Death, Radiation Rumble, Line and Guided, for xp, now that I‚Äôm leveling daily.
---
I go to Camden every three days or so, to do them all at once.
---
Davenport, Ward and the Raider quest.
---
Where you the Guy in Yellow Powerarmour that I Killt recently at the Super Red Rocket? I use a explosive Gatling, so you never now. When yes, im sorry, but Playing as a raider I must do it.
---
Eh.  This is what I do, but there have been times I've run out of bullets and it's been hard to get rolling again.
---
&gt; I don't have all of the math, but damage reduction seems to cap out at around 90%.
---
&gt;Sentinel / Cavalier &amp; the creature-specific damage reduction pieces (Zealot, TS, Mutant Slayer, etc), cap out at 75% damage reduction,
---
This is interesting, this would mean that they have actually changed the formula from Fallout 4, since in that game there wasn‚Äôt any actual limit.  You could go in to the files and give your wedding ring and vault suit sentinels and never take damage if you have a full set.  
---
&gt; You also have to add in various attacks which ignore armor entirely (or have a fairly high anti-armor effect, like the Col. Gutsy's).
---
Or that little level 4 turret outside of westek.  With the number of bugs in this game I can never tell if it‚Äôs intentional or not. 
---
Same, I‚Äôve have full sets of each monster specific gear, and I always took *some* damage, though usually minimal.  I was just trying to figure out a way to calculate the ‚ÄúBest‚Äù armor type and effects. 
---
For example, Robot Armor has radiation resistance built in.  Would a set of Ghoul Slayer Robot Armor with the +25 Radiation Resistance and +25 Poison Resistance be the best options vs. Ghouls.  If Damage reduction is capped at 90%, and then blocker level 1 is all you need to get to the 90% (75% from full set +15% from blocker).  No point in sentinels on your gear.  Since you can‚Äôt go above 90% anyways. 
---
Basically trying to min max, this set would let me farm Whitesprings, Charleston Capital Building, Fort Defiance, and the Burrows and be super tanky.
---
&gt; Chest: DR 41/ER 41 (Lvl30)
---
Okay, that will be Heavy on the belief that there is no Resistance mod applied to it. Heavy is 51/51 at Level 40 and 61/61 at Level 50. That 61/61 because 86/86 with the BoS resistance mod. Which makes Hvy Combat the best TORSO piece, if you don't have access to Secret Service Armour
---
&gt; Left Arm: DR 19/ER 23 (Lvl20)
---
&gt; Right Arm: DR 19/ER 23 (Lvl20)
---
&gt; Left Leg: DR 19/ER 23 (Lvl20)
---
Okay, these number also suggest that they are Heavy (11/11 base before resistance mods) - A good why of checking for the arms (Which in turn will confirm the legs as limbs all have the same resistances) - Is to look at your character in 3rd person without an outfit on, If you have big ridiculous ball like shoulder pads (Pauldrons) then it's heavy, if you don't  that and they look kind of normal, then it's Sturdy (Base 8/8 before resistance) with those stats, there is no way they can be light.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_armor_and_clothing
---
Though you will have to scroll WAY down for the armour section.
---
guess it‚Äôs time for a ‚Äúpls give mannequins‚Äù post again
---
I do, gained 10 levels from 200 with just one event (Line in the Sand) with no difference in EXP requirements during double XP event.
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand that 15k is still a lot on a regular day even with min maxing EXP gains (buffs, unyielding, mutations, etc.).
---
So no, level up every 5 minutes is definitely not something you can do unless it‚Äôs double XP week AND in a farm zone/event.
---
Since you don‚Äôt have proof, your statement regarding the wiki stats is invalid. There are tons of streamers, videos, and stats in the wiki that prove mine.
---
PS4 here too. A few days ago I had a couple of BSoD's caused by NW, within an hour of each other. None before, and none since.
---
whats funny event for you? line in the sand spawns behind the fence where 1 guy on the rock deletes all the waves? not much of a difference, but spawning near generator has much higher chance for everyone to gain exp from them
---
Oh yes, love it even more when joined by the manwife and I blow up the car he's stood by.
---
Why internal? Doesn't that require some mildly intrusive installation? If internal, would a Samsung EVO 860 work?
---
&gt;this land is your land
---
I would prefer DMB  "Don't Drink The Water" / "This Land Is Your Land" but it doesn't fit  the Fallout style !  :)
---
Yup free fast travel. Will it out you hear, there or anywhere? Who knows? Just black out and do some wondering!
---
Those curtains are a slap for anyone who bought them already. The exact red but refined.....like buying a tv and the shop in front of yours just now has a new super deal for the same tv.
---
I was stunned when I started FO76 and realized they had gun racks but not mannequins.
---
Try building a whole new collectron and then using the terminal. Sometimes if I build one in a workshop it wont work properly. Hopefully that works because I have no other ideas...
---
I know, I mostly don't wanna spend the caps for the plan but I may have to. I also don't have the flux to make them so I'll have to grind a few SBQ fights, small price to pay though
---
Yes they still use t51 b
---
"running away from a lv62 bloated one at level 10" ... those beasts sprinting at you is not the problem here ;) 
---
as already said: those are NOT undead. they are MUTANTS. their mind reduced to aggression only, their body powered by radiation induced strength and speed. 
---
THEY are one of the reasons being stealty and moving with foresight is close to mandatory in the wasteland.
---
The definition of a griefer can fit more than one thing.
---
it gets worse when you know that past fallout ghouls have all been normal human being speeds that are either weak but swarming or semi durable but hard hitters (heres looking at you fallout 3 reaver) but in none of the fallouts before 4 did any ghoul i repeat ANY ghoul either feral or non-feral gain super sonic fucking speeds, if anything the fastest ghouls moved in any other fallout games was about 15% faster than your base run speed and they didnt neo-dodge either.
---
fallout 4 decided to "spice things up" by making them super fast swarm rapists but in the process ended up jacking up their default run speed as well not just their sprint speed resulting in these breakneck speed freaks that break any form of immersion and past lore that was already established.
---
they were fast sure but not as fast as the flash.
---
I was not but I am curious now, what is your incentive for doing it? Is it just that you rp as a raider and want to kill people who have absolutely no interest in fighting you?
---
Like I would be fine with giving up the red rocket if they just asked in voice or let me walk away, as I only use it as a fast travel point so it's no big deal if I don't happen to be low on aluminium but they just insta-kill me if I happen to be close making me loose 50 additional caps for nothing as I neither have a way to fight back nor any motivation to do so.
---
Ghouls getting that terrifying super speed was one of the best changes from FO4. They used to be a joke in previous games, which didn't match at all with the stories of how deadly they're supposed to be in this canon. 
---
Now they're actually a threat, move at the speed of light, hit like a truck, irradiate you to hell, come in numbers and _will_ wreck your shit if you're careless, which is exactly how dangerous they should be.
---
Individual scraps would look like a LOT more, so yeah, it'd attract visitors.   
---
It would mean you have to sell them at prices rounded to whole caps, though. For example a bulk of 10 sold for 25 caps is 2.5 per item, but individually you have to choose whether it's 2 or 3. Probably not really a problem, but it's the sort of thing that bugs me, personally.   
---
Also, listing the items individually sounds like something they'd teach in the Bethesda school of marketing. Make it *look* like you've got more than you actually have.   
---
I'd go with the bulk, but that's just me.
---
Haha, wasn't sure if it was reaching too much, glad you got the reference :)
---
When you're unyielding,33% is useless as you're already at that level of accuracy.
---
I personally don't even like faster fire rate. I go for better critical as second,which helps quite a lot when you crit the queen every other shot.
---
Only half way. Too long!
---
Nice. This is why I keep my punch bowel on top of the Stash box in my vending area.
---
All done shopping? Enjoy the ride!
---
It could still be them, since the nukes targeted directly the WS bunker. I‚Äôve seen people do near simultaneous nukes on WS, two groups of players each did their work not knowing what‚Äôs coming from the other group and ooops, could have used one elsewhere.
---
Per item, yes.
---
I put it in my punch bowl, need to reload that. also I‚Äôve had it from many punch bowls and cracks me up every time
---
Its not  hard just watch a video on how to change a ps4 hdd.. And I say internal Because external ssd's are limited by the usb speed so they dpnt get all the benefit. Internal is not limited by that factor.mines  samsung just make sure it's the right part by searching ssd for ps4. Cant remember what model mine is. I'm so glad I got it tho.
---
stop asking to be sold shit like this ffs
---
Also pretty sure that's not true. Using 2 bows for about 400 hours. If anything it could be 2 separate rolls. Your post also doesn't add up mathematically considering high hits
---
Ah.  Gotcha.  Are you on PS4?  I have every pa mod plan minus a few ultracite ones.  Just ask that you provide the legs themselves and the flux.
---
You could try running stress tests on memory, CPU, and graphics adapter to see if the problem can be reproduced. 
---
Maybe power supply is not enough to handle all components operating at max.
---
Could try re-installing/updating/going back GPU drivers too, if you haven't done already.
---
In all, FO can't directly cause your system to reboot but it can accelerate the condition for your system to do so.
---
I like when the Enclave has you call down the thunder on the Red Rocket truck stop. 
---
Big badda boom.
---
My friend can shred here so I get my damage then he shreds her. I don't care if people are mad 99%of the time I have to un bloodied and take all 3 pylons so if you don't want to help you don't get a reward
---
My friend if he sees a car it doesnt matter what we are doing has to run over to the car melee it and corpse launch himself
---
oh right good point didn't even notice him until you said it
---
 PvP causes a bit of aggro on the microphone and if this is an U18 game maybe that causes an issue and reporting.  COD is 18+ only so the abuse is tolerated LOL
---
i need that bunker
---
Damn...I'm level ten did I jump the gun? Was exploring at around level eight found that distillery at the frat house...woke up in a cabin across the map and found a weapon I can not use till level fifty, then fast traveled to 76...so that will happen every time I drink one?  
---
Wild...
---
Yeah I‚Äôm glad I read that tip on Reddit, there‚Äôs often a ‚Äúclaim a workshop‚Äù or ‚Äúdo an event‚Äù challenge as well so you can knock them out at the same time. I love coming across workshops that people have previously decorated for challenges so they look like surrealist art.
---
As an aside, when I‚Äôm claiming just for a challenge, I put the vault boy pointing decoration to try and make it clear ‚Äúyou can take this workshop from me‚Äù. Got that idea off here as well
---
Oh, and remember not to sell off all your materials if you plan on doing the [BOS event](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/19lD84ailufdG6cgVdqls2/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-fortifying-atlas-and-quakecon-details)

thank you

The Combat Rifle already vaguely looks like and operates just like the BAR. Let's make shure the The Fixer can't use our 600 Atom Skin!
---
Lol, I did a similar thing when I used to have like 60k presents. Evey few presents you'd have around 1-2 nukashine and I was so over weight from like 350 nuka
---
As someone that's spent a lot of time in the area IRL, you should definitely nuke it.
---
Probably players not trusting whether or not it‚Äôs The Shining. Lmao.
---
Lol ok Mr. Triggered. üôÑ Whatever floats your flimsy ass boat.
---
Well I am tending to use bulk on some and non-bulk on others, as I think marketing wise that could attract more players as well as have players buy some items at more specific prices like with the example you gave.
---
Everything i have told you are already proven facts by datamining, in game experience and considered common knowledge. If you do not believe them, fine. You do you :) Also, regarding the 33% vats hit effect.. Feel free to go out and test it yourself. It's really simple thing to test.
---
My favourite new spot, I only just discovered today after over 1000 hours of blowing up cars post wastelanders, is in the middle of whitesprings, theres a big traffic jam that goes back quite a ways and even splits off in 2 different directions. There are a few gaps between cars and a few non explodable cars, but with the right placement of a few nuke mines or blast mines, you can blow up the 2 busses at the front of the line and start a huge reaction that goes about 100 metres up the road.
---
I have 140 of them  how many do you have?
---
I used to have a camp on top of Seneca Rocks and had a great view of whenever Morgantown was being nuked
---
 https://imgur.com/X198xON
---
Sounds like a plan
---
Yeah I will probably try to keep stocked on those that are harder to come by for that but all the legendarys I can't scrip are getting heavy so I kind of need some space and it's also just good to get this info for the future.
---
Mine is right outside of the Vault, just south of the pathway.  My bunch bowel gets cleaned out regularly. Lots of new players unlocking some decent fast travel points haha.
---
Grahm for president 2020
---
this is why i only do the construction challenges at a work station. got tired fof random light not wanting to delete and me having to totally rebuild my camp to get rid of it
---
Righte
---
I am indeed on PS4, my friend stores my flux for us (fallout 1st) so I currently don't have any till she hops on later. You can add me if you want, my name is the same as it is on here.
---
Got a B2590 one on my tenth try, so getting the plasma caster is gonna be hell
---
I don‚Äôt use it unless I‚Äôm fighting the SBQ or in some high radiated area.
---
Secret service armor is great, especially with buttressed mods on them, the only problem is you are at the mercy of RNG to get what legendary effects you want.
---
You can put beverages for free in the pop coolers?
---
That's nice. I had a high lvl jerk completely clean up my vending machine (there was like 5 nukashines) today. I don't care who takes it but why be so greedy and take everything. Hope he got diarrhea for drinking so much xD
---
Yeah, it's stuff I've been requesting since some time before FO4 came out :P
---
Cars are a great tool if you're slightly underleveled like I was at Whitesprings and you found yourself fighting a 62 ghoul. Little level 25 me found a couple of legendaries just by shooting cars.
---
On Xbox, I don't play it that often, but do at least a few times a week, most common crash for me in NW is right before the game starts, after we have all selected our spawn point. I'm just stuck there, in loading.. forever...
---
Where's the data mining info? That's the thing tho I have been testing it for a long time.
---
Man you're so wrong I can't even help you. Come back in at least 400 levels and not double xp, and tell me again how you lvl up 10 times in one line in the sand lol.
---
Untill then i'm out. You're clearly adamant on your streamer theory,and I have no interest in changing that. Bye.
---
My husband makes fun of me that he can always tell I'm nearby in game by the sounds of cars exploding. Nothing is more satisfying than a nice chain reaction of one after another going up in smoke!
---
As I understand it, they are fences, not formal walls.
---
Nothing has been more entertaining than getting people to drink the NUKA shined punch bowl. Kinda felt bad for that level 3 tho but I gave him some beginner level stuff to get him started.
---
It may take a while to get but I'm willing to put the time/effort into grinding for the complete set, thanks for the info!
---
I have to blow up every car.. they look at me funny.
---
There were no reasons. All I did was appear.
---
Mmmm ice cold NUKA TRIP ü§©ü§©ü§©

---
Good on you for being able to change your mind, and publicly no less.  A lot of people just double down on their senseless hate, but you managed to find something you enjoyed again!
---
I always run into a huge wall talking to people about 76. The fame of hating it has spread too far too fast, and it's hard to convince people to even consider trying it despite having so much new (free) content. I never really disliked the game to begin with (got it at launch), but I can understand why others might, even still, it's solid and easily recommendable now.
---
No problem. I recommend as your are grinding now, use your scrip on legendary modules. That way you can have as many attempts as possible to get those amazing rolls.
---
Tell her to go auto 10mm and do guerrilla perks
---
If it bothers you enough then get the speed demon mutation.
---
Otherwise, as others have said, you've decided to go for a very specialised build, it would be OP if you weren't in serious trouble as soon as you get surrounded by these fast powerful enemies... AND you're doing this in an area you shouldn't expect to be able to survive as a Level 10.
---
Hmm
---
&gt;cannot remove item.  Part of the structure would be inaccessible
---
Ffs Just let us delete stuff bugthesda, most of this game is a mediocre asset flip and yet Fo4's building system did not even have this and everything about it worked better.
---
When the game was first announced I was very strongly "I'm never going to play this game" mainly because I am not, as a rule, a fan of online games.  I like doing my own thing without feeling pressured to do some event, or to PvP when that's not really my thing (still isn't).
---
And then the BETA started and I started watching Oxhorn as he livestreamed the game. Yes there were bugs, glitches, server crashes, quite frankly the thing was a mess, but, the one thing I noticed through all of that was that the game actually looked fun to play so near the end of the BETA period and in spite of my previous misgivings I ponied up the $59.95 and bought it. And yeah, as I said there were problems, server crashes at the most inopportune time (like near the end of my first Nuke Silo run, not fun).
---
What kept me coming back and still has me to this day is the exploration, the visuals. I still remember the first time I discovered the crashed space station (now The Crater) the picture I took still comes up every now and then in loading screens. Or watching a sunset from atop a monorail tower near Watoga.
---
More than once during my time in the game I've muttered to myself "What the hell is that?" when I'd come across some place undiscovered and then I'd go find out.
---
That's what I love about this game, the sense that something fun, fascinating or downright scary could be just over the next hill.
---
More like Bigbabyps1213
---
Orr.... you could go for a stealth power armor.
---
Dude kills it at limbo.
---
I tend to think so as well, I recently got only ghoul slayer weapons (I think around 5 before I jumped servers) from ‚Äúrandom‚Äù legendary drops.
---
-Hey boomer,I bet you a quantum you cannot do the bridge!
---
-watch and learn kid!
---
Gotta shoot em in the head.
---
If you are only getting treasury notes from the event reward it's because you didn't do enough damage.
---
Im not sure all of my perk cards would apply if I use PA.
---
Won't be home till tonight around 5:30 cst.  Stupid work always getting in the way lol Add me when you get the flux and I'll throw them on for you quick.  My psn is same as here too.
---
I can‚Äôt help myself.  Sometimes will get the angry emote from other players but come on, they know they‚Äôd be doing it if I hadn‚Äôt.
---
Ha! üòÇüòÇ
---
Oh that‚Äôs laid out much better. Ty
---
It definitely does. In my experience this is true as well. 
---
I‚Äôll get 5/5 90% reduction
---
Or similar to your situation
---
If first two weapons aren‚Äôt great then switch lobbies
---
For awhile my private lobby was giving me god roll Unyielding armors
---
Now with VATS being disabled for PVP (soft disable, all damage reduced to 0), you are forced to deal with the clunky gunplay. Too bad they didn't take the obvious route and reduce chance to hit.
---
I was about to say Skyrim had a ton..cannot be hard to do...
---
There's a bus near the resort entrance that is rigged with explosives; I like to run inside it and trigger everything and then jump out. It's fun.
---
The third outfit (with the yellow construction helmet) is deadass just a recolor of the Railroad Heavy Armored Coat. üëÄ
---
I mean it still looks good but lol, I hope they didn't think we weren't going to notice.
---
One should destroy cars in a preemptive defensive position, and also destroy cars when your enemies are sitting near them, in Nuclear Winter.
---
That is one of the most frustrating bugs to deal with, IMO. It's been going on for so long, I've lost hope it will ever be fixed.
---
I would say that with my pistol build experience armor piercing mags on the 10mm and going for vats crits can make the damage about as viable as possible. Also if your not a fan of bloodied build the I would say look into a junkies build or just a two shot explosive or furious explosive pistol
---
A lot of that stuff I can't agree with, but everyone has their reasons and they're not invalid.  Personally I haven't spent any money and find it reasonable progression-wise, my experience has been that it just depends on which perks you're grabbing at level-ups.
---
What system are you playing on?
---
If you want max damage build then pistol just isn‚Äôt right for you.  You must do sneak and lots of crit perks in luck category to make it viable.  You can turn it into a vats build but you will always be better than her. Always. 
---
I‚Äôm currently working on a 15 charisma/luck/agility build to use pistols for fun but I know it‚Äôs not going to be as good as my other toons. I‚Äôm doing it just for the fun.
---
Charisma for the teammates
---
Obvious OP did not ignore this bored player. Antagonist (?) of the story got them to whine on reddit. That's more satisfying than any kill.
---
I keep getting an auto complete for Cop a Squatter, even when I'm nowhere near the area. I'm not complaining, though!
---
There‚Äôs a trophy on PS4 and probably the other platforms called Ground Zero. Basically you have to be at the center of the nuke zone when the bomb detonates. Most people have it way before level 300 but it‚Äôs a possibility that player didn‚Äôt. Or they were afk and came back to find their character dead. I‚Äôve done that more times than I care to admit ü§£
---
I personally like revolvers more than pistols so that might not be a bad idea.She could get some additional damage from sneak attacks,but that‚Äôs about all I can think of.If she doesn‚Äôt want to run a bloodied build,she might want to try junkies?I haven‚Äôt tried any of those two,but I hear they are good.
---
Laser and plasma weapons can be made into pistols and thus benefit from pistol perks (or at least I think they do).So you might wanna look into that.I don‚Äôt think anything else works like this besides plasma/laser.As I stated earlier,your other option is revolvers.One handed guns are just underpowered so she can‚Äôt expect to perform like people playing with actually good weapons.But that doesn‚Äôt mean she is going to be weak.
---
Legendary farming at levels below 50 isn‚Äôt really a great idea,those weapons stop being as good once you level up some more.Your best bet would be running west tek together,if you can.Otherwise do events like radiation rumble,uranium fever or the horde events/leader of the pack.
---
Or sell it with the bos for 3000 cork!
---
Has he always had that gold paint job he looking snazzy

Sugar grove has a nice chain reaction

i have the high capacity so i get 120. i lose a bit energy and rad resistance but whatevs. i also carry 2 other backpacks i can swap to for diff situations.
---
Well compared to a handmade or lever, all other things being equal, they are weak. Sneak/covert operative/mister sandman  offers good multipliers.
---
Stick to the bushes until as close to the end as possible. If you have a good team, follow their lead if you're like me and suck at PvP.
---
I hate when I‚Äôm in my ghillie PA suit posing next to my ghillie C.A.M.P. in my ghillie photomode frame, but I don‚Äôt have a ghillie fusion core inserted. That little yellow circle on my back totally gives me away.

Aye. i was gonna make one with 'Go for it' on it. 
---
but i haven't yet
---
Thanks man! I'm not sure what 5:30 cst will be for me, I'm in the East Coast (Pennsylvania) but I can add you no problem. Do you want anything else for helping out?
---
Get the marsupial mutation and the related perks to prevent losing it.
---
Use terrain.
---
Find high ground or places where the AI would have a harder time getting to you.
---
If you want to just stay in one position and shoot constantly, you may want to go commando and/or shotgun
---
I prefer oatmeal raisin, so I'd be pleasantly surprised, but standard chocolate chip is still good, so I'm plenty happy with either.

Oatmeal chocolate chip, however, is an abomination.
---
He insulted my dead body the other day.
---
I would pay for a fast travel mat.
---
I just shoot him before he gets close. Normally I can see/hear him befor3 he gets close. Just take whatever is in his Inventory and leave
---
When they do the 'One Wasteland' patch that should eliminate the problem. Levels shouldn't matter as much so low level people won't get wrecked. It's both blessing and curse. Going to Whitespring below level 40 these days is nearly impossible because some high level always passes though and everything spawns to their level, leaving behind enemies in the 60-90 level range... Then someone level 20-30 comes by to do the Mistress of Mystery quest or visit the vendors and gets wrecked. That's why I wish Whitespring was an area that limits how high mobs can spawn to a reasonable one...
---
I tried going the pistol route before on an older character. You're getting to the point where the damage just can't keep up.   
---
Mid-late 30s I shifted over to shotguns.    
---
I hope somebody has some better suggestions for you, but I tried all sorts of stuff. Even spent a heap of caps learning plasma pistol mods. Pistols just lack the "oomph" in the later levels.
---
I'll add you but I'm in gmt so chance we cross paths is low
---
This is why a radroach and mirelurk hatchling can kill you instantly in PA.
---
They got that whole thing of the bombs dropping on Halloween so I can't see them not doing something
---
He said something about vault 76
---
Ok i will look into them instead. I know in F04 two shot guns rocked so i assumed the same here. I will look into a vats crit type of build for her. Is the armor piercing mag a legendary or a mod?
---
My absolute favorite thing to so. Every car i see must meet a fiery end. Been doing this in every fallout game i have ever owned.
---
Sorry for my ignorance in advance. Just curious how some of you fellas have Brotherhood and Responders next to your name. Is it a title granted by someone or by value of karma or something?
---
Yes.  Pay it forward the next time you get a chance to help someone else.  Even if it's not in game.
---
Nah its for their buttplugs
---
Good choice, and congratulation on your first nuke. I only have one myself, put it close to Crater (Crater was just outside zone) not a very good place for anything really... next time I‚Äôll nuke Morgantown I think.
---
Clearly it's the Brotherhood getting an early start on wiping out the Enclave in the area.
---
I think its more she feels like she struggles with enemies at or near our level more so then trying to out damage me so just making it more viable will work. I will take a look at the luck category.
---
I'm planning to get that high capacity mod too. I've completed a bunch of possum challenges already so it wont be long. What a huge quality of life improvement.
---
Either go Junkies/furious/anti armour auto 10mm.
---
Aim for adrenaline with gorilla and bloody mess...
---
Not going bloodied on the weaker weapons going to be a challenge XD agility better be maxed... And better get used to using vats to headshot...
---
Tenderizer would help a lil
---
I think it would be cool, because it would be the only automatic that uses .308 and is a rifle.
---
I guess I'm the only one who sat there and waited till there were no new players or camps around Morgantown before bombing it.
---
I can do that! I help whoever out however I can in or out of game
---
Good question! I am curious as well
---
My Pleasure, üñïüèΩsorry it‚Äôs not mine, I‚Äôm all out of fingers
---
If that fireplace is a secret door, that's a slap in the face to those who grinded for the one on the legendary run.
---
It was like that for me the first time. I was over encumbered with primo stuff to me the first time I did the quest. It teleported me into the middle of nowhere in toxic valley which I hadn't even been to. All my weapons were spent. I slowly punched things till I found a Melee weapon and, eventually a much need weapons bench. It was actually pretty fun. Would do again. Hand all my Caps to my wife and store all my gear except a bottle of nuka and, fight my way back to camp
---
It‚Äôs a mod I think it is the perforating mag to be specific However if she does go the auto pistol route I would say the stinging mag so she would have a bit more mag size and some armor piercing
---
Wait, you're bloody melee build and it took 100 swings!?
---
I mean. Everything changes once you hit rank 50. Game is tough until then. So maybe just wait it out? 
---
My main toon is level 358 now and I miss the good old days of struggling to kill enemies and feeling like survival was a challenge. 
---
So maybe she can just enjoy the struggle and be there to help you out for the time being. 
---
Not many people run pistol build so it‚Äôs exciting to try and get it to work.
---
Edit: vault 79 gold vendor has a gauss pistol. Maybe run through wastelanders and try that one out.
---
Sometimes server hops don't help either. I did some experimenting utilizing 4 characters and got similar items on all of them.
---
I can say I didn't get it until after level 200.
---
I remember fast traveling as close as possible to the nuke point and sprinting my ass off, jumping enemies, to get to ground zero and die. Fond memories.
---
I blow that whole place up every time.
---
You can change your user flair in the community menu.
---
Unfortunate a relic of the programming left over from a time when there was very little crafting in the game. Modders have run into the same problem, it's apparently just not easy/possible to choose a certain amount of crafting. Which is why a lot of bulk crafting works the same way as single crafting, you just make 10x or 100x times the amount at once. And how they apparently are 'fixing' the ammo converter.
---
They better be waiting on the art team to finish assets, because this shouldn't be taking so long
---
With those blades on its extremities?
---
Something is fundamentally broken then, maybe the hardware composition, the mods or something else on your side. Damn that sucks
---
I‚Äôve noticed I either get a bunch with the same main affix or random shit with 90% the same 2/3* affixed.  
---
I rolled melee other day and out of the 10 I got 7 with swing speed.  Nothing good of course but i see this a lot.  
---
Now I just wait.  If i get a 2 or more of bloodied or junkies drop on the server I‚Äôll go play with the purveyor.
---
They are adding the bunker. On the waves thing, I could see that happening when they add instance camps.
---
Tbh it's kinda hard to do it super fast without double XP but for starters you definitely want to finish top 10. The xp given out for all kills is weak. If your only goal is to level up, time to find some bush. It's not the most exciting way to play but you'll probably find yourself making it to the end almost every time. Also I started teaming up with a buddy during double XP recently and being able to communicate with even just one person helps out a ton
---
Along with some creative and innovative developers who want to interlope passed this game with sad end game content. Tired of the looking for junk and building aspect and the amount of money they are trying to make off virtual items it should be second on their agenda yet I feel it is their first for making back money they estimated on making penalizing the loyalist players to the games name ever more so. This game needs more action. Weapons as you say for damn sure and other weapons fixed.
---
Unarmed. That's likely an exaggeration still, I didn't actually count. Anything more than 2 swings now feels like too many.
---
Maybe about a month ago, I saw a triple nuking of Whitesprings as well.  All three nukes only about 5-10 seconds apart at most.  No idea what the point was, but a heck of a photo op, that's for sure.
---
Think it changed around the release of Wastelanders

I did a gunslinger guide a while back, that was geared towards revolvers. Shown here:

Auto 10mm pistols,with the right perks and attachments  costs like 1 ap a shot, and when primed and using  junkies, the 10mm I can drop a 2* legendary scorch beast with 1 mag of sneak headshot/crits before its life regenerates. It's pretty impressive.
---
As for which one is better? Its hard to say mainly because its subjective and your playstyle will change the answer. But fastest time to kill high life pool monsters is the auto 10mm pistol by a good margin, the heal ability due to fire rate is also nice along with being able to stay hidden to take less damage. For normal jobs the revolver usually one shots weak  spots like the head, and it crits for around 800 or so damage when not sneaking, so it hits pretty hard. 
---
**guns:**
---
- Junkie/explosive/faster reload western modded with aligned grip,aligned barrel, reflex sight and servere receiver. 
---
- vampire/explosive lower vats 10mm (on swap)
---
- Junkie 50 crit lower vats 10mm or junkie ffr lower vats moded with : aligned grip, long aligned barrel,swift mag, powerful/prime auto receiver  and supressor.
---
I go back and forth between autos and revolvers, depending on how a feel like playing. I always like to have a healing weapon on swap for emergencies. I tend to favor revolvers the majority of the time for normal running around the map. However if I want to farm scorch beasts are take on the imposter sheep sasquatch auto 10mm usually gets the nod. Just remeber always use vats,sneak, target the head, and hold down that crit button while firing in vats. Pistols lack high damage and armor pen so crital hits and vats is....well critcal to being successful with handguns.
---
If junkies isnt for you ,anti armor or furious is the next best thing.
---
Most of the melee weapons got a generic melee keyword that enables the proper legendary rolls.
---
The ones on the list did not receive the keywords.
---
Seems like dev was halfway through task, went to lunch and never came back.
---
Had this happen in a session before. It was +8 caps every three minutes on the dot. Did your experience have a frequency like that?
---
I got the "build 5 wall decorations" one, so just wrote the word "S C O R E" on the wall next to the workshop.
---
I think it most iterations, BOS quartermaster sells tech to BOS members.  I have never played the first two games, but I know this was the case in Fallout 3, New Vegas and Fallout 4. I those games, you could enlist and when you do you could buy stuff from the quartermaster.   I assume we will be able to join the BOS in this game, in which case it makes perfect sense to have the option of buying stuff with Bullion.  Technically you already had the option to join BOS using a terminal at Ft. Defiance.
---
It's not.  But should be fixed in tomorrow's patch (it's fixed in the Public Test Server).
---
I run a slinger. 
---
I main a western revolver with a 10mm backup for silence situations. I am bloodied, mostly bc pistols are not very meta and are lower damage. So I wanted to fo the most with it. 
---
A full health slinger will want 2 shot or anti armor for 10mm. Instigating wo7odnt be bad with a western as it can one shot pretty well post level 50. 
---
The 10mm main isnt going to kill in less shots. But you can make it very fast. 
---
Per another suggestion. She could also switch to guerilla and go auto 10mm. But be aware thar only a few pistols can be auto. 
---
If on xbox, I can provide some materials too.
---
Yes and yes
---
I would keep the stealth suit and try to use damage avoidance perk cards.
---
With the sheer number of missed opportunities in this game, its unlikely there's anything special for that. It would've been a cool idea to double up with the "kill a wendigo in a clown costume" and "kill the Nightstalker unarmed" to unlock a special weapon or something.
---
Me. All the time. Especially next to AFK people and friends in their pip boys. 
---
There is an Enclave event called ‚ÄúA real blast‚Äù is my favorite event hands down. Always fun seeing the whole town blow up and bodies of ghouls flying.

There's one vendor in the Whitespring mall area that sells exotic food recipes, I know that much.

Grahm also sells Chally Feed for Meat Week.

Oh good one hunny.

It'd be better if *"part of the stucture would be inaccessible"* was followed by *"do you want to just delete the whole thing?"*

Yeah, this is what I mean! Have us officially join the brotherhood, not just let us buy stuff as soon as they come.

Nice, but I got excited when I saw the concrete and thought "finally the concrete walls are getting added", but it looks like its just the interior of that bunker prefab.

Chemist or grocers is where it's at. Can get mod from settlers or Raiders.  Easy max thru hiker or travelling pharmacy perk. If you're bloodied and carry tons of diluted radx and radaway it's a game changer.

I attacked this Workshop because i was low on steal and Aluminium and ther where multiple Extravetars. I needed some time to think about it before i attacked. After I destoyed his Army of Turrets he fougth back. I killed him after some Minutes. Than he wanted Revenge and i must kill him a second Time.
---
But I never use a one shot build, thats boring. When your Workshop hase nothing to offer I dident attack. Im only a attack for Goodies, not because im evil.
---
Edit: Im Bounty Hunter too. And helped minutes before a low level player with Stimpaks and ammunition.
---
Just in case you didn't know, Chameleon armor only works when you're not moving. So it won't be entirely identical to the stealth suit.
---
Ah all I could find gl!
---
Both Foundation or The Crater have vending machines to turn them in. The one at The Crater is right behind Meg.
---
Machines are inside Crater's broken core of the fallen space station, and near the entrance into the underground offices of the Foundation.
---
There's a machine near the bullion traders in both settlements. They look like the ammo dispensers in the train stations.
---
I just started this week saw dude once near Morgantown and once outside my camp near Wayward...much like Skyrim just bought lockpicks/bobby pins and moved on lol.
---
Mr Squeeze sells the Lemonade and Hard Lemonade recipes. Grahm also sells some unique plans
---
NGL. The extra DR and ER are a honey pot.
---
The damage resist system actually gives hugely diminishing returns.
---
Most enemies can't hit anywhere near 100 damage, so why do you need 500 DR?
---
It seems to have gotten more obvious. I crafted 3 SS left legs, and two in a row were Mutant Slayers, another separate instance 2 in a row were Cloaking.
---
 That can't just be "shitty RNG".
---
because the settlers are huge assholes...
---
There is a perk which reduce energy ammo by 90%, cores affected. And despite I use gatling laser a lot, I never had to farm or looking around for cores, you get pretty much of those from events or just in the world, there were some moments when I had to throw some away just because I had too much of those.
---
It's like that for everyone
---
People need to read up on how computers generate random numbers.
---
If it doesn‚Äôt do anything unique other than ammo type then just make it a skin
---
yes cause i never take any damage so i blow them up and my friends get instant death and think I'm hacking
---
I'd also like to see an mp40 from ww2. Whether it's a skin or an actual gun, it would be awesome
---
Y‚Äôall are awesome thank you I‚Äôve been losing my mind trying to figure this out. Cheers!
---
I use my armored backpack with the Chinese stealth suit. Works for me.
---
I got something about eating a large amount of dog food.
---
Yes!  Preceded by shouting "IT'S COMING RIGHT FOR YOU!" before slagging it full of bullets.
---
That sounds like the kind of honorable rule set that wouldn't ruin my day.
---
I had no structure placed on the workshop, not even one turret and he just one shot me from behind as I wanted to leave, so it's nothing comparable to the way you play.
---
I'm happy to see someone play a raider in a fun way, which isn't borderline grieving.
---
Debunked:   Power armor sinks in water.
---
I like to do it with a suppressed weapon from a distance next to a new player....
---
Thank you!
---
3 points into sneak will be a must for your build, when you're able to allocate
---
My Bloodied Gunslinger can almost one-shot Lv. 68 Super Mutants with a 10mm, which is about the best I could ask for with Adrenaline not working.  It came in very handy for XP farming because the ammo is so plentiful (the ArmCo maker just spits it out like no tomorrow).
---
However, I agree with others that with pistols, she will never be able to keep up with you.  You choose pistols *because* they are a somewhat crippled build, and that's what makes them fun and interesting compared to stronger options.  You're the one rolling in all wild west style with your revolver.  And as long as you're spec'ed well, you're not going to have trouble getting credit for the SBQ or anything... you probably just aren't going to do it by yourself.
---
They got intel that the Enclave has a full underground warehouse of cork down there..
---
Exploding cars is probably my #1 weapon honestly
---
With pistols i find either a two shot or a quad is a good way to go. I do have a full health one and for the most part i use either my two shot 10mm when im not against big mobs or my quad pipe pistol neither have really let me down but it does take more shots than with any of my other builds. And if your on ps4 i might have some extras to part with
---
Ah ok.  That is coming up soon if i remember correctly.
---
They're dick moves made by dicks.
---
Same thing happened to me today. Had the silo codes expired last Monday, and the IABD quest just restarted. Found new silo codes, killed by assaultrons 3 times. Gave up. Silo code expired again. Joined up public team to kill scorchbeast queen, suddently the quest is went into the completed list. Went to bunker, thought I could restart it. But I guess I cant huh? Really no fixes out there? Feel sad too, eventho some of u r sayin missing nuttin much. Bugs like this can make a hater out of a fan since fallout 3.
---
I sell nearly all my chems and eat meat raw so all I carry is a few waters and 10 or so stims and radaway usually.
---
You are carrying one of Ward‚Äôs requested items, most likely a MISC item that you can‚Äôt scrap like the Portable Power Pack. If you drop or stash it the quest goes back to the old way. Though I can‚Äôt imagine why you‚Äôd want to go through the extra step each time.
---
really wow that's a weird one, its also unlimited scrip. that's the part i'm worried about
---
Tomorrow‚Äôs patch we‚Äôre getting some increases in amounts and the ammo points are going up to 100k
---
"Hey my children, looks like 76 is putting in the work, fighting the good fight, he was just reunited with his long lost boss from Vault 76, so my children, now you know, good things DO happen...even in the Wastelands."
---
I'd disagree.
---
Bloodied/Unyielding is necessary to play the game without constantly grinding for screws and lead.
---
It's not about being debunked xD
---
Hmm I got the impression that more people sided with the settlers so maybe I am wrong.
---
On my 5 different characters, 4 of them are "good" and sided with the settlers and 1 is a raider type character so she sided with the Raiders.  I didn't really actually put any thought into who I liked or disliked.  
---
If I did, I would've sided with the settlers because Ra-Ra is one of the most annoying characters I have ever encountered.  I really dislike bratty kids as characters.  But at the end of the day it doesn't really matter because I have seen people post about how Ra-Ra was like their favorite character.
---
How so? I get that Ward is a huge asshole but other than him nobody really comes to mind.
---
Hmmm, I dont think I have ever ran into Mr. Sqeeze.
---
Ohhhh, bare-handed.  I've basically ignored that but thought it said unarmed so a gauntlet would count. Kudos to your patience
---
np
---
Spare osmosis kit in misc tab. He doesn't take it when completed. I heard about the multiple completions but I don't have that on pc.
---
For me, the Raiders were just more interesting.
---
It helps that Meg was actually kinda likeable - she wanted what was best for her people, took no bullshit, but also understood the importance of law and rule in a lawless and ruleless land.
---
The Settlers were just... nice.
---
I'm sure both could thrive, but I'd hazard a guess the Raiders would have it easier and, dare I say it, more structured.
---
I actually couldn‚Äôt stand a lot of the voices for the raiders so I didn‚Äôt do very many of their quests before I said screw these guys.  That was kind of unfortunate because I am a heavy weapons guy and that gatling gauss would be a lot more useful for me than the shotgun.
---
I really want a pointing and a *yay* emote. But, I would like anything at this point.
---
I thought that questline was one of the hardest parts of the game. I still don't like Assaultrons.
---
It's not only the cap, but damage and damage resistance in general. For example, you should die if you were hiding behind a car and it exploded. But no, you might walk away unharmed. You should die if hit one the face with a 50 call bullet while sleeping. A nuke launched with a catapult into your bed should kill you AND obliterate your camp. But no.
---
Survival was close to being OK, but Fallout 1st took those servers for good. A real shame. 
---
PvP in this game is fun for five minutes. Then, you realise it's all about playing "megajumping invisible enemy autoaim shooting" with a broken magical weapon. 
---
It's stupid, it breaks immersion and it doesn't fell like Fallout.
---
If you are a junkies build then go for junkies but if not then use the other one
---
I honestly feel like they are only good with the flamer attachment.
---
I just wanted to add that last year sentinal mitigated 100% damage but they patched it to 75%. Sentinal was top tier anything especially pvp cause all you had to do was not move and jump and shoot. Jumping counts as standing still as long as you don't move position and you even hold stealth from chameleon/ stealth boy. But as long as you didn't endure a stagger you could hold the 100% mitigate from full sentinal.
---
Now it is a chance to mitigate a percent, still very good though.
---
&gt; Now the reason I chose the settlers was just as it seemed they had a much more solid plan, with less wild-cards, breaking the vault door with the help of a pre-war scientist, using sophisticated stealth technology to overcome sensors and having at least somewhat trained personell for dealing with the turrets.
---
Exactly.  Effective, but boring.  For what it's worth, I think Bethesda's social media said that more people chose Settlers over Raiders when Wastelanders was released, albeit by a fairly slim margin. 
---
That said, I think most of the hate comes from Ward, who's just a sour asshole all the time.
---
If it made beeswax then he‚Äôll yeah, always could use more acid.
---
Hmmmm...odd. I just completed trade secret mission last night, then line in the sand? That then the Scorched earth because a nuke launched, and I ended up with treasurey notes. I will experiment more with missions tonight and see.
---
But the public event only commences after someone claimed it; without the pvp element one could hold all the workshops ad infinitum...
---
JE is 50% more damage (with 5 addictions) when compared to VE, while VE heals you when you shoot something with.
---
What is the question you are asking exactly?
---
Random encounter. I believe those are the only plans/recipes they sell too
---
I still say that if you want materials for stabilizing fluxes, Morgantown is one of the absolute best spots. There‚Äôs always better spots for specific fluxes, but for general stabilizing materials, I can‚Äôt think of a better location.
---
Well as I said I just got the impression and saying that, I was not around when wastelanders actually launched.
---
I can totally agree on you with Ra-Ra but in my opinion Gail is even worse. And yeah I have also seen those Ra-Ra enthusiasts, would be interesting if one of those could stop by here and tell me what they like about her.
---
Why don‚Äôt you like him? Seemed like a chill dude to me
---
Plasmas can be semi-auto rifles, automatic rifles, pisols, or automatic pistols. Depending on the barrel or grip/stock choices.   
---
Even the flamer barrel is an automatic rifle/pistol IIRC. Same for beam splitters, even though it looks like it's a shotgun, its considered either a rifle or pistol.   
---
Honestly, all energy weapons are a bit crap. I was pretty disappointed in both plasmas and lasers in this game.
---
Not for me at least
---
You can only turn in 20 notes every 20 hours
---
Or honeycomb at slower rate. Great idea, however i think that is probably going to break bandolier barbarian and blocker. Im hesitant on the fence tho
---
Ahh hmm that is interesting.. Thank you still a lot I don't know about Reddit I feel lol
---
Yeah it's been happening for me and a. Ouple friends for a while no idea how to fix it but I just don't use it anymore
---
First, this sounds great and I love the concept. I‚Äôd bee all over that. The issue, however, is that beeswax scraps into acid and has a solid value even selling to bots. Fertilizer is one thing, but having a place-anywhere acid resource may bee a bit much. I feel that if such a thing were added, it would likely bee either only included in a high-end atom shop bundle or toward the end of a season board.
---
You can place it on visitors to kill them instantly
---
I tried it with my bloodied unarmed ninja (hits for 300 with no weapons). Nothing happened, but I had grenades "equipped" so maybe that ruined it for me. 
---
Will try again.
---
I really wish some of the joke weapons were secretly op like flare gun as you mentioned. Or drill could repair camp objects. Chainsaw helps collect wood or destroy camp objects. Buzzy blade increase plant harvest. Pickaxe increase mining yield.
---
Or honeycomb. I just want bees lol
---
There‚Äôs a few different items that you can have in misc and ward won‚Äôt take them.
---
I haven't checked that. but come to think of it i do think i picked up a osmosis thing as well after i killed the 2. so I could  take it off my char to stop it. or is it stuck in my inventory  because its a quest item??
---
Raiders have more interesting characters, but I would say that they are more arseholes than the settlers are.
---
Did i hear cookies!?
---
Blowing up cars keeps me playing.
---
and I am on pc
---
Good point. As someone said maybe swap honeycomb for beeswax. I just want bees and honey lol
---
Definitely, would give more of a reason to keep them and make them. Super cool idea tbh :)
---
That's fair, I also like meg much more than the other raiders of the raid as well as, I don't have her name on hand rn, the girl you sell the photos of foundation to, also seemed nice, I would like a quest where you help her get recognised by meg or something. Main thing that turned me off hard were Johnny, Ra-Ra and especially Gail.
---
I got a two shot 10mm the other day and it is awesome! If you can find one of those, it is worth it.
---
It'd be handy to get a headstart on the bullion grind if you can figure it out.   
---
I know I wasn't getting them for doing the Photo Opportunity daily quest. Maybe it's only specific quests or events?
---
You can still get the rep by doing the dailies, I didn't side with them but have higher rep with them despite that, so good luck getting that gauss minigun \^\^
---
ah I see.
---
She drops grenades to fry the last guy.
---
I blame Fallout 3's parking lots full of cars for getting me addicted to blowing up cars in Fallout.
---
Personally prefer the emotes option.
---
Raiders had the stuff that I wanted, once I got it all I turned my back and became a double agent snapping pics and giving them to ward and making sure to send the runaway raiders over to the settlers. Raiders also have the slug buster which is a nice side rifle.
---
One of my spots is at the top of the world with rose.   Through one of the windows you can see a couple of cars that you can shoot at and have a very small chain.  I do it with a silenced marksman rifle and just love the confusion it would cause to anyone that happens to be around there (player or super mutant).
---
I left it, you can drop it and see.
---
I had no grenades equipped when I did it, so I doubt that would be a difference.
---
Sugar Grove has an explosive parking lot that I‚Äôve been caught in a few times
---
I used to use the chem backpack as i carried hundreds and hundreds of every chem known to man and then i realised i barely use any chems. Despite being a junkie. Now i carry the bare minimum.
---
They dont feel pain so they can push their messed up mutated bodies beyond their limits
---
so i can drop it. thx
---
I have to drop it. if not i know i'll abuse the hell out of it. unlimited scrip and i want a really  a good fixer i wouldn't stop until my account probably got banned
---
I brought this up in another thread recently, but I rarely find legendary 10mm pistols in the game.  I can‚Äôt count the times I‚Äôve gotten revolvers, or pope pistols from Mur.  10mm?  Never.  Only a couple from vendors.  
---
Recently found an AA, 33 vats chance once which is fun for killing trash mobs (I‚Äôm not specced for gunslinger)
---
And, did a pull a B25/15 Revolver the other day though.  But I don‚Äôt have much use for it atm.
---
Yep! That mining company where you get the excavator PA is also a good spot!
---
Man you must really wanna cry today to post 3 times on my post. So sure sounds like you‚Äôre whining
---
That looks like blue and gold, though. And the blue headlamp?
---
I'm afraid that didn't work for me.  Got my first gold through legendary run, no treasury notes until I finished WL.
---
Just this weekend, when my teenaged daughter happened to wander in as I was farming ferals at Whitespring, I gleefully said "Watch this!" as I lit a fuse of cars.
---
So, yes.
---
The doorgun was also my favorite thing about the BoS vertibird taxi in FO4 for the same reason.
---
Without a patch, obviously not.
---
Ward is still a raider at heart, Samuel is a lying sack of shit who looted a Vault Tec gift shop, Paige has the personality of a potato and the whole lot of them need to be warned a ghoul is coming to join them so they wont shoot her. Meanwhile the raiders have a super mutant with them, are oozing with personality and all their dailies can be completed without killing anyone, unlike Ward who requires you kill someone.
---
They're really not. They don't suck your dick or anything, but they're not huge assholes. Certainly not more than the raiders as a whole.
---
I really feel your comment it's pretty sad in a way, as some interactions could've been pretty cool but instead they are whacky let's use as many dmg exploits as possible games of tag.
---
Sadly I never experienced survival as I didn't play during that time period :(
---
So ... the point of this post was to just say you don‚Äôt like a small YouTuber ??
---
Must...try...tonight.
---
Thank you for the tip!
---
As you seem to be so adamant to ignore the facts and instead have backed into a corner regarding this throwing out childish remarks. Here you go:

Clearly Wanted
---
Not inside workshop
---
No AP loss due to Dodgy
---
No Serendipity procs
---
Now according to your false claims... I as a Wanted Player should ALWAYS be hurt regardless of whether my attacker is IN or OUT of Pacifist mode. 
---
So how am I fine taking NO DAMAGE and Losing NO AP...
---
Oh Yeah the guy attacking me is in PACIFIST. 
---
Can be disputed but I also had no armour on...
---
Take your BS claims to a different post friendo. Stop making up crap.
---
Ra-Ra is a mini Moira Brown. Her excitement is infectious, she's very helpful on that quest with the pipes plus she has Bunnabun! The devs did a great job with her animations and idles. She's just a joy to be around after experiencing the no life soul-sucking whiners at Foundation.
---
Sugar grove is pretty good for that too, not as good though
---
My guess is we will be getting an event, May not be the same one. I‚Äôd imagine the usual US holidays are just expected to happen unlike events like fasnacht and meat week which are based on little-known holidays or events that aren‚Äôt held down by a specific time of year despite being seasonal
---
Oh I know but I still dislike them a ton,  I break down now and then and go see them.
---
I wish i could, but it costs way too much nuclear waste to make a bunch of
---
The pain hurts he becomes scrap. So I can slowly forgot about the truth he gave me.
---
Yeah well I think they should've probably made the dudes dealing with the turrets a bit more interesting, other than that I actually liked the "communist spy-gal" and pre-war scientist.
---
And I also see ward as a huge problem, he is the settler you are forced to interact with the most while at the same time being the worst of them, I actually enjoyed talking to some of the random settlers but you never "need" to speak to them
---
I had this issue once with Fallout 4 it was my power supply dying, troubleshoot with stress tests on all the components to try and single out the issue.
---
I usually just punch them and they blow up. Its so satisfying
---
I think stalkers 100% vats accuracy if not in combat, have no ap penalty, and should be able to target invisible enemies in vats, like assaultrons or stealth boy players.
---
Mutants armor so give +1 all special if player is mutated. Full life version of unyielding.
---
My stealth rifleman uses a plasma flamer for tankier enemies like Sheepsquatch and when I get swarmed and lose stealth.  It shreds pretty well for me.  The flamer mod benefits from rifleman perks.
---
The build admittedly isn't optimal: I'm trying to run a generalist with a focus on stealth and sniping. I have marsupial, healing factor, eagle eye, and bird bones. I've been using a furious Gauss rifle, but I'm finding better results with a fixer. I use VATS a lot. 
---
S8 P9 E6 C4 I10 A10 L9
---
Perks are kinda all over: pm me for specifics.
---
I dont know if there was any patch since today I got unbanned lol
---
#Congrats mate. Now do it Again.
---
Yeah the only thing you really miss out on is the slug buster, I didn't know about it before, because as I said, I didn't look it up beforehand but other than that you actually have way more opportunities to raise raider rep than settler rap, because of that mirelurk farm.
---
Lol of course that‚Äôs how they did it, appreciate it
---
I‚Äôve had this position for a while now. 
---
I use private server and see what runs I get. If it‚Äôs good I use my other toons on there. It‚Äôs definitely more than happenstance. You drop a heavy you‚Äôll tend to get more heavy guns etc. I dropped 4 black powder pistols a few days ago. 
---
My best and most applicable experience was when I was dropping bloodied stuff 4 out of 5 on my main, then switched to other toons on same world and continued to drop it. 
---
It‚Äôs definitely worth a check and see what appears to be happening on the server and switch/wait if you can. 
---
I have like 40 bloodied weapons across 3 toons now all from feeling out the server trends and abusing them.
---
IMO, 79 needs a Gold Exchange.
---
And the Settlers and Raiders both need a Scrip Grinder.  Then, those two would be one-stop-shop locations.
---
Gatling versions of plasma and laser are pretty good. They're my favorite heavy weapons.
---
I do this too often to the golf club ghouls in the parking lot. All fun and games till someone sees what you‚Äôre doing and blows up the cars first though!
---
IMO Bethesda already gave us mannequins in the form of allies... walking, talking, headache-inducing mannequins! Assign your favourite (or not-so-favourite) outfits to them and bam! 
---
The only downside is that you can only have one manne-ahem- Ally at a time.
---
What Are you? Xbox, ps4, pc? Just that I might be able to give you something if you're Xbox.
---
I see, she kind of had the opposite effect for me, I liked the bunnabun thing and general joyous nature but her constant talk about Gail, paired with her voice just made it hard for me to be around her.
---
Damn need some [crimson](https://tenor.com/view/chappelles-show-dave-chappelle-crack-drugs-high-gif-4256947)
---
Because the settlers and the raiders give out the gold as per the story line. You buy plans at 79 you don‚Äôt get gold there
---
Eh, from what I've seen here, doesn't look all that promising, but I have recently seen a video of these objects (and a lot of what's in the video I don't see in the pics here), so not sure if the OP missed these or is the video misleading? This is the one I watched: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzVkeEXjaxg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzVkeEXjaxg)
---
\^And was very happy to see the sliding powered doors in that video.. and now I'm wondering if we will get them. -\_-
---
Scrip machines at the foundation and crater would be awesome.  Great idea.
---
Yep, that's every weapon I have received from the SBQ and Imposter in the last month.
---
Agree that mutants should scale but it should also not give as much of a buff as junkies or bloodied. My thought was 3% buff per mutation. This would thus max out at 48% if you had all 16 mutations.
---
I blow them up every time I see one. Whitesprings is the best. My partner judges me every time I do it when we play, but that's fine. Boom.
---
It's me - the griefer. Give me all your Spoiled Meat or the cow gets it
---
In mine it's 1:14 chance to get shined
---
A 76 roulette
---
What did you get from the bot in-game though?
---
Love blowing up the cars especially when you use it for tactical advantage. White springs!
---
Guns with 90% weight reduce help.
---
Wish I read ur post 29 days ago. Sigh. Time machine any1? Please! Had that ‚Äúpunch in the gut‚Äù feelin readin thru all the posts about this ‚Äúbug‚Äù.
---
And be free fast travel points
---
Those look really nice- shame that my camp budget is full. Would be nice if they could find a way to give us a \~20% boost or so, I'm sure more folks would buy it if they had the space for it.
---
to be fair, that is a very recent development in ESO
---
used to have to use all sorts of crafting and scrapping mods to make ESO crafting bearable
---
what shits me is having to collect dirty water, one at a time, then boil it, before i can cook, when i have 1000 purified water just sitting there. Guess the nasty bits make it spicier.
---
I attack them all anyways. The sentrys are worth ~1k xp each.
---
I love when there are multiples parked next to each other. It's like playing explody dominoes, they all go boom in an awesome chain reaction.
---
well you are lucky.. I completed the quest and I became an opossum, then I though to unlock the normal backpack project, not the lesser one given from the overseer quest, was the one in the opossum distributor.. so I wasted like 3 days doing those challenges for collect 3 possum badge and figure out that the project on the distributor was only a skin of the normal backpack that I already unlocked like a month ago! meanwhile I could keep the badge and try to get the high capacity mod but I wasted all of them for a skin lololol
---
It‚Äôs also how the daily for ward is set up. No way to get the item back for foundation with out murdering someone even if the raiders have more need of the item. At least with raider dailies you can actually walk away with reputation while not killing someone.
---
I love the junker wastelander style that they have, and their characters are more interesting. Not to mention that it's the wasteland, we're supposed to be depraved lunatics.
---
But it depends on the character, and which weapon I want. Raiders had the heavy weapon, so I went with them on my heavy weapons guy.
---
About half a dozen on this character, I got 3 the first time none since. Others say RNG and damage, so I'll just keep trying and increase my damage.
---
It would be nice if we could buy bigger budget by spending caps/scrips or bullion's.
---
Each purchase would increase budget limit to certain max limit.
---
Maybe that‚Äôs too harsh a term ... but they‚Äôre just cold and unfriendly. When you first meet Paige, he seems pretty belligerent to outsiders. And he barely warms up to us no matter how much we do for him. In general, they come across as arrogant, entitled, and slightly xenophobic in the case of Penny. Raiders are more like outcasts, appreciative of what they have and trying to keep their ‚Äúfamily‚Äù together. I think that‚Äôs why players tend to resent the settlers.
---
Something along the lines of ‚ÄúYou eat canned dog food, cram, [something else], but if you‚Äôre trying to disgust me, all you had to do was show me your face‚Äù
---
For what it's worth, I agree about Penny.  She's my favorite on both sides of the argument.
---
I got 3 on my first nuke for his character, I'll be patient and keep trying.
---
Never do those challenge on your own camp lol if you claim and do it on a workshop it be done with the free materials FYI
---
they should change the name of the punch bowl into " nuka shine bowl" because that's all i've ever seen in them.
---
the fucking thumbnail is hilarious
---
It were single player games.
---
76 manages like "30 single players" at same time
---
I get where you are coming from, though to get max rep you still need to kill on retirement plan and yeah the raiders do have personality where the settlers don't but if that personality is just obnoxious that doesn't really help me like them, though that's very subjective.
---
And yes paige is definitely a potato pretending to be human. And I do get your other points too but I think the caution towards ghouls is understandable and they do end up letting her stay there and ward being a raider at heart definitely is more of a problem in the foundation setting as it kind of goes against its feeling.
---
Red Rocket Mega Stop also!
---
Not really, riding shotgun has a 3 star and so do most horde events
---
The raider need it outside like the settlements I‚Äôm full blown raider and still trade at the settlement just so I don‚Äôt have to double zone
---
Johnny was a given to not-like, and Ra-Ra and Gail were a really good pairing, as she's a young kid who has adapted scarily well to her new world, and her best friend is someone she should be afraid of, by all rights.
---
Intended or not, the whole "don't judge a book by its cover" message between Ra-Ra and Gail was one I liked.
---
Horses for courses though, I guess.
---
If it makes you feel better, I had someone do that to me when I was level 4. But I was lucky enough to have my level 30? 40? son around to protect me.
---
I accidentally blew up the parking lot at the Galleria when shooting scorched with my exploding shotgun. Scared me good
---
Sounds useful and great idea to me!
---
Yep in my opinion she is much more likeable than the raider characters, while also not being too dull. I'd like to see more quests with her in the future to be honest.
---
There is a timer between when u can get the quest again
---
Riding shotgun you say? Thanks :)
---
Does the blue camo you get from nw work on the t65?
---
Samuel is a synth. Dont care about timelines. That mofo is a synth.
---
Needs to be a creature the captain doesn't count
---
Sheogorath would have a tear in his eye for these nutters. True madmen.
---
Retirement Plan lets you tell them to run away and never come back. No killing needed.
---
Or better yet implement an actual chat system or make every chat-related Emote free.  We shouldn't be spending Atoms to say Goodbye.
---
Solid idea here
---
I'm at work so fuck me if I'm wrong, but doesn't vault tech university always have one?  The place where you turn in scorchbeast DNA
---
It was odd. I had just gotten there, hadn't fired a shot. I had had no earlier altercations either. Anyway, a belly laugh emote would more civilized than a middle finger imo.
---
(Psssst.. Watch out for those Horde ~~and AWOL Armaments~~ events) ;)
---
edit: robots aren't creatures
---
I looked it up. I'll be on around then, my friend gets off like 5:30 here so I'll be good. Can team up too if ya want
---
The first time I found that I was just going around looting. The explosion followed by the other 2 or 3 cars next to it killed me REAL quick.
---
I have only found a legendary only once.
---
Some People forget that Raider in Fallout means more than Kill everything.
---
I personaly thing that this people are new to Fallout and think its like other Games where no Morality exist and so they think be Evil against others Players is normal.
---
Many veterans were more interested in the new rewards more than anything, and the raiders have the Guass Minigun and the ammo constructor. 
---
Good vs bad has nothing to do with who I sided with, I play both sides so that I always come out on top. Appalachia belongs to the residents of 76. Trust me, if the settler and raider npcs were non-essential and could be killed, I would probably destroy them every opportunity I had just for fun.
---
Ward is annoying and a little bitch. Be a man. Help yourself.
---
Now ill be doing the same!
---
Yeah the message with those two was great but they shut me out after choosing one dialogue they didn't like in turn kind of ruining it for me because it felt like they were prejudiced against not-killing/fighting. Though it does make sense in the wasteland that just felt kind of reckless and was something I couldn't identify with at all, the boasting didn't help either there.
---
I like to have my character dancing just outside my camp on a billboard when players exit my vendor room, one he spawned out of nowhere on the billboard with me, insulted me then vanished like the wind, I was so confused.
---
2 birds with one stone ;)
---
You likely just landed on a world with a group that farms the SBQ and moves on to the next server to farm her again for treasury notes.
---
There are a decent number of groups who run all 3 silos at the same time, then launch/kill, launch/kill, launch/kill and move on. Maybe throw in a quick Encryptid at the end if it hasn't already been burnt on that world.
---
What's "fun" about this is it's generally not just a bunch of random folks, but more likely an organized team coordinated on audio chat just getting together to level up and grind out some treasury notes.
---
It‚Äôs not unlimited scrip. You can only carry a max of 1000. This glitch has been around for months and if it were a priority Bethesda could have fixed it long ago. You won‚Äôt get banned for this.
---
For a while I was using a Rocket Sledge and had Explosive Resist Chest on... I'd smack a car once and BOOM! 
---
Was fun running around smashing cars and getting them to explode. I even used it to kill a few Scorched at the Galleria by getting them to chase me, then hitting a car instead of them to catch them in the blast.
---
So yeah, it's fun. =D
---
I didnt know this!? Is it the one by the front entrance?
---
No, it wouldbe more powerful.
---
Yeesh... might be the hardest one yet.
---
Do you still get the option to say there's a new corpse then? As otherwise you'll be getting a bit less rep there.
---
I blow them up, but it‚Äôs a practical matter. Got killed by some griefers at a low level thanks to cars, now they all need to go.
---
Thanks everyone
---
I killed two 3-star Major Gutsys during the AWOL Armaments event and it didn't give me credit for either of them.
---
No i joined reddit to get peoples opinion on this game and if i should give it another shot. And yes i have played the Game, i dont get your logic here why do you think i haven't played it?
---
Such pretty explosions!
---
retirement plan has a speech check that convinces them to come back to crater, or go to foundation as well
---
Fucking double SCORE and double XP weekends where is my Double Insult Weekends at
---
Creature, it says... Gutsys are not creatures. And the captain is not creature either in riding shotgun.
---
Don't they even say they're only selling stuff to get the gold back into the vault? The SS doesnt want the gold in circulation.
---
You're a level 10. 
---
Avoid level 62 areas. Problem solved.
---
forgot about that, just gotta server hop til the guy is up to start
---
Jesus H Pogostick.  Bethesda can GTFO with this shit.
---
That's actually a really good point, I can definitely see that being a main reason. The raiders are more tribe-like that way. Though I always interpreted the settlers "coldness" as them just being wary so that might be why I liked them more. And I didn't really get the impression the other settler NPCs (the named ones, not involved in the story directly) were nearly as cold
---
I've only played fallout 4 and fallout 76. My love for raiders started with fallout 4. Who wants to join the boring good guys when you can have a whole theme park and control 3 gangs that help you take over the world.
---
Yeah, I was pretty sure that all exploiters will downvote my post.
---
This game is full of cheaters.
---
it is potentially unlimited scrip. meaning go buy stuff. then us this method top up to max and repeat.
---
Don't forget AWOL. My favorite 3 star haunt.
---
I really never read them as arrogant or entitled, but I *did* see them as reasonably cautious for people that are trying to restart civilization in a hostile wasteland where they're regularly confronted by people who either want them dead or to steal anything of theirs that's useful. And while Paige openly doesn't trust you at first, raiders will *actually kill you* if given a chance before you organize a meet-up with Meg.
---
I did end up siding with the settlers and giving them all the gold (in the hopes that they'll be expanded with future content updates-- I admittedly found them less interesting than the raiders for now), but I always felt they were respectful enough for my role. I'm sure they'd be less respectful if I had shared the gold with the raiders, but considering the relationship between the two groups, I understand why they'd see that as a harmful betrayal as well.
---
Raiders don't give a shit about keeping their "family" together, I don't know why people keep parroting this. A few of the major named characters do, like Meg, Lou, and Wren (who's actually my favorite raider NPC), but raiders as whole don't care. You can hear people in ambient dialogue insulting Lou while he's in suicidal isolation trying to protect them and literally no one other than Meg or the player gave a shit about the rescue of Gail and Ra-Ra, the latter of which is a literal orphaned child.
---
Still doesn‚Äôt make it unique, it‚Äôs just a more powerful assault rifle. We don‚Äôt need any more powerful assault rifles, handmade/fixers are already good enough. We need actually new weapons, unique weapons we don‚Äôt have. There‚Äôs plenty of other weapons in new Vegas that they could add, that are actually unique and that we don‚Äôt have similar variants of yet, like the Tesla cannon or anti material rifle, which could have a unique effect like the fixer where it would penetrate armor.
---
I leave my vendor off intentionally so I dont show up on the map and because I dont want to build a power source...
---
IIRC the reason plasma guns suck so hard is they do half and half damage.  With the way dr/er works in the game the more damage you do the less armor matters.  This is beyond the simple math difference.  The high damage effectively pushes the damage resistance off the board.  This is why bloody builds dont really need armor pen.
---
So while combined the numbers look like some solid damage when its split like that you are actually allowing your target to in essence double dip into their defenses.
---
Morgantown is such an underrated place to nuke.
---
Hell...yes.   When my son plays with me I usually blow them up near him
---
Also autocorrect doesn't like to spell things wrong
---
I really think that's a big factor as that's a main point of contact with the settlers for most players. And I personally think ward is a bit misplaced at foundation as he doesn't seem to live the same way the other settlers do, being much more ruthless, like instead of "forcing" the raiders to steal he could offer them a trade if they really need it. But he just wants revenge.
---
Jawn/John isn't a person, but a Pennsylvania Dutch word if I remember correctly. I think it means something hard to describe.
---
For "nice camp" I use the camp emote followed by the heart.
---
I got mine at Huntersville, but West Tek and NIRA are also quite good locations for legendaries. Last time I tallied it, it was around [50% chance](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gmnb00/legendary_loot_drop_chances_roundup_may_19_2020/) to get a 3\* out of a legendary spawn.
---
And you saw how messed up the screaming eagle was. I dont want just another skin. Add itto the game with Botherhood of steel.
---
Ok fine, then let us use the treasure notes as currency instead. Point is I shouldn‚Äôt have to go somewhere else to change the notes and then come back there to buy stuff.
---
Once I got 4 broadsiders in a row
---
Valley galleria and a two shot fatman mirv is spectacular
---
Isolating Atlas Basement for some Nice clubing
---
But if they put everyone all in one place what‚Äôs the point in having multiple places to go.
---
I've finally found someone else who understands me :D
---
Now my boyfriend will finally see I'm not the only one who does this!
---
Glad I'm ahead in S.C.O.R.E. because this challenge can piss right off. Killing 3 legendaries was bad enough with my limited play time but hunting a 3*?! Naw.
---
That definition would apply to any event that gives you scrip. Wash, rinse, repeat. There are a ton of repeatable events that would do this. It‚Äôs really not that big of a deal. But if you feel better dropping the item and doing the grind, rock on. It‚Äôs your game. Play however you want. The last thing you need to be doing is worrying over a broken game mechanic.
---
Once again there is literally no reason to. You probably used this gun in NV and now it‚Äôs ‚Äúsentimental‚Äù or whatever and you want it in the game, but you gotta just realize that they aren‚Äôt (and shouldnt) listen to the wants of 1 person. It‚Äôs too bad, deal with it
---
I've had that happen several times too, I always just assumed someone else on the server has killed the enemies attached to the quest so it completes.
---
I agree that the style can be pretty but I also appreciate the practical architecture of foundation. And I can't really agree with the depraved lunatic mind-set, as all players come from a vault but if you RP in that direction it definitely makes sense as they have that much more whacky heist plan befitting of that.
---
And reading this again many people seem to have chosen the factions as if they can't get the other factions rewards by not doing the raid with them.
---
yes, many people.
---
aren‚Äôt these old?
---
To me, the raiders just felt like they had adapted to the wasteland setting in a more enjoyable way. The settlers, as the raiders put it, just follow the same old-world logic that led to the nukes. Everyone acts nice and cheery but are petty and tend to thrive on stabbing people in the back socially. Raiders aren‚Äôt as cunning and much more transparent. The ones like Meg believe in working towards their own personal goals as a group. Seeing as we‚Äôll always be an outsider no matter the faction we choose, I‚Äôd rather join a group built of outsiders rather than the people that never seem to trust me cause I‚Äôm not one of them. 
---
Plus ammo machine
---
So why build a vending machine? U can store or scrap one u don‚Äôt need. Literally store it and nobody can use it
---
Out of 1k+ scrip used so far, only one weapon was with the explosive modifier. It was a AAE Railway rifle that I still occasionally use.
---
Appalachia better watch out, I have a ton of lockpick sweet spot and breathe under water pieces.
---
So if there is somewhere on the map with 15 safes at the bottom of the lake, it‚Äôs over for you ho‚Äôs
---
a perk card that highlights the dead bodies that would be sooooo helpful
---
I've ridden the coattails of groups like that. I actually enjoy it.
---
My friends and I try to do that problem is I'm a melee build and it depends on how quick she lands
---
Even just fucking ‚Äúthank you‚Äù. Thumbs up feels rude in a boomer kinda way and i don‚Äôt wanna üíú someone just for like, every single thing.
---
Robots aren't creatures
---
Is that why noone ever drinks from my party punch? I keep it stocked with ballistic bocks/high voltage hefes and noone ever drinks em : /
---
I wish I didnt take the gold. Raider rep grinding is a pain in my cheeks.
---
I think I'm misunderstanding. Are you saying that you can just keep turning in the quest over and over again in one day? Because that's separate from the item in the inventory auto complete thing.
---
You're joking, right?
---
&gt;If they made that skin for the Assault rifle, people would start to use it EVEN if its worse than the Handmade.
---
No they won't because the Assault Rifle is just statistically inferior compared to the Handmade rifle (Really, they have basically exactly the same stats for everything but damage where the Assault Rifle is just inferior) so nobody uses it, which would basically make the R91 skin wasted considering that many people wouldn't buy that skin.
---
&gt;And about the animations. They could make it a "Legendary tier" skin and by that making it more expensive than the other skins, because giving it special animations would require more time and effort from the developers.
---
Yeah because nothing worse better than a skin on a underpowered rifle than a *premium* skin on a underpowered rifle!
---
And honestly eh about the new weapon thing too the current system works fairly well, the problem has more to do with the fact that some of these skins have been low quality than anything else really, Screaming Eagle being the prime example here.
---
If you blow up a car when another player is passing by it does that player take the full damage?
---
I also played Fallout 4 a lot and had multiple raider characters where I did the Nuka world DLC in different ways but all of them ended up almost as boring as the minuteman with them being about killing and chems just as the minutemen are about protecting and farms.
---
In that game the BoS, railroad are more interesting than those tbh, as they are a bit more complex than black and white good vs bad
---
A trip to wes tek always takes care of my 3 legendaries and usually a 3* is in there. 
---
I‚Äôm not fan of these dailies but come on man.   Killing 3 legendaries or a 3* isn‚Äôt that hard.
---
Me: WHAT?! NO! THAT'S HORRIBLE!
---
Also me: *throws a grenade at that first car in the line of cars outside Whitespring and turns to walk away with destruction in my wake*
---
Yuuuuup.  It sucks.  And why I will pay over 100 caps per when I see them in peoples machines.  Pop em like candy during ISS and SBQ.
---
That's why my vendors are in a little building with the garage doors. When I kill power to the machines it also kills power to the doors causing them to close.
---
It's not perfect since people can still glitch in or run up before everything loads but it works for me.
---
Stolen vertibirds! Just you wait, i'll crash your obsolete tin can with my new X-007 APA with implanted harmonica!
---
If it‚Äôs an organized team though can‚Äôt they just do that on Private servers? They can still server hop if more than one person has Fallout 1st which in my case they definitely did because there were like 5 survival tents in the area. None of my friends play this game so I go on Public servers for experiences like my first session mentioned in the post.
---
ya over and over again every time i'm in a new server
---
Are you doing photo opportunity and the mirelurk farms for raider rep? might help if you aren't. I have more raider rep even though I sided with foundation but I did choose to give both foundation and crater a cut so that might be it.
---
Tbh I hated it in NV. I just think it would be a fun gun to have in 76. I know its a longshot for them to actually put in the game.  But they also wouldn't listen to one person saying no.
---
YES!!!
---
You would still go to each location as they have different items to sell, I‚Äôm not saying I want to be able to buy all the gold bullion items at a single location.
---
What I have a problem with is that you have 3 locations that sell items that are unique at each location but gold bullion can only be exchanged at 2 of those 3 locations.
---
Hard? No. But I have a limited amount of time to play during the week and some days I have to pick and choose what I can do in game.
---
Because he probably still wants to keep it stocked but has the need to stop selling from it periodically when hes close to the 30k cap limit.
---
Same.  At one point I was jumping on top of the mole miner spawn points in Breach and Clear trying to get them to spawn.  I found that throwing a grenade is a great way to wake them up.
---
Yeah I've found that about 3 pounds of anfo is just enough to send the engine out of the hood without getting the cops called.
---
Sorry, wrong sub
---
It was the &gt;!second assaultron!&lt; that did me in. Ran outta shotgun shells, then huntjg rifle shells and then my 10mm tacticle hardened pistol broke. I also ran outta arrows and then fisticuffs failed. Plus I used up my Mollies and nades and mines. 
---
Gonna level up another one or two levels and try again with a full arsenal.
---
All of the loot assuming you can actually fire a bullet before someone else kills them all
---
Psycho Buff at least still has the 25% damage.  The HP and END sort of equate to the DR from Tats.  I craft way more than I ever use
---
St√©p 1 : Apply a Flamethrower Barrel 
---
Step 2 : Apply a Pulse Capacitor 
---
Step 3 : Profit
---
If you end up having to wait till later tonight let me know!
---
Nope this is the first time I've had this happened and I've been playing pretty much every day since last month
---
I am at max caps and don‚Äôt want people to buy more from my vendor, but still want to keep it placed where it is.
---
Yea makes you play everyday
---
U can pay 3k and start encrypted.
---
Hey man, what platform are you guys on?
---
Then that's not the game's fault.
---
You must not frequent this forum than.  It‚Äôs posted about several times a day, every day.  It‚Äôs a known bug.
---
PSA if you don't already know but the dense mod for the ss chest (i know i know but mah jetpack!) makes it so you takes practically 0 damage from explosives. So if you want toooo....you can be IN the splodey fun instead of just watching it!
---
There's something like "All you need to know is that it's been taken care of" or something. Can 100% non-lethal it.
---
You're misunderstanding, I clarified with him in a different sub-comment. He can turn it in over and over, not just automatically because the item. So that kinda is unlimited scrip with zero effort. Different bug than just the MISC item completion. I'd still use the hell out of it though lol.
---
ya i like the normal way. because if not all i would have to do is stay in foundation and log out, log back in with no real gameplay. plus i'd level like crazy and all the fun would be taken out of the game.
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 and there‚Äôs depth of view not field of view
---
Does it count as a "Creature"?  I can tell you for a fact that Major Gutsy doesn't.
---
That table and fire place look awesome
---
I see how a break from the "old" mind-set may be refreshing but I also think that the raiders couldn't exist without people like the settlers so it's a system set-up to fail unless they start being more productive themselves. I was already positively surprised they had their own fields, though those really are lacking, it's a kind of start towards independence.
---
And I really never thought of us joining the factions as staying as an outsider but that's a great point to note, thanks
---
Even with limited time it‚Äôs EZ possible. 
---
Whenever the legendaries is a daily I go to west tek, harpers ferry, burrows.  That daily is usually done before I even get to harpers ferry let alone the burrows. 
---
Fissure sites are also a good spot for legendaries.
---
Congratulations! I never said it was.
---
The fountain where you can cure all the disease
---
My main gripe with vendors is that the easiest solution here would be to just store them when not needed - except it doesn‚Äôt save what you have for sale.  So you tediously need to relist everything.   Wish you could just manually type in prices without having to drag the bar (clearly a console design)
---
I have not seen it before so thats why i asked hoping someone had a solution
---
I guess it‚Äôs subjective. It‚Äôs one thing to be cautious and wary, but when Paige‚Äôs first words are basically this is ours now because they took it and he‚Äôs sounding like he wants to go to blows on the spot ... Well, that left an impression on me, probably poisoned me against them. And contrasting with Meg‚Äôs tribe of not really Raiders that would be willing to take in a super mutant and an orphan, it made me question who was really the invading force in Appalachia.
---
I honestly have no idea. Somebody needs 2 test it out. Either that or drop a nuke in the queen.
---
okay, from what I heard that option gives less rep though, so I might need to test that, as it could lengthen the grind
---
Try each piece and try attaching full size second level pieces with another descending staircase to another foundation. Then try deleting the originals. It's likely not bugged but you're just running afoul of their stupid anti floating/clipping rules.
---
There isn't one. That's the deal with junkies, you have to just deal with your addictions, so choose wisely.
---
Today was the first time it happened to me so I guess I've been lucky. I even waited a half hour after the challenges changed to log on but my game crashed starting up and apparently that completed like 7 of the quests. If the quests auto complete then we should at least get the score. So annoying.
---
There are ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù on how to avoid this bug but some claim it can still happen even if taking precautions.
---
Yes. He is from a timeline where we side with the institute in fo4 and they develop time and dimension travel to send back agents into other timelines. To satisfy their observation needs.
---
You're not wrong at all, but without knowing how the whole thing was implemented (including the generator and the code that goes into how it's used), there's no real way to say for sure that there isn't something broken.
---
They've messed it up before (though this is a different situation) where the 'random' secondary effect on melee weapons was always the same.  Limb damage if I remember right, though I don't remember for certain.  There is something similar going on today with *some* melee weapons, so they haven't quite learned.
---
I love blowing up vehicles and hurting enemies. It's like dinner and a show.
---
Uranium Fever spawned all 3 as 3 star for me moments ago. Might be a good option if you have it available.
---
I had the same issue and it ended up being my power supply. Mine was old so I got a new one and it hasn‚Äôt crashed like that since.
---
Get used to it, welcome to the party.  Frankly it just turns into a cycle, but eventually you get there.  You also get ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù rolls to play with while you build up for enough chances to try again.  You also throw the bad stuff back into the script grinder.  I have 1 for 5 of exactly what I wanted on armor pieces, but ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù with weapons or ammo weight reduction plus the natural resists, so I suited up and just do some occasionally.
---
Golf club has lines of cars and you just shoot one for a chain reaction, just lure the ghouls üòà
---
Yeah i was annoyed too because the challenges would've been easy for me to complete and now i lost a bunch of score i could have gotten
---
Wow, some of that stuff is next level.
---
HMMMMMMMMM?
---
This is why I asked if you were joking. It's literally been the most discussed thing on here for weeks. And no, there is no solution. Just possible things you can try to avoid it happening again.
---
Just two weeks ago? I guess I wasn't looking for it so I never noticed it... I'll just wait for the next rotation. Thanks!
---
More powerful is unique.  But your saying is, let's put in less practical weapons, as long as it looks good. You wanna pay for a skin and I want to be able to find a unique one in the world.
---
god i wish i could get that bug to work (tried the guide but still nada). so much easier to do, and the spin up for legacy explosive plasma Gatlings is too slow to get a hit in so you don't have to deal with the usual kill stealing a$$-hats at events.
---
Sometimes I wish violence wasn't the only answer.
---
It makes sense to be repulsed with him at first but I think given some thought it does make sense, as the raiders returned only to boast about owning everything even though the vault dwellers saved appalachia so he might've just been on the edge because of the way the raiders act. It's all up to interpretation though.
---
That sucks
---
Ever since Fallout 3 I blow up every blow-up-able car I come across.
---
It's not a free item, it's the 24 hour sale.
---
I just found this out. Just read kill a 3* and didn‚Äôt read the last bit üò≠
---
I have had this happen once, where a single player stands there trying to clean it out. 
---
But maybe they think they‚Äôre doing someone else a solid.
---
Oh hell yeah. Every time I do tea time, that's my favorite. 
---
However, don't get to carried away with it and forget to check if someone owns a workshop, you'll get wanted status if you blow up a car.
---
We really don't know if the settlers would be willing to take in a super mutant and an orphan or not, but we do know people will defend Penny in ambient dialogue if someone questions her, whereas no one will come to Lou's defense when he's insulted.
---
They also, you know, seemed happy to leave Gail and Ra-Ra to their deaths before the player came to rescue them. I did not really understand the story to be 'the raiders happily took in an super mutant and an orphan', more like 'everyone else tolerates if even if they'd rather not because Meg says so.'
---
I've seen some people try to claim that the settlers as a whole are obviously xenophobic because Penny asks you to warn them she's coming, but we see no proof they'd be violent to her-- merely that she's cautious because it's a problem she's encountered in the past.
---
You can get three star enemies in Radiation Rumble, One Violent Night and Uranium Fever too.
---
When I first played it, I kept telling myself that it looked so bad and that I hated that the visuals were so outdated. But now I don‚Äôt know how I ever thought that because even now, two years after it‚Äôs release, I consider the game absolutely breath taking most of the time. 
---
It honestly looks beautiful. Also, I love the environmental storytelling that FO76 is absolutely stuffed with. Originally, I guess that‚Äôs what most of the storytelling was based on and I wasn‚Äôt a fan of it alone and by itself. But, now with the addition of NPCs and the Wastelanders storyline, I think the environmental storytelling is so amazingly done as I love stumbling across a random little area while it on a main quest where there‚Äôs so much story condensed into little bits-and-pieces that tell a small but engaging story that gets you really engaged to hear more. 
---
I think that the game, if released in its current state and with  more tweaks on balancing and bugs, could‚Äôve been a really great game in the franchise instead of something that‚Äôs looked back as ‚Äúthe worst game of 2018‚Äù and ‚Äúthe worst fallout title‚Äù. I really wish that more Fallout fans would give this game another go, like I did, and find a really enjoyable Fallout game.
---
Why dont they make reverse vendors you load it with caps and say i need for example 10 steel and some rando walks up and puts 10 steel in the machine and gets paid.its so much easier than searching 100 camps and 10 servers just for one item.
---
Then your only option is lock it a room. Didn‚Äôt think of it being stocked. Don‚Äôt even use mine only to sell some flux when I need to caps
---
Yeah, thank you. I've got a whole daily routine down. It's just my want to play NW, work on Score challenges, or fighting all the daily caps I don't always keep up.
---
That I'll likely not do that challenge. My apologies, I thought that was obvious.
---
You can get them from the raider collectron at least. Just make sure to clean out the booze often or it runs out of space for more chems.
---
I agree fully here, I also hope there will be more side-quests with the other named characters of both factions but I am already kind of worried as they decided to just plop the BoS in without fleshing the others out more first but we'll see.
---
And I also think that respect was a big thing for me, the raiders just seemed to think they could literally beat you 1 on 1 and were behaving like you need them more than they need you until you gave them gold.

There are two ways to get rep without killing. One is a str check to get them to come back to crater. This one gets you rep with raiders and has you telling her to expect him around. No lying about it. The other is a cha check to send them to foundation. That gets you rep with foundation and possibly crater as well. It has two options on the raider side for reporting. Lie or be vague.
---
Haha yeah same, usually wondering if it's me or the just the event got bugged. Good idea tho
---
The ability to ping the map would be great. More than just an orange-yellow map marker which blends into the map itself.
---
I doubt that, but maybe.
---
Check out "Confessions of an addict"
---
ooooh didn't see that part at all
---
I love blowing up cars! I also like interacting with petrified corpses so they disintegrate.
---
It‚Äôs more like buying 1 bullet for a cap three separate times
---
Looks like i'm launchin a nuke when i get home, i'm running low on repair kits anyway : /
---
I thought I saw one when browsing the settings on Xbox?
---
Honestly, the current damage cap isn't even a *good* bandaid. It would be one thing if it people only really started hitting that cap after stacking multiple damage buffs, because that's the kind of thing that can start getting unreasonable to actually balance around, but there are weapons whose base damage hit the cap, and probably a whole lot of others that hit it after basic modding and three rank 1 damage perks
---
Ever since Fallout 3
---
Good luck and have fun :)
---
I feel that, I have just accepted that for now, as I can't necessarily play every day and I got into the game after the score thing had already started that I wasn't going to do those challenges specifically, as to the other caps I can usually fill them and rather have a problem carrying all the chems I want to sell and gear I want to scrip if I played on a weekend causing me to not be able to "adventure" as much after a time
---
Yeah and they are counted as creatures too, so they are good kill.
---
Not 100% sure if molemen creatures, but it worth a try.
---
How about us killing everyone in foundation? That also sounds exciting
---
Not everyone sells ammo. People buy magazines from me all the time though. I will look for cheap 1-5 cap stuff in new players camps to buy though, I imagine many of them don't make 3 sales with the "useless" stuff they find leveling up and it's easy to help them along.
---
You need a logical reason to have fun?
---
Not sure what for Xbox but ps4 has depth of view and not field of view
---
Never used one, never will
---
H√¢te the gameplay in PA
---
I love when robots make fun of bloodied builds, they‚Äôre the worst kind of people
---
I don‚Äôt but the friend I play with does. I can‚Äôt even count the amount of times he‚Äôs blown me up doing that.
---
Also pretty sure its been disproven by Mikhail himself that he didn't base the AK off the STG44.
---
I'd rather have an M1 Garand and a 1911.
---
We've already got the Thompson.
---
10/31 twenty-four seven
---
Triggered must be a comfortable buzz word for you to use when you get called out for fucking lying.
---
And humanoids either. So the captain in riding shotgun does not count.
---
I was lucky found a 3 star hound down there too at the end, but still... :)
---
When I was a low level I would get all the ghouls in the White Springs golf club to follow me out to the parking lot and then I would blow up all the cars to help me take them out
---
Settlers are boring and kinda dbags about the whole thing, from the moment they set up shop they had the "oh sorry, was this your land? Tough, mine now" mindset which I kinda understand, to a point. The raiders mentality made sense and was relatable to me, since my camp was effectively commandeered by the settlers, after all, we were  here  first
---
Man that‚Äôs hard to swallow because I got this power supply in December
---
All Heavy guns with reduced weight sell. So I never have any on me.
---
Chemist backpack mod from raiders OP
---
I hate the Thompson.  But I'd love to see the M1!
---
#**"It Just Works!"**
---
It already is, its called the Combat Rifle
---
I've been selling things for cheap for a long time.    
---
Until the Ammo converter is fixed I'll put in some for cheap to get rid of it.    
---
Plans? Mostly 1 cap/ea but 5/ea at the highest.    
---
I have a lot of Junk and Aid items that I could sell to a vendor for more but I'd rather sell some of it to new players to help them out.    
---
I'm on PC and might be on later after 1pm CST. I could make a full set of leather armor or something. PM if you're interested.    
---
I have 9 of those XP lunchboxes and would benefit my main in getting to 100 finally among other things.
---
My wife, who is my gaming copilot, absolutely loves when I blow up cars. Especially if I can blow up 1 and it starts a chain reaction that blows up all the other cars.
---
I have access to both but I prefer the grocers one to be honest, it serves me much better as a carnivore as all the melee buff meats weigh a ton after a while, also I mostly use nuka-cola for healing so that saves chem weight
---
Don't we all.    
---
I'm trying to craft the Shielded lining for the SS Underarmor.
---
This is actually what I do, I‚Äôm a stealth build. But it doesn‚Äôt work people just start destroying things. Like little children throwing tantrums
---
Riding Shotgun usually has a 3 star captain to kill.  Its readily available by server hopping.
---
Not even that fast.. half the people log in and 9/9 challenges are ALREADY DONE.
---
Agree 100%. Though it would still have the issue that malicious team mates could power them up and then make purchases
---
But that is not a creature, it does not count. Tried myself.
---
I think free fast travel points at a certain rep level would be perfect. Neighborly. Makes the most sense... neighbors ya know
---
Agreed.  I have definitely noticed during my time with the "RNG", that if the random was true, there can't possibly be a reason why I would pull 4 harpoon guns in a row (and this is just one example of many instances I've experienced.)  There is something definitely not so random about their RNG.
---
Later on you will start stock piling. But go do mission for excavator power armor. Gives you 100 extra carry weight without doing any mods on it. Then goto lucky hole cavern and get all lead ore you get 4x with that power armor on. Being you‚Äôre level 36 you might not have these perks unlocked. But super duper maxed out when you go smelt the lead you got from there you can easily get 1k lead each run. Then there‚Äôs a perk card for 1 point called scrapper idk if you have that also but if you do use it every time you pick up all enemies guns and scrap them you get more steel back and everything else and then you can craft all your ammo you need. Another one is using super duper card while crafting ammo and ammunition perk card you get more ammo also. But again being level 36 might not have these cards. I use to never do this and I‚Äôve been playing since beta but I started using guns and this is how I craft all my stuff
---
Ultracite Gatling lasers don't do anything specific to Scorched other than a naturally higher base damage versus everything.
---
Primed UGL's are good at an SBQ event, and Primed does stack with Zealot's. A Primed Zealots (Ultracite or not) Gatling Laser is a solid workhorse of a weapon until you find your "Meta" weapon of choice.
---
Thanks. I'll get to work on finishing the Excavator set.
---
Okay. Finally i find soulmates!!!  I use cars for chain reactions all the time.  The back lot at white springs is superb during a nuke event.
---
Toss an orbital strike nade right in the middle and watch the glowing bitches fly!!
---
Got fried the other day by the car i was standing on...  dumb ass fng move by me.   Explosive .44 ammo, shooting glowing ones, gathered around my car, adoring me.  Ooops.  Blew my own ass up to skylab.
---
Christmas present?   Give me ability to fill my camp with cars.....  stacked up in rows!   And a spear to poke the bottom car
---
Ahhh.....nope
---
You'll probably need to do dedicated farming runs for lead and the like to make more ammo, alternatively you can buy from players for 1 cap each but that'll probably be heavy on your wallet at that level, other than that you could try to get your hands on the ammo factory workshop in the northeast of the map, it can produce ammo passively, but it may get attacked by scorched beasts so be careful when defending.
---
I do like that you're given options to resolve the matter peacefully while still getting raider rep, but the option that gets you the most possible rep is telling Rocksy that there's a new corpse in Appalachia, either by actually killing the defected raider or lying about doing so.
---
Get the excavator Power Armor and mine Luck Hole Mine for lead ore.
---
Using the full set of Excavator yields 4x the ore per node (you get 4 instead of one)
---
This should help with the crafting of ammo.
---
Alright. I'll check it out when I get the chance.
---
ya exactly, it absolutely stimulates buying 3 .38 bullets, total win well done Bethesda
---
I was probably thinking depth of view then.
---
Ahhhh.....yeah
---
You might be mistaking this with the one that reduces negatives from mutations as there is none for addictions.
---
 Not sure if that‚Äôs your problem, just happened to be mine!
---
the irony is i had them 6 hours before i got the jetpack plans. but wasted them making serums
---
Level 400, Heavy Weapons / Power Armor build here. My carry weight is always between 100-150 out of about a max of 350 while wearing my T-65 and carrying about seven different heavy guns at any one time. I usually have about 50-100 fusion cores for power and ammo.

Yes, I love it so much! My girlfriends' camp is near the large red rocket in the north and before we do anything we have to blow up all the cars! 
---
We have so many photos were we pose in front of the explosions
---
Oh, I couldve sworn there was one lol
---
Hope it helps you a bit \^\^
---
Wow really....then again it "just works". Humans are creatures by definition, but I guess I can quit expecting logic in Fallout.
---
I can't help myself and am always blowing up cars as well! It makes things more exciting that way
---
Jesus. I understand the frustration. I‚Äôve even made a post but goddamn I‚Äôm tired of the auto complete posts. Truly sorry it happened tho man
---
&gt;I‚Äôd go for a **two shot**, **anti armor**, junkies, or bloodied with faster fire
---
At it's best and most favourable comparison versus Zealots these will do less damage against Scorched than a Zealots weapon.
---
Yep, I sure did
---
Beth studios: "no no, that idea makes too much sense; they just want more scrip fodder"

Lol. Who killed Ward? It was me. Mystery solved.

Maybe so. I never thought to look for teammates or make sure I had them at the time. Some people join and leave right away, which is weird.

? It is an insulator not an conductor

Have you ever seen a picture of either?   I'm starting to question if you have.

Theres one to reduce the negative effects of mutations called Class Freak, maybe that's what you were thinking of üôÇ

One day the Enclave will be used for more than a handhold questline to show players how to drop nukes. Like no offense to the cult of mothman stuff because some of it's really good but how did THEY and the blood eagles get more fleshed out than the Enclave?
---
I don‚Äôt wonder how they are faster then me, I couldn‚Äôt imagine trying to run while carrying 300lbs worth of guns, ammo, armour and, junk.
---
That is what I was thinking of
---
lol..... so funny.. so sad and true
---
I got 6 pistols in a row, all were junk.
---
Luckily there is a scrapping machine nearby. 
---
Unfortunately had to scrap for a couple of days cause of the limit.
---
Are you crafting your own weapons up to your level?
---
I have my base near the Morgantown Station, and I am always shooting the 2 cars by the tracks. WELL someone had their FO1st tent there and when I shot the cars they were cussing me out over the mic. OH Well, don't put a tent by things that can explode.
---
I picked a lock in a workshop I didn‚Äôt know was owned and got a little bounty and a level like 200 showed up, hearted me, then killed me. Left me all my junk tho.
---
It's true. He now rolls up on you like a pimp. Insult bot 2.0
---
I think that was one thing the writers did well. The factions are not clearly good or bad cliches, but more nuanced. Settlers are strangers in a strange land, not sure who to trust and tending to assume the worst of newcomers. Crater is at a crossroads as Meg tries to establish a tribe and return home, but there‚Äôs tension as several Raiders want resort to the old ways. The Blood Eagles serve as contrast showing us a true unfiltered Raider faction, and the cultists are what happens when settlers start losing it in the wasteland. So you have all these extremes to help form opinion on the primary factions, and we as players find ourselves gravitating toward Crater or Foundation, or maybe liking or resenting them equally. Hard to argue definitively which side is better/worse. Like any group, there‚Äôs good and bad if you look hard enough.
---
Theyre all mostly legendary weapons. The new shotgun I got says it does the same damage amount as my old one. (127) and like 190 at night time.
---
Get to the rank of ally of do the vault raid with them?
---
Based on the other bugs I've tested, this 100% sounds like something they'd do
---
Definitely the excavator-&gt;lucky hole mine route. You will get so much lead with the proper perks. I remember when I was in a similar situation early on I was taking the Lakeside Cabins and Grafton Steel workshops all the time for consistent lead. The latter gives you a ton of steel too.
---
Blowing up cars is the shit, especially when u can kill bunch of ghouls or robots in the process.
---
Did encryptid....did not count üò¢
---
 The engine is horrible for PVE. You also have little to gain by PVE. This isn‚Äôt a full loot survival game. It‚Äôs clearly a PVP game with some singleplayer mixed in.
---
Tse
---
eks de de de de
---
Yeah they did well here but I wish bethesda would give them some more resources and time to flesh out some more characters for each of these factions as it seems they just had them move on to the BoS now, which is somewhat unfortunate in my opinion.
---
I peruse for any missing plans, but I end up doing this if folks aren't coming my way.
---
On the other hand, this has encouraged people to buy from my "See with your Special Eyes / My Brand!" vending machine. It was a fun idea but I am over it now.
---
Yes, in person.  and they look nothing alike. If anything the combat rifle should be call the handmade and the handmade should be called Chinese assault rifle again. If you look at the combat its welded very sloppily,  like its homemade.
---
Its funny cuz its true
---
I see them every time I go to crater
---
Nothing to see here.  
---
This was patched out, remember? üòÇ  
---
Please avert your eyes and pretend it doesn't still happen.
---
Yup, I don‚Äôt use Fat Mans so it‚Äôs the best way to see an amazing explosion. Whenever I do Feed the People I blow up the cars outside
---
Wow thank you so much for really going into detail for Me! Really appreciate it, there‚Äôs so much that I need to learn so this really helps!
---
Its learning
---
That's the laser gun where ultracite has higher RoF. Gatling has same fire rate and 10% damage increase per shot on the ultracite variant.
---
Hmm that's kind of weird. I haven't experienced much trouble with weapons not doing damage. I am only like level 20 rn so maybe that is something in the future. But if it is pure damage your lacking in then crafting your weapons to level 90 would be your best bet. Atleast thats what I do
---
I have 6, all I ask is you help me mule a weapon for an alt. Then you can have them 3 up front, 3 after.
---
If you're on PS4, I can set you up.  
---
I always try to help people who are victims of this particular flavour of bullshit.
---
I picked a lock flagged yellow because I thought that was ok. I'm assuming it was on purpose since the player put all their vending machines in there with no other entrance.
---
I've followed and jumped on a level 404, but they ignored me :(
---
I blow up every fucking car I see and it is hilarious bcoz I don't even die
---
Awe thanks to you to sweet heart
---
Yes they could use a private server, but they don't.  These are the kind of people who ruin everybody else's game then fly into a rage when Bethesda nerfs their gear (a nerf that happened because of them).
---
This is adorable and I really wanna pick up an extra Xbox so Dad and I can play FO76. Also Halo, now that he's sober we might as well go through it again and at least get 3 done right. Although might just have to grab the older systems and play those split-screen.
---
Griefers are the freaking worst. At least they are relatively uncommon in this game, at least in my experience. I think I‚Äôve been griefed a whole three times. Not like RDO where the griefers ate everywhere. Or gta which I don‚Äôt play.
---
Definitely agree there. So many side characters that could/should have quests associated with them. I was hoping we‚Äôd see some sporadic miscellaneous story and ally quests show up while we wait for the new BoS expansion. But I guess it‚Äôs all seasons and Atlas and other small things while we wait.
---
Whatever they'd try to do would probably not be enough. The only real end-game is artificial grind. If they could focus on creating a better end-game than that, it would make the wait far more tolerable
---
Junkies shotguns are bugged and do a significant amount more damage than the numbers on the gun indicste.  This is why your other shottie doesn't feel as powerful. Believe instigating and stalkers are also similarly bugged.  If you look up angry turtle on YouTube he has some excellent videos on "magic" weapons like this.
---
Good news is not a lot of people know this and shotguns aren't very popular so you can usually find one in someone's vending machines relatively cheap.
---
A while ago I might have agreed, but not anymore. Nowadays I can't find anything worth buying so I just buy three cheap things I don't need and then drop them
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm assuming as well. Maybe a screamer grenade that makes enemies run away?
---
I completed an angler horde event at the Valley Galleria with a level 20 character. I lit up the cars first; it was epic!
---
That would be cool!
---
I wouldnt mind the Yao Guais if the raiders would at least fight it.
---
Only Rocksy is willing to put shots on it
---
I have the bad habit of reading the text of the post before reading the name of the sub. I was really concerned. This habit will change now
---
I think that it is better to just cap it like junkies is capped at 50%, otherwise you would have a huge hit to your special stats to only get 48% extra damage.
---
ya sure np. i can log on anytime when your ready just pm me
---
Yao Guais at Crater - they hate me.

Are you being serious?  Im beyond the point of being able to tell.  Anyone with a working set of eyes can tell the 2 are extremely similar looking, almost like they used the real life version as inspiration.   Because they did,  they even used the gun in murals in Fallout 4
---
You can turn in mirelurk meat to blackeye at Ohio river run. Queen mirelurk meat is really the only thing worth turning in

I am.

I wish i could heart this lol

Its just so frustrating because I def won't be able to raid the vault with this garbage.
---
That's some pro level wookie right there! ;)
---
Lol I just find someone selling ammo and buy 1 for 1 cap three times
---
‚ô° 
---
It very well could be that im just doing something wrong but I am super grateful for any help.
---
you have to be in the dead center to get the achievement. Like you get killed by the bomb not by the blast. When you look straight up you see the bomb coming down and filling your screen and then you are dead.
---
Damn. I've got a spiral stair case similar to that one. But mine is not smooth at all. Makes me want to try to remake mine haha
---
Has to be a creature. 
---
Robots, the Encryptid Sheepsquatch or the 3\* Captain from Riding Shotgun don't count.
---
Bethesda logic owns.
---
Thanks for the help btw is this a repeatable quest or is it once per day too?
---
Easiest time I had on that mission was with my alt who is a stealth commando build. She‚Äôs level 77 and could one shot most of the bots before they even knew she was there. If you have the Chinese stealth suit from the settlers questline (‚ÄúInvisible Ties‚Äù) maybe you can use it to sneak around and land sneak attacks on the robots?
---
I was in NW before noon because i forgot yesterdays challenege
---
in one match i survived 10 mins...noon hits i place 3rd and rank up my overseer
---
two NW dailies done in 20 mins
---
and same as above. Halloween Candy, Line in the Sand for creatures, level up, alcohol for days, someones camp was nearby i bought 3 .45 rounds 2 events easy peasy as the enclave event was neaby afterwards
---
Done for the day
---
Yes at first it was fun but now it‚Äôs a chore as a herbivore I can‚Äôt have the pepperoni rolls and I can grind for better legendarilys at harpers ferry or some other place than the event
---
Sugar Grove parking lot is a goody too.
---
It‚Äôs got nothing to do with being a coward. I win at pvp   In the regular game. üòâ
---
You mean other than vault 79?
---
I'll admit I've gotten some good stuff off vendors due to this challenge, but as others said it often tends to just be people spending 3 caps on ammo. Oh well, at least now I have a two shot weightless broadsider
---
If you can craft Secret Service armor, just try to craft one part with 15% reduce dmg while blocking and you're set to go with any shotgun.
---
There‚Äôs the daily. And the daily at the Ohio River Adventures. There‚Äôs another quest there from bones.
---
If you take Davenports quest for pictures of Foundation you can sell them to the raiders for rep.
---
If you don‚Äôt fast travel everywhere and actually travel, you can encounter raiders and settlers in the world that can also give you small rep amounts.
---
Many, many times...and yet there's still a hard core who maintain its all pure random and if you can't post 1000 rolls it doesn't count.
---
Only yesterday I crafted 2x Secret Service Arms and got a 2* and 3* Zealots that differed only in that 3rd star. This was days after Bloodied 3* crossbows that differed again only in their 3rd effect. I've had concecutive black powder pistols, runs of heavy weapons, twin Plasma Gatlings...
---
You should get in touch with the IRA
---
LONG LIVE THE MINIVAN MINI NUKERS (but for real. blow that shit up)
---
It doesnt. Its a robot
---
Yes, I don‚Äôt feel whole unless I blow up a group of cars during my gaming sessions. The chain reaction explosions are just so satisfying to listen to in surround sound and view as they occur.
---
They spawn up on the hill nearby (through the tunnel to the left from the spawn) with the herd of radstags. You get directed there for a mission so I guess they get aggro and make their way in. I saved a level 30-odd the other day from a couple as I arrived, poor guy was hiding in the back of the truck in the centre as I flew in.
---
Dunno about bugs but the fact they are a natural spawn so close to the lip of the crater makes me think they randomly make their way in sometimes. 
---
I've been in a few times where the bodies are still there, but also I've weirdly had cultists dead or spawning in crater too and fighting the raiders.
---
People already run lots of mutations with bloodied and junkies. If you made the bonus damage too similar no one would run those builds because you could just run a mutants build without the low health of bloodied or the extra special stat negatives of chems.
---
farm rep for both factions at Slocum Joe and Marigold Pavillion, but that is slooooow going.
---
This was fixed in the last patch. Much like Ward glitching out.
---
Please note that Bethesda defines fixed in a way no one else would.
---
Thanks, you're right, got my first 3 were in AWOL Armaments. I just got a 3 star Mongrel and it triggered.
---
Robots dont count
---
3* *Creature*
---
Wishful thinking!! Fallout 76 doesn‚Äôt even qualify as a survival game
---
Sounds like you need to get him back in some way
---
Oh yeah, I love going there. It's a good place to take out super mutants with cars, too
---
Project paradise
---
I've noticed this while crafting secret service armor too. I'll craft a few pieces, then check what I got. If it's bad, or all 1* pieces, I'll stop and try again on a different day/server. If it's good but not right for my build, I'll keep trying.
---
What can you do in vault 79? I've currently been completing the daily quests for the raiders. One of their names is Rocksy and the other person starts with a W.
---
I did an event for QuakeCon called Nukashine Run! I managed to get 7 Nukashine runs in. It was fun. 
---
Another event on August 8th with QuakeCon House Party!
---
https://youtu.be/hFgTBEZTewc
---
I found it literally on the 2nd day of the game
---
Yeah I did it a ton. Untill I got all the rewards. Now I don't do it at all haha
---
I'm going to buy all the Olive-green communist stuff!
---
Those are mine!
---
That's probably why then. But its still weird that my other guns do very little.
---
Vault 79 is the gold quest and you get a ton of reputation for them while doing it you start it by talking to the overseer
---
Idk. I guess they just decided to change it up over time. In fallouts 1 and 2, the ghouls were obnoxiously slow. They quite literally shambled towards you. From dialogue with characters, you really got the feeling that they were rotting zombies barely able to move across. The combat dialogue from ghouls often involved some mention of their guts spilling out or whatever. The 3d ghoul animation in fallout 2 was able to run, but I'm pretty sure they only added that so recruiting Lenny wasn't such a massive pain. His stats and gear restrictions already did that job well enough.
---
Fallouts 3 and NV set them to roughly humanoid speed with attacks where they could leap slightly further, so if you were running backwards from them they could still hit you. Then, fallout 4 decided to one-up that and give them faster running speed than humans, along with a lunge attack. That's where we are for now
---
Wow thanks. Thanks for the help. Waiting for daily Quests take for ever to repeat again btw is this repeatable or is it a daily too?
---
Ikr! Lol. I really need to plot my revenge somehow. üòÇü§îü§î
---
Hell to the yeah this is an amazing idea
---
SBQ is ypur only option unless u get lucky. I did radiation rumble and got like 6 3* star enmies so Im gopd for the day. Good luck hunting!!
---
Today's pro tip for pyros:
---
Step one: Equip Fireproof perk card (rank 3) or a dense nodded chest piece as well as your preferred melee weapon.
---
Step two: Sprint into the middle of Valley Galleria parking lot and viciously attack an unsuspecting vehicle.
---
Step three: Bask in the glow.
---
I don't think you can get a Red colored commie PA jet pack. Only green.
---
Maybe you don't care about jet packs, but i think it's kinda sad that there is no fitting jetpack for the red chinese power armor....
---
I could really do with a I'm sorry emote!
---
How do you earn reputation in vault 79??
---
And do not forget  the whitespring and watoga.
---
Crazy!
---
Honestly as ranged, all unyielding.  Why are you getting hit? 
---
Melee is a tougher choice though I go all unyielding as well, using dodgy.
---
Similar as it has a barrel, trigger, stock, iron sights and a magazine than You'd be correct. It takes completely different ammo types. And came first in the game.(Fallout New Vegas). The combat rifle started as a combat shotgun first. But if the make a skin for the rifle,  I might be ok with it. But totally different weapons.
---
It spawned me on the roof of one of the inaccessible buildings one time and then I promptly fell through the roof and couldnt get out.  Would've been pretty cool if i hadn't died 3 minutes later when the storm moved lol
---
haha hell yes, efficiency is nice sometimes
---
All Unyielding all the time. Bolstering is meh.
---
PC, thanks for the the offer though!
---
We play on pc

You get it while breaking into vault 79 with one of the two factions
---
If I blew up every car I see, I‚Äôd never be able to play lol
---
(my camp is next to a very busy road at whitesprings)
---
lol.  I spent an hour and a half getting frustrated after killing two 3-star Gutsies that didn't count.  Then I find 3 3-star super mutants at harpers ferry within 5 minutes of each other.  This game is so goofy.
---
Options are always a good thing! I just wish the emotes menu wasnt so clunky. Its clearly made for a controller and is not very user friendly on PC. In conclusion, more emotes and ways to communicate please!
---
Put the tin foil hat down
---
Apologies in advance if any of this is stuff you already know ... 
---
Super Duper perk gives a chance to double your ammo batch. As soon as that comes available to you, give it a try along with ammosmith. Also, do not neglect to pick up weights, rat poison, or kids toys as all contain lead. Scrapper perk can net you more from breaking down junk and weapons, and you can start getting lead out of tin and aluminum cans. Can chimes disarms start giving more than tiny XP. 
---
You may also want to get into a routine of selling excess junk and aid items to train stations, and using those caps to buy ammo at player vendors. Just try not to spend more than a cap per bullet. At some point, you may have to narrow which weapons to main. It gets hard spreading resources out across multiple calibers.
---
I actually got 50% less fall damage on my Bolstering LA so I'll stick with it for now until I complete the set and fancy grinding for an Unyielding piece
---
I tend to always fine melee weapons on legendaries i feel. i hate it lol
---
Thanks for the psa hellthesda interplay was better btw
---
I like to hide inside the grafton monster
---
And don‚Äôt get it wrong I was being a conduit for the pylons while having less than 20% of my hp so if you want to defend higher level people who don‚Äôt do anything and get rewarded then the guy who‚Äôs wrong here is you
---
Ok thanks for the help. I didn't realize how much options there is for reputation. Someone just said 2 more methods too. Nice find. This looks like reputation should be obtain way quicker btw is the davenport repeatable or is that a daily too?
---
In Fallout 4, where the guns model comes from, it uses .308 rounds.  They just never transferred the ability over to this game.  The Combat Rifle was designed to be the BAR.  So again, go look at pictures of the gun, its painfully obvious they are the same gun.
---
The best mix is no mix. Full Unyielding. With decent perk cards/mutations you can still hit over 400 DR which is well beyond the point accepted for diminishing returns on DR ER. 
---
My build I am at 540ish DR with full unyielding. You don't need to make concessions. You're just cucking yourself out of extra SPECIAL buffs by not going full unyielding as a low health build. 
---
Ordinarily unyielding is a major buff, but with the legendary run it's more or less mandatory for the int buffs alone let alone everything else. 
---
I'm a heavy bloodied build, but with the proper cards and full unyielding armour I can pretty much use anything and do ok. My SS jetpack loves the fact I can hit over 400 AP, and still do close to 1500 damage a shot with a bloodied lever action I am in no way specced for other than shoehorning in 3 rifleman cards.
---
It really is just the best by a mile. I have like 40-45 strength agility and int with full buffs and I don't specialize at all.
---
Yeah I wish they just get rid of boiled water and just have 2 dirty water to one purified water. Once you have purifiers in your camp no more need to collect dirty water.
---
I like going to the mall that has the red rocket lots of cars and trucks to explode
---
You can make an argument that five 1* unyielding pieces are still better than perfect rolls with another prefix. Unyielding is that powerful.
---
One of the best npcs in the game
---
Thanks! I think that'll help quite a bit.
---
THIS
---
Build a vendor area that you can isolate (turn doorways into walls) and an area where you control the power (that other players can‚Äôt access) or be able to ‚Äòsnip‚Äô the wire.
---
When you want to shut down shop, close off the area and cut the power. 
---
That‚Äôs the only option you have, other than logging off or storing the machines/product.
---
You may be doing "too much" damage and the server is kicking the damage back out at you.  Again junkies is kinda bugged on shotguns right now.
---
Shotguns need a lot of bug fixes and a lot of love.  The rubberbanding health bars from doing too much damage alone is inexcusable.  Hoping they get them fixed cause I love shotguns in almost every other game and it would fit my S.P.E.C.I.A.L. distribution perfectly as an alternative spec.  You aren't alone lol
---
Got in over my head at Whitesprings as a low level player.
---
Managed to knock out a big group of enemies with one grenade starting a chain reaction of car explosions.
---
Easily one of my favorite Fallout moments ever.
---
I feel like people never go to it, so I never really check on it that much. Might benefit from being a full on public event instead
---
the whole T-bills for bullion is dumb as fuck anyway.  there is literally zero point to it.
---
Nice find. I'll look more into this. Is this repeatable or is this a daily too?
---
In their haste to monetize the game they forgot the most important aspect: fun. Instead the game is nothing more than short events to trigger some daily player metric management has dreamed up. The game is going to die a painful death if they don't unbridled the currencies. The game is a deplorable chore. That is not fun.
---
Build a ‚Äúpuzzle base‚Äù for him to solve that incorporates traps like radiation and acid extractor spots. You cant travel away if you‚Äôre taking the acid damage, so the only option will be to die to the radiation
---
I am beginning to think I might had encountered a bug. I was in public group with three friends, and all of them had completed the story already. So my rewards might had of been something tied to theirs. I will experiment with that tonight.
---
That's a great point. The bolstering left arm I just got actually has 50% less fall damage so I'm gonna use it until I finish the set in Unyielding and go back to it.
---
When you get the recipe, you learn that there's bourbon in it, specifically. :)
---
I see the bears attacking the Raider taking zero damage? The Raider is like "Hey, how ya doin?" lol I kill the bears for him. It's sad the Crater - Foundation NPC's don't take damage or fight back? maybe soon they will. I always have the low-level colonel Gutsy's spawn behind me at Crater or after taking a photo at the Lodge, annoying.
---
That's not an issue they just add it into a loop.
---
So where it was:
---
Ammo crafted - check for perk
---
Perk found - roll for extra
---
Extra given
---
They just add the loop on:
---
For X = 1 to %qty
---
Repeat
---
Another vote for 30, tried a bunch of different combos under the turrets in a silo and as long as the agi is 30 (or maybe as low as 27) there really isn‚Äôt any noticeable difference. Certainly not enough to justify 3 perk points.
---
Oh if you guys where on Xbox I would have happily gave you a lvl 35 furious explosive 10mm pistol. Hopefully you can find a good 10mm on pc though!
---
Now that‚Äôs brilliant....and devious! I like your style! üò¨üò¨üò¨
---
I'm hoping there will be some new things as rewards but if i was a betting man (and knowing how bughesda operates), i would put my money on -&gt; No, there won't be any new things.
---
She hates the service revolver (the slow firing) but just googled the western and it sounds like the western is more like a .44 but stronger and so might have her use that for tough ones and the 10mm on weaker stuff. 
---
Do you die often as bloodied? thats her worry
---
My best :D
---
I don't think I've done the settlers quests yet.
---
Yep. That‚Äôs where my car explosion addiction started. Standing in that parking lot...I told my friend ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna blow this car up.‚Äù And I did, indeed, blow that car up. And it, in turn, blew up far more cars than I anticipated, killing us both. And she called me a dumbass.
---
10/10 recommended activity for any player.
---
I know right! We'd appreciate if you could help blow this up across everywhere!
---
Full unyielding
---
Thats what I do if I cant find the ammo I use.
---
New rewards i know of are-
---
Dirty Chally costume
---
Brahmin grill
---
Tenderizer plan
---
Unfortunately, even that isn't foolproof. I can't tell you the number of CAMPs that I've come up on that are still rendering. I've learned to just stand and wait for it to render, but early on I would get myself "stuck" in locked rooms because I started going towards the CAMP before it fully rendered.
---
This is my favorite insult I've received so far. After putting in 500 hrs, I've only been insulted 12  times. 
---
https://youtu.be/j8PFvyGjU6U
---
1- it‚Äôs been fine. With the legendary run it is basically the SSDD
---
2- it‚Äôs fallout, so yup, and it is a crap shot as too if they affect you
---
3- Yup, you make it what you want. I personally do events and travel around and help people and what not. I spend less time fast traveling and more time waking and experiencing the things within the game
---
4- I am okay with things provided they keep to their proposed timelines, but some people are not happy unless there is new stuff every week, to each their own
---
5- Same as always if not worse since you don‚Äôt get atoms from dailies and instead get score for the game board 
---
6- Yup and I have. The stash is nice but with proper balancing you can keep the weapons and armor you like and enough scrap to be okay. Unless you need 1,000s of junk items to death safe and secure. You don‚Äôt need it, IMO
---
PS: if you get the PS5, but an external drive the same day, as it is easier to setup then and tell the system where to put stuff, as I could not imagine having only 500gb with games being so big these days.
---
Buuhuuhuu, did you mom deny you the allowance for f1st?
---
If you are on ps4 and you spot it just head on over and check out how smooth it actually is. I spend ages just running up and down it haha.
---
Just leaving this here so you can maximize your rep gains  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zTLDp5d4hNtsWkZnUKw8Ek-EYogqbaJ7UdAc7i5kIuw/edit#gid=844208859](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zTLDp5d4hNtsWkZnUKw8Ek-EYogqbaJ7UdAc7i5kIuw/edit#gid=844208859)
---
They don't look like they"ll be snapable unfortunately
---
I'm on xbox sadly
---
What weapon are you using?
---
Yeah I would thinks so too, but I like how you can manually start this event. Who knows. I really enjoyed it back then.
---
Wow, that is by far the best player built structure I've seen in the game. Great work.
---
My grandmother killed a legendary in Uranium Fever without letting others get a whack and she felt so terrible, she asked if there was a "I'm sorry" emote, I had to let her down :(
---
I started with bolstering myself, and didn't see the point of unyielding... Until I tried it. 
---
Once you find out/accept that DR/ER stop being that important beyond a certain point, i.e stuff that can't touch you at 350 still can't at 600, but stuff that melts you at 350 still will at 600 (like Assaultrons, high level ballstic gutsies etc) then you realise it doesn't matter and you can fine tune into other stuff more usefully. 
---
The jetpack can be a bit finicky if you decide to use it, but honestly for me, what marsupial is to standard characters is what the jetpack is to marsupial. I wouldn't be without it and with bird bones/serendipity you can get away with a lot of mistakes and pissing about. 
---
I often jump from tanagra town and see if I can survive with jetpack bursts. It makes a whole new game/world trying to live through jetpack usage when travelling about. you can cater to it but again I think it's a waste. 
---
Herd mentality and strange in numbers in a public group, you are basically a wasteland super hero if you have good mutations and a SS jetpack with unyielding :D
---
After you get in with either faction?
---
I built a labyrinth with two overloaded power-grids so i could mess with doors turning on and off as you progress through... and a dead end with this exact trap. Stuck one of my vendor machines in the room and filled it with hats and other silly shit, along with some of the notes like ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs The Damn Key?‚Äù
---
As long as they don't have a massive collision area that should be fine. More flexibility that way.
---
Wow an I just sold the one I had from over a year ago on my vendor for 50 caps...
---
One other thing ... To solve the gunpowder challenge, acid can be collected from antifreeze, coolant, abraxo, bloodbug proboscis, bloatfly glands, and makeshift batteries (which also have lead). Gunpowder is heavy, so I tend to craft as I need at chemistry benches.
---
You can do them up until you have to choose a side. So even if you want to side with the raiders you can still do the settlers quests up to a point and get the stealth suit. The game will warn you when you have to make your final choice so just look out for that.
---
Oh yeah, I'm obsessed and I ain't talking about 76 &gt;:)
---
Really sad this will get deleted before so many have the chance to see this masterful comedic performance.
---
Davenport is repeatable daily
---
Ok. So if they never added it to this , than here's their opportunity to add in the B.A.R. it shouldn't be hard to do.
---
I used to have a character that had all 16 mutations in the game and his special stats were far worse then my junkies build or bloodied build. So you either have no cap and you give every mutation a little bit of extra damage wich would still make it underpowered  compared to bloodied or junkies, or you could give it similar stats and it would actually be a viable build.
---
Guess we'll have to wait and see but for the moment I assume they'll work like in fo4
---
The real rewards are the friends we make at the cookout.
---
I've never really had issues with gunpowder (usually the missing ingredient is steel) but I'll make sure to keep it in mind if I run out. Thanks again for the advice.
---
What Protectron?
---
You can earn rep with both. At a certain level itd be cool
---
The BAR is already in the game, all you want is the ability to make it shoot .308 rounds like it did in Fallout 4
---
Thanks for the help and nice find. Thats definitely going to be useful.
---
I got mocked by my last pub team for nuking there, but I got the flux for a ss jetpack. The grind is finally over
---
Beotherhood protectron/collectron is one of the rewards
---
Athletic zombies have been a problem in entertainment media for far too long. Nerf them back to Romero speeds.
---
I die about the same. I use a variety of damage reductions and dodges to help. I can share my build after a work meeting.
---
The western is slow but I 1-2 shot most non boss things.
---
That's a shame but we'd really appreciate it if you'd help get this out there so Bethesda sees it.
---
Got it within a minute or two of logging in thanks to the Mole Miner event. Radiation Rumble?
---
I. Can't. Stop.
---
If you want to level up quickly, I have an xp run I use. Well rested, leader bobblehead and either cranberry relish or tasty squirrel stew if you have  the carnivore mutation. Start at the substation just north of Watoga for the deathclaw. Head to Huntersville. Then the investigators cabin...there‚Äôs a rest stop just north that spawns super mutants and usually something big to fight them. Then Wes Tek. Then the National Isolated Radio Array. The General‚Äôs Steakhouse. Harper‚Äôs Ferry. By the time you get to Harper‚Äôs Ferry things should be respawing. Go back to the beginning of the run or hop worlds if things aren‚Äôt respawned. The added benefit is you usually get 2 or three legendaries to spawn, also.
---
Davy Jones is a crazy good builder. Dude puts waaaay more effort that anyone I've ever seen into a camp.
---
gourmands gang where you at
---
Unyielding is always better, as long as you're sneaking and not getting thwacked around a lot.
---
Bolstering is a passable fallback, though, if it has effects you want.  Finding Unyielding with AP, Sent, Cav, Sneak, etc. can be difficult, but if you can find a Bolstering piece that does that, you might sacrifice the benefits of an Unyielding piece for it.
---
Yeah it's a shame those can't be added to the actual game to **earn** through gameplay instead of just buying with real money.
---
I was told it still does just doesn't say it does I have the mod on my armor as well
---
woo! pay real money to use these things we **literally** just  copy pasted over from Fallout 4!
---
Not everyone sells ammo, but most people will look for vendors that sell that ammo when completing this challenge.
---
I‚Äôd rather just be able to use legendary modules and craft specific weapons. Like how the SS armor and the Gauss weapons work.
---
Yeah was gonna say, I was worried about this daily and Uranium Fever sorted me out. Got a bloodied combat shotgun and Fe Gatling gun aswell - always get good weapons at level 40 FML.
---
I usually roll with 4x Unyield 1x Life saving with revenant perk or 3xUnyield 2x life saving.
---
If the feral ghouls ever learn to climb we are so screwed. 
---
Get the blocker perk, can't imagine playing without it!
---
You know the power fist is also affected by iron first right?
---
Hiding in a BR game is being a coward. If you don't like the mode don't play it. You will survive without the dailies. 
---
Where did you find pvp in the regular game lolüòÖ
---
That's a drag. I don't ever move my camp... I put it in a spot near new gad that no one else seems to use and I drop my tent when I need access to my stash when I'm far from camp or a red rocket, so I've only had to move mine a couple times since blueprinting everything and making several versions of my house.   
---
After I knock out some more challenges I'm going to buy the red rocket garage from the atom store and tear down my whole house, and drop the greenhouse with a bed and guitar in it, and the red rocket with my crafting benches and stash to be able to free up more budget for water purification, tato plants, corn, mutfruit, melon, and gourd then I'm going to put up a sign letting everyone know that they can harvest as much as they want from my fuckhueg adhesive farm. After that the only difficult part about moving my camp will be making sure there's water and dirt and replanting everything since all the other stuff will be stored in the greenhouse and garage as an auto-blueprint.
---
Name any other game where perk/ability can remain **completely** broken - i.e not working **at all**, for over a fucking **MONTH** without being fixed.
---
I would form my own. Slavers.
---
Nope. Killed one, got it. 
---
Good thing too. Its like one of the three that didn't autocomplete today. 
---
Supermutant btw.
---
Sorry emote! 
---
I would have killed for one yesterday when i forgot to change my gun in uranium fever and oneshotted a ledgendary while we where waiting for everyone to get a shot in on it. Got a lot of thumbs down and had no way of communicating back that i knew i made a mistake and that im not really a dic@
---
I finished it from killing SBQ
---
Are you a Legion Guy?
---
But Slavers  would be cool nontherles
---
Slocum and Marigold are random encounters where you can get a chance to help one side for a small amount of rep, just server hop. I think you used to be able to do the same with Bones at Ohio river adventure. youtube it :-) they arent dailys
---
He scared the crap outta me one time when he teleported to my face and did a flappy flappy
---
Kind of a shame to finally toss out my tenderizer, but  finally a plan for it. A 20 pound non-craftable novelty reward, top tier ideas there
---
The .308 version of the combat rifle is sniping and obviously not a BAR.  But if you say the combat rifle is made from the BAR, then they should easily add it to the game.
---
No, thank you.
---
Awesome. Thanks again. I'll definitely look into this.
---
Post your build
---
Maybe if it gets destroyed a bee swarm comes out? Just a tiny feature that might add a bit more realism to it on top of everything else
---
Every single car I see, I punch. My friends call me punch happy
---
Ya, i had to move mine to an alt bc 20 stash weight just to put it on my wall was too much.
---
thought he was talking about Enclave, but now I see the BoS one, thanks for the heads up. I'm excited!
---
Yes i know, and?
---
I‚Äôve done it twice with friends punching it bare fists and the only thing extra we got was the 1star Nailer. It would actually be nice to have a shot at a 3star Nailer if it was ever added but at this point that seems delusional
---
Oh man. I got nukashined like that. When I woke up I was standing in front of a friendly raider so I took him in as an ally and now I have a bar at my camp where I can get nuka cola quantum. So whoever shined me did me a HUGE favor and got me the very first ally in my camp. And also caused me to Google nukashine to figure out wtf just happened lol. Then I went and did the quest for it and got a bunch of really cool chess pieces out of the frat house. I just wish they'd give us a chess board option that works like display cases/magazine and bobble racks that we can use to store chess pieces and robot models instead of only being able to put them in display cases that hold 4 things.
---
For sure super annoying.  But on the other hand, my bloodied rifle also should be doing a pretty good amount of damage and it def isn't.
---
A few days ago I had a mirelurk king kill me in 2 hits cuz my gun was just giving him little flesh wounds lol
---
Well i just  soloed a 3\*  wedigo coll for a 1\* noctunal pipe pistol. yippee.
---
Yes, just interact with it once you've repaired it. No noise, but the generator is still functional.
---
Ok. Im going to youtube it now btw thanks again. It been taking forever to increase reputation but this looks like a useful method too
---
I keep my cola machine stocked with nukashine as well as a small assortment of liquors and beer. But a small txt warning says ‚Äúget nuked‚Äù and it‚Äôs a Russian roulette for what drink you might get. üòà
---
Add Abandoned Bog Town to that run if you head north. Place is loaded with Super Mutants, a Behemoth and the Pylon usually has Gulpers, Fog Crawlers or Anglers! :D (edit: typo)
---
Ok, i'll try and unequip/equip and se if dmg numbers change ü§î thank you for your reply üëç
---
1 like = 1 yes
---
Yes I cannot walk through the White Springs resort without blowing up every car in in their
---
The Crater &amp; Foundation icons from the Twitch bundle don't work, the Escape Artist icon doesn't work, neither does the Grease Monkey Icon, the Chemist icon doesn't seem to work either.  
---
Whenever I equip any of those, my ingame icon displays invisible!
---
I'm still out here wondering when that helicopter jet pack thing is gonna be released.
---
No problem let me know if it works I just kinda took the person's word for it and was like "if it doesn't work they will make it eventually" since I had already bought the plan
---
Ok so I just re ran it with the full excavator pa on and I got 364 ore...there were some that still showed they could be mined, but the game wouldn‚Äôt allow me to click it anymore...so I feel good enough now and after all your helps that I have found all the nodes.
---
Yeah my inventory has at least 1 type from every set, troubleshooter is key to encrypted! I even made some ultralight armors with -20% weight stats for my fat runs or I keep an excavator armor with fat legs etc
---
What do you think the .45 ACP, 20-round magazine Combat Rifle is analogous to? You're not getting a BAR in this game for the same reason the AK is a 'Handmade Rifle' - or rather, you already have it in the form of the Combat Rifle. I'm not sure why the Handmade looks so much closer to 1:1 with an AK than the Combat Rifle does to the BAR or the Assault Rifle does a Lewis gun.
---
At any rate if you can't get away with saying 'AK' because of copyright then legally it's going to be a fuck of a lot harder for a BAR. No one is going to sue you (or at least not successfully) for copyright for calling an AK an AK but someone probably would for a BAR.
---
Faschnacht had a few new masks and some new camp items...
---
Its even funnier to do so with an unarmed build and to tank the explosion with fire proof and serendipity!
---
"apparently complaining about it fixed it"
---
Please don't give people that hope.
---
With the dense armor mod you can jump through the explosions and feel like you‚Äôre in an action movie.
---
Top play right there. Champ!
---
Yes.   There is an area chat that lets you hear people that are nearby.      I usually just have mine set to team.
---
Same here! I use Nukashine when I get bored. Take a sip, find a landing place, and force myself to do the walk of shame back to my camp.
---
Still an exploit.If you justify one exploit, you justify all exploit.
---
Replace "xp" by "item", and you find cool to be a duper.
---
Someone's bored today.....
---
...and boring .....
---
I hate that I've become this way too. I actually play NW because I enjoy finding hiding spots.
---
You mean there are players who aren‚Äôt? I fell bad when I do it and a low level is standing next to a car but I quickly recover and do it again
---
Everything in the game has a shiny effect ffs
---
Pic 42and 43 in the second link show a red one. I‚Äôm hoping that comes in a bundle with the red commie skin
---
Gotcha! I just thought it would be more fun with a better looking BAR.
---
I just did the same thing a few months ago at lvl 250'ish. I even looked directly up at the last moment to see the nuke heading right for me. It was awesome.
---
My husband, especially if I'm standing near them lol

Sheepsquatch from free range count?

It‚Äôs how you get the best selfies. Shoot car once with a weaker weapon, get your selfie in frame and filtered to your liking while the car‚Äôs health meter slowly drops, snap pic at moment of explosion. Bad Boys for life.
---
Thank you SOOOO much.  Was losing my mind :(
---
Just the way your phrased it made it sound like you didn't. You'd be surprised by the number of people who think the power fist and dcg are affected by gladiator perks
---
I've been having weird issues with mirelurk kings too lately and it's not just their redonkulous poison.  Sometimes I'm 2 shotting them, other times 50 bullets later and they're still alive whooping my ass.  Bloodied nerd rage heavy weapons and demolitions spec though, no rifle perks at all.
---
I say enjoy the extra challenge while you can or stray to where your level is supposed to be.
---
hehe not really, you'll go crazy. I still think dailys are the best
---
It is a main quest
---
im convinced bethesda is never going to bother balancing this game. When each new boss **requires** a bloodied build or else you don't do enough damage, you've designed your game poorly.
---
Emotes are great, but I wish they'd let me hotkey some of my photomode poses as well.
---
Nice effort.  Stick with it!  You'll be better at humor by the time you're 12 or 13.
---
He regularly walks by hemlock holes maintenance, on the road.   Every time I take that workshop and hold it for more than an hour or so, I see him pass through during one of my defends.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen from time to time, which is why I server hop and immediately to go Murghgh while the game is still loading the server. Ie you‚Äôre still in that weird loading in state
---
I look around at a few camps for things I may want or need before resorting to that, so it‚Äôs not a total failure for everyone.
---
Should be able to place them at our camps.
---
Coming to the atom store :)
---
Project Paradise. I solo it and get a 3* sheepsquach all the time.
---
you're the reason nothing ever gets added to the game and instead gets added to the atom store.
---
Oh sorry, english is not my main language so i may fuc# up on my phrasing üòÖ i know it affects power fists, the settlers gauntlet, dcg and the hook, wich is why i was confused as to why the brawler mod dident.
---
I mean... it‚Äôs not but ok
---
You can get addicted to the tea lol that happened to me. I was like "What in teanation! addicted to tea!? lol
---
Yeah, and if the AK and Lewis gun looked exactly right that would be swell too. Seeing all the little differences sticks out jarringly to me.
---
In the meantime, at least we can use clientside replacement textures. If you're on PC any of this is just a mod away.
---
Lol true and i believe you.
---
The logs on the ground can be farmed for wood scraps. It will add up quickly.
---
imagine playing one of the most broken ass game without using minor exploits and just bitching about it on reddit. What are you, 6 ?
---
No thanks

I‚Äôve read on here a few times that if you blueprint your vendors it saves everything in them and you can just drop your blueprint

Oh i see

I just really hope that someone could find opinions like this, changed and more positive and are able to see the really beauty that Fallout 76 has. It is truly a very good game that does have issues but there‚Äôs truly a great game to be found if people would allow themselves to discover. Plus, I‚Äôve only ever found the community to be absolutely lovely. I will always thank that one level 200+ that gave me some really good low level gear that game me the edge I needed to truly fall in love with it. Wastelanders has done wonders and I truly cannot wait for the future content, content that seems to have community feedback in-mind. It‚Äôs a beautiful game and I hope that more people can see it. I know it‚Äôs not for ever Fallout fan, not for ever Bethesda fan, nor for every gamer but neither is any game. But, it‚Äôs a game that truly doesn‚Äôt deserve its past to corrupt its future.
---
The downside is they became less fun to fight. They became more jittery and tanky, so they're harder to hit unless you're using an automatic or VATS all the time.
---
People like the Fallout 3/NV versions because it was like a zombie shooting gallery. They ran, but they weren't nearly fast as they are now.  Cannon fodder, but still dangerous at higher-levels, especially if you were in Fallout 3 where Reavers may as well have been that game's version of what Charred Feral Ghouls are in Fallout 4.
---
The biggest fault in fighting them in 76 is you can't dismember their limbs anymore like you could in Fallout 4.  There's no feedback to hitting them with powerful enough weapons, which really sucks. They had to simplify 76 so much ghouls don't even dodge anymore either, but their run and idle animations are so jittery they're still naturally evasive without it.
---
This right here.
---
It‚Äôs perfect for mele as you need to collect the drops from radstags.
---
Settlers are definitely the right step towards a functioning society. For anyone who has watched the walking dead, it‚Äôs one thing they touched heavily on was how dependent this raider sort of lifestyle was on other people - basically the same way that governments can only survive because they have a population to tax. 
---
Some raiders specifically stated they had no desire to go to war with the settlers because they needed the resources. If Bethesda does plan on fleshing out both factions, I think we‚Äôll see the raiders change drastically. If you side with them, it ends with a major power vacuum, while the settlers seem to have too many cooks in the kitchen. Less trusted allies, former military who seem to be growing(evidence being small group of soldier random encounters), and the existing settlers who seem to be transitioning from a community mentality to a republic when we meet them. 
---
Would be fun to see an early government form through the settlers with this game like the NCR did and see how raiders respond, now that most of the xenophobes/warmongers were killed. All that being said, I‚Äôm not really worrying myself with what‚Äôs better long-term. I much prefer following the more exciting path. It just seems like there‚Äôs a lot more fun to be had with the raiders who are making the wasteland in their image rather than the settlers who basically want things to go back to the way it was pre-war.
---
I‚Äôve read that if you blueprint your vendors it saves everything in them, so you can just blueprint and delete them and just drop your blueprint once you spend some caps
---
I'll use whatever I need to in order to get at least 1 creature to Level 3 and take down the Alpha ASAP

Not all energy weapons are crap, but most are. If you can find a quad Tesla with an auto barrel or a TS ultracite laser with a beam splitter and scope you can do some surprising damage. There are of course glitched/legacy weapons that are monsters but I'm just talking about stuff one could possibly actually roll for.
---
You need the fragment venison x 60
---
Busy sharing cannibal with my public group, of course.
---
Huh seems like a lot of people are experiencing something similar. When I think about it it's the same way for me I'll have to try hopping servers next time.
---
I think I have about a dozen gas masks, flag plans &amp; outfits at this point (beyond what I've sold).
---
Sadly you either have luck with your server (well, the players on it) or not.And you will have to switch servers at that point, because one person starts to one-shot everything and all others, who **can** but usually **don't**, think "Well, before i get nothing..." and start one-shotting too. And thus the server is in "bloodied only"-mode.
---
Yesterday was not so lucky for me. Throughout the day on 3 different servers, a total of ...7? SBQs and on 5 of them i couldn't get loot. And it weren't always high levels who did it. There are some mean lvl 70s around.
---
On the other hand, today, at my first SBQ: lvl 800+ low hp; lvl 600+ low hp; lvl 600+ low hp and stealthed.
---
Oh boy was i sure i would get nothing. But they were really holding back, that was a welcome change and i'm grateful to those (and such) players.
---
I thought this was MERICA
---
I'm sure someone has answered but:    
---
Inside the Crator in the mainplace where Meg is there's a GOLD machine for it and the Mr. Handy(named) is the Vendor that sells the Raider stuff.    
---
At the Settler place it's on the R before you go into the Elevator to go underground. There is a max per day so don't go over it. I think there's a max you can have as well so be careful in what you buy.    
---
The Shielded Lining is the best(I think) for the Underarmor so don't bother with the lower tiers. Even then you'll still need the mats to craft it.

Get your rubber bands loosened up, drummers / meat spinners!

Whitespring Golf course clue house is also a great spot to check. It had three for me today.
---
Huh, that‚Äôs interesting. I thought it was for both. Well that‚Äôs good to know!
---
Can‚Äôt do that. 
---
They work with the gold bullion weapons and armor.
---
Interested aswell
---
We can only dream aye
---
1. Who was the barley English guy 
---
2. You can only use them for stuff you buy at the gold bullion vendor npc like regs and the guys‚Äôd at foundation and crater
---
The lines of cars by the mega Red Rocket up north is a lot of fun to chuck a few grenades at! Everytime I do the Pumpkin House quest, I treat myself to some explosions
---
They can only be used to craft new weapons and armor from the wastelanders dlc. You have to collect gold bullion to buy the recipes for them. Then go to the purveyor and buy the modules. Then go to a workbench to create the weapon. The legendary effects are completely random.
---
Thats bs, why do i have to just buy Random legendary boxes over and over again in hope i get the weapon i want, but in the end only getting a mutant slayers crossbow
---
You can't make those items as legendary using legendary modules. Legendary modules are automaticly used when crafting items that require them. Those being the new weapons and armor that came with Wastelanders DLC (like gauss shotgun, gauss minigun, secret service armors etc etc). To be able to craft them, you first need to buy plans for them using gold bullion.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Toxic valley is loaded with fallen trees.
---
The lumber mill near vault 76 - loot the woodpiles, then talk to the bots.   At least one of them will give you wood splinters.  Watch out for ticks though :)
---
I've heard the gat laser does more single target damage compared to the AoE effect of the gat plasma. Would you still take the gat plasma over the gat laser for boss fights?
---
Go to Sylvie &amp; Sons with woodchucker equipped. All the wood you'll ever want.
---
I love insult bot
---
My friends and I do this all the time. One more than the others.
---
Are you sure i could have sworn you were supposed to launch a nuke
---
Well for me I guess the purpose of the event is to complete it and defending higher level animals makes that easier
---
3 star would be a good reward, definitely worth the extra effort it takes.
---
Being a Heavy Guns Build, I imagine you have a high STR so I'd consider ranking up 1H or 2H Melee and getting a decent melee weapon to swap too when ammo is running out.  Automatic Weapons chew through ammo super quick where as melee requires nothing but weapon repairs. If it's a couple Scorched, hack em up... If it's something nastier, that's when you whip out the gatling.
---
He is the true anti-hero of this game, isn't he? It's a flat cake if he doesn't get a weekend or special event, sort of like Santa Claus, where 12,000 are out there simultaneously giving insults over the course of one night.
---
I'm honestly happier about my space. I had it up on my wall with the other collector's items, but now that it's going to be more common, I can replace it with something else. The 20 stash space will be nice too though
---
That‚Äôs not true at all. Let‚Äôs be honest here - Bethesda is going to add things to the Atom Shop regardless of whether or not I play. It‚Äôs money for them. The game is based around grinding and atom transactions. It‚Äôs not as bad as GTA5, but it‚Äôs still at the heart of this game. 
---
I don‚Äôt know who peed in your Cheerios, mate but it wasn‚Äôt me. I‚Äôm just giving my thoughts on it. If you don‚Äôt like the way this game was designed, don‚Äôt play it. It‚Äôs 2020 and the options for games to play is huge.
---
Hahaha everyday I see this same post
---
Me too me too! Everytime I do any teapot challenge I have to do that blow up car thing before I leave. Then I walked through flatwoods and blow up every car also.
---
The only interaction I had with Grahm was my camp defense attacked him and I fast traveled to watch him destroy my camp. I count interest with him because he was in combat and had to hop servers.
---
Back on the beat, baby! It's awesome to farm, then watch the event come up, and do it again.
---
Buddy of mine play this game when we do glitched Line in the Sand: pick up all the loot (which got me over 1000 one time) and the chug a Nukashine.
---
Same thing with Colossus balls soon. It's not 20 pounds but those still weigh a decent amount and everyone will have them after the new event is live.
---
I guess you‚Äôre right. I like trying for the bear arm plans though but to each their own
---
My ex-wife propably. She has some tendencies to give wood to random men.
---
Let's see your memorial shrines to Galen!  I'm sure Nate will appreciate it.
---
Wanted to second this. Everything I read seemed to indicate the auto nukes on PTS were soley to make testing the new event more accessible.
---
New rewards have already been confirmed.
---
Working as intended, kill them or be killed.
---
If weight is not an issue at the moment, try out both against different enemies and see which is better for your build.
---
(AA may do better against bots and turrets)  ~~Also may depend on the 2nd star on that TSE.~~
---
Classic bad fun post. Here comes the sarcastic responses.
---
That would be a QOL improvement, Bethesda doesn't know how to implement those haha
---
Thank you ü§£

---
Supposedly, the brawling mod doesn't show any difference to the damage numbers.  But when they tested it with PVP, the opponent took more damage when the mod was equipped.
---
Confirmed as meat week event rewards? Or possible meat week event rewards instead of more likely atomshop items? I have seen the new item pictures and nothing indicates they are from the event itself. Or the other way around.
---
Just curious, do you have all the proper dmg reduc perks? I assume you‚Äôre using a berserker or bloodied build when your hp is worth so little. 
---
Chameleon armor is fun, but you don‚Äôt really get anything for having more than one outside of the Cham mutation being useable, so you‚Äôre sacrificing a lot of effective legendary perks and time for only a small boost. This is all personal opinion based on my experience with the build though. I‚Äôm just assuming the math wouldn‚Äôt be much better. Plus rad resist will still be 1/3 of your stealth suit. Still a great number, but no more high rad zones sadly
---
Has anyone put a support ticket or a thread on official forum over this?
---
Mole rats also drop sludge, more reason to not launch the bodies into orbit
---
The parking lot at Dyer Chemical isn‚Äôt half bad either.

Oh ok, thank you üëçüëç

Everything you said was absolute garbage and useless. 
---
There‚Äôs nothing there but a whole bunch of assumptions in it. 
---
I‚Äôd wish you a good life.
---
My punch bowl is the same üòÇüòÇ
---
I‚Äôd rather have one in the middle of the map, splitting the distance between foundation and crater.
---
At the Wayward, perhaps?
---
I just wish we had more options to lure mobs to the cars and then got credit for blowing them up
---
lol it doesn't stimulate anything i simply go buy the first person who has ammo 3 caps is all they ever get. if they donst sell ammo i dont go. i spend way more on the fast travel then the actual sale. every time
---
Well unless they're going to start selling weapon plans in the shop I think it's pretty safe to say they're Meat Week rewards.
---
If you left because you didn't like wastelanders or the direction of the way the game was heading (in terms of grind) youre just simply not gonna enjoy it if you come back.
---
The game is simply a time gated grind so you can't even grind certain aspects of the game even if you wanted to. 
---
After a while youre gonna remember the exact reason you stopped playing.
---
Same. I have left arm and leg and chest as unyielding and got them pretty quick. The others I keep getting garbage rolls. Sometimes I get the same back to back.
---
There are observations of patent fact - as to how you interpret that as a bunch of assumption, not quite certain.
---
People need to read up on how words generate specific meanings.
---
In my experience, it should be guaranteed for just being there when she‚Äôs killed. It‚Äôs an event reward and events are just about proximity, not participation. That‚Äôs why we get a legendary item for completing the SBQ event and for killing the SBQ, so afk campers or new players can‚Äôt just do nothing and get the same rewards as the guy unloading all his ultracite ammo.
---
A new cryptid has emerged
---
Got lucky with a 3 star rad rat horde boss in the toxic valley.
---
A long while ago I helped a low level in a nuked Whitespring. I visited their camp near Morgantown, not bad, then later saw their camp was near Watoga? Turns out the low level was an alt. They had a 3* bloodied deathclaw gauntlet and sold it to me for like 500 caps. I still have that gauntlet now, 160+ levels later. You never know who you‚Äôre helping or who‚Äôs day might be made.
---
Still need the flag plan so I keep doing it more often. Also helps that the event can throw out multiple legendaries to get those challenges completed, and I get a pepperoni roll for carry weight management while I grind out my daily caps and bonds and rep and scrip. Extra treasury bonds are nice but I already have a good number in reserve.
---
Ah haven't seen any weapon mod plans mentioned anywhere. You happen to have link? I'm most interrested in seeing them. Or is the weapon mod plan just a hunch based on some image of a new skin?
---
Good god yes! I lure enemies into groups of cars and use the cars to kill them just for the fun factor
---
üò≥
---
Ah you're right, I think I'm gonna try the SS armor and if it dosent feel right I'll go back to the stealth suit, and the only damage reduc perks I'm using are serendipity and Nerd rage.
---
Oh shish. I did not see that.
---
Nice.
---
Yeah that would be dope.
---
Wow that's high alright haha. I'm only around 110
---
I don‚Äôt know about a better legendary grind. One guaranteed legendary and possibly more. This morning I got 4 legendaries total with a party size of 3 players. Hard to beat for 15 min of play.
---
Not a rifle, but so far, my zealots focused gatling plasma does the highest per hit damage (for my build, anyway) against normal SBs. 
---
Havent tried it out against the queen though.
---
Welcome to how it has worked  before they added wastelanders. Before wastelanders, there was no gold bullion, no legendary modules, you just had to gamble and hope.
---
Also, in no prior fallout game with legendary weapons were you able to specifically create any weapon without a mod to spawn them.
---
Well said!
---
No game is for everyone, but hating on them needlessly doesn't help. As for 76, you get out of it what you want to get out of it, I think. Some people just always wanna hate and can't appreciate when something isn't *exactly* the way they want it to be.
---
Having trouble finding any 3* today
---
Uranium Fever.  Radiation Rumble is the ore/ghoul event.
---
It‚Äôs just nice to be nice, regardless of level. It‚Äôs not something i do all the time. But if i see that i can do something to help someone else I‚Äôll at least tryüëç
---
Wouldn't bother bulking unless you're desperately hurting for stash space (and even then, iinm it's only lead and aluminum that weight slightly less in bulk) or trying to sell to npcs. Players will buy loose junk, you only end up wasting plastic by bulking everything.
---
Wow. More garbage. 
---
And you can‚Äôt even write. 
---
How embarrassing that your trying to insult someone and you can‚Äôt even write a decent sentence.
---
At least you had the decency to delete your previous weird comment.
---
And if I decide to use the Cham armor, I'll only have one piece be Cham, while I'll have unyeilding or vanguards, whichever one increases dmg resistance the lower your health.
---
I find that I have more luck with harpers ferry and white spring than I‚Äôve ever had with the event it may just be my preference but I‚Äôd go for those 2 places over riding shotgun any day of the week

Actually the Plasma Caster was from FO1 &amp; 2 first, but back then it was called the Plasma Rifle, or the Turbo Plasma Rifle;

Plans for the Tenderizer is the only one I think. They were posted about on here a while ago.
---
The week before Halloween actually
---
Log in. 
---
Trade 20 notes to hit daily gold cap
---
Trade water to hit daily cap cap
---
Trade 4 legendaries to hit daily scrip cap
---
Look at stash and see that I have 8 more days worth of supplies to hit the daily caps without actually playing. 
---
Think about the stuff I‚Äôll be able to buy in 28 more days. 
---
Log off.
---
I always blow up cars when my friends are near them, it‚Äôs worth losing the stimpaks
---
Its good. Especially if you are new.
---
Its also on game-pass, give it a go.
---
Maybe you have had better luck than me. Both are in my grind and at least half the time I never see a legendary at those locations.
---
You can get calibrated shocks as a mod from Camden Park vendor, but that'll take a lot of server hops
---
Lmao yes me
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs once per day
---
[Ah yup](https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/dashsixteen/screenshot/18361661)
---
I‚Äôve played it since beta it was a shit show but now it‚Äôs really fun I enjoy it you should give it a go
---
it stores everything in blueprints so you don't lose anything.
---
just convert the blueprints to stored items once you place the CAMP in the new spot and everything is now in stored items menu.
---
Have you played the Elder Scrolls Online it's really fun do you feel it will one day be as good
---
Here is my bloodied slinger build
---
[Bloodied Slinger](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=36918fe&amp;d=p02ej4a31l71lk2pb2ad2ak2al2e52ce0l12ar2ir2la2sg2eu0ic4lt2ao0&amp;m=51c2feb3&amp;n=girl)
---
Typically you can do this through a .ba2 file. There are mods on the nexus that already do what you are asking so you could add them. Once downloaded you would incorporate that mod file in you fo76 data folder and create a custom .ini that references the mod. After that you are smooth sailing.
---
However, it is important to note that you will not be able to play NW with altered files. You won't get banned, you just won't be able to load in. 
---
Modding is safe and protected in the terms of service as long as it does not provide competitive advantage. Furthermore,  modding is not supported by Bethesda directly so you take responsiblity if you mess up your game.
---
Vendor items and display items remain in your stash anyway, so they just become unattached from the display stand and stay in the stash.
---
I have two disabled friends with whom I regularly play. One is deaf, one is mute. A mic is not the solution to everything.
---
should of had her stand dead center for the achievement for getting hit with a nuke
---
It does not make sense lore-wise.
---
You get gold from one of the cities in exchange for notes, then you can spend that currency.
---
But 79 want to hoard the gold back.
---
I‚Äôll try this out.  I haven‚Äôt even done anything with blueprints tbh.  I‚Äôve rebuilt my camp so many times too
---
I didn't know anyone used bolstering
---
I believe you get everything stored in the same format from before you move, say you have a house, the foundation and everything on that will be one blueprint and a shed will be another blueprint, now this might have changed but the last time I moved my camp it was all stored.
---
I've played the Elder Scrolls Online and enjoyed it so hopefully I enjoy this I'm not expecting the same game of course but Fallout 76 definitely could take a few pages from the Elder Scrolls Online
---
Ok and thanks again. I'm definitely going to look more into this.
---
I feel your pain on the level range in that event. Was easy to knock out the score though so I‚Äôll take it.
---
Since theres a plan, j wouldnt be suprised if its added to the purveyor pool once you learn it.
---
Dont worry, I know what you speaking off. (-:
---
Revenants were no joke in FO3. They were ridiculous bullet sponges.
---
Like any Bethesda game there are bugs and glitches but honestly, if you like fallout you‚Äôll like this game. I love the series and have been a devoted player since 2008 when FO3 dropped. FO76 is different from the others in some ways‚Äîsome would say worse, but I think the pros outweigh the cons. Even if you don‚Äôt have friends who play, the community is awesome and public teams make it easy to enjoy the benefits of it being an online game. 
---
Pros:
---
-fun multiplayer game play
---
-camp system is really cool and you can get creative with it
---
-community is awesome and makes it enjoyable to do team events
---
-interesting new lore and side story lines
---
Cons:
---
-main story isn‚Äôt all that intriguing
---
-bugs / glitches you have to work through
---
-new patches always feel like they are still a work in progress
---
I was doing Tea Time by myself, and wasn‚Äôt having too hard a time because it‚Äôs admittedly one of the easiest events. I was waiting for another wave of creatures and just running around to see if I missed anything, when I noticed another player nearby. Big guy in full power armor, level 120+, hiding behind the cars in the Red Rocket lot so I wouldn‚Äôt see him piggybacking off my work! 
---
So I blew up all the cars. üòÅ
---
Oh yeah it definitely could at the same time though someone else handled eso Bethesda handled 76 themselves
---
I think it automatically blueprints your camp, but it's unlikely you'll actually be able to place it.  Usually I get the "cannot place: item needs support" error.  That means you'll have to store everything and rebuild.  Also, you'll have to reassign items to displays and vendors.
---
As well as being able to reroll a specific legendary bonus.  It is annoying to get the almost perfect legendary weapon, but it is an Instigating Minigun with Faster Fire Rate or Explosive and 90% reduced weight.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/Ei0SSUk](https://imgur.com/a/Ei0SSUk)  Images from this post? My betting money is still on atomshop..
---
Well, you saying 'garbage' doesn't make it so. That's a childlike understanding of the world, just like you've a childlike understanding of the English language.
---
&gt; How embarrassing that **your** trying to insult someone and you can‚Äôt even write a decent sentence.
---
Lol. Yes, your opinions are certainly valuable. In no way at all are you projecting your inadequacies onto me.
---
Garbage is too right.
---
AA works on energy weapons?
---
As I recall it didn't, was it "fixed"?
---
Don't pick fights with enemies 50 levels higher than you. Problem solved.
---
Honestly, like everyone pointed out, it's just changing the economy in the sense that you can just buy 3 bullets and you are done. In my case i buy 2 bullets and at least something "expensive" than i don't have or a plan i haven't learnt, i could even buy 10 things from a single vendor, that way i don't feel bad or make the other person feel bad, for a reason they set up the camp, it wasn't exactly for the challenges.
---
Man this is how I thought the legendary modules worked when I first started, bought a couple modules from Mumbles, went back to my camp to craft some legendary armor, and to my surprise :faaaart: no dice.
---
Ooo ok good to know! In that case, is there anywhere to find junk prices not in bulk? I assume most of the junk isn‚Äôt worth much apart from the stuff like adhesive etc ? Thanks!
---
Does it blueprint crops too?
---
It‚Äôs called an opinion. Which means to me it is garbage. 
---
You have a lot to learn. Mostly how to insult people. All your insults are ones other people have come up with and you‚Äôve read and then just regurgitate them back out. Generally when you‚Äôve got nothing if value or original to say.
---
Block.
---
Forward station delta had a couple of 3 star ghouls for me today. The fissure prime area is always my first stop for legendaries.. I got 7 in about 40 minutes the other day..
---
3 SB‚Äôs  a gutsy , 2 super mutants and a feral ghoul
---
I must be in the minority because it got me going to private vendors again. Lots of good plans, serums for 250 - 350 caps.  Just got an AA Combat shotty that I am having a blast with .. so far the experience has been fun. And really how many recall keycards do you really need anyway.  Tired of buying those things to keep from giving Todd my caps.
---
Lakeside Cabins workshop has a wood node that you can place a harvesting machine on and it produces like 40 wood every 20 mins.  Great easy way to get a bunch early in the game.
---
Jet pack is awesome. However, you‚Äôll need other pieces with fall damage resistance otherwise you may die sometimes. RNGesus hasn‚Äôt given me fall resist yet. I have goat legs, which is 80% ignore fall damage. The worst is when I get to SBQ fight and server lags. Hit jet pack and end up blasting way above her, then drop and die.
---
Or just highlight the connected pieces so we can see how to resolve it without guess and check.
---
This is what I miss most
---
It‚Äôs because there‚Äôs nothing else to do üôÑ
---
How do you put the fusion core under it?
---
Yup! It's a must!!
---
And a .. you are a complete tosser!

Just for the guy who killed the blood eagle captain when it was just him at level 180 and me at level 9

Didn't they add it for broken steel too?

Bolster will increase the lower your hp, but the recommended cap on resistance is usually 350-450 since there‚Äôs a soft cap around there. SS armor on its own can get you pretty close to that number, so don‚Äôt feel like you need to keep loading up on damage resistance to stay competitive.
---
If you have a vats build you may prefer unyielding as each piece will give you +3 of every stats but end. that would be +12 agility for ap and the extra 60 carry weight so your armor doesn‚Äôt get in the way of your current loadout. 
---
If you like what you have now you could try adding dodgy(agi),blocker(str), fireproof(end) and/or ricochet(luck), as they will reduce the damage you‚Äôre taking too! 
---
I personally love bloodied with the unyielding armor, but I‚Äôm sure your stealth build is totally different than mine. Hopefully some of that advice helps!
---
I've never played Elder Scrolls.
---
I donno, I'm pretty disappointed with how the games been evolving. So much potential missed and the cash shop gets all the support. The most recent update re did the challenge system to further incentivize cash item rewards
---
 The daily challenges are pretty dumb but almost necessary now as there isnt much else to do. You'll literally log in, check the list. Build and destroy 10 walls at your camp (get points), buy 3 cheap items you dont need from a vendor and throw them away, just dumb stuff like that you have to do nearly everyday if you want to ha e a chance at any of the almost cool high level run rewards. Anyway I'm ranting now. With that said it's also had lots of good additions too, wastelanders obviously, vendors, good quest content.
---
I have played more and enjoyed 76 more than the previous titles. 3 will always be my favorite as it was basically my into to the series.
---
76 has good stories, fun gameplay (its fallout). The end game content is almost non existent. The repeatables are boring and repetitive, and the drop rates are insulting.
---
I really hope for some quality repeatable content and some changes to RNG or how to acquire legendary weapons and gear.
---
Sadly everything they do add either doesnt interest me (Nuclear Winter, The legendary run, 95% of cash shop items) or comes with some strings attached (scrip limits, bullion limits, cap limits). I play once or twice a week every couple weeks now. I really hope the game grows into something great but I've stopped holding my breath.
---
I'm also like level 300. I would say give it a try, its enjoyable. The longevity of the game we will have to see if the developers can get their heads on straight and start delivering some real bosses, dungeons and, events. I dont think you will regret it though. Just isnt as engaging as a more developed mmo or RPGs, that you can count on to hold your interest everynight till you die.
---
Yeah, they fixed it a while back - maybe 8 months ago now?
---
Connect your vendors with some garage doors, thus when you shut the power to it, you shut the access. Don't forget to install a  (locked) back door for you.
---
 Morgantown/Mama Dulce‚Äôs is my go-to nuke spot for flux farming! I‚Äôve even gotten events to spawn inside the nuke zone there and walked away with like 29 high-rad fluids and 170+ cobalt flux. It‚Äôs even better if the game blue screens after a full run through the area, restart game, load back in and all enemies have re-spawned! Best BSOD yet. That only works if you‚Äôre in a private server or on a team though. Another good spot to hit is the Generals Steakhouse with the farm out back.
---
Except they are all worthless if you use power armor, because in a giant exoskeleton you hold less? I have to switch out my useful strength perk cards every-time I use power armor for traveling pharmacy because my chemist backpack is unequipped.  Why power armor so garbo??? Why did I spend 30,000 caps and 200 flux to get ultracite calibrated shocks that hold less than pleb teir excavator armor? So I can't use legendary power armor??? What is this mess of a game??
---
Everything but the scorch beast queen feels like you‚Äôve turned on easy difficulty, at least I felt like that, I have 9 addictions, a junkie ultracite Gatling laser and a junkie Gatling gun without using stealth at all so it definitely depends on what Junkie weapon you‚Äôve got I had heavy weapons so stealth was pointless but the build was still powerful
---
Ah, good to know!
---
Thinking the BAR is anything like the weird combat rifle is laughable.
---
I don't think so...maybe if you're using the farming tiles?  I haven't actually tried that.  If it's not blueprinted, then its stored automatically.  You shouldn't lose anything if that's your concern.
---
Glad it isn't just my husband! Thats ok though I usually get him back... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§£ü§£
---
Get yer cork ready boys.
---
Ground Zero is an achievement on XBOX also
---
I'd like them to fix it to more of an average to small dick in the ass.
---
I have found pistols, shotguns, and energy weapons are not great choices for specialization.
---
One thing comes to mind, though. Take a Pipe Revolver, perks for pistols apply to it. Put a stock on it to make it a pipe revolver rifle, now perks for rifles apply to it as well as the perks for pistols. This way she can double dip the perks.
---
I don‚Äôt play the game simply to see my numbers go up that is apparently all you want to hear.
---
Hmm I‚Äôm not really into heavy guns more of a rifle man
---
It would almost be better to get nothing than stalkers.. destroying me emotionally every time murmur and I get together is worse than most of my real life failed relationships.  I don't need that shit both places.
---
&gt; Which means to me it is garbage.
---
It's called a sentence fragment. You can't even write. How embarrassing that you're trying to insult someone and you can't even write a decent sentence.
---
Your comments are pure projection. Your insults are weak, literally: garbage. You speak and read like a child. You take a tone of patronizing and morally superior when you commit all the crimes you accuse me of.
---
Stating 'block' doesn't block someone just like stating 'garbage' doesn't render someone into trash just like how stating immediately observable facts about this very thread and its title do not constitute assumptions.
---
You're genuinely insane or an idiot. Either way you're a waste of time.
---
But you get his ball sac for a reward. You can put it in your vendor and make customers literally eye fuck it. You can't buy that sort of entertainment. 
---
I solo'd him twice now, both times he was stuck in the sundew grove after a queen nuke so it was just a shit fight. First two times me and a firend went hunting for him after it was first added, and it was a more difficult and fun fight.
---
I died endlessly as we weren't prepared, and I was getting gang banged by 15 wendigo spawns at once.
---
Why 9? It caps at 5
---
wonder whats going break and be left broken for months until the next update..
---
10 cap plans are flying off the shelves.
---
Since you seem so knowledgeable and eloquent, would you mind concisely explaining how computers generate random numbers?
---
Agree, the first few hours definitely aren't great, when you're scrambling for water and food and even the most basic ammo (much better to just embrace melee for the early game) - unless you have friends to give these things. I enjoyed it moderately pre-wastelanders, but after Wastelanders came, which sort of coincided with me hitting around level 30 and starting to have plenty of decent ammo and supplies, I've found the game so much fun.
---
3 caps a day
---
and the red rocket workshop
---
3/3 fireproof equipped makes them even more fun.
---
One of my medic's quirks is blowing every car she comes by
---
I nuked Foundation lol
---
That would require competent programming. If one of Bethesda's interns tried that you'd something utterly stupid, like the wrong ammo being made or the nearest hostile mob dying instantly or, most likely, the game crashes 20 minutes later.
---
Head over to West-Tek, normally about 2-3 legendary inside
---
Yeah , Insult bot is  much better than "Prize Bot" who always gives me junk then says he's gonna tax me on said junk.
---
Considering it was designed after it, why would that be weird?
---
Use a flamer trap on them
---
Clearly going for that addict rp, once you addicted why stop at 5. But yeh no damage buffs after 5.
---
Yeah, 2 of my 5 main guns (Bear Arms. LOL) are furious laser and plasma, but compared to Fo4 it seems like everything energy-based has had a serious nerf to base effectiveness.
---
Nobody LIKES assaultrons.
---
 "ZING"
---
I just came across someone with a similar issue lol, and everyone in the comments is telling them to go all unyeilding, since I believe I have a similar build to that person i think I'll go all unyeilding, and of course, get the dodgy perk.
---
I believe its the lore that the Secret Service doesn't WANT you to have gold, they're doing their best to buy it all back from you!
---
He spent a lot of time getting things to line up, which is technically impressive since the building mechanics are so shoddy. 
---
But this build does not look good enough to merit what you are asking. It is incredibly basic.
---
\*raises hand\* I just wish the nights were darker like they used to be in the beta it would be even more fantastic
---
I always leave stuff, mostly plans laying around at my vendor.   I have a designated ‚Äòfree shit‚Äô spot, labeled with a billboard and neon letters. Do whatever you like with them.
---
So does anyone know if colossal problem is going to be included with this patch?
---
Almost a bad of burn as all that radiation
---
WhiteSprings backlot parking blows up like fireworks too!
---
From a plot perspective you probably would be making things in batches. Wasted materials and what not every time you made something.
---
Where do you nuke to get him to come.out? I screenshotted the location months ago now cant find it and ready as I am ever gonna be lol
---
Lol..i do the same thing but i always throw an orbital strike grenade in the middle and watch from the roof of Red Rocket there. The chain reaction looks like a movie explosion...üòÅüëç
---
That's the one! Cheers for the clarification. I'm still kinda new to the game and don't remember all the names yet.
---
No, but in fo4 you could at least farm, but hey, downvote someone for saying that a bs game mechanic is bs
---
Gotta love the bid badda booms of the car explosions!! They never escape me either. I like to wait til a team mate is walking casually past and light them up lol always gets a good reaction
---
And talk to Bones for defence daily at Ohio river run.
---
Drop something close to the car then point him to the little paper bag. Then blow up the car
---
Isn‚Äôt that nuclear winter‚Äôs purpose?
---
&gt; And reading this again many people seem to have chosen the factions as if they can't get the other factions rewards by not doing the raid with them.
---
But you get them sooner by picking a side.
---
It should.
---
Not that I can remember, but now you mention Broken Steel , I'd love to see the Tesla Cannon again. Or even the  Drone Cannon from Mothership Zeta.
---
I usually bush wookie, but whenever I forget to turn off fill, I actively play and today because of that I won a match with some randos!
---
Nice I have only ever seen him twice, one there was a bunch of people and then now this one. I have been playing since after wastelanders (and therefor the WC) was added and I'm almost lvl 200 and just saw him for the first time about 5 days ago. I was thinking my first time seeing him would be in a colossal problem but just before I manage to see him twice
---
Atleast you can have his ball...
---
Wont stop
---
I ran whitesprings and killed three 1* and one 3*. Luckily ghouls count as creatures.
---
Herd mentality mutation. Adds special attributes so it doesn't hurt as much and since  being on a team even alone counts there's no reason to not get it.
---
Im surprised I've never done this. I have one where my character is doing the thumb trick while a nuke goes off in the background of the photo. Thats a pretty cool shot
---
Off the top of my head i usually see steel and cloth go for 1-2c each. Lead 2 or 3. gold and silver usually 5-10c. wood/glass/ceramic/bone/leather/rubber 1c. Ballistic fiber about 10-12c each. concrete 2-3. crystal about 5. nuclear waste 3-5. screws 5-10
---
bu to be honest  i see a vendor has junk i'm there. And it's not often i don't buy every single little scrap. I constantly have too many caps. as long as it's not ridiculously overpriced i buy it.
---
Seems buggy. Killed two event 3 stars (Liberator and Gutsy) and neither registered.
---
Yeah I am on the PTS but I haven't done the colossal problem yet so I dunno if he's harder or whatever as there are timed auto nuke drops on monongah for it, and I couldn't be bothered doing my own nuke run outside that period. 
---
It's a fun little fight, but very underwhelming in its current iteration when you get to a certain point of power. You can spawn him multiple times in the same nuke zone by cycling around over time, I've had him twice in one location before, and sell the ball sacks for 200 caps.
---
When I am sent to get vacuum tubes at Valley Galleria, I develop a maniacal grin as I get ready to prime a grenade.
---
Furious Gatling laser and plasma does the job, but I mostly put that down to high ROF. I imagine that stacks well with most damage boosting legendaries.   
---
I'm half joking about their crapness, but generally I've been disappointed by energy weapons in 76,
---
I've only seen him at overgrown sundew grove as a result from nuking the queen, however tomorrow after noon est you should be able to get a 100% spawn chance at Monongah mine if nuked and will be an event like the SBQ
---
For me, he stucked in a bush or something, so I just butchered him. It was not fun, nor challenge at all, poor guy.
---
They are robots, not creatures.
---
Yea, that's where i got my 3* also, while doing the 25 kills.
---
I get plenty of tiny ammo sales, but the other stuff is selling too.
---
It gets people to look at your inventory.
---
It was designed after the combat shotgun... lmao
---
Dodgy will def be good if you‚Äôre in the back line! Uny is great for melee, but I think you‚Äôll get a lot out of it. No more worries about skill checks!
---
I agree it's a challenge that should remain. Sometimes I buy small nothings but other times I'm buying nice legendaries.
---
Wood stack in back of the yellow house in Helvetia.
---
I'd rather just craft them, but even paying quadruple for a certain one is way better than current RNG
---
YESSSSSS
---
It's been fun for me since day 1.
---
I‚Äôve heard other people say you have to move you camp for the effect to be removed. I haven‚Äôt used it so I don‚Äôt know first hand.
---
Well I haven't been on today but that would be awesome.
---
Now I kind of think I may have accidentally dropped it when I was dropping those floater grenades. Executioner is right above the F's so I may have dropped it. üò•
---
Cool
---
So I‚Äôve fought him 4 times every time was with a couple ppl. The other night I join a server see there was a nuke already dropped when I see this and no one is down there I go every so often and check. Never ran into one solo, but that night I saw ppl all near the bunker so I make my way down. And notice they lead him near the bunker. So I put my stealth armor on and pulled fixer out and start fighting him. For some reason this was one of the hardest boss fights I‚Äôve encountered even with I think 5 other ppl. It took us a good twenty minutes to kill him. Then another player and me couldn‚Äôt find the body being someone used plasma and it was goo but if you looked at it through the camera it said just regular wendigo. But every weapon I got from him has been crap, either a hand gun, pool cue, or best one was that night a 3 star bolstering armor piece. But mad props for soloing him. I know I could prob do it but it would probably take a long while. Good job
---
I have a Rocket-Heavy Sledge that will instantly erupt any car with a quick attack. I keep it in the quick wheel at all times.
---
Kaboom
---
My sister and I play together a lot and she's newer so I typically follow her around and help her when she needs it. My favorite thing to do is follow behind her and knife cars twice and run away right before they blow up. Her reaction is normally hilarious because she's still scared of everything. I do this especially when she's trying to scope something out before heading in  XD
---
Def don't go into burrows. Won't run into a bunch there. Nor West Tek.
---
This ^
---
Congrats, I'm 800hrs in and considering getting around to it!!
---
Oh shit do people actually buy it? I put my first one on display and trashed the one i got from this guy. Though I guess starting tomorrow they wont sell nearly as well with easier access.
---
No paint other than what's provided at Space Legendary Run, all the Skins do work though.
---
You try not picking a fight when you're walking down the road and it comes barreling up behind you out of nowhere.
---
Yes this
---
Nice thats sweet.  I think ill try today then before it changes. Thanks man for the information!
---
I remember this, you used to KNOW it was night time, always busted out my nocturnal pump and went night hunting.
---
Dont feel bad I also did thid
---
Then why care about caps when the only thing they stop is numbers going up.
---
Its nice without stealth, but stealth makes everything better. I run a low health stealth commando, so I get the stealth bonus, adrenal reaction mutation bonus, and nerd rage bonus to go with my junkies explosive handmade and 5 addictions. I could do more damage with a bloodied explosive or ffr, but even if I go to full health for something like Encryptid, I don't completely hinder myself since I have the junkies bonus.
---
Grats for 3 caps mate
---
soon
---
Molemen count. Got mine during Uranium Fever
---
Whitespring parking lot and In general is very good for these purposes
---
I know this will sound dumb, but are items in the vending machines? I ran across a bug that unloaded all my machines. All my items were still in my stash but now my vending machines listed 0/30. Took me a good 15 minutes of messing with things to notice.
---
I was all [https://i.imgflip.com/2mju8n.jpg](https://i.imgflip.com/2mju8n.jpg)
---
That's where I got mine. Dragged him into the robots in the court yard, and let them do most of the work.
---
Tse isn't one star total, two-shot and explosive are the 2 stars
---
If you drop 2 or 3 that overlap (not directly on top of each other) you can make quite a wide area for the nuke zone. It‚Äôs useful for getting mats for crafting but doesn‚Äôt make it any more radioactive or produce more mobs.
---
As others have pointed out, UGL does not do more damaged to scorched.  It does, however, do more damage to everything in comparison to a similarly equipped Gatling Laser.
---
Plasma flamers are just a hell of a lot of fun. Honestly my friend I quit chasing the meta months ago. Now I'm just looking for a good time when I play and the flamer is that.
---
They did yeah, right at the start I was selling them for 500 easily haha. 200 is a push these days but they do go. 
---
And yeah, once the official event starts things wil lchange again I'm sure.
---
Anything over 200 is good
---
Thanks good job to you too, even though you haven't done it yet I believe in you you go one on 10 that bastard, kill his cronies and kill him, you got this. (Or don't waste durability and ammo and keep grouping up, thats probably the smarter thing lol)
---
I love doing it. one of the best parts of the game.
---
Fought a few times. Never alone, though once I thought I might have to. Getting him caught in the trees makes the fight easier. Because when he screams, I usually get caught on a tree and can‚Äôt get too far away from him. Out on the open, I find the fight harder because the Monty Python ‚ÄúRun away‚Äù effect is more disorienting.
---
Ward sucks colossal vocal sacks and Derek can‚Äôt find his tools and Samuel is thirsty for Jen.
---
Ok i will and thanks for the help
---
Ur a genius buddy. Hit the nail right on the head
---
What part of "during the defense event" did you not understand?
---
I like to stand in the middle of them and blow them up. They used to kill me all the time and be really annoying but since I spec‚Äôd for explosive res it‚Äôs pretty enjoyable
---
Glad I could help.
---
you can add mods to the small boi too
---
at the cost of 1 flamingo per!!!!!
---
I loved in previous fallout games you could kill anything
---
I think it's like a 10% chance every time someone launches a nuke at the forest next to the queen fight keep checking it will be there eventually. I didn't fight it for a long time until recently and now its at least once a week and I don't play 24/7.
---
Cool thanks, imma enjoy these new found points!
---
Has Bethesda announced any ETA on a fix for this, though? I don't recall seeing anything, but could have missed something. I just think it should at least be on their radar, since it's a reward that has been basically rendered useless for anyone who wants to be able to fast travel to their own camp.
---
Assuming that doesn‚Äôt qualify amongst your ‚Äògood stuff‚Äô, lol.
---
If it's not there, kill everything and return in 5/10mins. ;) You'll prob see the smaller Wendigo's before you see it!
---
Maybe you should read up on the design philosophy of Fallout guns.  You seem as clueless as the other person.
---
Oh my, it must suck to be on the other end of that.
---
If you're on PS4 I have an Instigating pump action.. 1* I'll sell you
---
I use a VE handmade at events. It does pretty low damage but really its good at splash damage so I can spray a mob and leave it for whoever else is around so we all get some EXP.
---
I've never noticed the explosions from my rifle send bodies flying, only had that from larger explosive weapons.
---
Awesome tip thanks man
---
Yes!
---
Camden Park car park and the Giant Teapot are pretty good!
---
Get yourself the Two Shot Auto Grenade Launcher with 90% Reduced Weight and enable the ordnance express perk card for 90% reduced weight grenades - it‚Äôs awesome, flying corpses everywhere!
---
Oh I wanna try to solo the queen and him. Just to see what I need to work on. But isn‚Äôt tomorrow when the event with him drops?
---
System?
---
Can you go somewhere else to beg? This sub isn‚Äôt the right place
---
Not to mention the stumbling and erratic movements.  Holy shifting hitboxes Batman!
---
I‚Äôve seen him near devil‚Äôs backbone once.  Wasn‚Äôt my nuke, I was flux farming when I heard a bunch of gunfire and investigated
---
Unfortunately i am in Xbox :( but thanks anyway.
---
Hoard events
---
I encountered two consecutively, the second time the SBQ fought the Colossus but of course the game crashed for everybody.
---
Do mole miners count? I'm still waiting for uranium fever to pop. Following here for better ideas üòÖ
---
I got a nocturnal blocking spear when I soloed one earlier
---
It isn't guaranteed
---
I would just go walk through the Mire.  I find 3* creatures there all the time
---
I agree, we don't need Bethesda focusing on some randos camp when the game has terrible bugs that need fixing and a severe lack of endgame content. 
---
Sorry OP, but this camp doesn't need to be "blown up everywhere."
---
Hello! I am in xbox
---
And you should read up on actual gun design and being able to admit when you're wrong. üòÇ
---
In fallout 4, running around building after doing the story, I felt alone even with the npc's there. In fo76, while Im not the most social type, it feels good having other players around. Makes the world feel more alive
---
Nothing they add to the game will make you happy. Why do you want them to add that is reasonable?
---
You can try white springs golf club, west tek. The ghoul infested houses near the white springs golf club. Certain events like uranium fever sometimes spawn 3 Star guys, or maybe free range for a 3 star sheepsquatch
---
Should do but I don‚Äôt remember the last time I saw a 3* miner during uranium fever
---
You and me both.  Pick the center of the map, find a bush, go make a sandwich.
---
Isn‚Äôt that only 5? The Pickaxe pilsners and candies dont have anything to do with west tek
---
I got mine from a horde event. Could also look out for Leader of the Pack event. Or just run to Whitesprings, Wes-Tek, or the Burrows for the best chances otherwise
---
Will the future tech skin work if you rebuild your camp from scratch after applying it?  Is it only a bug when you try to apply it on an existing camp?
---
Edit: fix autocorrect
---
Riding shotgun usually has a 3 star bloodeagle, outside that the SBQ is the only guaranteed 3 star.
---
yeah, I just assumed that all feral ghouls have speed demon mutation since they are heavily radiated lol
---
I've fought it a few times now, in groups of 1-3 players (note that if solo and you die then the WC will regain its full health...annoying is an understatement!) . Tbh it's an over-rated experienced. I find it little more than a bullet sponge and a fight that drags on and on. Out in the open it shouldn't be too difficult, especially if you have team mates alongside, but as most meetings are in the Sundews you end up fighting the environment as much as the enemies. The Glowing Wendigos that spawn will be a pain for low level player, but are a good source of screws.
---
Yes, it is confirmed to be released with this patch.
---
That's the point. Something else that makes you want to log in everyday.
---
Welcome to ass. 
---
Havent even finished Wastelanders bc of this.
---
Why do you care? You seem to think the only way to properly play this game is to play it your way and anyone that doesn‚Äôt play the exact same way or for the same reasons you do is it doing it wrong and has a problem and should play other games. Thank God you‚Äôre not in charge of any design decisions and I‚Äôm very done talking or justifying anything to you.
---
My lvl 3 friend told me his nukashining story yesterday lol I didn‚Äôt know it was a thing until he appeared in the savage divide 3 minutes after leaving vault 76üòÇ
---
It specifically says creature. I killed a few 3 star robots before getting it off a ghoul
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Just curious if it had bash damage or limb damage as a legendary prefix
---
I stopped using the ammo converter because I value my time.
---
"....but I want what's mine."
---
That sounded in my head like it was said by a old fashion cowboy.....
---
I haven't even come across a 3 star yet.  My server is not nuking.
---
Usually when I log on the first thing I do is vendor hop.  I love buying stuff from people that I need,and love seeing when someone makes a big purchase from my store as well.
---
Huh. That's weird. I see one almost every time.
---
I had 2, 3 stars and 1, 2 star my first run of whitespring today.
---
Gourmands for sure love me some tasty humans
---
Or have someone mow the damn lawns so we can find our meat piles!
---
Congrats!  
---
The first time I launched a nuke it took me and a friend at least an hour and a half to get through the base.   If you keep at it, and you'll see it is SO MUCH EASIER now that you know how things work.  I do practice runs then leave before actually launching the nuke.
---
It's not even that good.
---
i am assuming they don't have mods.. for some reason
---
Point taken.  Must need more coffer to read properly :)
---
I have been lucky enough to pick up several Vampire weapons. I even love my Vampire prime plasma caster.
---
The best way I found to kill a 3* creature is server hopping at whitesprings
---
Ohhhh know what, that makes sense. Thank you.
---
no never had that issue, would recommend just finding the serums from player vendors then of the mutations you want.
---
 You can also craft a higher level backpack for more carry weight. I ran around with a low level backpack for most of my playthrough until I randomly went to craft stuff and checked. Found out that a level 50 backpack has 60 carry weight. High capacity bumps it to 120, but I don‚Äôt like the drop in DR and ER so I usually run with my chemists backpack and keep the high capacity backpack on me for fast traveling when overencumbered.
---
Typical answer.
---
The thing is, by exploiting this event, you prevent evrybody to play it in a legit way. You are not only breaking the game for you (this, I don't care), but also for others (this, I care).
---
I'm pretty sure an Instigating ffr minigun is one of the absolute strongest weapons in the game right now due to the broken "magic" effects
---
\^ this is bait
---
Has anyone nuked Wavy Willards? If not, life goal.
---
I killed a couple earlier but I don't remember if I got SCORE.
---
I only care about perk packs! (only been playing a month, lvl 60 now)
---
not in fallout
---
Read his post.  Inventory
---
I can hook you up, just pm me your gamertag and when I'm on later I can give you a few I don't use.
---
Ya, it's just frustrating cause there's no reason I should have to dump the caps buying serums.
---
If the foundations go too high (sometimes even too low) to the point that their floating you wont be able to delete the foundations that are supporting the ones too high off the ground. 
---
Check to see if you can delete the attached foundations from the opposite side. Usually the same issue with upper floors too were you can't delete floors supporting others. 
---
Sometimes half walls cause you to not be able to modify foundations or floors too, try deleting them or converting to doorways when that issue crops up.
---
Because you are complaining about it on a public forum
---
what platform are you playing on? If on xbox I can hook you up
---
Would you like the endgame gear in a matter of days? a week?
---
I'm liking it a ton. Played every fallout since... 1988's Wasteland.
---
I love blowing up the cars by whitesprings. A couple of shots and I can see the white damage meter slowly tick down and I know there will be explosions soon. With marsupial, I can hop on top of buildings for a better view.
---
I‚Äôm guessing it will be much more limited as ESO game engine was built for that game in mind. F76‚Äôs is building on a lot of concepts that were never meant to be supported. Most likely will either be a new type of camp or you can just build an enclosed structure and decorate it on the inside based on the exterior design. 
---
Maybe with ES6 and a return to solo gaming we‚Äôll see something like this with the fallout building system though.
---
PS4 unfortunately. But I appreciate it nonetheless. Love this community.
---
I literally haven't spent a single dollar on this game. Got it through gamepass and have been playing for a while now lol
---
Drink dirty water, it's the quickest way to get mutations.
---
Reminder to grind out your limited time Nuclear Winter rewards today!
---
I usually find the lowest level player on the map, buy three reasonably expensive items, and drop them for the player to resell.  It keeps me from hitting 30k and redistributes the wealth to someone who can probably use a couple thousand caps.
---
That being said, I found a camp near mine today with heaps of scrip legendaries for under 100c each.  I cleared them out and transferred it all to an alt in preparation of upcoming Purveyor sales.  Thanks stranger!
---
When you get a good roll, you keep going until you have no more scrip. That seems to work. When you get a nocturnal broadsider, well... brace yourselves. 
---
There is obviously a "tendency" for the Purveyour to give you similar items.
---
I have seen people literally break bases just to buy stuff from locked up vendors
---
ok todd
---
LMAO.  Now I want to do that.
---
No reason to add new weapons? Dafuq? Are you against content? LOL
---
Project Paradise if it happens to pop up.
---
could always just go hop in one of the toxic vats at wes tek, would expect that should work.
---
Commie magic
---
Where's Tom Hardy when you need him.
---
Nuke Whitesprings, easy work
---
Its always 1 star when I do free range.
---
I used to max out explosion protection and gain life from radiation, so punching cars with my power fist would fill my life.
---
with the proper build &amp; setup, it's not hard at all to fight with lv62 ghouls when you're below level 40. My first character started farming Whitespring at level 30 when I got the excavator PA and heavy all-rise, I can one-shot most of the ghouls despite I was running a stealth commando build. My second character was able to farm Whitespring at level 20 after I got a full set of lv15 raider PA. The trick is to use power armor and melee and take rad-x, you'll find ghouls much easier to deal with compared to high-leveled scorched for example
---
Agreed, but this is gamers on the internet.
---
Complaints. Complaints never change.
---
Gamepass has only had it for a few weeks, I wouldn‚Äôt count that as a ‚Äúwhile now‚Äù.
---
I‚Äôve taken off an arm or two before, it just depends on where you hit them.
---
Minutes. I want a full set of endgame gear as I log in, every day. After that I can whine about there is nothing to do.
---
Bethesda themselves said they modeled the combat rifle after the BAR. Anyone with eyes can tell they look basically identical.  What's next the 50 Cal isn't the Browning M2 or the Handmade isn't an AK.....
---
I agree they should be dangerous as post fo4 but weren't them slow in Fo1 and Fo2?
---
There's that pesky "Anyone else" again...
---
Yes, always, of course.
---
It's been out since the 9th of July. So nearly s month
---
Robots, humans and sheepsquatch doesn't count to this challenge...
---
Eventually found one in the garage behind the Whitespring
---
I always try to give items to new players and it has came back twice. 
---
Once, at the beginning of the first Fasnacht of 2020, I was walking through Helvetia looking for the Master of Ceremonies (spoiler alert, it got delayed) when I saw a paper bag filled with plans I missed from the Mole Miner and Christmas event. As a lvl 30 character, then life was great. 
---
More recently a player expressed so much excitement over my camp that he dropped a 2 star furious tesla rifle for me. Ive used it at every event I've played since. 
---
Fallout 76's community is god tier.
---
I don't think the source of the radiation in the problem. I've tried a collection of different things from dirty water to toxic barrels to sitting in water in the toxic valley.
---
A single day. 
---
Players like OP, I mean. Personally, I prefer the system as is.
---
Boot up game , press enter world, profit.
---
Just play your main,  what build do you want ? Where are you now? Get cards first then swap points special points , watch angry turtle videos

When are they adding that Colossus event anyway?
---
My most downvoted comment. Someone is salty af.
---
well if you don't have starched genes on I'm not sure what could be preventing it.
---
Trash mobs?
---
The entire currency cap is bs. Only earning a certain amount a day is trash. Alternatively we could only spend a certain amount a day?
---
how many "are the servers up yet" posts do you think we weill see this time? 100? 200? 300? wonder what the record is.
---
I know but it is frustrating. I know the game isn‚Äôt perfect. There are plenty of things I would change about it. But if Bethesda asked me to pay $10 to have a bigger camp or god forbid $30 for an expansion pack, I wouldn‚Äôt even hesitate. It‚Äôs not like Bethesda is 2K or EA Sports who literally try to bankrupt people who just want to play one of their games.
---
That's how my friends knew I was near by. They could always find me by following the explosions. Once I found out about fireproof I always jump on one before I blow it up.
---
Westtek
---
I tried with my main, the new questline seem not to scale with my lvl, just approaching lvl 1-10 enemies. boring for 30 min, left.
---
Glad tidings upon you, you beautiful bastard.
---
Many events have guaranteed 3\* npc... even low level ones.  
---
Just play the damn game ;)
---
And then right in to suitcases at train stations. That's what I have been doing if my cheap plans and apparel aren't moving by the time I am about to log off.
---
I'm now aware of that lol thank you anyway though
---
People that sell the meat week flag can probably bring their ridiculous prices down now.
---
Youll oneshot everything with anjunkies explosive
---
anything over 2 caps per unit is overpriced for common junk. people trying to sell a bulk cork for 80 caps are trying to rip people off.
---
rare junk is a little different (black titanium, ballistic fiber, fiber optic, nuclear material ect) they can be priced higher.
---
honestly, dont bulk, youre just wasting plastic, and the bigger junk number will be more attractive on the map anyway.
---
or be able to buy those weapon coins that you get at the end of the wayward quest line
---
Read the beginning sections of this guide.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic
---
You can definitely still farm legendaries pretty efficiently in fo76
---
$60 for a game that still isn't full functional. It's had many of the same problems for almost 2 years now. Not to mention of you have any real problems the customer service is increasing lackluster.
---
It's 'gamer lingo' for any non-boss enemy, and typically one which doesn't pose a threat to the player.
---
In this context, anything which you can kill in one hit.
---
Yep. I just took some pics at the galleria the other day. My wife also hates it when i blow up another one randomly while i wait for her to be done with something üòÇ
---
Oh and in the beginning i used to stalk people in a creepy outfit and randomly blow up cars to show my presence and freak them out.
---
Oh and one time i got another player killed cus i blew up a car with a grenade and they didnt know i was there, so they thought another rando threw it trying to hurt them, so they shot him and he was like wtf?! And shot back and he got destroyed. I died laughing watching it all from the bushes.
---
It's also a great strategic asset if you dont stand too close.
---
All in all, blowing cars is one of my favorite things. &lt;3
---
No, I‚Äôm against adding useless weapons
---
Ah.
---
I know but he says he completed 7 in one run of west tek, yet 2 of the challenges could be completed anywhere at anytime. It‚Äôs dumb to include them in the west tek run whenever they have nothing to do with west tek
---
What did u kill? 
---
I have a few challenges that won‚Äôt ever complete for me as well. Mainly the atom challenges that are there forever. Glitched into eternity
---
Yeah don't think it's ever going to happen. They'll probably end up erasing half the map or something if they try to code that in.
---
Pretty sure the pesky "anyone else" is because some people may just be encountering connection issues as opposed to the actual issues of the games.
---
Instead of calling it "pesky" maybe try discussing the issue of the question?
---
Like I'm now well aware that it was on me thanks to those that brought up my actual issue instead of criticizing the post.
---
Trying to remember how many OVN events I saw over the weekend..... oh right, zero.
---
I completed it with the SBQ
---
That‚Äôs the aim
---
compared to some games the grind for end game gear in this is quite mild.
---
If you want something specific, you will never find like that
---
Hopefully we were cats go Galen and Mr. pebbles Will meet and be best friends in the stars
---
I don't see the big deal?!? I've gotten the 200 a day (mostly) and the 300 from smiley (minus 1 week when it was weird) and I didn't even start the grind until about a week or two after Wastelanders released. I've gotten full set of the Armor, T-65 +Jet Pack and Calibrated Shocks, the Food Backpack, and all Gauss Weapons as of yesterday. 
---
It was a grind to be sure, but not really any worse than other games.
---
Robots, Sheepsquatch or the 3\* from Riding Shotgun don't count.
---
ME
---
The game at launch was absolutely terrible. Wastelanders has changed my opinion on it into a positive one, but the engine is still holding this game back, same with FO4.
---
Fr i have like 130 treasury notes
---
Yeah, I know. I am a WoW veteran, who takes a bit break now :)
---
no. ours.
---
Shit, seriously? Guess thatd explain it...gonna have to wait for a horde event to pop up i suppose...
---
I need more maniacal women in Fallout in my playthroughs ;_;
---
My wife also hates it when i blow them up. Whether it hurts her or not. Lmao.
---
If it‚Äôs active on the map, and I have xp boost buffs active, I‚Äôll join for the quick xp. And see what shitty legendary the captain is going to drop.
---
But yeah, I used to do this event 5 to 10 plus times a day the first couple months. It‚Äôs a fun one overall.
---
Leader of the pack gives you one stars
---
That‚Äôs why I said a few weeks; it hasn‚Äôt been even an entire month yet.
---
Absolutely, sales on my 5mm ammo have gone through the roof! I'm selling at LEAST 3 extra bullets every day it seems.
---
Oh
---
Got my hopes up I had missed something lol
---
I killed a robot and two of the captains in Riding Shotgun, which someone just told me they dont count...
---
fairly certain its tomorrow
---
To the player, it definitely is dumb as fuck. But it's obviously there as another means of time and resource gating implemented by the suits at Bethesda to generate more money and keep people coming back. It's slimy and annoying and incredibly unfun, but look who it is behind the curtain. Par for the course.
---
Enemy leveling to match yourself is an upcoming feature. It's called "One Wasteland" I think.
---
Wait what?
---
you cant find wood? really? its like, literally everywhere, like you'll actually trip over logs every 10 feet...
---
Is there a confirmation from Bethesda about this? I haven't been able to find any confirmation.
---
Here's my piece of s\*\*t CAMP just doing the best I can at the moment. Think I can improve on it by starting on the bottom of the cliff by the acid as there's a little more space to build than I'd expected.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/N9LBYoA](https://imgur.com/a/N9LBYoA)
---
There's a lovely natural arch just out of reach of the acid and part of me thinks, just sack off the acid and have a nice camp up there with the lead.
---
Read what it says. 
---
**Creature**
---
Has to be an animal. And not to be confused with cryptids. So a rad ant, yau guai, and SBQ would be good examples
---
Quest probably is easiest if you kill SBQ.  Go to fissure prime and server hop u til a 3* scorchbeast pops out would be a strategy. I haven‚Äôt played today yet so I haven‚Äôt tested.
---
This is a tough challenge compared to most.
---
No. That‚Äôs not how it works. Read the guide posted above/below
---
It's a creature you have to kill. I got lucky and the first scorched beast I came across was a three star.
---
My friend, do not, i repeat do NOT, use the sink for water. I use to do the same thing with the water pump and i‚Äôm telling you, i did the math one day and i can‚Äôt remember what i came up with but it was something like, in the time it takes to get 5 water from a sink/pump (because you get 1 per animation cycle) you could get 70 or something from a river or lake, bc there‚Äôs no animation. I make 10 cran relish per day which takes 40 dirty water total to do. I just fast travel to the nearest water source and get it, throw on thru hiker, turn it into boiled, and stash it.
---
But i cannot agree with you more on the button mashing. It‚Äôs so fucking archaic. I‚Äôve honestly been getting so into FO76 the past month or two for the first time since after launch and i think i‚Äôm done now. Still a fun game but i do more bitching about the SIMPLE quality of life shit that they can‚Äôt be bothered to add to the game, meanwhile the atom store is FLOURISHING with an over-abundance of mediocre shit for you to spend money on. My complaining is not helping anyone, least of all myself.
---
sorry for the long reply i just had to let it all out üò≠
---
It's Bethesda, are you seriously surprised?
---
Can I please for the love of god just be able to get a good weapon without it being behind RNG. Lock them behind hard quests, certain #s or types of events completed, anything except this awful shit roulette.
---
They do, I can confirm
---
I have used WoW as an example a few times. people think this game has too many currencies and the rep is hard to get? They have obviously never played WoW.
---
Ha, if 1) people show up and 2) manage to make it far enough that the boss shows up. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love this event and it‚Äôs a great idea, but I rarely see it attempted and completed successfully. üò¢
---
That‚Äôs because it starts off in the forest... complete the intro and move on to the harder stuff
---
Really that actually works? good to know
---
This is my favorite thing about Whitesprings lol.
---
Join a public team. As long as someone does some decent damage you should get loot of you join the event. I often have issues with my character not automatically joining the event so always make sure. If you have a decent build you don't even need to shoot it the entire time once you get your tag damage in. I usually farm the mobs for xp.
---
Yes, seriously. 
---
Just go to West-Tek, VTU, CCB, Huntersville, WS. Those usually have 3\* ghouls or mutants.
---
You don‚Äôt even need to spend money to repair gear...
---
Gonna need some proof on that one because as far as I've seen, the feature has been removed.  All it took was crippling a limb on Fallout 4 ghouls to dismember them, it'd even work with a pipe pistol.
---
In 76, they'll just sort of hobble around if one leg is crippled, and retract their arms into their sides if they're crippled there, but I've never seen any live dismemberment like in Fallout 4.
---
Problem is Berserkers has such a shitty reputation everybody scrips them without trying to sell them first.
---
I bulk everything and just sell at about 1/3 the in-game listed price.  
---
That way people are buying for cheaper than they'd get at any NPC vendor and I'm getting more than I'd get from an NPC vendor without eating into my 1400 caps limit for the day.   
---
I'll still get rid of the *real* crap, like leather and bone shards, to NPC vendors, because I doubt anyone would want to buy it otherwise.
---
Not saying you're wrong - I just think it's important to provide both sides of the argument.
---
As soon as you crafted the first mutant slayers leg, the odds of crafting another were equally as likely as crafting the first one. It was equally as remarkable that you crafted the first one as it was the second. (Same for your other example).
---
I totally get it - it seems like a pattern. But remember humans are mentally wired to find patterns even when none exist. Unless anyone finds a *repeatable* way to trigger certain events, I'd lean to the side of pure RNG.
---
They should set it up so you can reroll specific effects for continually increasing amounts of scrip up to the scrip limit. That way you could roll a weapon with two legendary effects that you actually want and spend 100 scrip to reroll the third (or first or second). Still didn‚Äôt get the roll you wanted? Spend 200 more scrip and try again. Still nothing? Throw another 400 scrip at it. Reroll as much as you want up to the point you hit the scrip limit. This way you have a chance to majorly improve a mediocre roll but you can‚Äôt roll a nocturnal, bash damage, crit meter 50 cal and reroll it into a bloodied explosive 90rw.
---
absolute chaos
---
I try and find the low level vendors and splash caps on them.  
---
Today a level 30 had set their camp up close to mine, I called in on my way to Morgantown and he had a load of stuff that i'd never buy, but he had also priced 2 gears at 250 caps each and another scrap item at 200 caps.............  you know sometimes you have to admire some people and I had to buy em.  
---
I got my 3 "purchases" and he got a ton of caps.
---
Yea the less overlap the better use since you‚Äôd want to cover as much area as possible, but in OP‚Äôs case two nukes both centered on the bunker, so it was less likely done for efficient farming. In fact if you want to farm WS you‚Äôd center the nuke to the NW of the resort icon so that you can cover all ghoul spawns as well as area around the waste disposal. First timers however often center their nukes on the resort icon itself.
---
Too bad they didnt just focus on making a fun game that people want to play instead of time boxing so much.  Not everything has to be limited.
---
Edit: auto correct
---
Compared to settlers who have a chinese spy ghoul, her daughter, and wsrd, who is basically garvey v2
---
I haven‚Äôt had any issues with completing challenges and am at level 70 so I am a little surprised yes. So I guess it‚Äôs uranium fever or one violent night then..
---
It is just fencing pieces.
---
honestly at this point, we should just fuckin pay 1000 scrip to get whatever roll we want. thats one piece of gear like every 5ish days with 150 machine scrip+daily quest scrip. plenty of grind.
---
That‚Äôs fucking epic!
---
Yeah, creature literally has meant anything thats killable in past challenges, bud...thanks for nothing
---
Bummer, but thanks for the offer all the same! I am really debating grinding her a gun even though i know it will be replaced eventually. But i mean a good 10mm with like double shot could last from 30 to 50 im sure....right?
---
Well yeah the beginning of the new quest line is supposed to run parallel with the original main quest so everything is super easy at the beginning. Once you end up getting into the factions, raiders and settlers, things start to get a little harder. You‚Äôll get burnt to a crisp by many assaultrons and sentry bots by the time you crack open the vault. After you‚Äôre done with the raiders or settlers(whichever one you choose to finish with) is where the good stuff comes. Not so good if you hate grinding, but you‚Äôre missing out on some sweet weapons and armor if you never finish wastelanders. I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre better off starting a new character and starting it all fresh if you don‚Äôt want to feel like it‚Äôs too easy. But at the same time it‚Äôs really up to you. The games difficulty will catch up to you faster than a new character will catch up to the games difficulty if that makes sense. If you start a new character you may have to stop the quest line in several spots because it gets pretty hard until you get some better gear or find someone to help you out.
---
Got it with a random 3\* Mirlurk while doing Heart of the Swamp. Chance of one spawning is uncommon, but worth giving it a shot if it appears.
---
yesh tee mmghee forteethue is vehrry ghuod, u shood geet one eef you can.
---
Shit I didn‚Äôt know
---
I love the enthusiasm, and the build is obviously neat, with a good bit of care taken to get those angles all pretty perfect, but those lighthouse souvenirs are for the land view lighthouse, which is an actual place in the game already. This lighthouse is situated on a lake, which is fine for a player camp but for Bethesda to pick up and implement it as a permanent location, it makes no sense. I think this idea is the product of an over enthused conversation. Kudos for promoting your friends hard work, but let‚Äôs not treat it as anything more than what it is.. an above average camp. Great work Davy Jones, but let‚Äôs not get carried away.
---
Is okey I puppose but not as gud as a 50bal
---
Maybe they can add new content like quests and such
---
Been obsessed with doing that since FO3.
---
 don't judge me. It's a condition... ^^that ^^I ^^like
---
My opinion of the game changed after playing but my opinion of Bethesda got worse.
---
Blows through ammo.
---
Snape
---
Yeah, i got that bit, only issue is previous challenges have said kill creatures and ive gotten those by killing literally anything that can be killed...but for some reason this challenge in particular doesnt like robots, sheepsqautch or the riding shotgun legendary...which is dumb
---
Depending on your build it can be good. It consumes ammo relatively quick compared to other weapons though if your not disciplined with your trigger finger.
---
That's fair, I personally didn't really notice that much of a difference though, as getting raider rep is a bit easier than for settlers.
---
Get you, think it was more the sentiment of getting shit done
---
It's still pretty bad lol. Enemies have way too much explosive resistance, and the broadsider is the worst heavy launcher in the game for the bugged/delayed explosions. But if it actually hits, it's pretty much the best you can get from a broadsider
---
I just don‚Äôt get why people are surprised that a company that only makes entertainment is only doing it for the money.
---
What do people expect? That they all do this for the love of video games? 
---
Sorry. As a professional successful artist myself this is the truth.
---
I love making art FOR money. I‚Äôm a commercial artist. People who make video games are that too. Commercial game designers. Commercial artist. Commercial coders.
---
They all love doing this. For a living. Not some higher calling or purity of the thing.
---
That‚Äôs your thinking if you believe that. Not us professionals.
---
And we get tired of you always wanting more more more for free because you once bought something.
---
I am always on a building public team now.. it is bugging on me for some reason for the last 5 days or so.. west coast Xbox aftter 10 pm pdt
---
I am a collector of trash, so it will do. Not quite a weapon for emergencies, but it's pretty much as good as a broadsider can get
---
And you finish those in a few hours. They can not add content as fast as you burn it.
---
Good lord your spelling is an eyesore, but to answer your question, yes, however its expensive to feed it ammo unless you prime it.
---
People actually buy the repair and scrap kits? Lmao
---
Fuck Morgantown that‚Äôs why lol
---
Seems like it, or if you get lucky one of the horde events should suffice, if it isnt the liberator one
---
If everyone played properly it would such a fun game mode
---
yup
---
Whares the plan
---
Well the secret service armor is the best armor in game and power armor is supposed to be the best. Then you got the under armor that is good if you need strength.
---
You don‚Äôt get endgame gear by turning In Treasure notes/buillon. You get to buy plans, that you can only make by scrip which you can only turn in 1400 worth a day. These limits give you a reason to log out
---
Yeah, planned on doing something to that effect
---
I haven't even considered that. Hopefully Sofia starts giving me some more of those purveyor weapons and not any more berserker's gauss rifles
---
They weren't even real threats in FO1/2.  They were more like role-playing opportunities unless you went and produced purposefully tried to get into fights with huge groups.
---
A collectron that actually collects something useful, lost legendaries.
---
He‚Äôs just flexing on us
---
Honestly, its at least different, weve had the damn player vending one for the passed two weeks it seems...not to mention that bubblegum one pops up pretty regularly and is just annoying if you dont know gum spawns
---
The average punter isn‚Äôt a taxonomist au fait with the nuances of how things are categorised by Bethesda. Why is a SBQ a creature but another cryptid not?
---
Blood eagle is a human so doesnt count for the challenge.
---
Adrenaline gets fixed, legendary enemies are stuck fully regenerating their HP every two seconds, bobby pins go back to .1 weight each for the third time, catching bone worms will negate all your legendary effects until you hop servers
---
I punch them. Constantly.
---
Don't forget about the weekly buy from the star spangled guy at the Wayfarer.
---
Update - got into my stealth suit and rolled a 3*
---
Ok so it‚Äôs +1 endurance and sneaking for the other stars but at this point I‚Äôm happy to move onto legs!
---
\*as per tradition
---
Would you accept a refund?
---
Der plan shood bee in whittspigots
---
We got a 3\* Sheepsquatch as the Alpha for Project Paradise and it counted for me
---
How did fallout 4 have hundreds of hours of enjoyable content yet somehow this game gets an excuse
---
I swear i either find servers full of horde events or none at all for hours on end
---
Meeee i do it all the time in white springs!! Haha
---
I‚Äôd go to the trading sub for that, you can get them relatively cheaply.
---
It would be nice if they changed it around to incentivize actually playing the fucking game. Like give you more than a pathetic 15 exp for killing enemies, for starters
---
"Creature" is the group name for enemies affected by Wasteland Whisperer, so not robots, humans, or animals.   
---
Pretty sure it's the biggest group, since that includes Deathclaws, Super Mutants, Ghouls etc.  
---
Probably Mole Miners, since they react to Wasteland Whisperer, too.
---
Nobody is forcing you to play it. It's 250 score, you're not entitled to it
---
I've met people who thought you could only repair things with kits from the atom shop so....yeah..
---
I'd say since feral ghouls no longer have much left in terms of a brain, they also lose the built-in inhibitor all humans have that prevents us from hurting ourselves through overexertion. They're stronger and faster than most humans because there's nothing stopping them from injuring themselves by exceeding their normal limits.
---
Can confirm that confirmation. Just got 3* @ uranium fever
---
I didnt downvote? Only posted, but alright.
---
And the 220lbs in my stash of legendaries that I'm waiting to scrip says they can be farmed rather effectively.
---
Yep. Almost anything but an explosive or a 2525 would be scrip by me. Reality is that I don‚Äôt have the stash space to care about anything but mid meta pieces. Low end pieces get turned to scrip. High end pieces don‚Äôt even make it to the vending machines. They are stashed away for trades.
---
Sers pled en withee eny ever. Thraien.
---
I like that it gives a chance to see the variety in CAMP decor and how wonderful and weird this game is. Came to a camp today that had frog jars 3 across the whole length of a set of steps.... About 30 frog jars?  Just frog song the whole time. Kudos, frog stair guy (or gal) :)
---
I want in!
---
Imagine wanting to waste a bunch of time and ammo on an npc that literally just does the spray attack back and forth over and over again for a 1 star leather arm.. Like why are you even complaining?
---
Good idea.  Wouldve been nice to have a teammate doing the guitar pose or salute in the middle of it all
---
That‚Äôs very lucky- I‚Äôm well over that for 3 pieces
---
Thanks! It was easier than trying to get any kill credit...
---
I r Lonepupper
---
The armour and weapons plans you buy are to make endgame gear... even if they're shit. 
---
if there were no limits people would have had everything bought in the first week and that's not good for anyone. Cannot think of any game i've ever played where they let you get all the good shit in a week or two.
---
the wood farm i always do is travel to Vault 76 for free and walk south to the local lumberyard, picking up all the fallen trees i run into on the walk and around the lumberyard. within a few walks and a trip to your camp site, you should have more than enough wood to build your dream camp
---
You can tell me how many dev hours are behind fallout 4?
---
Also, why are you compare a single player game to a MMO?
---
That Slocums joe skin was enough incentive for me üòÖ
---
pretty sure it still counts humanoids as "creatures", so unless it calls out a specific subcategory then all enemies count as creatures. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_creatures
---
Must be a fuck huge group cause it always seems like killing anything goes for previous kill creature challenges
---
Ghouls count, I did my 3* and kill 25 creatures in burrows
---
cannot say i've ever noticed. I've noticed it say 'kill 10 robots' and 'kill 10 ghouls' and '10 scorched' but i've never seen it say creature and mean anything killable. I've seen it say kill 3 legendary enemies. Which implies anything goes as long as it's an enemy and legendary.
---
What subs do you recommend?
---
Remember when the only way to get a backpack was to complete the Pioneer Scouts questline?  Pepperidge Farms remembers.
---
That child has a promising future ahead of him!
---
You‚Äôre saying *check* for shit that doesn‚Äôt exist. Give an example for them if you wanna be that smug. Simply saying ‚Äúnu uh!‚Äù doesn‚Äôt change anyone‚Äôs mind. 
---
-There are no raids. There WERE, and then they removed them to be replaced with (wait for it) time gated content in the form of Vault 79 (and the settlers/raiders). 
---
-There are no dungeons. There are locations, with some stuff inside, but nothing like any typical MMO dungeon that involves clearing out specific sections, bosses, with a loot drop at the end. There‚Äôs just locations with random shit, sometimes a legendary enemy.
---
-There is no party comp. In a real MMO, there are roles that NEED to be filled otherwise the party will fail just about any task. In fo76, every swinging dick that shows up with a pipe gun is adequate to get the job done. The only role 90% of player fulfill is DPS because there‚Äôs literally no reason not to. The ONLY event that requires ONE person to have high health, defense, and self healing abilities (note, doesn‚Äôt have to heal anyone else at all ever) is Encryptid. And that is by far my favorite event because it‚Äôs the only one where full health tanks like me are actually needed anywhere on the map.
---
-The only classes that exist are different variations of DPS builds. The only major distinction i think you could make is between melee and ranged builds. Maybe also between sneak builds and non sneak builds, but any way you look at it, everybody in the game is chasing those sweet sweet high damage numbers when they hit something. 
---
-The insinuation of an actual end game is a joke. The most end game thing in the game is the scorchbeast queen, and she‚Äôs a joke. Not to mention she‚Äôs the toughest enemy in the game yet doesn‚Äôt drop a guaranteed 3 star piece of gear or anything. She literally takes thousands of bullets to kill for a drop you can get from a legendary cricket (literally. I got a level 50 god roll piece of scout armor from a cricket during the queen fight, and she dropped a 1* shitter weapon). So no, there is no real end game.
---
Honestly the only reason i‚Äôm even still replying is to see exactly how hard you wanna die on this hill. Like, the game has the slightest hints of MMO, even if it officially was an MMO, the content comes nowhere near close to being as well thought out as most popular MMO titles that i can think of.
---
i save mine for after uranium fever or line in the sand. Usually come out with 3-4k steel.
---
I guess we're just gonna keep posting about this instead of reading. Every hour, someone brings it up.
---
With fixed rolls, the 3 star should cost 1000 scrip, not just lowly 100... you can turn in 150 per day, withoit any effort.
---
Alright! :)
---
For the first time since playing (started 3 months ago) this weekend I witnessed 2 SBQs not complete.   Getting a shitty drop is one thing but dumping all your ammo into it and getting nothing really sucks.  Love the influx of new players but when you're the only player over 100 you know it's going to be a tough fight.
---
Why not just play the game, have some fun, and put aside thinking that you MUST have certain gear otherwise the game is unplayable.
---
That's all this really comes down to. You want very specific gear. And you don't want to have to go through the games process to get it, because you are totally Veruca Salt.
---
Hey, if people aren't going to take the time to read the subreddit, I'm going to take the time to point that out.
---
Of course Bethesda, they probably saw that it was annoying for people to find three legendaries sometimes, so they‚Äôre just like ‚Äúok we‚Äôll make it one legendary, but now it has to be a three star! They‚Äôll love that!‚Äù
---
Oh, geez, I hope that isn't what happened.   I hope it's there when you log on tomorrow.
---
Apparently liking the game gets downvoted. 
---
Never change, /r/fo76
---
I could be wrong but 3\* is still 3\* IMO it doesn't matter if "legendary" is in the name or not, especially in the case of a Sheepsquatch.
---
I just got it from west tek...not like the legendary was worth it since i got a shitty one star out of the kill
---
They picked today to be the time when challenges become both specific and vague at the same time.  
---
Historic moment.
---
I killed a Colonel Gutsy‚ãÜ‚ãÜ‚ãÜ and Sheepsquatch‚ãÜ‚ãÜ‚ãÜ. Neither completing the SCORE daily. Then a Glowing Wolf ‚ãÜ‚ãÜ‚ãÜ at the Project Paradise event, which did complete the SCORE daily.
---
 Oh no! Chain link fences that won't snap together again!
---
I'm in no means an expert when it comes to pistol builds but if you get her a good two shot or junkies one with faster fire rate or explosive you should be good for lvl 30-50. Especially if you mod it out to be automatic! 10mm pistols also aren't that expensive to buy/trade so you should be able to get a good one fairly easy.
---
Question: are you having a technical issue or a personal issue of some type?  If it‚Äôs a personal issue, is it a medical condition of some kind?
---
If it‚Äôs either of those, you have my sympathies. 
---
If not, please use more care in your communication. It‚Äôs a simple matter of respect.
---
Unpopular opinion but I don‚Äôt like this idea, then everyone would grind for the same op weapons like bloodied explosive fixers, be handmades, etc.
---
It would make several ‚Äúgood‚Äù guns now basically undesirable and everyone would use the same things 
---
I guess I‚Äôm weird I like the rng aspect of it, makes you appreciate a decent roll and try out some different guns. Granted I hate getting broadsiders and other shit guns...
---
That's true, although we did have some form of instanced settlement building in FO4 at Home Plate and the Mechanist's Lair, so maybe that's what we should be looking at for expectations.
---
The gum from your level up packs counts. 
---
‚ÄòChew Bubblegum‚Äô has been a challenge for a long time, as well. At least now it‚Äôs just one piece instead of 5.
---
I'm pretty sure they use "enemies" for that purpose.
---
Maybe not all the time, but typically.
---
And really, for this challenge, they should change it to be a 3\* enemy just to avoid this confusion.  It doesn't make sense that you'd reward players for killing the SBQ, but not the Imposter Sheepsquatch.
---
thanks for your input 0_o
---
If you decide to let it go, lemme know and name your price. I‚Äôve got the uniform and I‚Äôve been looking everywhere for a helmet.
---
Lol. Such a big macho man, this must be fulfilling for you in your poor sorry ass excuse of a life.
---
Didn‚Äôt even think alpha was a thing
---
yeah so unless you pay for fo1st good luck getting to him solo
---
Yeah, I know a bunch of people here are being snarky about 3 cap ammo sales, but I‚Äôve noticed my vendor is a *lot* more active (as a usually half-dead Forest CAMPer) and I‚Äôve been more apt to make proper purchases from others, too.
---
I heard in (probably Juicehead) a video that patch 21 would fix this
---
Bro, were you having a stroke when you posted this??
---
I thought I was the only one!!!!!
---
So?  It's also applied to those that may not be posting or asking about it.
---
 Instead of calling out someone asking questions, try calling out the fact of people posting daily that the dark matter paint should apply to the fixer. Seeing as I was asking a question, they're just complaining.
---
Ugh, that five one was just obnoxious...glad its gone...
---
Same for armour, i haven't unlocked all of the ss stuff yet, but it'd be really cool if i didnt waste hundreds if not thousands of scrip getting a one star troubleshooting chest piece, which (not that anyone would want it, unless dirt cheap) i can't even sell and only get 24 scrip back for it.
---
... I've never heard of this ability?
---
What wattage is your PSU?
---
I've been killed and killed others during defense events. If you don't enjoy any of that, just don't go into workshops. What part of that do you not understand..?
---
Huh?
---
What the actual fuck are you on about?
---
A very shitty joke.
---
Yeah, apparently those dont count along with humans apparently from what someone else said? Idk, Bethesda's categorization of enemies its just weird...
---
Try again
---
Well, people buy them to CHOOSE their mutations. By getting rads its completely random and if u get a mutation you don't want you can lose one you want to keep if you try to get rid of it. So caps is 100% guaranteed to get what you want. I sell mine for 500 caps but I've seen some for as low as 200. Good luck.
---
Took Rockstar 5 years to fix their crew system 
---
Runescape EoC was never fixed, they just started trying to market the og version of their game before they made all the changes.
---
Destiny had a laser rifle that could instakill player in pvp for at least a month or 2
---
It sucks a lot, but it‚Äôs a problem the entire industry has and a lot of them can‚Äôt be predicted. 
---
those legendary run ghillie textures though... that was just lazy bs
---
I believe changing colors is actually a bug and not the intended design of scout armor.  But yes, it is unfortunate that forest can't be changed too.
---
If you look at all the mmorpg games that have come out and get supported, very few if any are solely in the buy-to-play category. That model just doesn‚Äôt support long term growth and survival. Most end up transitioning to pay-to-play or some version of freemium. The reality is that Bethesda needs to sell shit that is borderline pay to win to the small sliver of players who will spend money so that the majority can continue to play the game for free. The alternatives are that we all put our money where our mouth is and buy fo1st so Bethesda has no excuses or we stop playing.
---
There‚Äôs a ton of creative and talented builders in this game! :) I love taking the time to scope out a CAMP; half my photomode snaps are probably just shots of other people‚Äôs CAMPs.
---
There's no button to do that though
---
No kidding...cause i swear, one of the weeklies a while back was kill 25 creatures and it seemed like everything i killed counted, humans and all
---
Go play golf, mr pres.
---
Yeah, you see these posts every once in a while, usually right after a free weekend or for this sake, gamepass added it recently.  If you have actually played the game/studied what you want in the endgame, and reach level 100+ you will quickly degrade. The community,  best in any game I have ever seen, I will never deny that. But ya know what makes you come back to a game? Actual progress, which is non existent after a while. (At least that's the case for me). Its kinda like being in a small town and you've known everybody for 30 years. Awesome community,  but there's just nothing to do after a while.
---
My wife suggested I take fireproof to lvl 3 early on, as I got into blowing up the cars. 
---
She regretted giving me that advice, because now, she has to watch me melee/fist every car we pass. Coupled with "HAHAHAHA I'M SO STRONG HUNNY, LOOKLOOKLOOKLOO-WHEEEEEEEEE!"
---
shes still wearing the ring, so I'm lucky
---
Oh my MothGod! It would be my main Emote! So many freaking assholes play this game.
---
Who knew you could accomplish such a feat!
---
Yeah, on urban scout pieces you can change "no paint" --&gt; "no paint".  The preview may not show a difference, but you can see the color change in 3rd person mode.
---
Thanks my guy. I'm actually trying to get all the mutations so I'm not worried about being selective initially.
---
I‚Äôm praying it might still be active because dumbass me finally made an alt on my own account yesterday and realized I should grind NW. My main ‚Äî and my Ghillie suit ‚Äî are on my boyfriend‚Äôs Xbox/Bethesda account.
---
The name is the only difference. All enemies with star(s) after their name are legendary.
---
Is that you, DEVGRU? If not, this happened to me yesterday, buddy joined my private server, I go to Galleria &amp; he said 'wait for me!' Then proceeds to blow up every. single. car. üòÇ
---
Well sorry, i hadnt seen any other posts like this in my feed about it, sue me
---
If you got to  Tyler County fairgrounds approximately 30 mason jars at the "Jar Toss" booth. And yes Whitespring is pretty good fo it :)
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Assuming you mean dead players. Yes, they'll drop both nuke codes and briefcases if they had them.
---
&gt; Line in the Sand
---
More like "Rain of exploding scorched"
---
To add to this, when you harvest honey you will spawn swarms just like wild beehives. To avoid exploiting, they can yield 0xp. Also, when you unlock the beehives you also unlock a bee suit (craftable at armor bench) that reduces sting damage, bee smokers (craftable at tinkers bench)  and smoker fuel (craftable at chem station) that reduces/eliminates swarms from harvesting.
---
I mean, it should be simpler. Something like this:
---
**PLAYER:**  
---
Hey Server, I'd like to craft X units of Y.  
---
**SERVER:**
---
    You are using the correct workbench to craft Y.
---
    You also have the correct perks required to craft Y.
---
    You also have Super Duper III, and Y can be Super Dupered.
---
    You also have enough room in your inventory to hold X units of Y.
---
    You also have enough resources to craft X units of Y.
---
    I will now remove these resources from your inventory.
---
    I will now add (X*1.3) units of Y to your inventory.
---
I was in 1 and 1\4 fights last week that didn't complete.  The one I was there for Nancy wouldn't quit pissing and land.  Massive bad behavior.  The one I was there for the last quarter of the fight she wouldn't land either while I was there and she was almost full health.  Most just hit minions as it was obvious it was going to fail.
---
It has just been bad this last week.  That and quest markers not showing up... God that frustrates me ü•É
---
What was the event?
---
This game has 0 hotfixes. Everything gets packaged in monthly large updates.
---
They need to get their shit together.
---
Game has turned into an eternal grind, getting quite bored at 160. How people play this game long enough to achieve ultra high levels is beyond me
---
Same. That‚Äôs when I run like hell and draw the enemies out to Mama Assaultron. Good times.
---
Are you getting xp when she dies? The servers had been pretty hit or miss the last two weeks on PC and sometimes took a few minutes to load her loot.
---
I'd say just being able to pick which part (arm/leg right/left chest) or which weapon type (semi-auto rifle, auto rifle, pistol, shotgun, heavy, melee 1h/2h) you want to roll would be a **huge** improvement.   
---
In an ideal world there'd be a system to scrap legendaries for parts to transplant specific effects to an item of your choice. Like scrap 10 random instigating weapons, then use the "instigating shards", or whatever you want to call it, to graft the instgating effect onto your rolling pin.
---
I like the thought put into this but that seems too complex for something they‚Äôd do. Trying to keep it fairly bare bones
---
Agreed. The thrill of the hunt comes when you land a good one. 
---
Like you said, it'll make it too easy to land a god tier weapon and obliterate the fun out of the game.
---
If calling you a liar when you lie makes me a macho man,  then snap into a slim jim, jackass.
---
You are right; Destiny should really be a standard for other games to aspire in this regard.
---
Where does insult bot spawn?
---
That is an awsome idea
---
Haha. I remember thinking when I got to level 100, I wouldn‚Äôt be wrecked by the level 62 charred ghouls. Nope, I still got wrecked. But that‚Äôs cause I run melee. Once I started using my Gatling laser on them, I wasn‚Äôt wrecked as much.
---
When I first got the dense mod I'd stand on every car I saw and whack it with my meat hook,  good times.
---
It‚Äôs possible. My guess is whatever forces them to make the fewest number of operational changes. The devs seem to have know idea how the Austin team developed a lot of their new systems like combat algorithms and how perk cards function. I‚Äôm sure at this point BGS is just begging them to not touch a single existing asset and just find a way to make it work without any alterations.
---
This game engine is like buying a great look suit and finding out every measurement is totally wrong.
---
Oh, that's cool.  Thanks for letting me know.
---
Lol. You just keep proving my point by being one of those people who absolutely cannot stand not being the last word in. Also, what are you off about? Lying? Lol about what? Just another reason you‚Äôve made up in your mind.
---
The character holds the bow in the wrong hand... that is fucking stupid. I haven‚Äôt found or crafted one yet, but I bet it doesn‚Äôt feel right when using one.
---
It should be ‚ÄúSpend X caps at player vendors.‚Äù That would help the economy. Most peeps just find 1 cap ammo.
---
Trying to keep simple and not exploitable
---
No, legendarys arent necessary. 
---
But a Quad Explosive Black Powder Rifle is a Quad Explosive Black Powder Rifle
---
I like your enthusiasm; upvote.
---
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a reason as they used to have hot fixes, but I have no idea why. 
---
Bethesda might be slowly taking ppl off the project or following the rockstar method hoping they can have the next GTA V. But there‚Äôs not enough content to make up for the major flaws left everywhere else.
---
Hahaha at my old CAMP, I wrote out ‚ÄúFREE FAST TRAVEL‚Äù on the wall behind my Nukashine-filled punch bowl.
---
Nope. If you die you don‚Äôt drop your codes. You do drop the briefcase though. 
---
In order to find codes you‚Äôll need to hunt for crates (orange &amp; yellow more likely to have them than blue) and creatures. Larger creatures will more than likely drop them (SB, Grafton Monsters), but you can get them from the smaller ones as well. 
---
Good luck!
---
I love it since I enjoy seeing other people‚Äôs camps . Plus I have sold a few items that have been taking space in my inventory
---
would u look at that.  just logged in.  FT to wes tek and 3*waiting for me.  took less then 2 minutes.   man this daily challenge is such a pain.
---
YUP!!! :D
---
See. All the ideas for how to make things better always come down to this. 
---
Wanting an Uber weapon. And the point of these Uber weapons is to remove as much challenge from the game. 
---
Which seems weird to me.
---
We would get 1 honey/beeswax/honeycomb every other week knowing how Bethesda works.
---
he has a tiny chance to spawn , hes mostly spawning right after u fast travel somewhere. I usually caught him after fast travel while looking around. Hes gonna approach you slowly, so u can easily just outrun him and he ll dissapear
---
I prefer 4x uny 1x chameleons. Invisibility is very good for silenced weapons like the handmade / fixer, you can stay hidden and gain sneak bonus against queen etc. I even use it on my heavy gunner because I just like the privacy of the invisibility to keep nosy players away lol
---
Typically 1-3 legendaries per run
---
What is the best mutation to sell? Just curious as I‚Äôve had a cheap Twisted Muscles for sell for ages now.
---
Yeah, simple to state. Now try it in a codebase so convoluted that having a piece of armor with "reflects 15% damage back when blocking" causes all pellets of a shotgun to crit (the so-called "magic" effect)
---
I think you‚Äôve captured the essence of it.
---
its pretty bad...
---
Ah thanks if don‚Äôt Know if there was a dedicated place
---
Did you use photo mode or the camera?
---
Yuppp I‚Äôve noticed the same thing. I have a Nukashine farm but rarely do people drink from my punch bowl üò¢ they do buy my Nukashine at 3 caps a piece in my vendor. That‚Äôs okay, but I like knowing that I instantly sent someone on a Nukashine trip rather than knowing that they saved it for later or traded it.
---
I don't think Regenerating is that uncommon, I have at least two pieces that have that effect, maybe one or two in my stash.
---
"Yes"
---
Trying to remember a OVN event I managed to get a single shot in before it gets blasted within 3 seconds of spawning. Nope, nothing.
---
Enclave all the way.
---
Drugged cookies after all.
---
So by now you probably know there's a certain meta in pvp (as is always in every mp game) and snipers are not in it...
---
However ffr auto is not end-all and there is fun to be found in many off-meta weapons...
---
My newest cheap workaround is to check if any of the people around Crater or camps nearby belong to somebody in a public group. Thanks for the lift!
---
I feel like this would kill trading for others like myself. My vendor would be useless if you could grab high tier weapons at rusty pick for 100 scrip
---
This^^
---
Or maybe even a more nuanced, ‚ÄúI spent 2000 caps on this assaultron recall card. I know how to use a terminal. I‚Äôm not a f***ing idiot. If I haven‚Äôt started the combat yet, maybe there is a reason. When you pony up and spend 2000 caps on a card, you will be allowed to choose when to activate the terminal. Now go outside before I stab you.‚Äù
---
Is that too much content for one emote?
---
He gave me a silver locket the other day... Traveled across Appalachia just to give me crappy jewelry
---
I mean, the scrip prices can be higher or lower, its just a rough idea
---
The roulette wheel has landed on red the last three time...it HAS to land on black this time
---
Go to the Grafton Lumbermill, you can easily gather hundreds of wood.
---
:)
---
Legendary effects get twisted into the negative, instead of +25% fire rate it goes to -25% fire rate and bloodied reduces your points instead.
---
Awesome thanks! Glad I have some keycards stockpiled
---
800 here. That's nothing.
---
Grounded mode lol
---
hard to buy peoples plans when they charge 300 caps for plastic yard flamingoes
---
Are you sure sheepsquatch don‚Äôt count? I think it‚Äôs only the imposter that doesn‚Äôt since it‚Äôs a robot
---
Corvega CEO hated that.
---
Just to recap:
---
you get to Reddit how you want. But I don't. 
---
Got it.
---
I feel really rude if I just buy 3 ammo and leave so I if they are selling an ammo I‚Äôll use I buy 2 and then the rest.
---
Paperwork has been filed.
---
Choose the one that you feel better while ADS.
---
Yeah I know that there is a meta, I was just kind of sad about how useless snipers are and how artificially created that problem is with the cap system, since I enjoy them for PvE and am not interested in dedicating to PvP, even with an inevitable meta all weapons should at least be viable in some capacity in my opinion instead of snipers just hitting like wet noodles, forcing you to just run when faced with PvP against anything that's not a sniper itself or melee weapon you can out-range even though in that case they can very easily out heal the damage.
---
Giant Teapot parking lot. Shoot the light blue truck first. Just one shot to take it halfway down. Then shoot the orange car. Sets off a nice chain reaction. üòÉüëç
---
Sounds like some guy has a small wiener problem, that just happens
---
Then walk and use things like your camp, vault 76 and free to join events to cut down on that.
---
Also use travel agent perk. 
---
Learn the game to your advantage
---
In lore terms... the brotherhood better give us dwellers anything we damn well please, they‚Äôve been wiped out already by a threat that they know we slap around for fun and gear.  There‚Äôd be no technology to protect here without us, it‚Äôd be a scorched wasteland they couldn‚Äôt hope of setting foot in. In fact, most people in Appalachia should view our characters as living gods.
---
The only thing that still scares me
---
Wait, is that where it is? In with whatshername that leads the raiders? No wonder I can't find it, I haven't gone in there since the storyline made me... I just assumed they didn't have one for some reason.
---
For me it was more like [this](https://youtu.be/9Jz1TjCphXE)
---
Still can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre getting a Grelok bundle before we get anything for Manta Man, The Inspector, or The Mistress of Mystery.
---
I hated the stealth junkie commando build. All those tanky perks wasted and terrible sbq damage. Also pvp is foolish in adventure. Battle of the duped cheese guns and mag glitches. " Oofta,  he must have more duped stealth boys, quantums, and tesla ammo than me. I lose."
---
I switched my junkie to heavy gunner. Way more fun IMO
---
I think OP means players that died from the storm?
---
I am not too worried about spending caps. I figure I gotta spend caps anyway to keep from hitting max so I might as well do it traveling. I don‚Äôt think twice about fast travel costs. 
---
Reality is that a berserker build is a non meta play style. You will have trouble finding a good weapon because no one has the stash space to save it. I really only keep weapons I think will be popular enough to sell within a couple weeks and even that usually fails because everyone wants the AA/SS powerfist for 1k caps rather than what it‚Äôs worth.
---
You probably can't use a bow right-handed because you have a huge Pip-Boy on your left wrist.
---
Man, I've got the opposite problem.  I run a stealth build, so I can tank all three pylons easy.  I have to look around to see what we're working with for damage before I set a pile of Super Stimpaks on fire.
---
Reason #5,390 that I'm glad I don't waste time with other players.
---
BoS is about to be infiltrated by MEMBERS.
---
Doing dailies felt like a second job. So I stopped doing them.
---
Lol white springs
---
Yea that where is at and it annoying
---
This was one of my favorite activities in Fallout 3.
---
Even if I'm low on ammo I have to kill them cars.
---
If you're looking for cool battles at workshops, join a discord role playing channel, like BoS or WVR; they have pvp subgroups with occasional friendly takeover events with set rules, e. g. no legacies.
---
It's a cool camp in it's own right, very creative and as a person who has personally messed around with building exploits (these are exploits btw) to make these non-box shaped camps I can appreciate how many hours and tedium it took.
---
Maybe if there was specifically a competition they put out then it would be a good entry but let's not go around shouting "put my camp in-game" until the game is in a much more polished, content rich state please.
---
I buy bobble heads and treasure maps if sensibly priced.  I‚Äôll also buy duplicate plans from low level players to give them the caps.
---
photomode, why do you ask?
---
Perfect, built in arm guard.
---
EDIT: Actually nah they don't even hold the bow properly. So arm guard won't matter. Without "Aiming" they hold the bow to the side like a gangsta holds a handgun.
---
I only used the bow for a short time, imho the only thing that needs fixing is that the first shot in vats ALWAYS misses.
---
Iron sights? Why even bother with them?
---
I mean it‚Äôs not my favorite song....but if that was playing while I was fighting the colossus there‚Äôd be a living room mosh and and forehead sized crack on the tv
---
I run fire proof on all my bloody builds. Eliminates explosions, more of a tickle...I even thru Molotovs at my feet to tag multiple ghouls.
---
Finally, the bloodied nerf we've all been waiting for!
---
It's possible to discover someone's location based on IP addresses. When you join a party, the connections are peer to peer and IP addresses of all the participants are known at that point. That's how that person could tell your state and town, at least. However, it's not possible for someone to shutdown your Wireless Access to the Internet this way UNLESS they're within range themselves...
---
Edit: make sure your router is properly secured too: if they know your external IP address and your router is using default admin credentials, they can login and shutdown your access to the Internet that way.

You don‚Äôt have to do the NW challenge to complete the LR. Doing them is your choice. 
---
The 3 Star needs to be a creature. Often you can find a scorched beast at a fissure is a 3 star. Or fight the SBQ.
---
If leveling up is going to take a while. You can always make an alt and level them up very quickly. 
---
The score points is for your account not your character.
---
They also said the challengers will get harder as they progress towards the end. They can‚Äôt always be chewing gum.
---
Basically the exact same build, but swap commando perks for rifleman perks and switch to powerful automatic receiver on your handmade, fixer or combat rifle
---
Not only that but it's simply non-viable late game, I wanted bows to work, I had a character focused on bows which I used that way up to about level 75 but there it just became more and more obvious how utterly useless the bow is against any event boss mob or even just tougher enemys.
---
No dent in an imposter sheepsquatsch, not even in a regular legendary one and don't get me started on the impossibility that is reaching the damage threshhold for loot on the SBQ with a bow.
---
I had all perks possible to boost damage/armor pen, including stealth and everything boosting stealth multipliers and I still couldn't compare to any other build damage wise.
---
I get that its meant to be a trade-off for it being noiseless but the damage it does is just too low for its fire rate one of the two needs buffing, well either that or an inherit additional stealth multiplier to double down on the stealth aspect.
---
Galleria is the best show around appalachia.
---
What I meant is give people a reason to play the mode as opposed to AFKing for hours. Every game mode I've played where people were incentivized to play by not playing ended up dead very quickly. Probably the saddest one was the zombies multiplayer playlist in COD WW2, it was so fun but 2/3 of the lobby was just standing around or walking in circles. NW is almost as bad
---
Fair point.
---
So I'll add - So you get to get to criticize how i Reddit? But I don't?
---
Lmao they‚Äôre adding junk fences, fucking Fallout 4 junk fences, and you suckers are going to pay real money for them holy shit what a pathetic community
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say obsessed, but I‚Äôve used it as a tactic since fo4 in fights I‚Äôm outclassed in. Maneuver yourself so death claw or raiders will close on a car, and fire or toss a grenade at the car instead of the people. More bang for your buck.
---
Photo mode seems to be better than the camera.
---
Not much at all
---
Three of my friends LOVE this. Two of which are beefy speedy melee characters... I'm a sneaky ranged character...  The timing after they run up and hit a car while I'm trailing behind is unfortunate. 
---
I'm just in time to catch the explosions while they're off to the next car already.
---
Lately I‚Äôve seen people creep farther and farther outside so they can mow down more mobs. But they forget the ghouls come in the front door sometimes too. The jukebox gets demolished and I have to go repair it again.
---
I‚Äôm happy to sit and play an instrument if 1) people keep the ghouls off of me 2) keep the ghouls off the jukebox and 3) please let me get one hit on the legendary 
---
But it rarely works out that way.
---
Take a workshop, build before the defend mission starts, leave.
---
It‚Äôs pretty much everyone doing this, just one of the many perks of having public teams.
---
I suppose it adds a bit to the realism. Crafting items in SWTOR often takes hours if not the better part of a day. If it didn't though there would be way too much vendor trash. I have like 8ncharacters on SWTOR of various levels and I have WAYYYYY too much stuff.
---
But then again you can make virtually as much soup as you want if you have enough ingredients. I'm not spamming modded weapons in batches and I don't think anyone does...
---
Maybe.. I did notice once that I think I got event or some of the event reward while I fast traveled away (checked the queen ran across the field and checked her kick and got loot ran back across field and SBQ not there, she teleported to the bunker, I ran there and she still empty, maybe got mad, and fast traveled) . I then noticed at the vendor that either the kids SB gave me a ton of meat that I must have got something from SBQ.and I think I got repair kits.
---
Two other times I definitely got nothing.  The event wouldn't even show on my data page.  One of those times however I got loot from the queen, some one star rolling pin.
---
I think it's got something to do with patch 21 why suddenly queen fighting is getting steadily super crappy this last month.
---
And how much did you mod fallout4 to get those hundreds of hours of content..cause it wasnt in the base game.
---
Whitesprings...
---
Hehehe
---
You made a whole new reddit account just to come here and say you returned to the game for 30 mins and didn't like that you did a newbie quest and enemies were low level? (Oh, my bad. Not new, just barely used)
---
As another player said, just boot up the game. Make a new character, or not, it matters not to us since you already decided it wasn't fun to do the new quests on your old account.
---
I found a radiation site and I just stand near the barrels until I get one. Then server hop after curing it.
---
truth brother, preach. sadly this game gets boring really quick even without grinding pointless god rolls.
---
Damn, I must have gotten really lucky. I saw the challenge, and immediately went to Westek, where a 3* was chillin outside. A few shots later it was done.
---
I agree.
---
I cant play more than a few hours most days but I always am able to get my 200gold a day. If it was more, I'd feel left behind compared to hardcore players.
---
Where the patch note?!? I know we getting the 8player event and the BOS event  but are we getting anything else
---
youre doing too well?! youre playing this game like someone who enjoys the game?! fnck you.
---
Just wait till people find out the new boss event is limited to two teams only. AND according to AngryTurtle pretty much bones anyone but Bloodied Builds from completing it.
---
Back in survival servers snipers absolutely annihilated all others without that dmg cap... F76 is, for better or worse, geared towards pve and devs have other work to do (*cough Atom shop) than normalize every weapon in pvp. 
---
Also a side note: melee is actually pretty great and extremely fun, since no one uses Blocker anymore ;)
---
What did it say, it was indeed removed.
---
This, I switch between Commando and Rifleman perk cards all the time.
---
Idk who keeps repairing him after I shotgun him and take the scraps. Whoever they are is a real jerk though.
---
3 weeks 
---
I did the math
---
The ones at whitesprings are great when a ghoul mob is chasing you. Jump over a row of cars, make them blow up behind you
---
I just tried it and either I‚Äôm dense or it doesn‚Äôt work... but either way I couldn‚Äôt get the stuff to stay priced in the vendor. So maybe I‚Äôm gonna have to walk em up
---
My guild has a blind guy. But he's been unable to play since VATS became broken.
---
Reminds me of the oobe exploit way way back for the orginal gta. It had a chat room where you could play vs randos. The guy who wrote the site thought it was a good idea to give out all the ip's of users in the room
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is. Not really sure why the camera was bothered with considering photomode allows your to change settings and take pictures faster.
---
A more violent vomiting emote that makes goo piles that have your insulted notes inside
---
And the junkyard workshop too.
---
Just do a bloodied build.
---
BTW Bethesda I killed a 3* Blood Eagle Captain during Riding Shotgun and it didn't count.  I launched a nuke for a SBQ fight and someone killed it in 2 seconds.
---
But it takes longer to set up photo mode :/
---
Damn dude youre pathetic ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
it was awsome!!!
---
Workshops my good man.
---
I know it was too strong then but I don't see the point of a damage per shot cap to prevent one-shots, when it is still possible by other means anyway.
---
And as to the argument of PvE focus and them not having time to normalize weapons for PvP, I have mentioned before that removing PvP from adventure mode entirely might be the best option, as there is still NW for those who want a PvP Fallout experience.
---
And well my build includes blocker as I have unarmed in my arsenal as well and I don't want to be chewed up by ghouls in-case stealth is broken \^\^ but that won't help me with getting one-shot by some high fire-rate gun.
---
Look for the hoarde events or Surface to Air and you'll get it no problem.
---
Honestly, I agree. But everyone would still complain about it. As much as I'd rather be able to just find a plan for mannequins or a PA display in the open world, I think it'd be worth the money. Plus its not like atoms are that hard to get.
---
They're not very specific are they? It would have been nice if it had said:  
---
*"Kill a Legendary 3-Star animal or humanoid (0/1)"*
---
A red rocket truck stop up north is a good spot too
---
your saying yes. the other person says no.. so whos..correct
---
I went for the SBQ myself and it worked out well for me.
---
Wait, what? You can fast travel to another player or their camp?
---
Pretty much this. I don't understand why people are pretending they're forced into doing them. Each of the cancer dailies is only 250 score. If you really don't want to do them, don't. There is more than enough score to reach 100 if you started from the beginning and participated in the double exp/double daily. There will most likely be another double daily event near the end, too. And even if all of that is not enough for you, all you're missing out on is some cosmetics and a few small packages of caps, scrip, atoms. If this is getting to the point where it feels like another job, just use an hour's worth of money from your real job to buy far more atoms than you get out of this
---
Why???
---
M + T + Down Arrrow + Down Arrow + Right Arrow.
---
Otherwise known as bring up the map, photomode then turning off Depth of Field. 
---
That's really all you will usually need unless you just prefer something crazy.
---
Way too much lmao. You have a 2/9 chance of getting one for turning in the pleasant valley tickets, absolute most would be 500 caps but even 200 is pushing it
---
Don‚Äôt worry about those people don‚Äôt get any love and won‚Äôt do nothing in real life they‚Äôre just internet gangsters they would cry if you just back hand them in person
---
A few hundred caps at most. Pretty common since wastelanders, it used to be a very rare event drop
---
Just remember to have FIREPROOF, preferably at level 3, while blowing up cars.. you‚Äôll die less often üòÖ
---
Buy brambles from atom shop, clump them together into a dense blueprint, bring your bush everywhere
---
tickets duped to hell. prices crashed. 500-1000 if you're lucky
---
750w
---
I've been involved in a few "end game" things. I've gotten all the weapons I could ever want. Many unicorn legacies and other god level ones. I'm about 20 plans shy of having 100% plans finished. And I need two or three rare outfits to finish that collection. What's next? Maybe rare junk to display? Maybe solo queen? Definitely isn't much to do beyond that for the longer term players
---
I nuked the Nuka Cola plant for my first launch, idk why really lol
---
Funny enough I find the chewing gum one hard sometimes... I can never remember where they spawn hahha
---
We all skipped leg day
---
I didn't know that about the alts, thanks
---
At this stage of the game its ridiculous that we cant do this.  I cant see a negative side to this
---
&gt; Your character holds every weapon in the right hand, even melee, so they are right handed, if you are right handed you hold the bow in your left and draw with the right.
---
Aren't you technically holding the hunting rifle in a left-handed manner? The bolt is on the left side, if it was right-handed the bolt would be on the right and you would be holding the rifle further to the left
---
It was a shitshow but they fix it with wastelanders update which added quests and endgame gear (it grindly ) 
---
But I‚Äôll be honest with you , if you are a seasonal mmorpg player Fallout 76 don‚Äôt expect fallout 76 to be one. You will be disappointed
---
Because I like to switch between my Lever Action or Fixer/Handmade on certain days.
---
Who says you have to level up a high level character? I got second place in NW with a level zero overseer ranked character.
---
Turn your router off for awhile and call your internet provider asking for an ip change. Say these words (doesn't have to be exact): "Hi, I'm calling you today because I was recently taken offline by someone over the internet and would like my ip to be changed." What they'll do is track where the packets came from to boot you offline and arrest the booter (assuming they aren't using a VPN) and you'll get a new IP address. In the future don't join parties with people you don't know, keep trading to dms. It's alot safer.
---
What I read a while ago was that the red/sec also influenced mutation rates.
---
I used Emmett Mountain do get mutations naturally.
---
High rad/sec pools and a decontamination shower all in an indoor environment, so if you take too many rads and die, you just respawn at the entrance.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Emmett\_Mountain\_disposal\_site](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Emmett_Mountain_disposal_site)
---
I sell it for 99 caps. I sell the one with chaps for 150
---
C O R K
---
I was at one of those events today.  Everyone except me was standing behind the barriers with an OP gatling of some sort mowing down the scorched.  I just equipped my shotgun and ran at the front line so I could actually gain XP myself.
---
Tomorrow.
---
S
---
Thanks for the feedback, ya it is pretty basic isn‚Äôt it... I‚Äôll go back and fix that.
---
Man, I have literally done exactly that.  "Okay, I have 10min to kill.  Ya, I can toast the bread, no problem."
---
&gt; ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ Bloodied Explosive Rapid Handmade Rifle |100 Scrips
---
LOL I wish I had some of whatever you're having. Bethesda is never going to give you god rolls for free. They only did it once with the unstoppable monster, and it was most likely an accident on their part. They will never let you craft custom legendaries, they will never let you buy guaranteed drops as good as that for any price, and they will certainly not remove timegates from it all. This is their business model for the game
---
The fasnacht collectron brings you gum.
---
I'd say 50 caps
---
 Cause you can get it easier than pushing out a 10lb shite.
---
You are right, I must of mistaken the Western Outfit for something else.
---
Not on a PC
---
Same. Its rare that I come across anything I need anymore.
---
If I can't shoot off arrows like I'm Legolas, why even give me a bow?
---
I was expecting a rick roll and the sound fit perfectly with my disappointment
---
I play both and eso is way better...
---
Fallout 76 is limited online game with 24 players per server. No text chat and no dungeons (yet)
---
But I‚Äôm hopeful for the future of the game other then the 24 player cap , Bethesda could add dungeons and raids and better gearing
---
Yeah the hunting rifle has been wrong since F04. That's a weird Bethesda thing that every one who played the game hated.
---
Can't get mods to fix it in 76 though :(
---
Edit: The hunting rifle is wrong is my point, it's chamber for left handed use. Which unless everyone in Appalachia and Boston was left handed and had custom rifles made, is wrong... An thinking about it, it's chambered to the left hand and still held in the right so that is a double F for Bethesda there.
---
The XP you get from the enemy‚Äôs the SBQ spawns...when you kill her fast less XP. Can easily craft more ammo no problem
---
I‚Äôve killed 3 different 3 star enemies and none have mine worked for the event so don‚Äôt be too happy when you find one only get happy when you get the points.
---
It only takes longer because it takes more points to rank up. 
---
I‚Äôm currently rank 72 and even with 9 daily challenges it still doesn‚Äôt usually take more than an hour to complete. Which is fortunate for me because the game is so boring now that an hour is all I can stand.
---
Relog each time you get one
---
Let me guess... all robots?
---
Ah thanks!
---
While blocking?  Is this another shotgun bug?
---
Also Free Range, Project Paradise and if a Wendigo counts as a creature, One Violent Night. 
---
Edit; I‚Äôve heard others say sheepsquatch doesn‚Äôt work, but it did for me.
---
They said that daily challenges would take 1-2 hours, with it being more towards an hour near the start and 2 hours near the end.
---
To all low levels wondering how to get hits. Craft. Molotov. Throw Molotov. Drink and watch them buuuurn
---
T-60 has knight bos
---
Touching on this subject. Which guns use the commando cards?
---
Tbh I want zeta content more than bos content
---
"[removed]" is 10x funnier, trust me.
---
i went in to the burrows and there was 1 in the first area. there were 2 more in the place
---
It has to be creatures. so. no humans or robots
---
Yeah i would like that that would be cool
---
No I killed a ghoul, a blood raider or whatever their called, and a fog crawler.
---
I know that i mean the new pa the t65
---
In addition, if you join a team you get to travel to your teammates camp for free. They‚Äôre marked in yellow like your own.
---
Well, at least you're not a rocket scientist like some posters we've had.
---
humans and robots don't count as it has to be a creature
---
Not much, but sometimes you can meet raiders or settlers in a fight, you get a pixel of progression if you assist them.
---
Your post suggest that you though it was only t-51b
---
It's now has became second nature to me to see a car and immediately blow it up, no questions asked, and even in battle and watch things get rekt by it, and sometimes myself.
---
PSA: if you are part of a team, and your teammate gets a tag on a legendary in an event, but you do not, the legendary will still drop loot for you.
---
Please sire, notes for the poor?
---
I had a level 6 launch nuke and fight the queen
---
Bows feel like a support weapon. Not a mob cleaner, but it is certainly good enough to perform.
---
I like them as a way of "nerfing" myself. Sneak, aim, shot. No autoshooting from a distance until the enemies explodes without knowing what happened to him. 
---
Killing is much more satisfying.
---
What about the fog crawler?
---
that blows.
---
K i love you. 
---
K bye
---
1 .38 mm 
---
1 .38 mm
---
1 .38 mm annnnd done!
---
Why do i feel like I‚Äôve just found my support group? - Me: ‚ÄúHello, my name is David and I‚Äôm an exploding car addict‚Äù ... Group: ‚ÄúHello David‚Äù
---
Nearly every horde event is a 3* horde boss. Happy hunting.
---
If you mod it as a flamer it‚Äôs good for a rifleman weapon, but don‚Äôt base your raid choice on that, it‚Äôs not game changing or anything like that.
---
Rank 50 is pretty bad right ?
---
I appreciate the help, I really do, but it's not needed. I'm aware of building in workshops.  My complaint isn't motivated by difficulty, it comes from an aversion to rote, menial tasks.  The "challenge" is to trade 40 wood and 20 steel for 250 score. That's it. And if I'm lucky, the game wont bug and result in a permanent set of stairs that I'm unable to remove without making a new CAMP.  If you're a casual player it might not seem like a big deal but, to date, I've crafted/scrapped hundreds of floors/stairs/fires,etc for atoms/score.  This game doesnt need to be a building contractor grind.
---
Any rifle that has an automatic receiver mod applied to it will benefit from the commando perks. Handmade, Fixer, combat rifle, assault rifle, Tommy gun, Tesla (I believe), pipe, probably some that I'm missing...
---
Nice!  I got a bloodied 40% swing speed hatchet the other day.  Usually get crap from her lol
---
Games are supposed to be fun, but this is a GaaS model game.
---
Fun will never be it's primary goal
---
Oh awesome
---
Nice. I'm curious to know how the 250 dr works with a bow. Is it while it's in the process of being pulled back, or while its drawn?
---
Personally, I seem to find him more frequently in the Mire and parts of the Savage Divide :)
---
2 of my teammates were there but no one else got to tag the boss except for Mr. Lives-in-his-mom's-basement-and-shits-in-a-bucket
---
Omg i barely relized i meant t60 sorry for being illiterate
---
I knew this actually. Found it out by... You guessed it... BUTTON MASHING A
---
I use nothing but a hunting rifle at all times and pick everyone off from a distance. You should be able to do the same with every none heavy weapon with the right perks.
---
server hop in the mire maybe?  What I'm gonna try when I get home lol.
---
So godmode still there? Oof.
---
Every time I go to one it‚Äôs a one or two star, maybe fallout just hates me today lol thanks though I‚Äôll be sure to keep trying them
---
I really wonder if Bethesda doesn't contract a lot of this outside.
---
yeah its free too which is nice.
---
Mine might be messed up I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm about to get off and back on to see if it fixes itself.
---
A 3* Sheepsquatch from Project Paradise worked for me today.
---
Ok so i have argued your point before and got berated for my troubles...
---
Here is the thing. I get why ppl do it and its systemic of the way events work.
---
Let me give u an example of something else that happens. You do ALL of campfire tales and just want the legendary kill and what happens. A low level turns up and kills nia.....
---
So what happens next time. They ain‚Äôt getting that chance again...
---
Encrypted is a bit different but the behavioural reason is the same...
---
Team members, yes. Free fast travel to player, camp and FO1st tents.
---
Cool story, bro.
---
If you haven't realized yet nobody is saying that this is necessarily hard, just potentially time consuming. And those of us with limited play time may have to opt to work on other things than take, what could be, a significant amount of time. Just because you had one right there doesn't mean that every player will as well.
---
I'm glad that you were able to knock yours out so quickly.
---
Thank you
---
My husband can't leave a car, it has to explode, i didn't know cars did that when i started the game and he almost killed me a couple of times ü§£
---
I think you can find someone to trade it to you I‚Äôm not sure if its droppable
---
Couldn't tell yet. I rarely get spotted by enemies and the bow is pretty damn silent
---
Bethesda is greedy, anyone who tries to make a GaaS always online game is definitely doing it for the money.
---
Wow 
---
Your on Xbox and your IP info still available to other player over console? That crazy
---
Any automatic rifle (if converted to automatic) such as Assault Rifle, Handmade, The Fixer, Combat Rifle, Laser Rifle, Pipe Rifle, and I think a couple more that I can‚Äôt remember.
---
And now we know why the post is NSFW
---
Everytime I step outside my house than the game there's a 3-star legendary I don't know why they just love me SMH
---
It just works
---
The combat marine helmet and the metal helmet can be scrapped to learn the plans. None of the others can.
---
I wish they would ban those posts.  It takes all of 2 seconds to check the Bethedsa portal for a status update
---
Don't worry, bloodied builds get rekt in the new Colossal Problem event :D
---
Bethesda should honestly just delete the legacy weapons from the game tbh. They're not obtainable anymore, so why keep them in the game?
---
It sounds like you experienced a DDos attack. This is illegal and you should contact both Xbox live and your ISP. Apparently people can gain access to you IP address when you are in party chat and use it to shut you down. As an Xbox user myself, the fact that this can happen really sucks. I hope you get your internet back soon.
---
Yep, love that workshop.  Junk boxes are highly underrated, I always need screws and gears.
---
Kill the SBQ...
---
I'd like the end game gear to be granted to me after completing a difficult challenge. I don't want to wait literal months to grind billion.
---
I still haven't launched one yet. Did get to the end of the quest, only to accidentally enter the last number wrong.
---
I have like 4 uny ss right legs but i only need one with wep weight reduction! Been trying for so long to get the exact rolls i need!!!!!
---
You're not wrong. Bethesda's code is supposedly linked list hell, so god knows how something as simple as the above would break.
---
It's certainly takes dedication. I have T-65, all the guns / useful mods and I'm now starting on SS armor. I can tell you that if you don't care it makes little difference in your playing the game. T-65 feels about the same as the others in terms of protection, gauss mini uses so much expensive ammo it's not worth using over UGL. Gauss shotty is a beast tho.
---
You got the curse. Need to sacrifice a sheepsquatch to the altar of Mothman to free yourself of the bad juju. Gl
---
I understand that rationale more with events like Campfire tales, uranium fever, etc where the Legendaries can be easily 1-shot.
---
But it's a whole other level of douchebag-ery to show up to an event that someone else does the work to start, where the boss is tanky enough for your average group of players to shoot for longer than 5 seconds...same as with the queen.
---
I only rock t60 because I spent so much time grinding to get the elder paint so I would love to have it on other PA. I also hope there‚Äôs some cool outfits, the only ones I really like are super rare drops and the rng gods hate me lol
---
Maybe he's just really good. Maybe he just learned to succumb to the modern dreary-ness of wanting to get out of mom's basement. He got a real job, got a good girlfriend, made a wife out of her and then one evening he comes home early from work....to discover...you in an encryptid event and is like " f*** this basement dweller" and proceeds to make sure you do all the leg work for his prize....and the his wife cheats on him.
---
As a flamer ???
---
i believe when you start it it notifies on a popup
---
That SHOULD count as it is a creature
---
Hahaha I got mine during Fasnacht this year! I‚Äôve been teleworking and during Fasnacht, I logged in every hour on the hour. Loaded in just as someone was nuking it. Fun times.
---
Only perk I know to be good for bloodied is Nerd Rage, I‚Äôm sure there might be more though
---
Susan did you put liquor in ma nuka cola?
---
the challenge is to collect enough bullion and rep and materials to craft the endgame gear.
---
Difficult enough for you?
---
Yessss with viable 3-star Tenderizers we Monster Hunter now
---
Scorched earth
---
Photo mode sucks for taking pictures of a moving target.
---
This was an awful one today.  Hopped servers until found a SBQ and just did that.
---
Most people would agree that the event is actually better when it's bugged.
---
To cancel a shot open your pipboy.
---
Settler Wanderer needs to take a bath
---
It can't now. They made it a plan for the treasure hunter event. Lame.
---
U get it in a house by the nuka cola plant
---
I have one too and never remove it.
---
Omg right? I hope this peasant isnt speaking ill of our great prophet The Angry Turtle.
---
Ill be ready for pvp, be that the case. That man is a god
---
Uranium Fever routinely spawns 3*...
---
Ditto
---
First, I‚Äôd suggest unarmed rather than melee, but do 2H at least if you‚Äôre dead set. 
---
That said, AP boosts and refresh are your absolute best friends, focus on boosting available HP/AP rather than DR. Serendipity, Dodgy, Evasive, etc standard bloody perks will provide more than enough reduction by pure avoidance, you won‚Äôt need too much DR to be able to tank the few hits that come in. Dense torso helps significantly, ultralight legs and brawling arms can go a long way. Keep well tuned. Carnivore is an absolute must, big time melee/unarmed damage boosts. If you run class freak 3, you can add bird bones and egghead with minimal impact to damage output. 
---
There‚Äôs a lot of good info out there, but it‚Äôs really trial and error to exactly how you play.
---
Well then I must be the most unlucky person in the world rn, I keep getting 1*
---
Took me a very long time to even find one /public and private servers.  Finally found a 3* super mutant at census violence event.
---
Yes i want that steel dawn fatigues from the community event
---
I run bloodied, but whenever encrypted pops up, I know I'm going to have to grab pylons. First thing I do is fast travel to the event, and then pop RadAway till I'm back at 100%.
---
Why do u think bloodied will get killed during that?
---
So they should also remove all the legendary dragons, quad and double harpoons too?
---
I've had it happen with an assault rifle. Way better with a double barrel. I don't know how to trigger it, but I'd like to. Unfortunately it goes back to normal when you have to unload.
---
Or hold reload
---
Splitter barrel on the plasma gun turns it into a flamer, not a shotgun.
---
They said the ranks not the dailies.
---
i believe she didn‚Äôt do one, she was chosen on merit alone if you listen to all her holotapes 
---
the morgantown schools or the vtec uni has tapes alluring to this
---
All we need is an event that deals unavoidable damage over time, consistently. Bloodied will struggle there to regulate that health bar. I'm assuming this is why I don't see them on pylons too much and down in the mines grabbing ore. 
---
However let's blame jerks as a whole, as there's just as many full health jerks around.
---
Blows my mind how the same company (albeit, zenimax more involved than the other) as ESO and it's horrific power balance nerfing moves can claim relative ownership of this free range pissing contest.
---
It‚Äôs a bug that‚Äôs been around for a while. Once you use all the ammo in the gun it will revert back to normal operation.
---
lol... glad I'm not the only one.. I was asked, why I wear it by a friend... NO idea... I think simply cuz it's Unique.
---
Are you referring to the Funky Mothman and the Protectron Shuffle (aka The Robot)? The two currently available dancing emotes are perks given to for FO1 subscribers.
---
Lots of people who feel entitled to it and get salty and behave that way in relation....
---
I have thought that u should have always get the legendary drop from the boss during an event... Uranium fever is the worst example of all of this...
---
Railway Rifle too
---
Look for a looking for group. There are usually a few for encryptid
---
They are really cool, I hope there‚Äôs more colors than just the baby blue camo
---
No, I would rather some actual gameplay, and for good gear to be available just like any other Fallout game.
---
It's free to get inside Vault 79, why wouldn't you? Even if you don't use plasma weapons it weighs .3 pounds if you remove all the mods so storing it is a non issue.
---
Ideally it should just be a feature. 
---
I saw someone suggest that how berry mentats (?) Highlight living targets, we should get something to consume to highlight dead bodies.
---
Yeah, it's probably way too complicated. Even when I was typing it out I thought to myself that bee sting damage is so small to that making an item to negate it would be pointless.
---
If you took part in Encryptid recently and saw a Science scribe just standing motionless, sorry, that was me. My controller batteries ran out. 
---
When the new ones were in the event was over and I had a new mascot suit. And somehow still alive. 
---
Sorry, well done, sorry.
---
So I guess they meant the challenges would get more difficult? I took it that it would just take longer to rank up.
---
I suppose that‚Äôs where game experience makes the difference. I think I‚Äôve just been playing long enough to know exactly where to go to knock these challenges out in good time.
---
If it's like other similar weapons, basically useless, as it would not count charge time. Only the tiny window between firing off the arrow and the game replenishing it would count
---
I am not a low level and still do this.
---
Easy XP and save on ammo.
---
Yes! I‚Äôve sold so many bullet. Lol. I do get people buying 3 separate bullets. But I also get more sales.
---
oh so the recall card you can sometimes find at railway stations is for, i didn‚Äôt know
---
Silo charlie always has one 3 stars ghoul
---
Weapons with weak per shot damage get wrecked hard by armor, and after level 20 every single enemy in the game will be a heavily armored tank, scorched are the least armored common enemy and they still rock 80+ armor at high levels that means any weapon dealing 80 damage or less is getting it's damage more than cut in half. 
---
The only thing you can do is stack all the damage and armor piercing you can get to try to overcome this. 
---
Slow hard hitting weapons are so heavily favored in this game, and pistols are not that kind of weapon, especially semi and full auto type.
---
I just sell the claim tickets for 75 caps. But I would not pay more than a couple hundred caps for unique outfits unless I just really needed to use some caps.
---
That's the gatling plasma, the splitter works as intended on a plasma rifle and it also has a flamer barrel
---
This is the answer
---
I think they meant it would take longer to do the challenges. Like having to find a 3 star legendary creature over just a 3 star legendary.
---
It comes out tomorrow
---
The defense event begins a public event on the map essentially saying "come kill me".  That's just stupid.   Like I said...  This was the first time since the game launched that this had happened to me.  If the stupid fucking challenges didn't force me to take workshops I wouldn't ever touch them in public servers. 
---
There's no need to do fucking pvp with people just trying to find a sliver of enjoyment.  Go play NW if you want that shit.
---
I would have thought that would be enough, but I suppose if the efficiencies aren't great or your input power isn't what it should be (due to volt drop and such) then I suppose that could be dropping out... I'd download some benchmarking software and see if you can recreate the crash that way, could also be a RAM issue or an overclocking issue (if you've decided to clock the GPU or CPU at all)
---
You aren‚Äôt paying attention.
---
Tomorrow at daily reset time will be when maintenance starts, when it ends, who knows?
---
I know i just wanted to make sure they felt included!
---
Edit: your input wasn't known. I learned that defensive response as a kid and im STILL shaking the bad habit. Thank you for your input! :)
---
Nice story! Thanks for sharing.
---
No CAMP exploit/glitch has had any repercussions. Even the early Wastelanders display duplication glitch
---
I found the 3 Legendary Creatures Challenge quite easy by just doing Uranium Fever, with 3 fixed spawns.
---
1. Yes
---
2. Have you even seen bloodied Colossal Problem gameplay?
---
Use the search function for the other thousand topics on this.
---
It‚Äôs an exploit. Exploits are bannable offenses.
---
The question is will Bethesda do anything, and no one knows
---
I used to have a camp in Charleston, it got nuked 6 times in the 2 weeks I was built there.
---
I am aware of the glitch, but currently there is no way to scrap them from your build budget.
---
i use a lot pve perks like auqaboy for prime example and just lay on the bottom of grafton lake or in the deepest spot of a stream.
---
you have to break down your whole camp i think. then it gets rid of them
---
What is a better fixer? 
---
Two-Shot/25% Faster Fire/+1 Per 
---
or 
---
Quad Ammo/+33% VATS Chance/25% Less AP?
---
1 daily mission a day is painful?
---
I love it. I use a flamer on it as mentioned. With bloody mess perk it results in hilarious explosions of flaming green goo.
---
I use it in almost all situations except when the enemies are high level.
---
It's very easy. Just do one of the harder events. First thing I did when I saw the challenge was complete  project paradise.
---
Yes thats a great idea
---
I'm realizing that the other guy is right. no one was banned for any other camp glitches including the display case dupe and that one was huge
---
Did you even click on the link? It says right in the post "As always, patch notes for tomorrow's update will be posted during maintenance."
---
hmm ok thats good to know. May focus on getting her the armor penetration mag and see how much that helps
---
Oh you mean turtle? I love his accent.
---
They're worth way more then that. You actually can't put a price on them.üòÇ
---
Yeah listening to them just now is what made me think of the question. Morgantown high-school just said she was accepted to VTU and VTU one says 'I must have impressed the right people' but how did she impress them if she didn't do an experiment? Having straight A's doesn't impress people who care more about actual results from morally reprehensible experiments
---
There‚Äôs a small chance that you accidentally blocked him. Happens to me often when I try to quickly join or fast travel to my friend. The game glitches and for some reason it will randomly give me the option to ‚Äúadd‚Äù or ‚Äúblock‚Äù
---
So go to your social. You‚Äôll see your online friends. Keep going down, to your offline friends. Eventually you might see his name.
---
Oh hell yeah
---
Best way to grab pylons whilst being bloodied at this event is cooking some schorchedbeast meat, there is a cooking station behind the little shack. It gives about 400-500 HP. 
---
You can grab 2 pylons and manage to hold on without being downed [youll need some stims of course]. But it works!
---
&gt; Where the patch note?
---
They usually don't release those ahead of the patch.
---
Slap on blocker and you're fine.
---
I get a giggle out of catching players who are afk for a long period of time and blowing up cars around them to see if their TV volume is up loud enough to get them to come running to see what happened. Then I just raider salute and hop away if they start moving.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/fPSas0ftnlgD0FcZNnMoL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-introducing-the-2020-roadmap-and-76-seasons
---
If you mean the QA at the bottom of this article which is the only place they talked about anything close to what you are saying. Then yes I am and they clearly mention ranks not challenges.
---
I think I read something about a fix for the social menu glitch in the next patch tomorrow, but I‚Äôm unsure of the details
---
I would run the Two Shot if not doing VATS but the Quad is a great role to use VATS. Use the Quad, it‚Äôs more valuable too.
---
Have you tried removing him from your friends list and re-adding him?
---
I get you :)
---
Then all of a sudden we had some other ban waves.
---
who knows when or for what reason they‚Äôll strike.
---
up to you if you want to risk iy
---
Go to Ohio River Adventures. There‚Äôs a raider there that you can sell Mirelurk meat to for rep. Selling 1 queen mirelurk meat is the best. Also can only be done once a day.
---
I think it would be cool if it reduced/ stopped creatures from wandering into your camp like how they use beehives in Africa to stop rhinos and elephants from wandering into farmlands. I'd limit it by having scorched be unaffected otherwise camps would be super exploitable
---
Yup, no easy route to duping or trading your way to the endgame equipment unlike before; when you see players with the gear you know they at least earned the bullions legitimately. Glad Bethesda finally learned how to slow down gear progression so players have to earn them overtime instead of instantly using illegitimate methods. I also dislike timegated equipment but we all saw what happened with the vault raids and legacy equipment.
---
Lol quite. 
---
Just had a guy with 20 + kills killing people on the map, while being nowhere near them.
---
I arched him, he was firing 1 shot at a time, and every 2-3 shots someone would die, who,e no one was near him.. what BS...
---
No OC anywhere... strange. I‚Äôll benchmark and see what happens soon
---
You know I never considered that. Maybe his life is so miserable he *needed* that. 
---
I guess all is forgiven.
---
‚ÄúLooks right to me!‚Äù
---

---
this isn't like any other fallout game. the only thing stopping you experiencing gameplay it seems is you. 
---
So as soon as wastelanders came out did the gear you have automatically stop being good or something?
---
Ooh, that‚Äôs a fun idea. The roots are eerie, yeah. Have two crimson lights replacing the eyes.
---
I'm left handed and I hold my bow in my left hand IRL ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
The spawn rate may be changed, who knows.  But they will sometimes be part of the mix
---
I'd rather have someone AFKing the event than ripping me off. So if you were in my event and that was the case, congrats! No hard feelings üëç
---
If you try to make nw fun, you'll have a great time completing challenges and grinding xp. I like to find super hidden spots to hide in. My favourite is a water tower just outside of Morgan Town, you can climb up to it with camp stairs and glitch insidebthe ball. Too bad you can't get out again.

I've always enjoyed the nukashine. My husband has started giving them to me when i ask him where i should live when i move. It really shows you some interesting home locations.
---
33 is the best perk for pve but nobody wants to hear it. Congrats on finding out the truth. :)
---
But its hard to get b3325 weapons, they havent been duped enough because the market demands be and b25.
---
Oh yes, it really boosts the interplayer economy... bought and sold a lot of single pieces of ammo the last days. each for a cap... =)
---
I restarted my game I‚Äôll see what happens now
---
Hopefully there's something new. Low key kinda bored at just level 70. Finished the 79 quests, killed the scorch queen, and pretty much everything else. Rebuilding the camp and grinding for faction rep is getting boring lol.
---
I think it can now, my scout set now has two ‚Äúno paint‚Äú options when it was stuck in Forest for the longest time. You can‚Äôt see which is which, but I changed it from forest to urban and back to forest the other day.
---
Yeah that's not the issue here though, I'm a full health junkies build and I have absolutely no problem soloing the event. I made the mistake of doing it on a public server thinking "hey, let's get a party going and let a bunch of people get rewards".
---
But no...asshats with their BE Gatling plasmas gotta ruin it for everyone else.
---
Kudos. Same, I was debating on fo76 or eso since i been off the mmo bandwagon for some time. I played the free weekend and liked the game as much if not more than fo4 (honestly played fo4 for far farbor, and then four years got back into playing more of the main game).
---
I was afraid someone might read my reply as mean and ass-kissing to bethesda (or commander dag bent over at her console... This game needs mentats to function like advil or motrin, poor woman). I play fo76 to just goof off and escape from the tediousness of Real Life. Ironically, i find the repetition of the grind oddly cathartic, killing virtual things with overpowered weapons (but getting my metaphorical ass handed to me in nw, haha).
---
Still, i hold out for seeing the potential of the game being only a few months into it. I like the glitches and dumb idiosyncrasies, ward not knowing how to use a bunkbed, etc.
---
Only seen one vid of it and that was AngryTurtle‚Äôs and he was playing bloodied...
---
Just join a public team and use travel agent. Its not difficult.
---
I belive there are 2 wedding ring spawns and 1 old ring spawn. Me and my ally wear the old rings. Then i always keep 2 wedding rings on me incase someone wants to buy a set. I should build a church, wear pastor vestments, then host weddings and sell dresses and suits for the occasion.
---
We have tried removing from friends list and re adding in game still no luck
---
I've checked hes not blocked
---
More like a few weeks to get the ss armour.
---
Lol Right? ‚ÄúStimulate the economy ‚Äú. Me who only spends 3 caps at a time.
---
I read they where gunna do a community building event but im hoping there's some new quests
---
I sell em for 500 caps.
---
Anyone remember the bridge(can't remember what's it's called) from fallout 3. By far the most satisfying explosion I've ever seen in any game.
---
The real endgame is camp building. I'm level 200 and still haven't found the spot for my camp, tomorrow Is a huge update for endgame players. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/19lD84ailufdG6cgVdqls2/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-fortifying-atlas-and-quakecon-details
---
I can confirm this one counts just completed it 5 minutes ago
---
That's commendable. 
---
If only the 5% of douchebags didn't have to ruin my opinion of bloodied builds because of their selfishness.
---
Hope no one discovers the burrows. Just ran that and killed maybe 5 3 star creatures. West Tek too.
---
It‚Äôs hide and seek with guns!
---
And sorry but why should they be removed. That‚Äôs daft.... like all of the vault 94 rewards? Anything that‚Äôs no longer in the atom shop... Where do you the line?
---
Daily mission itself isn‚Äôt painful, but hours on end for 10-25 rep from each rando encounter is, if that‚Äôs the only way I have to endure it
---
It's free to get ???
---
Mhmm. Sorry it didn‚Äôt help.
---
Yeah, it's that hopeful start that gets you up, and then that drop
---
It always reminds me tripping over my own feet as a kid and discovering what hurt pride feels like
---
Its like they don't know what they fixing lol
---
Thanks mate
---
Sure thing. Happy to help.
---
I'm ready for new quests honestly. I'm still looking for a solid camp location too i guess. Currently chilling in the mire with a lead node and a water fall.
---
I try to be nice to all players.  But if I see a player under about lvl 25, they're getting a bag of presents.  If they don't run away from me!
---
If you see me online, hit me up. My record is 12 Encryptid events in one night.

I'm in the middle of building in the mire, under a wee bridge thing

Thanks anyway :)

May I ask, what magic effects? Thx

You got it

Ends Aug 31
---
Lucked out in that one of my random encounter locations that spits out legendaries with consistency didn‚Äôt let me down. 3* wolf on first visit.
---
I run VATS all the time. Quad it is... I just had it drop recently! Thanks!
---
I wonder what else you dont know
---
There is no reason the crossbow should be worse than the bow. Compound? Fine, I can deal. But with the crossbow being the only one usable in PA, it should be at *least* on par with the bow. If not a bit better.
---
Everyday Zorbos ship moves forward a space, when he gets to the end that‚Äôs the end of the season.
---
I've just checked it's about the public teams nothing about social menu :(
---
How do you get that? Max rep?
---
Another thing the game needs are zip lines to go down the mountains with.
---
Maybe removed is a bit of a radical solution, how about nerfed into oblivion? That way people still have trophies and they won't break the game anymore.
---
The line is drawn exactly where real world money gets involved. Beth could/should remove anything except the atom shop items.
---
Can't upvote this enough.h
---
its not rocket science..
---
pun intended...
---
I use to do this, but be prepared. They can use the power armor glitch to get through. üòë I only did it when i was maxed and a holes still got through.
---
Man if only you‚Äôre on PS4 I would‚Äôve gave you one
---
Yes it's inside Vault 79. Ra Ra will get it for you if you side with the Raiders. I don't know who does it if you join the settlers.
---
It‚Äôs just so satisfying
---
There is a glitch with the raiders ally quests with Roxy (not linking to it but it's easy to find it).  It was the only time I have cheated in this game.  But I don't regret it at all.  At. All. That grind is stupid slow and mind-numbing.
---
I love logging back in on your main and surprising your teammates. Leveled my alt to 5 yesterday on a team with a lvl 23, 60-something, and 30-something. Then I came back with my level 147 and dropped 20 radaways to save the ass of my level 23 teammate haha
---
I would pay double scrip to guarantee my first star is Bloodied.
---
&gt;\-There are no raids. There WERE, and then they removed them to be replaced with (wait for it) time gated content in the form of Vault 79 (and the settlers/raiders).
---
There were raids but players were not doing them because they didn't get back 4x the resources put into it.  And they were legitimatly upset that they had to group up if they wanted to do harder stuff and come out with a profit.
---
&gt; There are no dungeons. There are locations, with some stuff inside, but  nothing like any typical MMO dungeon that involves clearing out specific  sections, bosses, with a loot drop at the end. There‚Äôs just locations  with random shit, sometimes a legendary enemy. 
---
Dungeons and Raids are the exact same fucking thing. 
---
&gt; \-There is no party comp. In a real MMO, there are roles that NEED to be  filled otherwise the party will fail just about any task. 
---
Depends on the MMO. Not every MMO is heavily class based.  And the roles are pretty rudimentary similar to how Sheepsquach operates needing "tanks" to take the electrical damage to make the boss vulnerable as you fight off wave after wave of robot spawns.  Or Project Paradise were you need people to activly aggro and tank hits for the creature while others go on the pure offensive to wipe out the waves of creatures.
---
&gt; \-The only classes that exist are different variations of DPS builds. 
---
Not quite as I'd say my build is more tanky. I got a lot of aid weight reduction legendary effects along with more utility based perks. Really only employing the base 4 offensive perks for my rifle build with everything else utility based. Which allows me to tank a lot of damage when I'm paying attention. 
---
That said an altering on how enemies aggro would make a tank build very effective. 
---
&gt; \-The insinuation of an actual end game is a joke. The most end game  thing in the game is the scorchbeast queen, and she‚Äôs a joke. Not to  mention she‚Äôs the toughest enemy in the game yet doesn‚Äôt drop a  guaranteed 3 star piece of gear or anything 
---
A joke for certain players. But the same can be said for every end game boss in any MMO game. Equally end game bosses do not always drop their rare items at every kill. Runescape I went a literal decade while only getting 1 dragon visage drop in my entire time playing it.  Compared to Runescape 76 is down right generous.
---
This is the only consistent answer.
---
Damn
---
It spawns at every station each world you load into...
---
You could farm it if u had spare...
---
Is it normal to do all the dailies and only move ONE board space?  Seems like that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been able to do lately.  I‚Äôm either one space or neck and neck with abZORBtion...
---
Indeed. Sunny sells it and I'm almost sure that the girl at Crater too
---
Yeah I only made this post after I got my b33p fixer and b3390 handmade lol didn't think there would be so many "I think I know what I'm talking abouts" in here lol
---
But really there should be some sort of actual date because I doubt most people playing know nor want to do the math.
---
Fix poor code and don‚Äôt have dupes...
---
Definitely a game changer.
---
Thanks but there really should be a date ingame that we can refer back to for this.
---
I've done uranium fever solo a few times over the last couple days and no joke one time they were all 3*. I didn't get anything good but it was still cool
---
Now that's a solution I can get behind.
---
You can‚Äôt get it if you go with the settlers.
---
It‚Äôs great for triggering ghouls and getting them out in the open
---
heh, that would be awesome :)
---
Just stay ahead of Zorbo.
---
It would also be easy to implement a weapon and armour serial number...
---
My friends say I am a curse sense I blow up more cars than anything. Taking in the graphics, killing enemies, and enjoying story lines? Naw, I'm going to nuke the line of cars in Whitesprings.
---
I like the mire, i just need more places on the east side of the map with a lead or junk node with water for purifiers. Theres a few in the savage devide it sucks building there.
---
GaaS is kind of a scam model anyway. Not every game company does it. So the ones that do - yeah, pretty greedy.
---
This challenge is singlehandedly what got me into actually browsing player vendors. I saw the types of things that people sell, and now I'm just buying stuff on the regular. Really glad that they put this challenge into the game.
---
I'm usually in the savage divide or forest. Wanted a change of scenery
---
The only thing stopping me from experiencing the gameplay is daily and weekly limits, huge grind requirements, and of course, a lack of general gameplay overall. 
---
Online GaaS and Fallout just don't go together
---
That‚Äôs crazy, what are you playing on?
---
As another suggestion, maybe half price to re-roll for another weapon one time? 
---
That way your hard work grinding scrip feels like it goes further but doesn't really alter the rng
---
.
---
What do you get instead if you go with the settlers?
---
Or not.
---
I left ESO about 8 months ago as I was sick of my class and gear being hammered into the fucking ground and being compensated with a shiny new unicorn pony pet.
---
F76 is actually more fun to play, and almost 100% of content is soloable. It's not gimmicky and disgustingly mechanic heavy either. The pylons of Encryptid would be the ceiling imo. 
---
Meanwhile ESO if you don't have a decent trials or progression group most endgame gear is cut off from you. Even if you get it, PvP players will bitch because it causes them adversity and presents some kind of challenge to their cookie-cutter bleed/dot 2h build so you as a pve player get fucked as a result. 
---
So yeah....
---
Lol running a junkies build and I keep getting unyielding
---
Did you get his username? If you did report him ingame, to Xbox, and even the police (even though it‚Äôs unlikely they‚Äôll do anything). I had a friend who had his entire router shut down and he had to get a completely new router because of someone who‚Äôs party he was in. More advice, never join random people‚Äôs parties on xbox, they can get your IP address
---
Zenimax. And they're cunts.
---
Can confirm the burrows. Took me a while to find one but it‚Äôs a good place to find a 3*
---
You need to be lucky enough to have a Horde event spawn on the server you‚Äôre in, see the event as soon as it spawns, and get there first.
---
Alpha usually means it‚Äôs a part of a horde event and I think Mongrels can have that name but I‚Äôm not too sure on the mongrel part
---
I like it too. When I'm walking around I always look for food that don't expire so when there is this quest of pre war food i put them for sale for around 2 caps, we complete 2 in 1, same with the alcohol, today was 3x1 üòä
---
It‚Äôs not 250% damage resist it‚Äôs just a flat out 250 damage resistance
---
Yea, just get a random explosive automatic gun to tag all the enemys, thats what i do when someone uses that spawn glitch :D  
---
You have at least one guaranteed level up, but probably more especially if you are at a low level.
---
You have to be level 5. Collect water in a river until you die. Get mutation, server hop. Drink water until you die, server hop. Rinse and repeat until you have all mutations.
---
Well now I feel like a fool for charging 15 caps for that one.
---
Tyler County Fairgrounds for candy/gum.
---
What game normally release patch note atleast a day before it drops but I guess not fallout 76
---
Yes one of my favorite things to do haha especially when team mates are by the car and you blows them up with it hehe love messing with my friends! üòâ
---
Its probably intentionally flexible and vague. Beth earlier said it would end mid September.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6gFSDSYkcGiWk1FspNzvZZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-kicking-off-season-one
---
I wouldn't label an exact date either if I as a company wasn't sure if I would end up changing the date later. The gauge is Zorbo's ship
---
They dont want to hear it. They‚Äòve invested in be and b25 and scripped b33. Perhaps they need a youtube video where they see someone unloading a full clip into the queens head to understand it.
---
I'm lvl 485, 400+ hours in the game. Never seen that madafaka. I don't see the point in grinding for it. 10% to spawn him for little to no reward, seems like a massive waste of time to me.
---
Marsupial.
---
Typically it‚Äôs 2-3 dailies you can do. 
---
Importance of communication/ Retirement plan
---
Photo opportunity (taking pictures of foundation to sell to crater) 
---
Ohio River adventures (doesn‚Äôt always reset for me though) 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the Roxy glitch was fixed awhile ago so it‚Äôll have to be 100% grind.
---
I used to almost always find at least one Legendary inside West Tek but in recent months that dried up. Haven‚Äôt found one there in a while.
---
General‚Äôs Steakhouse dried up too.
---
for every time someone asks if the servers are up, there is a new bug being added to the patch
---
I'm guessing PC, with crashing upon login.
---
How do you, like, *know* no one was banned for this or that? You work for Beth? You some kind of internet cop?
---
Lol true
---
Mid-September, according to Bethesda.
---
Fair, I like the forest but due to it costing to fast travel I try to keep my camp on the east side so I have a free travel point in the area.
---
4k since yesterday seems a little high...
---
I can tell you I wasn't. I used the display case glitch to hell and back.
---
Thank you should be an easy challenge then that or scorched earth
---
Literally tomorrow.
---
Except in this case where it doesn't count. People have killed the blood eagle without getting credit.
---
Once you finish uranium or the scorch beast one you have about 1000
---
The thing with legendaries at these locations is the first run after a server restart will have the legendaries. After that it's all basic enemy spawn. I find I have better luck in burrows. No one really goes there. Or a private server.
---
I'm 200, I keep scrapper on at all times because I hate when forgetting it
---
Yeah, I'm really bad when it comes to actually finding spots. But when I get my build theme/ idea. I hate finding a new spot but I'm never happy with my current camps
---
Riding shotgun, Uranium fever... every other event
---
I chose Instigating because it is completely worthless on a Minigun if the game is working properly and Bethesda will eventually fix magic effects even if it takes 5 years.
---

---
I‚Äôd have a lot more fun getting cool strong weapons than 6 assassins broadsiders...
---
12? JFC you‚Äôre a madman!
---
Imagine how awesome it would be if you were the only one!!!
---
Move CAMP somewhere else and then move it back to where you are now.
---
This is why I built off the side of a cliff. If someone is at my camp when the machines are off, I go and investigate. If they glitched through the door I just leave the server. It's roughly a 400ft drop for them.
---
One day we're going to see him waddling up to us with a baller cap and gold chain around his neck, flanked on either side by Annihilator Sentry Bots with tuxedos and bowties painted on them.
---
Is it the whole thing with ‚ÄúAppalachia got a new corpse‚Äù dialogue option and exiting it?
---
A really bad 10mm smg
---
We need text chat.
---
Your chances of survival are minimal subject.
---
I sell almost everything at 75% off original price. Plans, chems, bulk junk, bobbleheads, etc. I collect a lot of stuff and it takes up too much of my stash inventory. Only exception is legendary items. I sell those at a 33% discount.
---
There's even cheap ammo in my vending machines to help other players out with completing the daily challenge.
---
üòÇrude lol
---
I was trying to avoid that because I built under a bridge and it was a really tricky build that took me almost a day of messing with it
---
You tube has a lot of guides for this
---
Like you and many others have said, not fun. It's more like working a 2nd job with split shifts. You clock in, do some work, clock out &amp; then repeat the process a few hours later....over &amp; over.
---
Last night was a 1st for me. Got on the game, looked at what Bethesda was telling me I had to do, grabbed my 200 gold, said fuck it, &amp; logged off. I just didn't want to go through the hassle.
---
This game is dying &amp; it's Bethesda killing it. Then maybe that's their goal to have an excuse to shut it down so they don't have to pay for the servers.
---
Come October I think they will get a rude wakeup call when players like me that jumped on Fallout 1st for a year when it came out don't renew their subs.
---
I'll finish the season, &amp; run my sub to the end then I'm pretty much done with this circus...and Bethesda. I don't care what they release going forward, they showed me they absolutely don't care about their players or the quality of their products. They won't be getting anymore of my money that's for damn sure.
---
Too bad Obsidian can't get their hands on the IP &amp; give it the attention it deserves.
---
Always. In my usual group the person who shot it has to say "it wasn't me!"
---
sounds like you "play" the game for the wrong reasons. Maybe you should stop.
---
The season ends when my chickens come home.
---
*Chicky Chicky, I love you, always know just what to do, Chicky Chicky* üê• üê• üê• üêî
---
yea, had someone recently glitch into my vendors protected by a powered door key code
---
Nahh... I don't really care what others do. I don't compete. I just was curious, because I had no reason to wear it. Simply curious if others wore it or got rid of it.
---
I want less power armor skins.
---
A summonable eyebot that finds dead bodies in the tall grass.
---
I play the game to have fun. I didn't know you could play games for the wrong reasons tbh.
---
Off the radroach wearing a trilby hat and a walking cane.
---
Still makes me laugh
---
yeah. i spent 4-5 hours building my camp one time and then i thought i'd put a concrete block in the water and then a statue on it. It was a few inches out of the water and when i pressed place it was under. 
---
it took all my willpower not to start again
---
It doesn't make it dumb at all.  You just didn't know.
---
They meant minor events like riding shotgun, etc. Not public
---
Count the number of score the dailies give you. It's 2.5k. That's about the same amount of score it takes to level 1 space.
---
So, uh, yes, it's normal at where you currently are.
---
At the beginning, you'd have gotten 2 spaces in a day.
---
Closer to rank 100, you will take more than one day to level a space.
---
You'll do far more damage with a Gat Plasma.
---
Harsh!
---
Ain‚Äôt that the truth
---
I can never get her to give me quests

---
You‚Äôre welcone
---
I legit lol'd at this, and now I'm stealing this idea. Perfect for my camp near Vault 76 with the "Noobs Welcome" sign.
---
Good Ol' Zorbo moves one space per day, and his per day progress is in the meter at the bottom right of the map.
---
Count his spaces left to go on the map, pull out a calendar, do some maths
---
Yeah, I'm not gonna bother. The block isn't really in the way and my build is finished so I'm not even going to mess with it. Was just curious if anyone had found a way to move underwater items
---
They stay stuck in your budget and you can‚Äôt get it out.
---
What level is the character you‚Äôre doing this on?
---
True, but you should make sure to check all their machines while you're there. I once got an Imposter Sheepsquatch Helmet for 50 caps. That thing looks so absurd, I had to use it.
---
Doesn't participating in an SBQ kill count for this?
---
If you sided with the settlers you can glitch through the rubble made by the motherlode to get back into vault 79 to kill the securitron.
---
It happens more often over PS4 I've noticed than over Xbox, but yeah it's a major problem alot of people use to scare people into giving them things or doing it because they're mad
---
Good point on the last line. Lol
---
I can confirm the roxy glitch 100% isn‚Äôt fixed.
---
Heaven forbid a new player be excited about the game and sharing an uplifting story....
---
üôÑ
---
dont worry, for 500 atoms, you can have a fixer skin for your combat rifle. and due to a bug people couldn't test in the public test server or the fact that we don't actually play our own game. the fixer model has been removed from the game and all you have is a big red ! for a missing model. but don't worry, we are looking into and and will fix it in the following patch in a month. also if you modify, equip, store, or even hover over the fixer while this bug exists, it will delete it, delete everything that is in that tab (if you are in your weapon inventory, good by all weapons you are carrying), and we have no way to restore any of your character information what so ever. even though we just made a back up copy that has all your exact inventory in the PTS but with the fixer model working. sorry for the issue, and we let the team know.
---
oof
---
How is it even Possible on console?!?
---
I look for good stuff, if i don't find it then i buy 3 bullets
---
I dropped about 5k on one dude cuz he had plans i didn't have
---
Same, its a love hate. I love building but sometimes the game has issues with my ideas and then I'm never completely happy with the finished product. I equally wanna rebuild and don't wanna rebuild lol.
---
Copy pasted from the Q&amp;A in Inside the Vault. The language used is "rank up":
---
Q: How long will it take to rank up?
---
A:¬†Each rank-up should take between one and two hours of play time, with earlier ranks taking closer to one hour, and later ranks nearing two.
---
Hopefully they actually add stuff and fix some stuff
---
And how many hours for the first dupe video?
---
Or just buy it seriously. After two shit show runs I just paid the caps.
---
I've seen them about 5-6k. I just traded a Fasnacht mask for it from a dude.
---
I'm not very tech savvy, but my friend is a booter himself (only does it to assholes and people threatening helpless individuals) and he easily pulls them. I think what it is, is he has his Xbox hooked up to his computer or something and pulls it through that. I couldn't tell you honestly, I just know how to get my ip and location secured when I'm booted offline, which sadly happens too often for my pleasure üòÇ
---
PS4? I only have spare marsupial and speed demon but you can have em

You can find 3 bubble gum packs in Flatwoods alone.

Ive just finished my camp at the mire. Guess what?? I don't like it lol. Imma move to an old location on a really high, flat cliff near whitesprings now ... ugh
---
Bruh that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking I have no caps ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Xbox
---
I lost out yesterday and today.
---
I put the chemist mod on the small backpack so they work for sure.
---
That's not pvp. I one shot every one with my bloody build. This game isn't made for pvp.
---
Good luck either standing right by it when it spawns or playing with the only 10-20 percent of players who will actually share the kill.
---
oh, hell yeah !  oh - you mean in the game ?  eh.  i can take it or leave it
---
trying to  be funny?
---
Same, I had a place overlooking  the cranberry bog with a private pond on a cliff and im thinking about heading back
---
We need ghillie skin on purified water so enemy can't see we drinking
---
Damn i did that frsat house quest and already knew, but at someone else's camp did not know you could put it in a bowl. First time i traveled to where you can launch the dudes off the catapults. Best hangover ever
---
Ok I‚Äôll keep it topped up then. Really enjoying it!
---
I know that place!! A bit left from the relay tower at the bottom of the map?
---
I want the tin foil hat to matter!
---
Yea its great seeing everyones shitty wares marked up 1000% /s
---
Yeah! Sadly I dont think it has any junk or lead nodes but its been a minute since I was there so idk. Its a solid spot though, scenic place to build.
---
Stabilized if you need range &amp; accuracy.  Aligned has the same but slightly less range and more hip-fire accuracy.
---
There's always an ah in one violent night that kill the legendary with one shot before anyone else can touch it üòÖ happened to me several times
---
Have you tried to do any of the things outlined here to try and avoid it?
---
Yeah I like building there. There's a nice spot down from that to the right, massive lake with a small rock that you can place your camp on. One of my favourite camps I've made
---
I think you are ignoring headshots here. You deal way more damage with headshots on bosses than +25% and you need 33 to get the headshots without wasting time on getting close.
---
You do. Look at the map. The number of spaces zorbo has to go is the number of days
---
Buying three bullets for 1 each stimulates the economy. Fascinating.
---
To be honest Ive liked some of the camps out there
---
If you're using vats true is the best
---
Happened to me and other than moving the camp, I don't think there is anything that can be done.
---
Well good as long as ZORBy only moves a space a day then I‚Äôm fine with that logic
---
Get ready for the next wave of bugs we're going to be stuck with for the coming months
---
What math? Just found the number of spaces ahead of zorbo
---
Me

bethesda employee right here  üòÇ  üòÇ  üòÇ  üòÇ  üòÇ

You could farm 6k quicker than you could reliably find Encryptid groups and actually have the plans drop instead of just a fedora hat.
---
Also, having just got a decent legendary Fixer I've found personally the Handmade is better. Each to their own though.
---
I‚Äôve only just started playing and a car blew up during a fight, while my husband was watching.  Now I can‚Äôt log on without him immediately telling me to go and blow up a car lol
---
Thats what smiley is for.
---
you fool! real bush wookie is looking to the ground in the bush  while being in photomode and scanning surroundings
---
You are the problem with this game
---
You learn something new everyday I suppose
---
The bows need a slight damage buff, they need to stop missing 10+ times in VATS on some enemies like I'm Stevie Wonder, they need to stop sailing straight through the chests/center of enemies like they're ghosts and if not lighter ammo, then a perk card that makes bow and crossbow ammo lighter.
---
ok, and?
---
I have a really great connection, never had any lag, and this weekend was complete slog
---
You just need to tag them, so a 40mm auto grenade launcher, WITHOUT heavy guns or explovive perks will do the trick. Also, all those floater grenades the game seems to reward you nowadays will work too.
---
yeah the 3 10mm bullets I sell per day really help out
---
Just watch the YouTube video on it
---
Its a common reward for using a claim ticket. It used to be rare but isnt anymore.
---
Apart of the last known one?yes.Apart of the many current and past ones?No
---
I'd love to be able to use them as wall decorations
---
Yep, I‚Äôm hoping that it will be patched for good tomorrow.  To be honest, I‚Äôm pretty much over being mad about it, I‚Äôm like 1-2 steps ahead right now, granted that‚Äôs with a random skip I did.  When I see the autocompletes, I usually don‚Äôt play at all that day.  I know that‚Äôs cost me some xp.  I‚Äôm not naive enough to think this really is their top priority to fix.  It‚Äôs a sort of perverse incentive to get people to spend atoms.  At the very least it‚Äôs the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù keeping its advantage.
---
Thanks for the response. you‚Äôre having trouble too then?
---
It's not the plan it's the pink flamingos themselves.
---
This would be perfect and not a hard think to do
---
Well idk if you‚Äôre gonna get your armor back but what system are you on
---
Not one craftable legendary for riflemen. Pistol shotgun heavies get 2, nothing for rifle
---
Oh, I got mine from a friend and I was a very new player and didn't know much of the game and it's problems. I dunno if I'd take it if I thought it was duped.. Oh who am I kidding, it's too good, I just hope it won't get me into trouble if it was indeed duped.
---
I just got my first one the other day (rng).  I just stuck it in my stash because it doesn't do much and I had never seen one before.
---
Sometimes I'll have shots that register on screen but take no damage off and criticals hit and use the full bar but no damage dealt. Wasting so much ammo.
---
With all these daily workshop challenges, I'd like to turn off defend and retake events. I only claim a workshop to complete the challenge, so I don't care what happens to it afterwards.
---
Where did you get the mask to drop from?
---
Ah. So not me.
---
Ghouls are also short sighted monsters, that constantly lunge, tumble, and most likely injure themselves while running. The sad truth is that the fastest a human can run would destroy the body, and such cant be achieved
---
just got mine at white springs none nuke
---
got fixer and handmade plans for all 5 of my characters. i usually hit my 150 limit every day on each one. When it's nearly max i buy 9 or 10 ranged weapons. Have done this for several months. In that time i've had 1 average fixer and not maybe 2 or 3 less than average handmades. We're talking 4000-5000 scrip a week. And i've had the bear arm plan for about a month and none of those either.
---
Yes, I hardly ever remember/bother to go cash them in
---
I mean, surely you‚Äôve answered your own question right there?
---
Sounds like you're having GREAT fun.
---
We‚Äôre not aloud to post the name in this sub, just search fo76 and you‚Äôll see it
---
A wholesale laws are like that is very rare. keep in mind it'll show up as a power armor frame not a power armor. And it may just reappear if you hop servers a couple times.
---
Impractical terms game providers are coordinating an absolute monster ton of data and no data warehouses perfect. Especially when that data has to be multi-session and multi-server.
---
take hard in the fact that if they lost your power armor they probably also lost a hard drive in the real-world.
---
If it pops back up good for you. If it doesn't remember that this is a game of stress and loss anyway. You'll get ripped off for more by circumstances later once you really full of junk. You'll get Trump in an ambush right after finishing an epic junk pickup, and you won't be able to get back to your dropped junk. It's part of the lesson of the game.
---
and if you're level 25, you were going to have to rebuild all that stuff for reals once you pass level 50 as walking around in low-level gear is a harsh, harsh unhappiness.
---
I know it's a little disheartening, but there's nothing to do but see if it magically comes back tomorrow, or in an hour.
---
And more often than not you just end up losing something in the haze long ass menus.
---
If it comes back, it'll come back as a unnamed power armor frame in your apparel tab. It won't say anything about being excavator anything or anything.
---
if you discover that's what happened, the lesson is that you have to rename your power armor frames once you have more than one, or you'll end up dropping or scrapping the wrong one. And that is a double miserable experience.
---
Take heart, whatever happened to happened.
---
When i said they i was referring to OP. not the backpack =0
---
Slaver gang rise up
---
&gt; Isn't the reward for cork a week of double score or some shit? No doubt they're going to make us work for it.
---
Hmm, is that the case?
---
The powergamers that would be able to farm for it - are unlikely to need the double score weekend because of already being finished?
---
I mean - once you hit level 100, are there any more rewards from it?
---
What annoys me is they know this as that's entirely the point of the way you redeem the reward from that one guys treasure. I thought I would see more of that but no
---
Are you certain? I don't see how Bethesda would be able to track players with that item at their C.A.M.P.
---
Blocker is great for melee bloodied builds, flat 45% reduction in melee attacks.
---
I meant the one from Encryptid, sorry. :)
---
Yeah. It makes V.A.T.S. shotgun shots do insane dmg. Probably will get fixed in future, but until then it has its use to hunt better loot.
---
Probably not for using the glitch, but Bethesda has banned players for receiving large amounts of ammo over a certain period of time. There hasn‚Äôt been a set number of how much ammo or over what period of time though. It‚Äôs usually in the upper tens to hundred thousands.
---
This maybe a stupid thing to say, but since you're relatively new player maybe it can help. The PA goes automatically in your inventory if it's not used within 60 second and when it does it says something with "chassis" word in it. You probably know this, but just in case, because when I started playing this game and got my first set of pa I didn't know that, I thought it adds all parts separately. If it's not the case and you actually lost it then the best thing you can do is submit a ticket and hope for a response.
---
There is always the possibility. But no CAMP glitch, including the display dupe, has had any repercussions
---
Encrypted, project paradise, the Queen...
---
Only one I've seen is the Final Word and maybe All Rise.
---
Well not so much today, but this weekend was pretty nuts.  Wondering if it was because of an influx in the amount of people?
---
I mean, I'd pay an extra 200%, let alone 25%.
---
So wait Im ahead, yay I really thought I was so far behind. For some reason I thought seasons were only 5 weeks. Im at level 72 almost 73, just woke up so I'll be back at it today. Happy Gaming!
---
There are 100 tiers and ten weeks.  That isn‚Äôt a tier per day.  Most actual games with battlepasses have some sort of system so you can tell what week you are on.  There clearly isn‚Äôt a system like that here.  That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm talking about
---
Just nuke sbq and get a tag. 
---
If not that plenty of other events have 3" enemies guaranteed.
---
I can't tell you how many broadsiders and bows she's given me.  No, please no.
---
Hunting rifles, combat rifles, combat shotguns, sure, I would give those serious consideration.  But a pipe pistol?  I don't care WTF it is, it is going back in the exchange.
---
You get nuked outta the server, If I see it. Lol. Seriously though, I'll nuke you.
---
BuT tHe GrInD
---
So If I set up just one machine it wouldn't seem suspicious?
---
AWOL Armaments too...or Encryptid
---
Too bad you're not on pc, I'd take you to the silo for free and explain stuff, got a few nuclear cards covered in dust in my stash too. Hope you'll find a buddy and have fun!
---
What, and you don‚Äôt think dupers have already done that?
---
You can never get rid of it ever and if you move your camp itll turn into an invisible budget drain. Up to you if you wanna risk it
---
I‚Äôm bloodied and carry 20 diluted radx and 20 radaway.  Not really a weight issue.
---
Zorbo starts at space 30. He moves a total of 70 spaces, 1 per day. The event is 70 days. The number of spaces left is the number of days left. It is that simple. Count the spaces.
---
I don't do nukes for plenty of reasons, but having to rely on events where people can kill legendaries faster than you is not fun. The kill 3 legendary enemies itself is annoying because when the wolf pack event spawns, someone usually already killed them by the time I get there, and yes, I do fast travel.
---
Riding shotgun has a guaranteed 3* spawn each run
---
They tracked ppl duping that last glitch...
---
Nobody knows for sure. They don't announce this shit beforehand. But you wouldn't be asking if you were not 100% certain it's wrong, yes?
---
Even If it gets destroyed and I don't repair it?
---
I always wanted to spent 300 caps for a door mat plan
---
Yeah, her too. Grats, by the way. I just got a junkies compund bow and it's been fun ... slow, but fun.
---
Yeah it isn‚Äôt much of a big loss due to it being low level it was just the time i spent getting it to only spend around 10 minutes in it. But i what i am concerned about is it happening again in the future with a more valuable set of PA. i read a few similar things about sets getting lost randomly.I‚Äôm hoping it will just pop up tomorrow I‚Äôm my stash or something. Its annoying because me and my mates had been having a blast and we hadn‚Äôt encountered any major glitches so far.
---
You might always end up being the exception, but bethesda unbanned people with hacked weapons and dozens of the same duped god-tiers, so you're unlikely to get hit for any kind of exploits. You can bring out an aimbot into NW and use it to get to overseer rank 100, you still won't get banned
---
Who upvoted this?? This is not accurate
---
Yup. It's there forever
---
Riding shotgun doesn't count
---
Isn't that the whole point of this conversation? That I'm not having the fun I should be because of greedy game design?
---
Yeah i already checked my inventory and my stash, no PA frames. But what is the ticket thing you mentioned ?
---
I'd rather do that than get drunk or chew a lot of gum ....
---
No! Please have mercy!
---
One of my buddies loves doing it, has in every fallout game he has played. Can make exploring Appalachia even more dangerous sometimes lol
---
why is that?  I've been using aligned barrels and stock bc I read someplace those reduce the AP points used in VATS
---
Actually I think it‚Äôs steel for the first 4 days, but we should also grab cork too.
---
You need to go to Bethesda official website and log in with your account. then scroll all the way down till you see contact support. then it's an easy trip from there. there's a section concerning missing item, I believe it's in in-game sub, but not sure.
---
I suppose I'll try it on an alternate character and see how it plays out.
---
GET. YOUR. MOTHER. TRUCKING. CORK. READY. YOU. MAGGOT.
---
alright I will don‚Äôt yell at me
---
for similar reasons, I just leave super duper equipped all the time.  I used to have scrounger but I'm less paranoid about ammo these days.
---
IT more about the time bouncing around trying to find something on vending machines
---
It's explosive, so yes. You can mitigate the damage the Fireproof, but more importantly it's not a gun meant to be used in close quarters. BTW you can also buff it's damage with Demo Expert.
---
Christmas for New Years!
---
This will not be a popular opinion. 
---
Threads full of entitlement completely kill my desire to play with those people. Just leave, please. Gotta have it all, all the time. Instant gratification. Same folks would claim there is nothing to do. Heck, this thread has plenty of that as well.   
---
No one is required to log in everyday for any of the various currencies in game (save for SCORE as it is limited time event).  People like myself and my wife work from home and enjoy the daily grind, gives us goals, periodic rewards, and yes some of that content won't be recieved by all. OH NO!
---
Perhaps the SCORE event is aggressive on its schedule. I get it, FOMO is real and folks dont want to miss out. That is okay, but crying in a forum claiming on one hand there is too much time gating and then not enough content on the other tells me that some folkas just need to move the fuck on. This game might not be fo you, much like Diablo 3, Path of Exile, Destiny and Fortnite the grinds found there aren't for eveyone, they are for the most dedicated. Yeesh, so much confirmation bias in here it is sad.  
---
There is not a single developer out there that can make enough content or high enough quality to appease everyone for an extended period, folks are going to get bored and move on, this is normal, not the exception like so many here appear to claim.
---
I will add that I appreciate the people making constructive suggestions on ways to improve the game (ie. making the daily limit a weekly one). At least they arent just coming off as negative whiners.
---
TLDR; Much crying, there is nothing wrong with a grind. Patience and dedication SHOULD be rewarded. If you do not agree play something else. (/end rant)
---
Ok i will do that and hope for the best, thank you (:!
---
Possibly
---
There are other references.  Prior to elder scrolls but you are correct.  I actually purchased one about 30 years ago.  It‚Äôs an impressive weapon but very unwealdy.  It needs to be very heavy to avoid brittleness.
---
I do understand that glitches such as this ruin the experience of the game. However, I would much rather plop down one machine and have free ammo, as opposed to paying other players for duped goods. It all boils down to me being lazy.
---
If you want I can make you the armor again
---
Guided Meditation have around 6 legendaries, at least 3 were 3 star.
---
I can‚Äôt guarantee it, but most of Bethesda‚Äôs past bans have been for actions that could damage the in-game economy ie ruin other player‚Äôs game experiences. 
---
Honestly not even sure if BGS could tell that you had placed an ammo manufacturer where it doesn‚Äôt belong. I‚Äôd assume you‚Äôd be fine having one though
---
They'll actually arrest the dude? That's awesome
---
I'm honestly not sure why they didn't just have you buy a legendary from a specific class its so hard to get anything you would actually use.
---
Like I go in for a heavy weapon and I come out with an assassin death tambo
---
Gauss Shotgun built-in explosive effect, so yes you can injure yourself. Use ranks of fireproof perk to mitigate the damage.
---
My group nuked Charleston and a few other places on PS4 last night, so may have been us if you are PS4? We dropped two other nukes after that in odd locations (we were hitting various spawn points for the wendigo, though the Charleston nuke was for other reasons.) So if you had three non-SBQ nukes, that was us!
---
Dense chest mod and fireproof perk are your friends
---
Yes duped weapons exist but theyre relatively spread out and not disgustingly saturated. You don‚Äôt see bloodied explosive handmades at even 2% of camp vendors (at least I can vouch for that on Xbox don‚Äôt know about other platforms).
---
Point is if they throw in towel and make it pretty damn easy to roll god tiers, the game will be overly saturated with them. If everyone is op and the game gets too easy it becomes really boring quickly, and makes more than 70-80% of legendaries garbage. Is it fun one shotting everything in the forest? That would be the game. 
---
What would Bethesda do at that point. Everyone will have the same things and they‚Äôll have to add more bullet sponges and nerfs to balance it out.
---
Cool!
---
Yeah but he's for caps not notes
---
The season is ten weeks long. 
---
That‚Äôs 70 days.
---
The season ends on Tuesday, September 8th at noon.
---
&gt; two shot weightless broadsider
---
That sounds hilarious to use.
---
And that Youtuber's source was likely the reddit post from a dev saying exactly that.
---
EDIT: Found the [source](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hr5q43/_/fy2e247/?context=1)
---
I did not know it was explosive, is that all shotguns or just the gauss?
---
Robots don't count so Encrypted is out. Project Paradise and SBQ can potentially take a good amount of time. And I can't solo either so they both require help.
---
No problem!I do hope they'll help but honestly I wouldn't count on it. If you were on pc I'd just craft you a new set, it'd be easier xD
---
Just gauss
---
The problem with ditching or doubling scrip limit is that the economy will be flooded with Legendary items. Things are Legendary for a reason. It's their rarity. If there was no scrip limit, and we could pick &amp; choose what we wanted either for ourselves or to sell, then Legendaries just become Ordinaries. As much as I hate spending 1k scrip just to finally get a *3 Unyielding Left Leg &amp; Left Arm, I do get why it's like it is. Alas, still not managed to get these items I so covet üòî
---
No recipe for Buffout, or calmex either.
---
Dude, I hear what you're saying - I like to hear both sides of an argument. But, this happens with too much frequency. I might  agree with you slightly, but when both of the mutant slayers, both of the cloaking, both of the ghoul slayers were all three stars, there's something happening there. When I'm pulling Nocturnal after Nocturnal off mobs in the world, there's something that isn't really 'random' happening. 
---
Try it yourself, go to Mumble's basement, craft 5 limbs of whatever, see what happens. Hop to another server, craft 5 more of the same limb, and see what happens.
---
Indeed, I have a lot of fun just shopping.
---
Robots don‚Äôt count?
---
All Plans and Recipes 5 Caps or less.  All Ammo 1 cap, Plasma Cores 10 caps each.  (PS4)
---
Is this from Gearsthecools dump?
---

huh and here i  thought the game was quite a bit laggy the past few days. if its not just me might be on bethesda's end
---
ü§Æ
---
just learn to jump and shoot and don't get stuck in a corner or back to a wall
---
if you are pn ps4 and interested in a trade or sell of it, let me know.
---
It's a pretty serious crime, especially if you're good enough at booting someone offline that you literally fry their router (it'll actually start smoking) as that's destruction of personal property. So yeah, they'll basically be swatted by the FBI.
---
I found a level 30 3-star mole miner during an event  in the Ash Heap. It was the one where you have to go into the mine to get the ores and get out before it collapses. Maybe try there?
---
Yup, I keep it equipped and will never not use it. It's also the one star perk card that I share in public teams because hey, who doesn't love getting more scrap?
---
Oh wow thank you that is a really kind offer but its fine honestly, if its gone its gone. Ill just try and make it again at a higher level hopefully. (:
---
I can agree that the kills you do get are much more satisfying and the damage is just about enough with all perks to one hit a level 68 supermutant if it's a headshot, I think the problem is that it is treated like a main weapon perk wise but can't live up to that at all in late game events.
---
Only if there‚Äôs a blueberry standing next to them.....
---
Gotta love the down votes for simply stating a fact.
---
No no no.  Taking long enough to load in camps
---
took me a while to find it again. I had to dig deep to remember where I saw it.
---
[Heres the link to the post itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i0t3e7/quakecon_demonic_sheepsquatch_outfit_and_backpack/fzsagmk/).
---
Appalachia has been boring lately.  Hopefully they update the game with events that are fun
---
I do this event everyday, never got a legendary out of it...
---
Seems fairly balanced way to play imho.
---
I got 4 black powder rifles in a row during that sale a few weeks ago. Had to take a long break after that lol
---
I found out about it pretty early and I've been keeping it ever since. Very useful
---
No problem, a lot of the people will help but there‚Äôs also a lot of assholes who will try to pvp, you just gotta find the right people and it‚Äôll be a much more enjoyable game
---
But they have a $olution already in called fallout first
---
Apparently not. I personally didn't try it but several people on this thread have stated it.
---
Ah a DBZ reference I believe.
---
No arguments there. Even on a controller you sometimes overshoot the emote you want.
---
Destiny does this and I never realized how nice it was
---
It says on the website 50 percent off so if it does affect them its gonna be awesome
---
Thank you !(: thats very kind. At least i didn‚Äôt lose a higher level one or a more valuable set though. This has certainly taught me to try and look after my PA as best i can from Bethesda‚Äôs bugs.
---
*yawn*
---
Goodnight ZAX
---
Edit: Oh shit forgot we're not allowed to trade here but my PS4 name is the same if you're interested
---
Nah, million and a half caps to worry about everyday.   If you don't keep a stop watch and calender set up GL. I love the game but daily limits are cheeks. I could learn to live with it if they weren't all at opposite times of the day, like wtf?  
---
I would say yes, if you decide to blueprint that and put it in your camp you'd be doing it at your own risk.
---
Didn't get the SCORE points at Encryptid, shot the 3* Impostor a few times, because I was holding two conduits.  Got the Legendary rewards though.  Down on my luck, I thought I would give WS a shot since I just finished Uranium Fever.  Super Mutants at the front gate, damn what luck and out pops a 3* Legendary Super Mutant, just when I was about to give up on the SCORE points.
---
Do you have starched genes perk on?
---
The pvp one at the fort. I can't remember the last time I even saw it up so assume it's either been removed or bugged.
---
The servers where rigged from the start.
---
The community for this game is a lot friendlier than i thought it was gonna be, i have already had some good experiences with people on it.
---
That's exactly the reason why I try to store my pa as soon as I unequip it because you never know what surprise you'll get from this game xD
---
Actually most games like MMO's and games with multiplayer economies don't release patch notes before servers go down specifically to counter people doing shit like hoarding altered items like if they get buffed and were worthless previously etc
---
FFXIV does it with crafting recipes to prevent gatherers/people buying off the MB at dirt cheap rates from people who didn't see it yet, POE does it because of how it affects trading, and so on
---
No, rock that pack, you are fine!
---
Yea I‚Äôve had my camp nuked and the people who did it were honestly pretty cool
---
This is great...  I have a tonnes of legendary weapons to clear and hopefully this will encourage people to buy them
---
This is my favorite event. 1 run, knocks out daily caps if you sell all the weapons and meat. Plus you have legendary items and monsters with the extra caps at the end. Takes 15 minutes and you'll also knock out damn near all of the daily score list. Plus I love the npc and dialog. It feels the most natural out of all the other npcs in the game. I really want them to release the blue crates, flags and barrels for camp decor. I also wish they would release a skin to turn your Braham into a pack Braham. I really wish they would also expand them as a group and give them a story line.
---
Awesome, I'll show my little croco more places then when it's not stored under PA :p
---
what was it
---
You're implying you can't have fun unless you have all the good stuff right now.
---
It's been removed but it was called the battle that never was
---
Yeah.  My 1 round purchase for three times really stimulated stuff.  
---
Though I did find two plans in the last week I hadn't gotten yet, but when I did purchase them it wasn't for the challenges.
---
So help me god if I pull another 3 star pipe pistol I'm gonna lose my fkin mind
---
Im down. ive never done a nuke before. Ive got pretty good gear, level 46. If you are still doing it shoot me your gamertag
---
They should just remove the hold to fire mechanic and take it up.in reload time.
---
I'm usually good for one a night. GT: ManmadeNebula89
---
Don't point the bow or the arrow?
---
from previous experience with this glitch in the past, the best advice i can give is:  
---
1: don't be online when the daily rolls over as it tends to bug loading in the new daily's while still having the old ones loaded
---
2: when you log off, have your last game session be adventure/private mode. nuclear winter really confuses itself with what daily/weekly challenges are active and defaults to completed as a result.
---
3: (assuming on PC) don't switch between the steam version and bethesda launcher version, since the two have different ATOM totals and the challenges where previously tied to atoms and i assume its some neglected rejigged codethat bugs it out
---
That is something i shall endeavour to do from now on, but i really hope it doesn‚Äôt happen again i was literally wearing it and the game deleted it right off my back.
---
Sure... I'll jump on.. but make it quick.. I gotta make dinner. Send me your GT
---
Ehh found me a junkies mini from a shop, so not bad in my experience
---
They are worried that people will grind through the content in a week, because that‚Äôs exactly what people do. There‚Äôs a good 100-150 hours of content, yet some people seem intent on finishing that in an unhealthy amount of time, forcing Bethesda to add these timegates and limits in the hope of slowing them down so they have enough time to create the new content these ‚Äòbored‚Äô people demand. (i say bored because it‚Äôs their own fault they blew through the entire game within a week and left themselves with nothing to do)
---
So you told us a good deed you do to justify the crappy thing you did.
---
Oh dear, im glad i haven‚Äôt encountered people like that yet. Everyone has been pretty friendly towards me.
---
They are going to be part of a Liquid Courage brew according to datamined [code](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/005911A3).
---
I am at work all day, nowhere near reset, and I always begin and end with adventure mode.
---
I figured as much, thanks!
---
It's not better, it's just easy brainless xp. You will find that better if you just like to stick your finger in your ass instead of playing a game.
---
Please explain how it is a scam
---
I treated myself to a fancy new dog head for my camp today and accidentally bought 15 of them instead of 1 from the vendor. Someone got 150 of my hard earned caps üòÇ
---
Yes, it's my fave plasma. And don't forget to always be nice to ra ra! Also, flamer barrel + pulse capacitor makes it an awesome medium range mob melter
---
I was just looking up the world challenge for completing events and saw a list of things I've never heard of.  So I have some work ahead of me.
---
That‚Äôs dedication to a collection for certain, given that these weigh 5 each! That‚Äôs a lot of stash space!
---
I'm not sure I implied that. I definitely do mean to imply they're prioritizing money and daily logins over fun, though.
---
Get addicted to 5 chems and do what you want with your build. All Junkie's requires is 5 addictions.
---
I have no idea. I noticed a thing, I said "hey, I noticed a thing." That's the end of my involvement in any of it.
---
That's what I would think. One could hope though. üòã
---
Just like to point out that a handedness option would be nice, and as a lefty it absolutely isn't the "wrong" hand for all of us.
---
Outright loss is very rare.
---
You know how sometimes when you're looking at a post you wrote and you're watching the post ranking go up and down?
---
That happens because every time you refresh you're hitting a different server with a slightly different value cached locally.
---
If the server crashed at their end, we can take a while for thedata consistency algorithms to figure out what is and isn't supposed to be in your inventory. As far as these things go this system is actually pretty good and reliable in general. People notice the sets and big ticket things like that but I bet if you had perfect memory for what you'd had in your gear bag you'd notice some food items or something that were also not quite perfect.
---
It's distributed data coherence problem is part of distributed computing in general, and it happens in every game from time to time.
---
Did you actually finish the armor and register the helmet and all that? The most important part of doing the excavator armor missions is that's the only way to get the plans for the power armor station.
---
I didn't realize I had to finish that to get the PA station until I was like level 65 and I finally looked it up.
---
It's a much bigger pain in the ass to do those missions at higher level because the robots are all much higher level at that point.
---
saw a fw for 50 caps yesterday. Took two rare outfits and made them a joke common now....
---
Sure! I can hook you up... but I will need 14 screws to do it. What's your GT?
---
Edit: nvm. I see that someone else got you covered.
---
I already have a well because there's nothing else to buy...
---
I understand how frustrating it can be, but don't worry, you'll need a new set anyway because you lvl up pretty quickly in this game. And the scrap that's needed for it isn't rare, so you'll have no troubles in crafting it later. Maybe you won't even need it by then because there are much better types of PA around and some of them are very easy to get.
---
My love of blowing up cars has gotten me into trouble.  I think at the Whitesprings place with all the bots.  I accidentally blew up one when I blew up a car, and the entire place was out for blood.  So I‚Äôve gotten much more careful about my car arsons.  :(
---
Ive been making sure I have something less than 5caps in mine for these challenges. Usually a consumable of some type. While they may come for something cheap theyre usually looking at what else I have
---
If line in the sand is up and you can run silos quickly, its a p good source for materials too
---
Never done hunter/hunted, might try next time since it's the only one left I've got to do.
---
pick up all laser weapons, 10 plastic per gun is something no-one should sleep on
---
I dont really do chems, but do many people look for chems at a player vendor?
---
The grind is killing us.  Actually it's the RNG that's killing us.
---
That is literally what I am talking about. How do you rank up? Doing dailies.
---
Dailies like kill a 3 star legendary creature is going to take longer than kill just 3 legendaries. 
---
My god it‚Äôs not really hard to Understand.
---
Sameüòî
---
No reason to be rude, most people do enjoy it better.
---
As soon as you go through the door entering the silos it begins the quest like any other. Just go for it by yourself. I asked for help the first time as well and the guy that "helped" me had me PA glitch through a door and basically cheat my way through and I didn't learn anything until I did it solo anyway. Pack some stims and ammo look up the code on nukacrypt and follow the quest targets inside the silo. Boom apprenticeship complete lol.
---
There has been an increased in herbivore/carnivore too from my observations, probably due to it getting buffed amd people not having it prior
---
it does, but I guess not everyone can participate in it due to different reasons. but I did just that, since it's a guaranteed spawn and also got vendigo colossus right after.
---
I guess now it's a event that never was.
---
Yeah... 
---
I did free range today, he did not count for me. I asked dataminer friend and he confirmed that sheepsquatch doesn't count.
---
Yes but with 4 and 5
---
We had once killed the SBQ around 5-10 seconds after the event timer ended, got the even successfully finished xD
---
I appreciate your "Ron Swanson" esque solution. I encountered a bug where someone nuked while i was on "I am become..." And now even when i have keycard and silo codes there aren't waypoints. I legit need a step by step as the game design doesnt allow me.
---
I humbly assume this was a good natured reply.
---
Huh, so weird
---
Wrong its the junkies25 minigun... You get the junkies dmg and add the magic
---
Kinda like the room at the end of the wayward quest line. Machines set up for random legendarys with of a specific type.
---
They'll probably just create a bee-keeping collectron. It'll find lots of honey, some honeycomb and little beeswax to keeps things balanced
---
or look at the main menu, the month old announcement or basically any social media.
---
"  I'm sure there is some "but realistically you couldn't put clothes over that because of the technology, yadda yadda" reason behind it "  
---
If this game was consistent with logic I'd be on board with that kind of  argument. But this is a game where logic and realism are more of a suggestion.  
---
\-My big bulky armor disappears when I put on a t-shirt and slacks. Not logical or realistic.   
---
\-My character with an intelligence 14 isn't smart enough to cook with purified water to eat less radiation. Which would be basic survival. Not logical or realistic.  
---
\-I pick up 7 giant suits of armor that are each big enough for me to fit into and put them all in my pocket, next to my minigun and rocket launcher. Not logical or realistic.
---
I'm fine with things like this (except maybe the cooking thing). But it does mean they don't have the "but realism/logic!" card as an argument. Honestly, there's no real reason why someone shouldn't be able to put clothes over stealth armor and customize the way they look.
---
Ah yes it was. If I was PS4 i would help you out for sure. Ever make the Xbox switch hit me up!
---
I run around hitting them with my hammer. Loads of fun. 1 hit boom
---
SQB, FreeRange, Project paradise... It's not that hard to get guaranteed 3\*...
---
Gamers in 2020...
---
If I am maxed (rare currently) I build a wall around them that cant be glitched through and kill the power. No one knows they are there, and if they can somehow glitch walls and do so in the wrong place, they fall off the map (im underground).
---
I feel pretty scammed anytime I discover a game that's meant to be fun is actually prioritizing daily logins and money generation. 
---
Good rule of thumb is to never trust devs that try and sell you microtransactions. The whole 'games are becoming too expensive to make we simply *need* to charge people more' is actually a lie.
---
I‚Äôve unlocked it and built it in adventure mode, but it doesn‚Äôt show up when I go back to play nuclear winter? Am I missing something ?
---
At LVL 270, mostly I look for ammo, like what you're saying if you want to top up or don't feel like doing any crafting. I might take a look at plans, maybe some stable flux if I need some and can't land on a nuked server.
---
I found a few camps with some crazy ammo prices lately, like 5 caps and 10 caps a bullet - not sure what's happening there.
---
Someone was selling 10 mm rounds for 2 caps each today, and while I could've used them, it just wasn't worth it. So I bought 1 of them and 1 of their 2 caps each .45 to finish of my player challenge.
---
Do you know if 15% faster reload works well on the bows
---
Same my Boxy friend
---
You get tanks by doing the daily challenges. The early daily challenges should only take an hour. The later daily challenges should take two hours.
---
Because other than buying a rank the ONLY WAY TO MOVE UP RANKS IS DOING THE CHALLENGES!!!!

Dogwood die off

Breach and clear

"an animal, as distinct from a human being"
---
I had every piece and it took me a while to get it all, its just very disheartening because it was my first set and it was literally taken off my back by a server issue. I really hope that it does just randomly pop into my inventory when i log back into the game tomorrow but i wont get my hopes for that.Its not like a major loss or anything just a big annoyance and a fun dampener Also thank you for the response and help !(:
---
So I added up money spent plus 1st. I have a collective total of 1700 hours  which gives me a cost rate of 0.094 cents an hour for my play time.   
---
Seems like a fucking damn good return for my personal entertainment. Beats spending $60 for 2-10 hours of gameplay.
---
Maps, scrap, ammo, scrip weapons and armor(prices at 20 or less a scrip).
---
Let‚Äôs say I want a B2525 Fixer. And let‚Äôs assume I can ask for a fixer only, meaning nothing else will drop. It‚Äôs a 1/22 chance to drop Bloodied. Then a 1/6 chance for the second star to be 25, and the third has a 1/9 chance to be 25. That is a 1/1188 chance to drop with the rolls I want. 
---
Let‚Äôs assume I only get weapons from the rifle class like it was suggested. There are 12 weapons I know for sure roll as rifles, possibly more, that come under rifleman. So if I want a B2525 fixer only, that‚Äôs now a 1/14256 chance of getting my B2525 fixer. 
---
So. Is it still going to make the market ‚Äúdisgustingly saturated‚Äù and ‚Äúmake it pretty damn easy to roll god rolls‚Äù? Does anyone in their right minds think 1/1188 is easy odds to beat, *controlling the weapon that drops*, let alone 1/14256 odds without controlling the weapon drop and only the class?
---
Edit: broke it up so it‚Äôs not a wall of text anymore.
---
Launched a nuke. Found a 3* ghoul when I fast traveled to the drop site. Lol
---
No it won‚Äôt work regardless.  It‚Äôll just cause your vendor to bug out no matter what. Don‚Äôt use it unless you‚Äôre not planning on selling anything through vendors

I thought they were talking about Jawn's from southern US slang which normally means a long story/tale that usually makes very little sense (has no meaning).
---
I have, like, 600+ gunpowder but refuse to craft my own ammo. I'd rather buyout someone's vending machine.
---
Yeah it just an annoyance and little bit of a setback due to all the stuff i put into it. Im really hoping it never happens again with a more valuable set. I already have collected quite a few pieces of t-45 t-60 and t-51 on my travels at various levels so i still at least have some i could cobble together onto a frame currently.
---
I'm not crying you are.
---
My mistake, only ever used a gatling plasma and plasma caster. Thought it was the same, but I stand corrected.
---
This happened to me today, thought it was unusual too.
---
Turns out that is the only piece of power armor he can‚Äôt make lol. Would you still be a able to help me out?
---
Lol very interesting prop bet. I'll say 12 hrs?
---
Run west tek, Whitesprings, free range, horde events, etc. You'll get it eventually. Getting legendary is easy, just keep going for creature 3*.
---
I dont know if most people like it that way better. Butwhat I am sure of, it' that most people don't have to choice to play it in a regular way anymore.
---
(ps: I love how not standing on the side of exploiters get me downvoted. It's priceless ;) )
---
I'll take "heavy gun" or "not heavy gun" at this point just because I'm sick of getting gatlings and broadsiders. I must roll 70% heavy weapons, and I don't use them nor have STASH space to sell the few good ones. It's so frustrating, I end up selling for caps and saving the low weight stuff I loot for scrip.
---
The gauss minigun is great for destroying things including the mainframe cores and cars. I highly recommend it.
---
Maybe you could use a legendary module to craft a specific weapon but it can‚Äôt be traded
---
I honestly feel terrible for you fellas, I‚Äôve only had one autocomplete for a single daily ever.
---
Cheers for the response '72.  I'm a lowly level 30-something (giving it a go on the recent Xbox game pass offer), and I find I spend cash on very little other than occasional ammo top-ups and some plans.
---
No doubt this might change as I level up further, but it's good to know that even level 270s are up for buying some reasonably priced ammo from time to time :)
---
I must note, the higher level players I've come across so far have been good folk. A small handful of the people that presumably also started on the Games Pass offer with me have been dicks, but the community seems generally very positive.
---
Or because the ranks require more score per rank therefore they take longer than the ranks before regardless of the dailies. The challenges haven't increased in difficulty at all. Just because we just got a daily that hasn't appeared in the rotation yet doesn't mean they are getting harder. If anything killing a 3 star = to killing 3 any stars, it's just a different challenge. Deliberately misquoting the QA to suit your needs isn't helping your argument.
---
That's actually pretty damn scary. I'm actually quite glad I have FO1st &amp; try to not interact with a lot of players while I'm on public.
---
I only shop for plans and the occasional outfit
---
Outfit mannequins are now called allies. 
---
Also just an FYI, we may be getting a display soon. There's a skeleton display looking item in datamines. I'm GUESSING that's what it is, cause it's shown with and without a hat.
---
Im only at lvl 72 rn but i really only will check someones trader if they have a decent amount of plans and weapons.    I was able to buy my first bloodied weapon a week or so ago at like 200 caps. Its only a 1 star but being such a low level and finally finding a weapon for my build i couldnt pass it up lol

I stick any excess gunpowder I have in at 1 cap a piece, and it seems to move - Not every time I'm online, but occasionally people will come and buy in bulk
---
Ive noticed the lower levels sell ammo at higher prices than the higher levels. At least from my experience on xb1 so far
---
weird. chemist works for me but I don't have the other ones
---
I‚Äôm PS4 and sell mutations for 300 caps each if you‚Äôre interested, and have most of them available. :)

At least the challenge is not, collect a 3\* item from an enemy lol.

I can build and mod just about anything in the game üëç However, I have 7 screws left. So if you provide screws, we're good üòÅ

Lemme know how you get on!

Bulked scrap, I'm guessing? One cap per one scrap sounds pricey from my rudimentary understanding of general pricing.

I've been playing around with the reduced VATS cost, and it works nicely.

Wrong. But I can‚Äôt stop you from being stupid.
---
They did not say that later ranks would take longer because you won‚Äôt be able to get a rank a day. 
---
That‚Äôs because of the weeklies. They help you stay on track.
---
It's called a 'challenge' not a 'freebie'. 
---
There are plenty of places you can go on the map to find legendary creatures, it's really not that bad. If you go start at Forward Point Delta, run around that area, through the Sundew Grove, and go all the way up through there to the Big Bend Tunnel and start Ridin' Shotgun(The Blood Eagle Leader is always a 3* and there's usually other legendaries in the tunnel at least 1 other on average), you're going to find legendaries and have an event ready to go. If there are 'kill scorched' or 'kill creatures' events, you'll be able to knock those out running that from Forward Point Delta to Big Bend Tunnel.  
---
The challenges can be knocked out in an hour to an hour and a half, really not that bad.
---
I'm bored with this grind. Made it up to 70 but this battle pass has burned me out from this game.
---
Just search junkies build in the search bar.   Someone made a small tips and tuts post for runnung junkies and it was pretty insightful
---
Dogwood die off.  Is this event bugged?  Everytime I go to get fertilizer and go back nothing happens
---
Most of them were freebies for logins.
---
Agree on this 100%
---
I find it even more enjoyable being in the midst of all the explosions because my dense chest armor and fireproof active lol
---
I usually look for plans first for anything I don‚Äôt have cause I‚Äôm a camp boy. I‚Äôve been getting into looking for cheap legendaries for spare scrip cause I‚Äôve been slacking on getting good weapons/armor for a good build. Also just started with some heavy weapons for some end game grinding so I‚Äôm usually looking for cheap cheap fusion cores
---
there's also an extra stash box next to Meg in the middle of that room while Foundation only has one.
---
You can buy the holo tape in the bunker from Modus
---
Yes there is a holo tape called Missile Silo State holotape which is given when you start that quest and also available to buy from MODUS (in the armoury I believe). I didn't realise that I even had it so check your holo tab in inventory. It shows what silos are available and how long if on cooldown.
---
You get a holotape when you join the Enclave that shows the status of the silos
---
Happen to me today lmao trash game
---
You can place one in any workshop you run so that's am option.
---
If the others can‚Äôt make you the piece I gotchu
---
Ok but that‚Äôs to get the exact specific gun you want, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd either settle for or sell most bloodied rifles you‚Äôd get along the way (handmade, assault, fixer, radium, etc). Yet alone any bloodied explosive or faster fire rates. Also not everyone rolls for 3 stars, almost god tier two stars exist.
---
Edit: misread only a fixer part still tho, there‚Äôs plenty of decent combos. two shots vampires furious and anti armor are still decent too. How many ‚Äúacceptable/good‚Äù weapon combos are there that you could sell? What would your odds be then
---
Not a bad idea. I used to stick 5.56 in my machine at 2-3 caps per. I wasn't really looking to sell but I had, like, 20k rounds stockpiled &amp; figured if it was going to sit in storage, might as well. I only ever put 1k at a time in the vending machine but they surprisingly sold several times, albeit, not quickly.
---
I haven't seen that one yet. you can only have 1 at you're camp. My question would be why on earth would anyone want to listen to 5 of those damn things.
---
On desktop you can just drag and drop pictures into your post.
---
What level do you need?
---
Had tesla rifle with 200 cell batteries, pretty neat bug.
---
I've got some very annoying news for when you remember to go cash them in...200 per day.
---
Use Class Freak and public teams, then having all mutations becomes amazing.
---
The event that used to be.
---
What's your GT?
---
I have a quick errand to run and can help you after I get back.
---
I think the range and heat seaking vats effect are enough to go with the snowballer. You only want a regular barrel if its an explosive cryo.
---
Are you scrapping the bags?  It has to be the bags and not the raw.
---
I think I'm a lower level player (L37), but I searched up what various bits of ammo typically go for before I got around to even being able to open a vendor.
---
I think there can deffo be a disconnect between how easy some ammo is to pick up, and how much early players want to sell it for. I'd like to put that down to youthful/green exuberance/optimism.
---
I'm not saying I've nailed all my prices yet, but some things do move quickly.
---
I use Serendipity (LCK), Dodgy (AGI), Nerd Rage (INT), Radicool (END) as a basic setup for Bloodied.
---
Yes, they're planning on improving it, Maybe in tomorrow's patch.
---
Did that on accident in Valley Galleria. Caught me quite by surprise! I didn‚Äôt die, but came close and enjoyed the show
---
That would explain why it didn't Pop for me
---
Depends on what it is steel one cap per.  Adhesive and lead 2 caps per.  Oil right now is thru the roof because of all the legacy framers that people acquired thru totally legitimate means.  I started out selling scrap.
---
thats good to hear
---
That's why my 30 machines are underground. Too many trolls in this game.
---
Yeah but if you join a team you loose the benefits of lone wanderer wich are quite amazing in my opinion.
---
No. Just did Encrypted - three 3\* legendary bots and none of them counted.
---
Really fanciful post, although I agree with some points (like the scrap box) we will have all the weapons we want so easily; thats the main problem I see with your argument. I like it tho of course, but we would get bored quick.
---
Edit: I laught with the end of your post 10/10; yes we need more content
---
I run a heavy gunner/exp bloody/uny build but have a TSE 10mm SMG, its my favorite every day gun that I use for most daily quests. I suggest trying on of those.
---
My husband and I both wear one.
---
Absolutely not! I can‚Äôt sell 1* anything! Whenever I try, I‚Äôm downvoted to oblivion and laughed at. But let‚Äôs say for one moment I can control the weapon class, so that‚Äôs 2/12 (or 1/6) to get a handmade or fixer (only weapons I haven‚Äôt been mocked for trying to sell) and I‚Äôm after a 2* BE, JE, JFFR or BFFR version. The odds of rolling Bloodied or Junkies is 2/22 (or 1/11.) The odds of rolling explosive or faster fire rate are 2/6 (or 1/3). So the odds of getting a weapon I am easily resell are 1/198. Still pretty long odds, in my opinion. It‚Äôs still not easy, I still have to try almost 200 times to have a near 100% chance of rolling a single gun of value.
---
Explosive radium rifles no longer roll, hence why I excluded them from my calculations.
---
Why are people downvoting your accurate tipps for saving time killing legendary creatures?
---
I don‚Äôt get it. Almost like they just *want* to be mad not finishing the dailies
---
Photos were just on my phone it literally blocks me from posting a picture album post
---
I stopped using it for now because it isn‚Äôt worth it and the interface is terrible. Interested to see how they patch it though
---
Is it possible to remove it from below? If you built a stairway leading down with the bass on a rug on the stairs you should be able to get under it. Of course you‚Äôd also have to build back up somewhere else and connect to a different foundation so that the message about sections being inaccessible doesn‚Äôt get you next. It might be more trouble than it‚Äôs worth.
---
Oki doke.
---
I'm on wired connection 100mb sec and since the last update game is a laggy mess run to fast frame rate drops, line in sand laggy as hell,  I'm on Xbox one x and I might as well be playing on a the 360.
---
I did go loaded with scrapped fertilizer once.   But then realised I needed the bags. So I fast travelled to the markers.  But nothing seems to complete.
---
It's like the prison break event where there is no timer or queues on the screen.
---
Same here
---
I believe they are only changing how much you can withdraw or deposit aka 1 stack 10 stacks 100 stacks and upping how many points the machine can store to 100,000. Don't think they are changing the points to ammo ratio.
---
Old school WoW player here. I've played in every expansion and will be checking out the new one.
---
Battleground type PvP could definitely be fun.
---
Cobalt and crimson flux for my plasma caster and gauss minigun. Please let me know if you're selling any... thanks.
---
&gt;Unpopular opinion but I don‚Äôt like this idea, then everyone would grind for the same op weapons like bloodied explosive fixers, be handmades, etc.  
---
&gt;It would make several ‚Äúgood‚Äù guns now basically undesirable and everyone would use the same things
---
That doesn't happen unless there's only a few weapons/builds worth using in the first place.  Games like Diablo, PoE, Division, Warframe, Borderlands, Destiny, etc all have various ways of narrowing down RNG, crafting, target farming or questing for specific items.  And every single one of those games completely shits on 76 in terms of build diversity.
---
You want **actual** gear/build diversity?  You have to give people a reason to *want* more than bloodied/junkie/explosive weapons.
---
&gt;Like you said, it'll make it too easy to land a god tier weapon and obliterate the fun out of the game.
---
I don't know how people can say this with a straight face.  How many times have we seen looter shooters/ARPGs rework their loot system to make it easier to get better drops?
---
Saddling players with unending streams of trash so a handful of items can feel, "special" does not keep most people on the hook for long.  Even a game as big as Diablo 3 had to learn this lesson the hard way.
---
Imagine if the BoS Atlas turn in worked like the ammo converter.
---
Though I can't wait for the AC to be fixed / changed tomorrow.
---
Actually yes I have experienced this issue, mainly when I‚Äôm trying to get mutations on my new character I‚Äôm building. They are only level 4 so i figured it had something to do w/ that
---
Got a bloodied swing speed from doing a ally dailey
---
Just a level 25
---
I've only seen a legendary there one time. Only place I regularly see legendary mole miners is Uranium Fever, like legendary Scorched, they happen, but they're kind of a rarity.
---
well we'll have to wait and see
---
My husband and I so the same too ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞

Surely someone will make it through the night. Chances are it won't be you...
---

---

---
been waiting for the brother hood stuff to come
---
Ok, i have repeated this a lot, i have never had anyone tell me they have had it happen when following the advice, and the only times i have had autocomplete is when doing something other than this. 
---
Dont look at TLR table or atom shop prior to logging in after reset. Dont go to NW as first game mode. Enter adventure/private first login in after reset (doesnt matter how long after, its just the first log in). After entering the world, dont open the map for any reason for the first 2 to 5 minutes. This is how long the world takes to load. If you are at your camp, its easier to see how fast things load, as you are more accustomed to it. After all that, then you can look. 
---
I havent had anyone that followed say it still did it, and like i said, the only times it happened to me were when I didnt do it. 
---
Hope you make it through ok üëç
---
I think its sluggish on purpose. Its Power Armor after all.
---
I nuke you first
---
Good to know, thank you for the heads up!
---
True, though Empath makes up for some of that loss: the damage increase is reduced to about +8% IIRC by Class Freak, and the damage reduction can be increased to -33% using Strange in Numbers, and for some reason it applies to you as well.  It doesn't quite replace Lone Wanderer, but it's a good chunk of it.
---
meat week's been running on the PTS for weeks but i'm sure your conspiracy theory is right...
---
Damn that's quite worrying. For me at least this is why I never interact with people on games like fallout 76. Trading etc. Just not worth it. There's always better loot.
---
"How could anyone throw away this used Toilet Paper" is still funny.
---
I was probably 10-15 tiers behind early on, but am now about 3-4 back, so it‚Äôs definitely possible. But the double score weekend was a big part of that, so if you didn‚Äôt hit every one of those days, it might be pretty hard
---
Imho you really shouldnt be ttying to sell ammo for more than 1-2 caps.  Obviously there are those few ammo types which dont fit in that category like cores or ultracite ammo.  Which im not even sure if you can sell off ultracite but was just using it as somewhat of an example but yea
---
I am feeling optimistic, Jes2r is still in the game and sitting at the costume shop at the top of the Mire.
---
I‚Äôll try it after letting the world load, haven‚Äôt heard that before.
---
I've mainly looked for plans but I have only 20 more plans to get and I have all of them from the game so that's pretty much done.
---
I look for cheap mentats or berry mentats. Some clothing but my hopes for a rare gem is low. Cheap 2mm. Cheap maps. A funny legendary weapon. Maybe a nocturnal rolling pin low level one star just for hahas.
---
Non-event go to for this was the Generals steakhouse and west tec, got it first try
---
It‚Äôs only a lie for games that come out every year (eg Fifa). But for a game that people buy once and expect fresh content two years after release, it is not. $60 does not entitle you to content several years after the fact. Producing games cost money. Maintaining servers costs money. Paying programmers and artists to create new content costs money.
---
Yea it happens when you either do the mission too fast or you're just in a laggy lobby.
---
it's droppable and sellable
---
It‚Äôs literally impossible to place your camp anywhere once it gets blueprinted.
---
Id get some more opinions on it but i have a ts ffr with the snowballer and i dont have any complaints.
---
Thanks I wasn‚Äôt 100% sure on that
---
Did you finish the test and the plans for the power armor station?
---
Realized it a couple days after it started. Being online is mostly to avoid "looking" at the challenges as they load. I saw them autocomplete as they entered, but because they load the first time you enter a world, technically you can be on during reset as long as you dont open the map during that 5 minute span of refresh. I wouldnt suggest testing the theory, but this is all from what i have read from other people and my own issues.
---
I have both. I write stories for my characters. My main wears his dad's hat and ring as part of it. That's my reason for it.
---
I went to West Tek this afternoon to look for a level up and a 3\*. There were three 3\* super mutants in there for me.
---
true!
---
Just did it solo at level 34 I died about 20 or so times but its doable
---
Id be down to pay to reroll weapons
---
I have the same issue. My cousin can see me but i cant see him in the social menu. Everytime we play together he has to join me and sent me a team invite. Wish bethesda would fix this. Its a known issue.
---
Well pay scrip anyway
---
If you think bows being inexplicably left handed is bad then whatever you do; don't use a hunting rifle.
---
Then they can find a better, more consumer-friendly way of monetization. We had it figured out back in the WoW days, so I'm sure we can figure it out again.
---
And by figure it out, I mean, simply move away from MTX and GaaS. Consumers don't benefit from that model.
---
I did actually. I was even 90 at the beginning of double score, and was level 120 afterwards
---
Ah, yeah they better. I joined fo76 late and missed it. Isnt there a new event coming out soon tho that's supposed to be like a raid?
---
\*'make it rain' hand gestures\*
---
In afraid I think I might be at least 100 levels behind you.
---
As far as I know no you can not. They had a grace period where you could link the two as a welcoming the game to steam. I think that ability is expired.
---
Gotcha.  Yeah, that is classified as a robot.
---
I think your waypoints reactivate when you enter the silo; I still get them and Im lvl 300

You can get it off the roach on the toilet, near Nuka Cola bottle plant. The wife and I both wear our in game weeding rings.

Does it freeze any slower??
---
If the community does well with this BoS event we should be given a score event. It's always possible buffing XP and doing every single challenge but it would be tight. Otherwise as another had said buy a few levels up to get past.
---
Do not worry, he does not move every day, you can catch up so long as you keep up on your dailies and weeklies. You do get atoms from the board that you can invest back in to skipping ranks, I would save this until each rank costs more than 2600.
---

Just to be clear, does the armor say "Forest Scout" in the name?  I can do that too with urban scout armor...but it doesn't work with my forest scout pieces.

---
Sorry if I'm not understanding correctly, but isn't butchers bounty the perk that gives extra meat from dead animals?
---
Oh and you didn't say what platform you were using. If you're using the console try doing an orderly exit from the program and session.
---
You do that by going to the map, then selecting social, then doing it up arrow until you can click on the box in the extreme upper right of the map. And then there should be an option for leave world.
---
Then quit the game completely and wait a minute or two before going back in.
---
That might trigger a server-side cleanup of the dropped session.
---
Top left vault should be vault 51 if im remembering correctly. Its the vault used for the nuclear winter staging area. Its nice inside, my only complaint is that theres no real way to explore and listen to the holotapes.
---
I have tried a couple times separate days. Im not trying to be contrarian just informative. Just a bit glitched. I suppose to be thorough i cwould run an alt launch but that would take some grind... Anyway i appreciate your input nonetheless

It crashes my PC as well sometimes, I think it has something to do with ram usage, normally I have firefox and spotify (I listen to one or the other while I play) open in combination with FO76 set to max settings, I'm almost maxed out of my ram (16GB, 8086K @ 5.2ghz, 1080ti, 850w).

If you join a person you dont know's party you're going to get DDOSd half the time so I guess just try not to.

If you have 15 strength your 8 mouse clicks away from a max damage heavy weapon.  I found 3 , 3 star legendaries enemies in the first 5 minutes.  AWOL always spawns one, got lucky and found 2 gutsies and an alpha death claw walking into a SBQ fight (all 3 star)
---
Try to have as high intelligence as you can possibly get so use unyielding armor or however high Intel with power armor if that's what you use. I myself use herbivore and eat cranberry relish for 25% bonus xp with  strange in numbers perk and use a food that also boost intelligence as well. Then I usually do runs of Charleston DMV, whitespring, West tek then barrows for legendary gear but this also gives pretty good xp as well. Should help you complete the repeatable SCORE challenge to help you catch up.
---
Vault 51. Log into nuclear winter to get inside
---
This. If we are able to get enough junk - I think we get both a double daily challenges weekend AND a bonus challenge week. So this might be just what you need to help you catch up (assuming we are able to get enough junk)
---
Does the vault have a number on it?
---
doesn't count, or so I heard.  I could be wrong and everyone was trolling.
---
Shhhh ü§´üòÇ
---
But beyond my sarcasm yes West Tek and burrows are a legendary gold mine. If you fail in those spots serving hoping usually does the trick.
---
If you buy levels wait until the end of the season to do it.  Levels take more score for each level.
---
Do it
---
Do it nao
---
I did the raid a few times, it did not ever go well, it just became more of a resource sink than it was worth and I could find people more willing to run project paradise. On top of that, the timed versions were not interesting for me, and as a melee build I never bothered with trying to solo because the final boss was a strangler heart sitting up in the air. Meaning you needed ranged players with you, or you needed a good gun if you wanted to try solo. That being said I would like a better raid put in the game, something with less water and mirelurks with their acid damage.
---
He moves 1 spot each day. You need to do more and grind xp like crazy. You are behind.
---
Everytime I jump on a new server I browse all player vendors for whoever has the most plans. Usually I know them all or they're priced at something ridiculous like 300 caps each, but now and then you get some nice people selling them all at 5-35 caps each and a couple I didn't know yet. 
---
Lately I've also been on the lookout for camps with many weapons/armors posted, but generally whenever I visit their vendors it's some shit like explosive bow level 5, explosive bow level 10, explosive bow level 15, etc, all at 1k caps each. The hidden gems seem to be the people selling very few weapons/armors or even people without their shop wired. So I just visit everyone's camp now if I got the time after the vendors with the most plans.
---
Sometimes the bodies will appear in different spots for other people. So you might just be sitting out in the open from another player's perspective.
---
I use it for missiles, nukes, and 40mm. Everything else takes too long to add points for.

Ahh there it is! Had no markings, a tractor trailer outside it, and a bunch of lockers and containers scattered around.
---
Perfect for my hermit lair

Ok must be something I'm doing wrong.  I'll try again another day

Yes it is. I believe he is talking about it no longer doubles the tick blood sack drops from ticks as it did before Wastelanders.

You really have to grind that repeatable. I passed him on the double XP weekend. I ended up grinding my way to rank 91 and bought the last 9 because I was done grinding.
---
Red Rocket mega stop is fun too. Bonus if you can get some of those blobby ghouls in the explosion. XP with a light show!
---
Yep. And Bethesda knows well succeed at achieving those goals. The reason the BoS event is what it is is to pull some of the stored junk in the game out of the ecosystem to make servers a bit more stable. They also wouldn't want us to fail as that's a way of saying "no one plays the game." So I expect to get a score event.
---
Ah ok, I didn't know if they got it confused with pharma farma. Thanks for the response.
---
In previous Fallouts I‚Äôve often used cars as impromptu IED‚Äôs

I‚Äôve got 32 gb so I hope not
---
IDK about ghouls havent really tries but you can still shoot the eyes off of a Mr. Handy / Gutsy
---
I have this happen a lot. I also suspect this issue is why people have trouble hitting the damage cap at scorched earth. I've hit the queen in the face for around 1200 a couple of times before and got nothing coz the server decided it didn't happen.
---
Lol. Well it‚Äôs worked well so far. That‚Äôs a funny thought though. I may have hidden in Morgantown high school before also
---
Why not both, the 50 cal for trash mobs and use the lmg for things that are gunna last a few bullets so make the 308 worth using since it vomits then out.
---
I finished the quest and got the plans yeah so I‚Äôm all good on that front luckily, i completely quit the game after i found out the armour was gone, ill log into it again tomorrow hopefully if it is possible for it to come back it should have had enough time to sort itself out by then.
---
Oh and im on xbox (:
---
Oh ya. I do it at white springs it makes the bad guys come out
---
Between this and this SCORE complaints it would seem this subs wants to play the game as little as possible
---
Yes, but he does not exchange T-notes for bullion, He just sells bullion for caps.
---
 Foundation/crater dailys are not high on my list of things to do, but I do complete a number of events on a regular basis; being able to exchange T-Notes without having to hoof it to one of the extreme ends of the map would be nice.
---
Royal Jelly too
---
You just saved 30 caps. They sure do add up though
---
10-20 is a high number
---
Thanks for the breakdown, that‚Äôs pretty solid reasoning. So yeah .05% isn‚Äôt real great if you‚Äôre looking for real nice rifle stuff, idk I don‚Äôt really sell exactly high tier I sell for maybe 600-3000 just at my camp rarely anything considered very high end. Mostly mid grade/good.
---
I still think it‚Äôs a bit high of odds, people will grind it and eventually  get good stuff. If 198 players rolled at once, it‚Äôs likely at least one would get within that .05 bracket. It‚Äôs hard to say how much it would impact
---
First time for me, i had no idea what was going on. I thought the game had glitched. Suddenly,i woke up in the middle of the Savage Divide with no idea of where i was and nearly shat myself because I'd never been in The Divide before. I had no idea on how far to safety, any clues on what lay ahead, overencumbered and no other landmarker to Respawn if i died then the one I'd landed at. Something i became aware of when i also came on my first Yao Guai in game and had to use it. Lol.

Humans like to see patterns. Everywhere. And they create patterns wherever possible.

Also: 2 (or 5. or 10.) is not a good sample size.
---
It was removed for being bugged. Apparently the bots had a terrible tendency to get stuck out in the parking lot and would never path up to the fort. Only ever did it once and I remember having to snipe robots stuck down the hill to finish the event. It was interesting but not that special alone.
---
my question is Meat Week coming this month? It was held at end of summer last year...so...where is it? Havent heard any announcements
---
mine always says "95%" but of course that is hardly true.
---
Luckily update 21 is fixing the ammo converter which is going to be released today for non PTS servers
---
Mmm I see, yeah someone will help Im on PC
---
There are some pretty good folk out there, everyone started somewhere, and eventually, we all catch on to what the community wants; or abandon the game altogether. If I have the caps, I don't mind buying some ammo, I usually just make it myself, or get it from my Ammo Mill from the Raiders, which I'd highly suggest working toward since it produces ammo out of thin air - if you decide to stick around after the Game Pass ends, that is:)
---
Must have a really high standard if "buying things from other people at prices they decided on" is a crappy thing to do.

That would actually be an interesting idea. A Christmas/halloween mixed event

While this is nice for potential buyers looking for a few missing plans, I'm wary of offering items at such a low price (except ammo of course). I've been offering stimpaks, grenades etc at very low prices in the past, and found that the whole stock of a specific item would *always* get bought by a single player instead of helping different players in need.

Plans I don‚Äôt know, cheap ammo, or something low cap to satisfy the ‚Äúbuy/sell‚Äù challenge without breaking the bank.

I love you too ZAX

Robots are the only enemies that still have live dismemberment, which is why it bothers me that they removed it for other enemies like Deathclaws, Mirelurks, and Feral ghouls in 76.  Even Bloodbugs could be dismembered rarely.

Well, considering currently it‚Äôs currently 1/55836 odds to get a B2525 fixer as is... 1/14256 isn‚Äôt that much of a leap imo.

I thought about this too and thought on top of mount blair would be a great spot for that. You could even do other events like king of hill with the giant excavator with team camp building allowed so you could build defenses. It would have to be separate of main world. either way you could do a lot with that area

Sounds good, have fun, and hopefully you get away with it.  If instead you get banned, oh well.
