Either way you will complain. They charge to play if you want or not. The content is free. Either way you pay so who cares thats its like this. I enjoy the game a lot and pay when I have time to play

It would make more sense(server stability) to allow players to collect more scrip but only allow them to spend a certain amount daily. This would free up player stash space which frees up server memory space. Bethesda should be aware of this simple solution for stability. More proof they don't really prioritize this game.
---
It does sound like a great idea.
---

---
I hate having to decide whether to let people get XP or being time efficient, and I REALLY don't care if people get XP while I'm mowing down everything VATS can target.
---
I like shooting mobs, I like one-shotting things, I love seeing 2300+ damage numbers pop up every half second while running through an event. 
---
Want to leech? Go for it.
---
That's a very very good idea. I've been paranoid about this. Thankyou for the idea sir.
---
They dont need to really add interior walls, just let us customize both sides of the walls we already have. Would make everything much simpler, and it'd most likely just be a line to edit in the file.
---
My luck with her is so bad, I don‚Äôt even care anymore about scrip.
---
Because if there's a dick move that can be done, Vault-Tec is gonna do it every time
---
It's just the community on Reddit. I doubt most players would actually set foot here.
---
It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs much scrap or loot to scavenge.
---
Looking forward to living in your world, vault dweller!
---
no
---
I guess because there‚Äôs really nothing in there to revisit unless you forgot the holotape game.
---
Especially since 4 people can stack 4 Lunchboxes for +100% XP.
---
lvl5
---
I haven‚Äôt been grinding exp too hard, and a few days ago I had two challenges autocomplete.  I‚Äôm at level 15 now.  I‚Äôm planning on doing the weekly challenges during the double score event, and with double xp, there should be plenty of time to make sure I get it by week 10.  It would not surprise me either if they extended it by a week or two.
---
Reasons.
---
As a pc player its better in those terms but still has a lot of the over glaring issues. They just happen less but theyre still there.
---
To the point I appreciate that.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
its meaningless.. get to the end before the season is over is all you have to do
---
I get the sense you actually don't care and just want to low key shit on the game.
---
Youre pretty far ahead like hardcore grinded levels ahead.
---
The cranberry relish gives 20% to 25% exp boost with herbivore. For some reason the bonus on food vary from 2x to 2.5x bonus. I think my strange in numbers keep buffing herb even though it shouldn‚Äôt.
---
Sorry to hear that man just remember use biuld team for more exp for everything not just event completion. I had full team (extra 8% exp for everything that gives exp) and everyone popped a lunch box ( 100% more) I completed the repeatable exp challenge about 15 times
---
Yes!!! I‚Äôve been hoping they‚Äôd add a bit more Mothman content!
---
Alt tab through your opened programs. And back into it?
---
fuck whoever removed this. quality post and interaction. i bet you‚Äôre the one with who‚Äôd ask the teacher about homework right before everyone left.
---
Today I took out a Mothman cult and during the battle was attacked by a Vengeful Mothman. I‚Äôm starting to believe these nutters might be on to something worshiping his bugness.
---
Huh?
---
All I really wanted from this season was the sink, which was a bit of a let down cause it gives you dirty water, the fireplace, and this wallpaper.
---
When I clicked the final reward, it says something like you beat Zorbo in the Legendary Run so I am kinda baffled if this has anything to do with the green spaceship.
---
I doubt it‚Äôll be that hard to hit lvl 100 before the season expires. I mean the pace you and I and the rest of us maniacs are at, ( lvl 17 here ) we‚Äôll be finished in 5 and half weeks
---
NSW Australia, the Harbour bridge and the opera house would be really cool landmarks to explore, and it would be super neat to know what happened to fallout Australia. Did it get invaded by the Chinese? Plus, Australian accents, plus some fun unique mutated monsters.
---
On pc I just use the custom Ini editor and can change the colour so easy to anything I want
---
Exploiters got to 100 day 1. Of course Bethesda didn't do anything about it. For legit cases, I heard someone got as high as 40+
---
I just hit 16. I did skip two NW ones though. Seems like I've been playing a lot since it started and already I'm a little bored of the grind. Most challenges are fine but I hate the leveling up one and will probably just stop trying to complete it and see how far I end up getting.
---
His spaceship‚Äôs engine broke down because he bought the cheap gas. I think you‚Äôre gonna be O.K.
---
Does it matter? :P
---
I know that feeling; or swapping out nerd rage and the anti-armor for heavy weapons in power armor perk cards for gunsmith when I'm upgrading things; and forgetting to put them back in so my bullets do sod all xD
---
My record so far, even when moving around before trying again, is 22 attempts before being able to travel.
---
Sorry I worded it poorly. I wasn't trying to make this another post about broken promises blah blah etc... I'm just burning out slowly and don't see the benefit in keeping the tent and paying for it right now if I'm barely playing. I'll probably reactivate my subscription when the BoS stuff comes out but I figured that extra 50?ish dollars that I'll end up saving could be used on a new game or going out on a date.
---
Let's go Bethesda! Get Adrenaline fixed, you broke it so fix it! üòÅ I need Adrenaline in my life, I am empty without it! FIX FIX FIX!!
---
Because some people still haven‚Äôt recovered from Reclamation Day hangovers and we are letting them sleep it off.
---
Wow i thought i had it bad. Im sorry my guy.
---
Wait the games nuke tapper right
---
I hope his spaceship gets sucked into the 4th dimensional wormhole
---
One nice spot is the tall power pylon next to Charleston station, you can do something creative with the design I guess.
---
I'm a friggin' dumb ass!  I thought "builder team" was for peeps building a camp. Having ongoing coms issues, I couldn't figure out why the eff they were standing around watching me build while shooting alien blasters at me. Half an hour later I was booted and now I know why. UUUGH! I feel so misunderstood!
---
Seen this a bunch and have also had people drop off and then pop back on my team. Possibly you are looking at someone that crashed out or got kicked due to inactivity and the refresh on the team slots is bugged.
---
My buddy forgot when the season started and got on today, just in time for windows to corrupt itself while updating.
---
Not that it would make you feel any better to hear someone else is more delayed.
---
An upvote for the grinding you did
---
But if you park down at C-town Station you‚Äôll make it impossible for the Responser Bot to sell us Clean Spacesuits.
---
But why? Did the 15 caps you spent going there hurt? I like going to camps because some people make amazing things
---
Not sure what your "no" is for, I just want the raids added back to the game, do you?  Experienced runners like you can duo expert and wouldn't need the public teams, and if you're bored you can coach some noobs through hell.
---
The public teams just give those non dedicated players a chance to get in and try it out with a group, which they didn't have before, which led to low participation and removal.
---
The dataminer guy says tank killer and ground pounder doesn't work for shotguns. You told me the opposite.
---
I'm curious who's right because I genuinely don't know.
---
This is how it works in Elder Scrolls Online, you need proximity for it to proc, you even get to loot them!
---
Zorbo was added so that Bethesda can throw you the middle finger as he reaches the last few spaces and denies you the best stuff...
---
22 here. Juice your intelligence stats and work that 10k bonus.
---
That is a problem too, pity! Forgot about the bot..
---
How far have you got?
---
I would have to check. But, yeah, one of the terminals has a game that you couldn‚Äôt get in the world from what I recall. 
---
If you missed it then creating a second character was needed to grab it in order to complete the atom challenge. 
---
That said, i don‚Äôt know if it was patched so you can get it in the open world.
---
We get backed further and further into a corner with builds in order to remain competitive, but I don‚Äôt mess with that glitch shit. Between the ammo glitch, the broken lasers, and the jet packs, it‚Äôs getting to be a clusterfuck. There are still a lot of legitimately good pvpers out there though, we‚Äôre not all cheats.
---
Flavor text. He wont reach the end b4 the end of the season.
---
I have nuka tapper so I think I'm good phew
---
That‚Äôs true, but over half of the time it‚Äôs a ugly camp with just troll items in vendors. Plus does it hurt to have a player level on their camp? No, it does not. It‚Äôs a QoL improvement, there‚Äôs literally no reason of not having this.
---
There was a terminal inside before you left the vault that stated that the air supply would be shut off if you didn't leave.
---
The only other game I play with a battlepass is MW. That game granted cost 1000 cod point to buy the premium BP but as long as you play, you will earn enough where all the rest are free. 
---
That game has you earning towards the battlepass as long as you play. Its not linked to challenges only.
---
And thats COD. An Activision game. They are hardly known for their generosity.
---
I get bogged down. I have quests to do! I do better at these challenges than the old ones. Of course, that also means I‚Äôm getting less Atoms.
---
I'm sorry for whatever negative thing in your life had made you such a bitter ball of nerves and hate.  Hope it gets better bud. Really do.
---
It should be somewhere around 9:00 AM MT
---
I always want to buy some skins for my PA so you can't tell that it's a mix of T-51b and T-60 but I can't justify that the cheapest skin is 1,000 atoms. It makes no sense.
---
Buy FO76 cheap on steam and use it as a mule account.
---
It just works.
---
Good to know!
---
Count me in...getting online in a few. Gt Egaman69
---
Im sorry but their is just to much in this game whic is so badly timegated and its soooo restrictive. It ruins players that can only play on weekends, or 2-3 times per week. Its mobile esq with the daily restriction crap.
---
I had the opposite problem yesterday. The weekly for building stuff finished before I built everything I needed and I got the score for it. It was still showing as not completed, but didn't give any SCORE when I actually completed it.
---
Test it. Watch how fast you reload with a shotgun. Double barrel and gauss are more noticeable.
---
Not only that but you can add the super bright headlamp mod and shine down onto people with the light of God.
---
I also just cancelled.  For me, it's the atoms.  I dont need it at all nor do I want them.  I really wish there was a cheaper option for 1st that only provided the scrap box and survival tent.  It should just be free but that's not the world we live in.  I would happily pay 3.99 a month for those features and skip all the atoms.
---
Ah get the hell outta here I lost all respect for them when I noticed these 'skilled' pvpers were aimbotting instead of hacking so they would look legit. And most of them at least use glitches or exploits. If you ain't then you lack
---
Decent I‚Äôll message you
---
Double benefit from vegggie based XP boosts (cranberry relish gives 20%). And yes, int increases XP slightly.
---
Send Bethesda Support a ticket.
---
Fallout 3 *was* a Bethesda game, dingus.
---
I'm down to join with people to complete this. I'll make a staircase blueprint and we can take turns jumping off it for revives and exp
---
I wish they weren't hostile on site
---
And it was also fun seeing the weapon be grabbed when in third-person, rather them just appearing out of thin air
---
What??
---
I‚Äôve been just southwest of the golf course forever it seems. 
---
I get ‚Äúattacked‚Äù maybe once every two weeks and it‚Äôs usually wolves or those green pea-colored Chinese bots. 
---
Do you have a lot of turrets?
---
Because theres only so many servers, and alot of popular CAMP spots. So you'll run into this problem. Easy solution is to move it to a location that's not so popular
---
No
---
May your child be blessed with all the best perk cards life has to offer.
---
Now fuck off and go be a dad.
---
I like nice shots and I cannot lie..
---
this is someone that's familiar with the lore
---
Let go of the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to keep everything just in case....‚Äù mentality. You don‚Äôt need a lot of junk. You used to need it to craft armor and weapons to scrap to learn mods. Now the best weapons have purchasable plans, and can‚Äôt be learned by scraping. So no need for huge amounts of junk. And the tent has limited value now too. You will be doing the daily grind, which reward caps that generally cover fast travel plus. And since you don‚Äôt need tons of junk, you won‚Äôt be weighed down with it, preventing fast travel and requiring that tent. Public teams make it easy to get a few free fast travel points if you feel to cheap to spend the caps.
---
Or at least make it so u join a different server 100%. My camps in a not very popular location and ive gotten 11 relogs in a row before
---
lvl 3! and grinding for that ammo thingy! not really. weather's too nice right now :)
---
Yeah I moved it to an unpopular location but it‚Äôs still a little annoying going in and out of the game only to be put in the same server 10 times in a row lol
---
Wait, they are supposed to be bullion-only rewards?
---
Geez, I am sitting on, like, 20 of each type. I never finished Wastelanders.
---
Its not hysteria. I trade for rare weapons and cosmetics via market76 discord, launch nukes, and modify my camp, and occasionally partake in events that is it. I am level 234 on my main character. I will not get anywhere near to max without doing those dumb challenges and I absolutely refuse to do them. I have nearly 800 hours in this game and I am done with arbitrary tasks. The time to have me grind for basic functionality is long past. I cannot even bring myself to max out my settler rep after getting raider, its just too damned tedious after weeks of daily logging in. 
---
My buddy and I play minion masters which is a card game auto-chess hybrid. Do you know how their 10 dollar season pass works that lasts 1 month? You play the game in any capacity, win or lose, no special instructions or builds or forcing you to do anything to get the rewards and each tier of reward is their paid currency, shards to craft cards, and power tokens you put back into the system to randomly unlock cards. You get this just by nature of paying 10 dollars and it has enough content given directly to you that you can make real meaningful progress doing whatever you want without feeling like you need to play 15 games a day every day for 3 months. They also have an achievement system based around more tedious tasks you can partake in voluntarily that award more. 
---
Grinding through lame specific achievements designed for new players like "scrap junk to produce concrete" or "collect wood" (something I have no motivation to do because I have all the concrete and wood I could ever use in a thousand camps) is not fun.
---
On mine he's already at the end.
---
They leave the 4th July up to the players as they are to lazy to make an event. Hence the crap in the Atomic Store this week...
---
Per color
---
Respect. I felt this too.
---
I've seen some players who are very good at communicating intentions with emotes, but otherwise if you really want to properly communicate, use the console's text chat which can be done by phone!
---
Traps are just a part of Fallout. Nothing you can do but stash before visiting other CAMPs.
---
But the hat cannot change bulb color, whereas the helmet can was the idea I was after.
---
They are not even repeatable fireworks. Lazy programming...
---
And if they do that i would have my level 5 alt with all the best stuff at the best prices. 
---
Player level means nothing. I've been to the camp of players over 100 and 200 and they've got 1* mutant slayer boards for 5000 caps. And i've been to the camps of players under 50 who had some fantastic pieces and wonderful prices. If you're so bothered why don't you look around the map for them.
---
You don't see the speaker if it's unplugged or muted before joining the match, if it's disabled you see a speaker with a cross on it. So no speaker they can still potentially hear you.
---
Yep. The plans are 150 from Mortimer at Friendly with Crater.
---
I'd rather just be able to see the inventory without going to their camp. Make it so all the machines are intertubed up and I can check them all from my own. Sure, it'll make it so whales can easily find and snatch up all the really good deals but I don't care. I just want to be able to locate specific "regular" stuff without travelling to 17 different camps. Plus, sometimes I'll throw killer deals in my own machine just to clear inventory and this would help the bargain hunters get to me sooner.
---
The sad thing is people _would_ want to do that if there was any kind of reason to team up for building.  You know, content.
---
Would be a waste of energy. There'd be better places for that anyways.

usually i do but this was pure laziness on my part. I was gonna go back with light footed and my stealth suit on to get the stuff back but then i couldn't be bothered. 
---
And i don't even know if light footed would have worked. Can you go into stealth while punji boards are stabbing you?
---
Lore-wise 76 was supposed to start repopulating the world right?  One look at deathclaw and every last one of us would be sprinting back inside.
---
You on PC?
---
I thought I was way far behind because I couldn't really play until Thursday night... And I'm skipping the NW stuff because I don't like NW... But I just hit rank 15. Just like everyone freaking out about the rep grind I really don't think all the people that "crunched the numbers" are very good at math.
---
Herbivore buffs plant foods to give twice the benefit, which is both very good for +int food like brain bombs (+8 int with buffs) and for xp buffing food (+25%xp with buffs)
---
Int does increase xp gain. You get *much* more xp with substantial amount of additional points in int so it's totally viable to play high-int char. (You can easily check it by putting on +int clothes and killing a super-mutant vs killing it without that piece if clothing) This is why I believe it's absolutely crippling to play high-health builds, the levelling process starts to take *so* much more time/resource-consuming process without unyielding/bloodied buffs to int (xp) and damage.
---
I did sacrifice some gun damage here (reallocating points from str to int) but a BE flamer got more than enough firepower even with 3 1* perks only, so it's quite a wortwhile tradeoff, I oneshot my main xp-suppliers (max lvl super-mutants) anyway.
---
Have you made a party?
---
You can by tweaking the ini files it also changes the pipboy lamp color as well as the pipboy display color
---
Tried that and nothing
---
Hmmm.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Nah.
---
They stated no stash space to do so!
---
"unable to play" "forced me to stop playing"
---
How? No one is forcing you to pick up or hoard every legendary you find. You know you can only get 150 scrip a day, so why keep amassing them?
---
Personally, I only keep more than a couple legendaries if I know I'm not going to be able to play on a given day. The only exceptions outside of vendors are 3*s that are weightless or I can throw Ultra-light on.
---
I've been blocking the players in my spot
---
glow in the dark wall paper is the only thing i want
---
Huh. Neat. I do not really want to keep my hands on the,, since they are heavy as shit, and I cannot sell them, so they are of no use to me.
---
What is the most looked for weapon or used weapon in fallout 76?
---
  I'm kinda new to it and I would like to try and get ahead.
---
im on ps4 lol
---
I like the black Combat Rifle Skin, even tho I didn't own one for over a year.
---
Everybody else goes back in all the time. What vile acts you've done you need to discuss with the Overseer yourself.
---
[removed]
---
You other players can‚Äôt deny
---
Me either. I've seen it on other people but when I take my brotherhood scribe outfit off(which hardly ever happens) my armor still looks beefy as hell.
---
&gt;	Can you go into stealth while punji boards are stabbing you?
---
I‚Äôve no idea. I‚Äôm a bloodied build so once that stuff hits I‚Äôm toast.
---
My goodness used a mutant Slayer shotgun at west Tek and sneaked the whole way and lost no health at all. Level 68 super mutants thanks for the tip
---
Yes
---
But does it say you have herd mentality in your list of effects? And is something not suppressing your mutations?
---
If your on pc I can give you a bunch. I have way to many.
---
It's not even in my list
---
All of them?
---
Nobody seems to be pointing out the obviously best reward which is the Jangles Backpack
---
I use t65 and I could care less about losing out on jetpack/emergency. I just use Emergency protocol with my 65. The high armor of 65 helps in pvp imo due to armor reduction not making you feel like paper.
---
The jet pack on SS is good enough if I want to fly around since Im mostly not in PA outside of events like project paradise or scorched earth.
---
Ouch :(
---
Hey, that cultist chick came on to me first. What happened with the Mothman eggs and the fires is definitely not my fault.
---
Huh? The backpack has never worked in PA and Gutsy's have always had anti armor rounds. I'm not even sure what the next few of your paragraphs are on about... But they don't have a limited camp size to fuck with you personally. In fact they're giving us instanced camps in the future so we can have a bigger budget. Also that gold bar encounter is not rare... You get it multiple times a session if you farm random encounter spots.
---
Nice idea
---
Haha thanks
---
lol test server.. whats the sense if everything is still broken anyway
---
You‚Äôre welcome! Only gets better, too. You‚Äôll be able to take out scorchbeasts on the ground in pretty quick order much the same as those mutants. Not being ‚Äòseen‚Äô allows for a lot of damage. My build is the same. Ranged and up close stealth.
---
Happened to me too, that sucks
---
Land with team mates. Stay with team mates. Let team mates down. Kill enemies. Revive team mates.
---
I‚Äôm at 15 without doing the NW challenges, but I had some time to grind this week. Not sure I‚Äôll make it all the way, but there aren‚Äôt many rewards I‚Äôm excited about.
---
What level is that?
---
Test server should be next week. Actual release should be August.
---
I don't think anyone is surprised Beth needs to patch a ton of bugs.
---
its such a minor thing but also my biggest gripe with the game.  all my TES/FO3+ games are modded with armed to the teeth/visible weapon mods so I can walk around the world looking like [this guy](https://i.imgur.com/qnzwUni.jpg)
---
Want the fireplace too but the grind is real, it's like one of the last rewards
---
Do you have other mutations?
---
Personally i run a flamer in my stealth build aside from other suppresed weapons, they are completely silent and do amazing damage, the downsides are how expensive the fuel is and how fast they break. I use a Legacy flamer with explosive effect as well as a bloodied/anti-armor one.
---
The Fixer is also amazing for this kind of build, try to get the plans for it for some good legendaries with the Purveyor
---
clownshoes
---
Get a head set and talk to your team that you want to get this done and you will help them with theirs afterward. 
---
Not hard at all. Find a cliff and jump into the loving arms of your companions.
---
Ok, what is your game tag for xbox and I will fiend you. I am Flash 126.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Looks like 86.
---
Oh and I want all the fireworks
---
Lol you don‚Äôt seem to understand the point of this post and for some reason you seem to take offense to it. Sure levels don‚Äôt matter for finding better items at better prices, it just makes sense to have a player icon + level + name literally beside the camp when you go over it. It doesn‚Äôt add any harm does it? I mean, not like it‚Äôll ruin your day now would it? You are pointlessly arguing a point when there‚Äôs literally no argument at all lol. It‚Äôs a QoL improvement and something that should just be there, it doesn‚Äôt have any negatives.
---
‚ÄúOverslept‚Äù or recently connected the alternate universe that Vault 76 accesses. Time is irrelevant in Appalachia. It‚Äôs like a time world that is frozen in time and just loops upon itself. You should join The Radio Network to learn more...
---
I bet it will stay. They need to at least somehow support their claim about "getting SCORE from events", so it'd be a logical thing to leave the ability to gain more score for xp. Still, I won't be surprised if they'll remove these challenges at some point (after two weeks by the time buying levels with atoms will unlock for example) to promote some more atom purchases from people who fear not to finish season in time.
---
Both...I thought it was gonna have some damage/energy resistance but it doesn't. Mainly bought it because I had plenty of gold and nothing else I wanted at the time, plus I like how it looks.
---
Ah, pc is absolute shit for pvp from what I hear. I‚Äôm on Xbox so we don‚Äôt get the hacks, we‚Äôre poor ü§£
---
I use the intel 5 perk card for guns to cut the degrade and can make several runs before I have to fix it.  As without that yeah it degrades super fast.
---
wat
---
I have two missle 1 heavy laser and 2 heavy machine turrets
---
Ya just did one on a full build team and didn't even get a ton of mobs in but I got a full 10k punch on the weekly for it. It is too bad I can rarely get or keep a full build team.
---
I wouldnt mind a new pvp event or something if done right, a settler vs raider thing or smth
---
There is alot of bad stuff happening for pvpers atm so would be nice if bethesda threw the pvpers a bone, hah
---
Doesn't matter. Pvpers got this same mentality. I know pvpers on xbox would hack as much as they can only if they could. Only thing that's stopping them is this platform they are on
---
Gz you but exactly what I ak talking about
---
Excavator, weight "fixed" 3 or 4 patches ago...
---
Ty for the info!
---
Yeah the raider shot was very linked to the event, but the shot before with the ¬´strongest will survive¬ª stuff just made me wonder 
---
Maybe we get an actual pvp event with attack defend objectives etc
---
I know this isnt a hat (though you can equip it with the mask) but the BOS hood makes it look so cool
---
Thanks for the tip! Funny, I looked it up a bit ago and I've actually been there before. I played last year until Level 35 or so and back then it was Crashed Space Station. Guess Bethesda made more changes than I thought
---
Does it ? Never knew
---
I lose track of corpses so I liked it while it lasted.  It seems to have gone away a few days after I got it?
---
Yeah i used to run it with the mountain scout outfit
---
This is happening to me too. Super frustrating. And simply walking somewhere else isn't a reliable a fix. If there are enemies near, the 15 second timer pops up, and then disappears immediately, and the whole fast travel just doesn't work.
---
Not that I know of. People just frown upon it because of how the people didn‚Äôt work for it
---
The raider hat with the horns looks good
---
Ah ok might have to get one
---
every game with a season pass
---
Why would there be?
---
What‚Äôs that ?
---
good idea i can't believe no one has posted this before [https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=pip%20boy%20light](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=pip%20boy%20light)
---
Blue combat helmet looks pretty cool. Though I don‚Äôt know if it still clips or not.
---
People do buy those ammo types from me so stop being so close minded.
---
Oh absolutely, we‚Äôve got plenty of them, they just end up fighting each other because everyone else avoids them. The only real exploits we‚Äôve got right now are the JE laser, the ammo glitch, and god mode stacking. Two of them are just annoying, the third is painfully obvious so it‚Äôs easy to avoid.
---
Just play the game mainly and if you have a stealth boy use it to revive one in the open. Chances are if you're on Xbox, im going to snipe you next if you try to revive your teammate.
---
Why‚Äôd you have to make confetti sound like something that‚Äôs exclusive to children? You don‚Äôt have to be 8 years old to enjoy confetti
---
Exactly, assault rifles and heavy weapons are arguably the best weapon types in the game far outdpsing even shotguns, yet they still insist on screwing over shotguns.
---
when you sprint with it out, the hand holding the gun's barrel floats under the barrel. it's really only noticeable at higher FOVs mine's around 90.
---
Sounds like you're a grumpy adult.
---
The fireplace door is cool, it's like a speakeasy type door for my hidden nukashine celer. Or just for my room haha. And I want that beer stein to collect at 6 when each one drops.
---
The game only figures out your location is taken once you're loaded in, so I just gives you the choice if you want to stay or not. A good way would be to be able to toggle on/off moving to another server if location is used until you get put on a server where your camp can be placed :)
---
Don't you have Starched Genes?
---
hopefully they allow us to put it on the fixer at some point, in fact all the combat rifle skins should be able to be applied.
---
There are tons and tons of good campsites on all parts of the map.
---
17, going on 18, almost legal baby.

I‚Äôm assuming you did get your score but you did not see the score increase. There is a bug on weekly that when you get half done with weekly you are given the score. 
---
Not once have I met a person who did not receive a score but all of them have had the same problem.
---
Next time list your legendary run rank before ranting. It makes it wether it‚Äôs believable or not.
---
I do but that doesn't affect serums as I have taken serums before with it on
---
Exactly
---
I had fun tossing em at the SBQ. Still no clue where I got em
---
Because the title was not long enough. Yeah. That's ridiculous. 
---
  How long of a title should I make it?
---
Can I get an example?
---
I think it‚Äôs more full time workers with families will probably have to spend atoms. It‚Äôs a huge time sink. No problem if you play for hours a day.
---
For real, dude. I get tired of micromanaging shooting enemies but not killing them so everyone has time to get xp. Especially legendaries.
---
Actually quite fun again imo. 
---
Lots of new places to explore with the wastelanders! Love that addition
---
Yea I skipped the nw stuff too and from what I herd its loging off while still in nw that caused the score bug so I'm avoiding it altogether
---
Beth2 sounds like the guy that came up with Wearing a Full Clown Suit for the old dailies.

---
Emissions? We driving across the wasteland now?
---
If you don't make a batcave after getting it, there's something wrong with you. üòã
---
Those look sick !
---
I understand it perfectly fine. You want a level next to someones name so you can judge them based on that. And i'm saying that would make no difference.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Know how this bug is caused though?  I'll probably buy the recipe instead to add to my collection
---
same for me last thing I need is the jacket but it seems like it taking forever, unlocked everything else what feels like a while ago already.
---
So let's end pvp once and for all cause pc players don't want to get screwed over amusement of console users aight? I don't want pvp and many people don't want them. You might think it's a good addition in the game cause you are quite invested on it and want to make the most out of it but most players really don't like pvp cause they suck balls. And trust me, if you get many players participating, you will lose your edge quickly cause people are gonna find out all the tricks and exploits you've been using the whole time and will catch up fast then end up destroying you
---
Another tip that someone put me on is the sentry bots at whitspring resort  with above buff and 4 pieces of unyielding I was getting 1.9k exp per bot and theres usually 4
---
Note I'm using this https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/449
---
Changes the look of the forest and scout mask. The one I have equipped is the forest.
---
Legacies have significant performance differences and can no longer be acquired legitimately, thus they are the most heavily duped legendary.
---
Oh ok I‚Äôm on PS4 so never got mods
---
new in the atom shop P.A.I.N.T.
---
Use P.A.I.N.T to color your gear any single color you want. P.A.I.N.T. is a single use cosmetic, 100 atoms each. and comes in 4 different colors with new colors coming \[redacted\]
---
I dunno seems more like that whole "only the strong will survive" was immediately before "a colossal problem" event.
---
Same, one of the ones im most looking forward too
---
You could idk make your camp the way you want it.
---
First of all, confetti are awesome üéâ 
---
And second, if you want to disable gibbing add ‚ÄúbDisableAllGore=1‚Äù in [General] in Custom.ini Makes it way easier to spot the bodies.
---
just buy all of them, tis what i did
---
This accurate
---
Eeeh. We should reach 45-55 in the first 3 weeks but then every level will require a whole day worth of challenges. I think the over privileged unyielding will be done between the 7th and 8th week. The rest will make it just in time. I wouldn't mind using some atoms for the last 5 levels ,if I feel like taking a break.
---
As someone who has the scrapbox, I can tell you you will likely still face major Stash issues regardless. Im currently struggling again with space.
---
Adrenal reaction, twisted muscles, scaly skin, empath, herd mentality, bird bones, eagle eyes, carnivore, herbivore. 
---
I'd probably go with empath and herd first.  https://imgur.com/2vg9uFa
---
best part of digital confetti, no clean up.
---
Yeah because 40 is legit ok...
---
Or maybe he could be riding a sit down mower, drinking wine out of a Pringle‚Äôs can
---
I'm getting on in a minute, you still available?
---
The sink - except it produced dirty water.
---
The ammo converter - very poor ui
---
Sheepsquatch Plushie - just hope it can be placed anywhere
---
Firefly Lamp - will it be bright enough for general use? 
---
Chicken coop - with or instead of the Brahmin pen? (pen! Trough is more accurate, it's just a wheelbarrow and hay) 
---
Little else excites me as I can't get excited about armour and weapon skins. I can't even go 'whoop' when I get atoms as I know it's a half or less of what I would have earned pre-seasons in the same time span.
---
You did the same thing I did - bought the recipies for the mutations you use.
---
After that, theres the caps for bullion sink...all the PA mod plans....
---
I‚Äôve alos bought out plans at vendors, to include Graham.
---
eventually I guess I will but i wanted to focus on the more sought after ones first
---
Agreed
---
Why do you think you don't have the mutation? Did you check your special points in and out of a team?
---
I did
---
I've bought them all and it surprises me how varying people are in what they want. For example you'd figure empath would be one of the least used, but I cant keep it stocked @ 399 ea.
---
Speed demon/marsupial/carnivore/herbivore seem to be the hottest though.
---
Oooo.  Different colored Mr. Fuzzy outfits.  Sign me up!
---
Yes can't wait to pay 500 atoms or $5 to change my pipboy to blue...
---
Helvetia will pretty much get you all the wood you need for it.
---
Herd mentality and empath are more popular now since the grouping system update. Before adrenal reaction, herb, carn, monsupial.
---
Twisted and talens for melee.
---
Eagle eyes for guns. 
---
And the 2 defense mutations. 
---
Basically most are sought after
---
well, personally after i got those 3, i went for Adrenal reaction, Scaly Skin, and Grounded next. following that i did Egghead, Eagle eyes, Bird Bones, and Twisted Muscles. then i proceeded with the rest. took a while
---
Is it suppressed? If it is, what until the suppression ends and check again.
---
I'm just making dinner but I'll be on in like half an hour :)
---
Problem with that is some meats are used in multiple recipes.
---
Thats interesting because I would have put Empath on bottom of my list too but another poster suggested it too so maybe Ill rethink that one. Thanks for the suggestions
---
"I have come to terms with the Barbie's playhouse minigame some people play within FO76. I don't judge."

Cool, message me on xbox when you get back on GT: DaRapuano
---
I have 40 minutes left, just tried another,  different serum and nothing again
---
I have completed all the daily's except the NW one every day this week.  I'm sitting at rank 12 with 500 to go to the next rank. If you can earn 1750 a day with daily's, you might be right and some of them dinged but didnt notify me. I still think I'm off a few thousand though, given 8750 for daily's and 6500 for weekly's so far completed.
---
You want 80 atoms? Then do that 7600 times!
---
I'm at 5.5k in over 2k hours.
---
Then have it be a public group type.
---
Xp shared between team members within x distance.
---
Need MFGA on a red hat lol
---
yeah it may lack some things and details that other games do well, i will agree. 
---
But overall I‚Äôm pretty satisfied. But yeah I hear you. Don‚Äôt think the photo mechanic is used by many haha
---
It's not hard to collect wood 25 times. It worked the same back when we had weekly challenges wanting 250 wood.... That was a pain to do.
---
Not to mention the safety issues:
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tDedpreZH-0
---
Yeah, annoying as I initially jumped to a logging camp. Quickly realised my error when 25 didn't complete so I nipped off to Helvetia where one pile alone gives 6 collections.
---
Many people through my childhood but i don't paste through reddit.
---
Yeah, move to a safer location and get rid of all those. That‚Äôll give you so much more budget for an addition to your camp or more decorations
---
It might be bugged while suppressed. I think I might have noticed that the other day. Patience :-)
---
What is this content thing you speak of? Lol.
---
Just fill up as much as you can because you'll run out eventually. Make as much stable flux as you can.
---
Was just watching a 2 minute video about this, they afk to level there accounts to sell for real money there's normally 3 people. Here's the video: https://youtu.be/-G-e1rGeuhI
---
The pip boy skins should at least change the colours of the font to match them
---
Thanks!  This is a weird bug... Wonder when it started
---
How many people do you need to revive for that?
---
Crabs and lobsters travel all over the ocean so I don‚Äôt see why the crawlers can‚Äôt
---
Yup that looks about right for score. Don‚Äôt forget that score increases per rank so the rank your at is believable.
---
ADK, like others, I just started using it.
---
I‚Äôm looking for some help on xb1
---
2 months and only 1 uny is for sure terrible RNG.
---
Im probably a bit crazy for saying it but I dont even know that I care too much about the bullion. I already got the 2 x main things I wanted (dirt tile and ammo maker). I dont feel like I need another weapon. The Fancy shotgun suits my combat needs and I have a decent enough heavy gun. Im already struggling for stash space so I dont want to carry guns I may not use often anyway. The armor I have serves my needs. I will likely get the SS armor next because I need to spend the bullion on something but im in no rush. Im one of those annoying people that dont like change for change sake.  If it ain't broke, dont fix it is my motto. Exchanging treasury notes is fine enough for grinding for me. 
---
Buying up plans from Vendors is something Ive been doing lately though.
---
Nature's pocket
---
There are ways to get accounts much cheaper than that actually. Got an additional one for 6$ about a month and a half ago.
---
I saw that challenge and just accepted I won‚Äôt get those points today
---
LMG is a heavy weapon, it doesn't benefit from commando. That said, it's an absolute buzz saw and outperforms a handmade 10/10 times. It's also a nightmare to craft ammo for.
---
All the grenades are shit in 76 anywayü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That‚Äôs always my number one on my mod list
---
Thanks for the suggestions!
---
The reason they dropped it for 4 is they said working with each unique combination of weapons and mods would takes lot to prevent clipping with all the various outfits and armours.
---
Like the movie Get Hard with Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell lol
---
Nice, i run 15 int with full unyielding armor and but never knew it boosted that. Ill have to switch from being a cannibal raider to an herbivore lol. Random, but does this effe t leader bobble heads?
---
Do you brush your teeth before or after the actual bootlicking?
---
arrrgh. It'll cost ye atoms. Give us the booty and you can have selected colors. Im'a guess 500 atom, arrrgh!   
---
point is, Bethesda are a bunch of pirates that rob you of your money just to make the game slightly different.
---
ive got a question ,  ive unlocked cryo arrow    as well as cryo frame.  
---
where do i make this cryo frame bow ???
---
Ohhh ok. Thanks. Recently switched from a heavy weapon build so I already have those perks
---
The board rewards 1500 atoms so if you save all of them everyone can buy the last 10 legs for free
---
Thanks for the suggestions. And yeah itll take me a while too but its good to have a plan lol
---
I play on medium settings with 8gb ddr3, Gtx 750 ti 2gb and amd fx 6100 3.3ghz. With minor stutter some times. I'm already level 123
---
ya burns through ammo like the 50 and minigun, without being able to craft the ammo by the 100s
---
30 hours? Is that accurate?
---
Lol no you don‚Äôt understand it all, you are saying ‚Äúit makes no difference and if you really cared, then go look for them on the map‚Äù. Think about how stupid that is especially since you have to look for small dots on the screen which sometimes don‚Äôt show up because of fast travelling, when it could‚Äôve been a simple addition of the player icon + level beside their camp. It‚Äôs called a QoL improvement and there‚Äôs no negatives behind it. Plus hence why i said it‚Äôs minor, I know it won‚Äôt change things drastically, it just gives you an idea of the camps and vendors. I would always try going to camps that have a bunch of items/know that it‚Äôs high level before I check out all the other ones, so many people hop servers so you usually you don‚Äôt have a lot of time to check some camps out.
---
I get crappy frames, but that can probably be attributed to the integrated Intel HD-4600.
---
Seems to be the pattern in others suggestions too. Thanks for the suggestions!
---
It can be the same person I just need to revive them around 15 times, The easiest way is to get them to take off there armour then they rush into some scorched or blood eagles.
---
It could be for a bloodied biuld if the guy has no life
---
Sure
---
Have marsupial going to get speed demon
---
That too didn't work : (
---
I have that at least once a week. That happens depending on your connection and the games server stability. Stuff like that is bound to pop up now and again.
---
Are you still down?
---
Imagine a world where people use the search function and this sub has actual useful information instead of wall to wall BETH PLLLLLZXZZ
---
If its for both I may buy it.
---
This site has way worse stuff then anything in fo76.
---
It happens occasionally. Sometimes they'll fully render in but won't do anything and can't be killed, and their great for taking selfies with.
---
White springs?
---
I think you nailed it with the bulider team being misunderstood.  With the name, I was thinking you had to build stuff.
---
 It can be the same person I just need to revive them around 15 times, The easiest way is to get them to take off there armour then they rush into some scorched or blood eagles.
---
I get between 30- 40 fps, a little less right after fast travel
---
1 foundation and 2 sets of stairs and a teammate that knows wtf you're doing
---
Add me, my name is my name on here, I'll take one for the team

I‚Äôm in psn piazzaroy
---
If you are dead set on switching to rifles just start acquiring the perks now, then when you get to 50 you can start to move your special points accordingly. You should know tho that your heavy gun build might not feel great right now but once your in end game and aquire all the perks the build really starts to perform amazing, as does rifles but the issue with rifles is you most of the time you rely on sneak attacks so when you are playing in a group the build suffers from it, still performs fine but it deff takes a hit.
---
It will cost a 12 month subscription to fallout first and an extra 1500 atoms per color
---
Complains about not getting enough free shit? Check.
---
Complaints about something being not cosmetic, not because it creates a competitive advantage, but because you want everything free(but make up some bullshit about p2w in a non competitive game to hide the whine)? Check 
---
Talks about how games used to be....... And seems to forget that 76 offers free DLC in a time when that's virtually non existent? Check.
---
Can't quit crying about an entirely optional, fake currency? Check.
---
Yup. Whiny and Entitled.
---
i found super duper,hard bargain and travel agent to be really good. 
---
super duper has a chance to get double of what you craft,hard bargain reduces the prices and NPC vendors and travel agent reduces the cost of fast travel by 30%

Server hopping for events.

Bloody mess, class freak, and starched genes for luck. Anything else just have fun trying different perks.
---
Think of a serum or some other optional in game mechanic you don't like. Then picture Bethesda saying "Here it is for an hour. It's fun you will enjoy it" Then you ask if it can be removed and voice your displeasure and I come along and say "You're grumpy" lol.

I don't have a lot of time to play lately, I try and be efficient with my time though. Server hop Ward, stop for SBQ and Radiation Rumble.
---
I'm probably on for about an hour a day during weekdays, 2 hrs a day on weekends.
---
It lasts for an hour real time. If you play 30 minutes and log out then log in 2 days later it still lasts the other 30 minutes. I wish it was disease curable.
---
Thanks. I have a hard time judging.

I'm level 194 if that's what you're asking?

Sent it

I‚Äòll just lock it and use it as a fireplace lol
---
Uh no I just hit replay and I do not know why that showed up.
---
All of the bullion items should be tradeable. It's especially egregious with the legendary weapons and armor. You could craft dozens of items before getting the right one, or even just settling for "close enough". The only thing you can do with the "extras" currently is turn them into scrip. This is exceedingly tedios, and thanks to the daily limits, can also take several days.
---
This is interesting. I'm going to try it out. Sucks because I'm ok with gore I just hate when the entire body explodes. It's like trying to find that one tiny piece of the bloatfly so it can be looted. I hate looking and searching just to loot 3 pieces of ammo.
---
Do you like the Season idea? 
---
I feel like I'm going to get annoyed with it in a month or so. Being told what to do with the few hours I get to play kind of defeats why I started playing fo76.
---
Tested it, it does not seem to work
---
But any competent build is doing that now
---
Unless you actually want new low level players to visit your camp and have items that are at their level that they can afford
---
Fill that box with as much shit as possible. 
---
You want to fill it with all the stuff people need for making ammo. Steel, Lead, Acid, Cloth.. whatever i''m forgetting. That way if you fall on hard times (in fallout 76) you can sell stuff. Trade things for flux instead of caps. 
---
Use this pre wastelander guide to get ALL the things.  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)

Lead weights in the charleston firestation and green county lodge. Do that at least once a day and soon you'll be swimming in lead. 
---
Capture all the workshops. I got to 14 while levelling an alt before the game booted me.
---
ALSO! you can use your private server to move stuff between characters. I wouldn't do anything TOO valuable though. Just incase.
---
There‚Äôs a tool someone posted that shows you your pace. Wish I saved the link
---
Sorry if this sounds rude but I simply do not believe your hours/rank. It mathematically does not add up with the dailys/weekly challenges or score.
---
Lmao. Ad hominem attacks still don‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre correct.
---
I enjoy confetti. Popping balloons in the fasnacht parade was one of my favourite things.  I just don't like every enemy in the game turning into fasnacht balloons.
---
Pretty sure you can't mod alien blaster into rifle variant in fo4...
---
Dirty water? Now I'm kind of relieved that I haven't got enough budget for it. Definitely still want the wallpaper though. My character has two kids whose room is scouts/outdoors themed and it'll be great for their room.
---
youcan, just go to yourpc/documents/game/Fallout76/Fallout76.ini
---
It probably would‚Äôve been better as a skin. As for the animations... while it may look like a baton, remember, it‚Äôs called the ‚ÄúInvader‚Äù. It‚Äôs not a baton. It‚Äôs for aliens to do what aliens are so often said to do...
---
The combat knife thrusts.
---
Seems like it went downhill...
---
Same, a bit annoyed that the little time I have to play is planned out for me.
---
I would have rather seen more added content, specifically more events like Radiation Rumble.
---
I think it's pretty clear they're saving this to sell to us later.
---
It‚Äôs something to do with enemies respawning after being turned to ash or goo piles.
---
For real. Only one is the one from the encryptid event that‚Äôs gotta be the hardest 1v1 in the game
---
How do you even turn the light on?
---
stealth unarmed build with meat hook and a shadowed wooden armor ( or a chinese stealth armor if you don't mind faming nuclear mats, ballistic fibers and circuits), you'll need only steel to repair the meat hook and wood to repair your armor and cook your meat buffs, maybe few mats here and there.
---
I presume it's to do with the weapon modding system, since that means there are now hundreds of weapon models in the game, but honestly seeing a rifle floating 2 inches off my back and a pistol hovering vaguely near my hip never really added much for me.
---
Events have gone nuts lately! 
---
I logged out of my main and back in on an alt to try and get the level up challenge done for the day. I joined a Building team (because the +INT is better for XP) and then soon after someone else in the team came over and dropped a big bunch of plans in front of my level 7 toon. I love this game sometimes.
---
Yea, the original post said it's now the seat of the poorest county in the state.
---
Hit 19 earlier today during lunch. Might have another 45min tonight to grind some more, but I'm usually just so exhausted.
---
they arent really there
---
My gal rocks the straitjacket, combined with the shoddy undercut and blocky face paint across the eyes, I love how manic it looks. Gives me Mad Max: Thunder Road vibes
---
On PSN you can, I don't know about xbox but I imagine you can.
---
I don't see why you wouldn't be able to. But then again they don't let you gift someone atomic dollars so I don't know.

Hawt! Let me know when you're 21, we can crack open a Nuka Dark.

You can change the colour values in the Prefs file. Make sure it's read only or the game will default them.

What, whats that? You want another re-skin of the suit and shorts outfit, you got it.

Dude, this is why we build camps! Nice job!
---
I spend all my scrip on SS armor since it dropped and im still short one unyielding piece. All my other pieces were good 3 stars at 1. unyielding role tho
---
Definitely, mods on PC are a perfect example of that...
---
The more int you have, the more base xp you will have for any %-based buffs (like leader bobbles, cranberry foods, well-rested buffs, lunchboxes, double/triple xp weekends and such) which ends up to scale quite nicely. With 69 int under berry mentats/brain bombs/cranberry relish/well rested I get 2200+xp from a max lvl sentrybot/deathclaw/behemoth and about 640xp from a max lvl super-mutant.
---
Can‚Äôt you do that in the system files?
---
Anyone have any idea about the cryptic communication discussed in the last paragraph?
---
They do not, send about 6 messages and all in got was a sorry.
---
It does clip at the brow but it‚Äôs still noice
---
Some ppl like jumping to other people‚Äôs camp and see how they build compared
---
To yours. They look at how some unique methods to make a camp more tidy or unique. 
---
I had someone message me about how they liked the idea of using one of the certain roofs to make a small opening to pull a wire through and thanked me. I only received a message like this once though lol.
---
Go into game chat and ask them if they can down themselves so you can get the revive. People are usually more willing to help than not
---
Only like two cave spots left and they are highly contested to have your camp there.
---
*starts sweating with the number of rifles I have*
---
Sure- it's just the idling that seems new to me. Wasn't sure if they wanted me to join their public team or were trying to summon people.
---
Just want around the forest and you‚Äôll find enough in no time
---
Oh maybe it was a mod then
---
Woah man what happen to the pen is mightier than the nuclear warhead? #makelovenotwar
---
+karma
---
On the record: now digging this ‚Äúsuit‚Äù out of storage so I can be noticed. Bombs away!
---
Warframe nightwaves can be completed in 1/3 of the event duration while skipping the majority of dailies.
---
Oh thank you!  I'm such a newb I just started playing a few weeks ago.  Balls deep in this game but don't want to look into builds or anything and take away from the wonder of it all.  Casual shitter approach. 
---
Is there a way to track corpses you haven't looted?  I've lost a few legendaries or boss types before because I'm bad
---
take a bunch of workshops and put scavenger bots there.
---
Automatic for overall being more economically viable and has actual mods for the weapon, lmg if you're not a loser
---
God yes, if they maybe provided a new wheel that allowed you to assign 1 two handed weapon (except heavies), pistol on your right hip and 1 handed meele on your left hip that would be great. Since it would be purely aesthetic as well I cant see it causing any problems,
---
Warframe is free to play and everything can be earned in game with relative ease, not to mention that premium currency is tradable and is earned easily trading parts and mods to other players.
---
Why not just have the plans make regular ones and only the folks that know the plans get legendaries added to the drop pool same as the fixer or the bear arm.
---
"I find the idea preposterous. Preposterous I say!"
---
*Pulls down The Dragon sitting above the mantel.
---
"However, I am not one to shy away from good sport!"
---
Thats wild wtf, I get 317 without the lunchbox?? r u below lvl 100 by any chance?
---
What the hell dude that‚Äôs  ridiculously over powered
---
Ah that's a shame...looks hopping in the 40s...
---
Relax, I'm at 13.
---
If you could just get a can of Raid and...yeah...
---
Tru
---
Combat rifle skin. Woo hoo
---
So what exactly is ita build team does ? So you just build at your camp for xp?
---
There should definitely be an option in the main menu to view other peoples shots and upload your own and save them to your own reel.
---
So basically between 1 and 2 months, if this last """june""" update was any indication.
---
So by my calculations you should be at... rank 19.
---
It‚Äôs a skin. It‚Äôs a combat knife. It used combat knife mods. The crafting is weird but it has exact same stats as a combat knife. It‚Äôs not it‚Äôs own weapon.
---
Still need help?
---
Sorry, no. But there are others here that are open!
---
Two lessons most people playing this game never learn.
---
1. Just because it exists doesn't mean you have to pick it up.
---
2. Just because you picked it up does not mean it needs to be sold.
---
Agree except for my TS Auto Grenade Launcher... it brings ALL the BOOMS!
---
Just not a as fast or easy as some would like, and that‚Äôs my point.
---
why don't you ask someone to make you one?
---
They're just playing on the board game theme.
---
Unfortunately there is not. Once you get to be a high level with good gear you can run up, kill em, loot em then kill the next. If you kill everything in one shot it can be a nightmare finding them. If you wait a while their corpse turns into a pile with flies flying around it and if you stop and look you can see the flies. That trick works good even in water(as long as the water isn't too deep you can still see the flies above the water)
---
I'm like you. Getting close to level 400 and I have never made any kind of build. I have a mix of cards that I like and off I go. But yeah if you can survive, best way to do things is kill, loot, kill, loot, kill, loot. 
---
Welcome to Appalachia Newb! See you in the wastelands my friend.
---
On xbox, hold down B button. Other platforms I don't know. Ultra bright headlamp on miner helmet is a godsend in dark areas. Its better than daylight.
---
plans do make regular ones 
---
or am i reading this wrong
---
Honestly if a group of modders with the same numbers as Bethesda studios wanted to make a fo game with the fo4 engine they would make fo76 look horrible
---
Lighting in a lot of areas in FO76 is horrible.

Hunting rifle plans i believe can be bought at any train station vendor. As well as are giving out as random rewards. Pump action shotgun plans can be gotten from the grafton day and the protest march up event up in grafton. 
---
Events are pretty good for weapons plans as well scrap like screws and aluminum. 
---
 I recommend shopping at player vendors for plans. Most the time you‚Äôll get them cheaper. For example the powerfist plan is easily 1,000 caps at whitesprings but iv seen it frequently for 200 caps. 
---
If you didn‚Äôt know this allready you can learn mods from scrapping weapons and can craft those mods to weapons without the plans. The plans just let you craft the actual weapon. I believe it works the same with armor mods.
---
I've been doing it since B.E.T.A. and not been banned. So I would say it's safe.
---
Totally agree with this. It's part of my circuit. Fast leveling and legendary loot.
---
I went out my to get a bloodied combat rifle only to realise it doesn't have a drum mag... then it clicked combat shotgun has the drum mag
---
I second this
---
I've been doing it since the beta and I havent been banned yet. Only pushback I've ever gotten from Bethesda is a forced name change
---
That would be nice. The more stuff PVP players have to do, the less of them will be bothering me in adventure mode lmao
---
Call me Snake
---
Ive never killed a mob that gave more caps tho
---
But that means Bethesda will have to actually make frequent quality content instead of shitty suit and shorts re skins on the atomic shop..
---
Oh. Yes please. In every freaking color imaginable. That's worth all my atoms. Please don't add any of those useless skins for weapons. Nobody wants them. Especially if you made those skins awesome and unique, that would totally suck.
---
Agreed.  Especially if it's for a build you don't run.  Like I'm a Junkies build so blooded is useless to me but there's tons of people who'd want it.
---
I honestly think I‚Äôm the one who should be pissed. I pay the $15 a month and what do I get... same as you but now I can collect all the scrap I want. Same event issues, same 1 shot kill issues. Same same same. I‚Äôm the one not getting what I pay for and still doesn‚Äôt bother me. Pay or no pay your choice.
---
You sound just like The Overseer, nuking you as well.
---
WarFrame has its own series of issues. 
---
Vaulting of the Prime frames absolutely blows. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily agree with the phrase ‚Äúrelative ease‚Äù with regards to WarFrame. But, technically, yeah. 
---
The premium currency situation is dicey, as well. When I left that game, the situation was anyone who got caught with currency that had purchased with a ‚Äúchargeback‚Äù-ed amount could get those currency automatically removed from their accounts, and if resulting in a negative balance, then you had to pay their market rate to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù your account with currency you had absolutely nothing to do with. 
---
I adore that game, but it is not an easy grind to unlock everything, and, yeah, they still have tons of issues. 
---
Locking weapon blueprints behind limited time events only available for sale at clan dojo‚Äôs was absolute bullshit. Having to HAVE to be in a clan to actually get access to half of the shit in the game without having the ability to leave your clan chat channel? Yeah. No. That was some awful design decisions.
---
I know there were a few posts here showing players using glitches (god mode) to run through all 100 levels.
---
Is it normal for that bond level not to be above my own gamertag?  I am unsure if I am earning bond with the team or not.
---
Hopefully they get banned and rewards stripped from their accounts.
---
Wait I'm a noob.  If someone nukes my camp do I get cancer and does insurance cover rebuilding?
---
I have been trying for a decent uny chest, over 60 attempts later I have only got one 1 star uny piece ...
---
The gauss shotgun, minigun, and pistol are no-drop legendary crafts.
---
That ain‚Äôt happening, chief. 
---
It is a nice thought, though.
---
No lifers?
---
A YouTuber I follow (not sure if it's okay to give the name) does a really great episode on duping in Fallout. I really didn't know it was such a big thing. It's really disappointing. But I assume most people prefer the fun of earning gear over cheating the system.
---
I'm just gonna make the brotherhood recon rifle. They take the same mods as the hunting rifle but they come pre-modded.
---
As long as it‚Äôs above everyone else‚Äôs you are getting The bond level, your own bond level can‚Äôt be with yourself which is why it‚Äôs not there
---
Box wine my friend. We still keep it classy down here.
---
To each his own I suppose.  
---
I personally am not a fan of the Mothman Camp stuff but I know there are some Raider Roleplayers who have that fit their aesthetic perfectly.  
---
Just because it isn't relevant to me, doesn't mean I'm just going to complain about it. Having diversity of items for CAMPs is important.
---
No need to. They look very nice in game.
---
BOOM .. BOOM .. BOOM  ...... plink .. plink .. plink ..  WTF!!!!!!!!ü§£üòÇüò™
---
I actually enjoyed the fact that I was gonna be some bloated glowing ones lunch at some point in time. Second character plays so much quicker because you‚Äôve learnt from your mistakes. Nice handmedowns is pretty sweet too.
---
Maniacle Dad chuckle
---
"Roll tape!"
---
So it goes on the combat
---
I thought you were just talking about gauss rifles. 
---
Shotgun is unreal. Can murder almost anything easily. Has a problem with missing in vats though. But you get used to it. Easy on the ammo as well. 
---
Minigun. Don't have one but i know it kicks all sorts of bum. BUT it uses a LOT of ammo. 
---
Pistol. No idea.
---
Just in case, zooming in/out near the location I want to fast travel sometime helps me
---
Pink suit/pink suit and shorts 4 life!
---
So don't do it then. 
---
You could have got 20000 xp and earned 200 points EASILY in that time.
---
How pointless is a secret door anyway?
---
Based off of the trailer there will be limited time "event/quests" related to season. Building the  Atlas Observatory is a prime example. As those who play after the BOS arrive won't of had the experience of contributing to the construction of the base.
---
If I can't find a body I'll just wait a few minutes for the flys to show up and that usually shows where it is in tall grass.
---
I ended up putting my weapon away and it let me port. I wonder if that works to?
---
Oh well.
---
Agreed.  All of these are just arm twists to get people to play NW longer.  I'll do the easy ones and skip the ones like today.
---
There are those times when you look at a challenges and just say to yourself ‚Äútuck that‚Äù and move on.
---
Big Copper?
---
Just be prepared for another delay.
---
I'll have to try that out. Thanks.
---
Something came up I‚Äôll be pre occupied tonight but I can totally add you and give you a couple tomorrow. Gt is StoicChimera
---
Indeed they will, kind of like how fo76 feels exactly like fo4 with all the good player made mods.. rolled into one. Including fo4mmo mod on PC. That's why I will never submit one of my own mods, no copyright means free content to use, no holds barred.
---
15. Only did 1 nw. The rest from weekly, dailies and usual grind.
---
You could have spent one hour grinding XP and gotten the 250 score.  I can get that much in about 35 minutes.  Ignore the BS nw dailies and just do the easy ones.
---
Try Wasteland1-3, it sounds perfect for you and is the forerunner to Fallout.
---
Just like when you step into a bus or park your bike you will not know if your usual spot is taken when you leave from home.
---
Just get on a mic and ask someone to help, plenty of cliffs available
---
Cheats/exploit. Really the best thing you can do at this point is report the player.
---
The contest could be pissing on the floor and there will always be at least someone who HAS to be the best at it.
---
yeaaaaaaaa
---
I've never seen anyone actually building. People just use it because each point of int gives +2% xp.
---
Far Harbor was in Maine, though, wasn't it?
---
Yes this, and also it is preferable for the ammo casing to eject away from you and not into your face (as I believe someone mentioned earlier).
---
I haven‚Äôt tested this but I‚Äôll give it a look. 
---
It takes a hard mentality to play 76 through all these bugs doesn‚Äôt it? üòÖ
---
Not sure What You're talking about regarding the currency, personally have not had a issue. 
---
Primed frames beeing rotated a bunch now and is pretty cheap to buy from other players or from the store itself for maybe 20 bucks.
---
Iirc the only timed exclusive weapons for dojos was the ignis wraith, also dojos are pretty good and offer some great features, most clans let you join and take the bleuprints and you can just leave. 
---
I made my own dojo and it took about 2 weeks to research everything.
---
Warframe is doing a lot better than Fallout 76 and not by a small amount, devs listen to player feedback, give us updates and streams with upcomming content and they actually fix critical bug where bethesda is taking well over a year to just fix 1 bug.
---
Earning platinum is really easy though, players can run void relics for prime parts that can sell for a decent amount of platinum or get lucky with a nice riven and sell That for a few hundred or thousand platinum
---
Sure it's not 100% perfect but for a f2p it's delivering paid triple A quality. Bethesda can learn a lot from DE.
---
True though
---
What score exploit(for research purposes) this is a joke
---
score exploit? üëÄ
---
You miss it really.
---
Happy fasnacht....merry fasnacht
---
Lol. You just cracked me up.
---
Yeah but you need to find the mod or the plans for the different colors. My second character has a tactical red one
---
Theyll prob get banned. The worst offense a Fallout 76 player can make is mess with Zenimaxs money.
---
Yes 
---
25%
---
Yeah. This, a high INT base, full set of unyielding at low health and some Chema will literally have you swimming in xp. 
---
In the recent triple XP event it was actually laughable.
---
I only mind my spot taken if their camp building skills are on the abysmal and/or lazy side of things. If it‚Äôs a well built camp I‚Äôll usually check it out, give props or buy something.
---
I would‚Äôve been fine to just get a white or yellow light on the pipboy. The miners helmet isn‚Äôt practical when you need protection from diseases
---
As soon as the matched started I sinply said: Im trying to do the Score challenge, any one that can hear me emote. One guy did and jumped from a cliff so I could rez him twice. Afterwards I was able to finish the match in 3rd place, unlocking the glowing skeleton suit. Overall, a good day for nw.
---
You can't VATS other players, my main issue is that it's always who is super optimized on their build and one shotting me, someone using an explosive energy weapon, or someone using a limb dmg auto telsa. It's never about skill in pvp not even in NW, I'm rank 26 and have like one dmg card and since weapons are random it makes it difficult to even use properly.
---
Don‚Äôt see why you should care
---
I'd carry the handmade for daily stuff, it doesn't use a ton of ammo and Vats cost is low.  Against tanks, the LMG will absolutely destroy most everything if you can keep it aimed.  VATS is a no go with the LMG.  AP runs out if you move your finger anywhere near the trigger.
---
Both are great in their own way, but if I had to pick only one it would be the handmade for it's utility and still has great DPS.
---
Totally agree. The green light gives me a headache if I have to leave it on for more than a few minutes at a time :(
---
I actually crafted a 3 star Junkie's Gauss Minigun. Also has +10% damage and faster speed while aiming. 
---
This is one of those situations where I feel we could trade weapons and both leave happy, but Bethesda's against it for some odd reason. I honestly think being able to sell and trade the items would be a great incentive in grinding towards accquiring them. As is you're just grinding to unlock another grind. It's why I gave up when I got a 1 star bloodied Gauss minigun and a 1 star unyielding secret service chest piece. I was tired of staring at the crafting menus so often.
---
Its on the 9th of july. Make sure you stock up.
---
why didn't you just ask someone to help? the first squad I got, I asked for help and we all took turns jumping off cliffs and reviving
---
Trade  and drop bullion items? But that would just let players skip the grind. Maybe if both parties have the plan unlocked then sure.
---
sir that is called being on fire
---
This is exactly what I would have typed.  Good advice.  I'll add that you can farm locations, and as long as 10 minutes has passed since your last kill at a location you can log off and back onto the same private server and the mobs will have respawned.  Great for farming XP.
---
For real ?
---
Well thats a fair point, but that armor look!
---
Beauty is pain after all.
---
Yep, but we got ours üòÜ
---
any source where they say you have to pay? 
---
Fairly sure when first playing the game it stated once a workshop is owned its a free fast travel point like your camp. Have seen it in online guides too. I don't know anyone who paid to travel to a workshop they owned
---
But with class freak 3 there's no negative effects so it wouldn't matter
---
***inserts "this is fine" meme***
---
The foreskin
---
That all depends on your GPU.  I'd say a GTX750 or so is the minimum for a good experience.  I have a 1060 6gb and mine runs flawlessly.
---
I also had this happen once a few weeks ago (during Fasnacht).
---
I‚Äôm not arguing with any of those points. 
---
I just know that WarFrame vaulting rotation isn‚Äôt good for my mental health and I had to step away. The amount of keys, orbs, void bleh bleh bleh to keep trying to run the right void nodes was just exhausting and I had WAY more time to devote than an average gamer. 
---
If you don‚Äôt mind spending, it‚Äôs fine. Trading is meh. I didn‚Äôt care for it, but vending machine bugs haven‚Äôt seem to go away here either. 
---
As for clans, yeah they‚Äôre not generally too bad, but honestly the ignis wraith was one of the strongest weapons in the game, leaving it locked behind clans was a cruddy move. And yeah, most of the time guilds are cool about it, but it doesn‚Äôt make it any less of a hassle when you need a plan. Not to mention parts, etc. 
---
Again, they are a great team and it‚Äôs a great game, but I feel like people WAY overstate how little grind is involved to get ‚Äúeverything‚Äù in that game. Or I was just unlucky enough to have it take bloody ages to complete anything.
---
Didn‚Äôt even bother
---
I keep my coins there lol
---
I assume you are talking about the rep gauss guns. 
---
I thought you were just talking about gauss rifles.
---
I notice for big events everyone will join up but for smaller events I think we all have our preferences.
---
For example I just refuse to do the cannery one. It's glitched too many times on me and I hate it. Buuut, I will try for Paradise everytime I can get enough people there.
---
I'm okay with this setup. It's a game where there's quite a bit to manage and if someone needs to peel off to get materials or they don't like a specific event I'm cool with that.
---
that's one of the reasons I chose to trade play on PC to play on a console, way harder to do cheat and stuff.
---
No difference except on hacked versions.  Duped ones are exactly the same.
---
You don‚Äôt own servers. You are temporarily owning them after you first join a private world. If every fallout first member kept a world to them selves then there would be hardly any servers for anyone else if all they do is solo.
---
Yes Gauss guns
---
Humblebrag?
---
You know, when we were in the Vault we did some kinky shit and learning how to kiester was at the top of the list.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt ban them.
---
I would mark them and in a few weeks strip them of their rewards and reset them to level 1 (pass). That way it‚Äôs impossible for them to get back to max without spending money. 
---
I think banning is a little over the top, on the other side if they don‚Äôt have any repercussions than as soon as I find a glitch I‚Äôll be doing it as well.
---
Trade and drop one time use grenades...
---
It happens when too many ghouls spawn after people leaving and joining
---
Yep, it happens post-nuke, not very often.
---
Oh those, I thought he meant bullion items in general.
---
I'm 21 and I've played my azz off.  You are fine.
---
Ok thanks for the info I though it might be something new with the brotherhood doing some scouting or something
---
I have heavy doubt they'll actually get banned. But we'll see.
---
Well you can make gauss rifles. And people can trade them. That would kinda give you a feel for the shotgun.
---
It‚Äôs also why a lot of console players don‚Äôt want cross play. They don‚Äôt want pc-modded gear affecting PS4 or XBOne.
---
Fair enough, they changed a ton though since you last played from what i read. 
---
It's not a game for everyone as it's about hoarding resources and farming for frame parts, weapons and mods. I just think they did the pacing right and not really forcing players into FOMO. =)
---
But New Vegas wasn‚Äôt - Obsidian made that one.
---
Not the case. I wasn't on at all during a reset. I have my challenges all complete rip
---
are you getting white texture blinking too? or out of know where the light don't render and  the shadows are gone with a huge brightness.
---
This.  Is called "Missile State Holotape" or something similar.  Can be purchased at the terminal in the enclave command center of the whitespring bunker.
---
Yup. I hit the repeatable ten times today and ignored that one completely.
---
[PS4] North Carolina, level 64, online most nights around 9:00/10:00, same name as on here.
---
I wou love ps4-xbox cross, but I will leave any game that let pc players to crossplay.
---
Wow are you serious? I completed this in 5 mins tops. Get a headset and talk to people. Stop expecting people to die for you randomly. Ask them if you want to complete the daily together. Stop making it sound like it‚Äôs impossible.
---
Just started playing the game, you really can‚Äôt decorate the ceilings huh?
---
Yea all those advantages it gives.. Plus 100% damage and ignore pacifist of other players. Who cares, like others have said they will probably get banned
---
It‚Äôs not bad if you get a headset and tell your group if they want to complete the challenge. I did this and we all turn turns jumping cliffs.
---
Its not no negative effects, just less.
---
But floaters aren‚Äôt cryptids bud
---
Ye. Was happening to me too.
---
This is possible on console as well. It's actually really easy
---
Nope just a way to stop people from farming
---
I try to equip both weapons beforehand at the puppy and just hit X-Pac left to change, but still get lag or weird animations till I can full use the weapon
---
Are gamers really so horny that they start perving over the mere sound of a female?
---
Yeah I get that and understand that fact, but it feels like they should count for the challange at least
---
I have this happen to me sometimes, and I just keep walking away from where it's happening at. It reminds of how it was in FO4/FO3 where you couldn't fast travel if there are mobs around. It's as if you're in some spot where there's something putting strain on the server or mobs running around.
---
How do you figure? 25% of -2 isn't zero.
---
Then why am I paying 15.
---
I wondered also, but how would anybody here know the answer?
---
OK I don't want to bore you with a thousand details so here is my take:
---
Troubleshooters is trash except against robots.  No good for every day use.  If you run low health, try to find bloodied or instigating.  Furious is good for heavies but you are apparently a stealth build, so that isn't great for you.  
---
If you run high health, get Junkies or at the least Vampires. Vampires is only really effective on fast fire rate weapons.  Not great on melee or shotguns.
---
I'd suggest a combat rifle, Handmade or Fixer if you run commando.  A suppressed shotgun if you run heavy or shotgunner.  
---
If you are melee, you need a quiet weapon.  No super sledge or other loud weapon.  The best for sneaking are Combat knife with stealth blade, Death Tambo, Power Fist, DCG.
---
Good Luck.
---
That‚Äôs fair. It was a great game and a great team. I wish them tons of success because they really are neat people. The Tenno Con stuff is great and they are so amazing to remember TotalBiscuit and what he did for them. 
---
I‚Äôm always glad to hear good news about them.
---
Don't pull anything out the scrap box
---
I would just wipe his characters, I can't have sure if he got all that he have on a genuinely because he's cheating so deleting all it is, and band from a week.
---
i‚Äôve seen them often
---
Did someone say... *EXPLOIT?*
---
Maybe a sign you need to make you game more engaging when over half the players just server hop constantly
---
Using an exploit, so they can do another exploit to get a lot of XP and rank up tons of score points and finish already.
---
I like my Nukas Dark
---
so its a glitch and not a cheat, still I find better pc players keep on PC, too many mods and wat not.
---
The problem I've run into, with not having 1st, is all my supply of stable flux.
---
They weigh a pound each.
---
They count as a junk item, so 1st subscribers probably don't even realize this.  
---
There's a perk that can reduce the weight of junk items, but that only works for items held on your person, not in your stash. (And I'm not about to go around carrying all my flux with me everywhere I go, that would be very foolish).
---
Since flux is basically a late-game item, it really does feel like 1st is required once you reach that part of the game.
---
it rounds it down to -0 to your stats
---
your stats don't go down. Even if it is .5 of a stat point
---
skipping today‚Äôs as well
---
Who cares? It doesn‚Äôt affect you. For anyone curious, follow this video:

---
piss off
---
Yep and when they're already bored and complaining that there's 'nothing new to do' they can take their skins and furniture items unlawfully earned and shove em up their fuckin ass.
---
I use QOL mods on PC. I started on PS4 but the game runs better on PC so I swapped. I've never had a cheater affect my game so I don't really care what they do
---
This is not Fallout 5, this is the beginning of the fallout version os ESO, a platform that can be built upon and maintained for years. Ifr you want a single player game, go elsewhere or get used to typical mmo mechanics and practices
---
not for excavator im reffering to the other PA sets.
---
25% of 2 is .5. They can't take .5 of you so they just don't. Who am i to argue with them.
---
I would like to have neon pink to capture that retro vibe
---
I would personally love this. It's a good middle ground between full on Survival servers and Adventure mode PvP. A lot of people seem to be against PvP but with a few adjustments and some additions like this it could seriously bring new life to the game and make it so much better.
---
thats a blatant lie i know for a fact they were at one time working fine as my weight never changed. now it does. i know becasue i get paranoid about my stats and saw that now it no longer stacks.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, play long enough and you‚Äôll have your moment, lol.
---
At that point id just go to a different game üòÇ
---
‚ÄúSeats taken‚Äù
---
Not when I still have vendors to check on a server... lol.
---
Over time servers get locked out of players being able to join. If you stay long enough the server will open back up to allow players to join.
---
I‚Äôve never had this problem though and I‚Äôve played on and off since beta. What platform you on?
---
How do you get such high int? I can only max out at about 30
---
I love it when I go to someone's camp and the "armor" is all outfits. I already have a bajillion legendary weapons and pieces of armor. My stash is perpetually full. Rare outfits take up barely any weight so I can consistently get rid of my excess caps that way. I like gifting them to other people who also collect outfits.   
---
Randomly super high prices definitely don't feel great to see though
---
Why would it if you aren‚Äôt killing cryptids? I don‚Äôt get the levelling up challenge if I don‚Äôt level up lol.
---
Oh tbh i never check vendors üòÇ. Im usually set.
---
I only solo due to idiots running bloody and killing all events instantly with ebayed items.
---
It's called workshops.
---
This happened to a friend, so I ran a mod to auto pick up items, and scammed the same guy and few other scammers of that type out of some great gear. Good times.
---
As others have said, start filling that scrapbox. But consider yourself warned, it's addictive as hell and will be hard to play without it once you get used to it. I've got like 400 pounds of flux alone in mine, not to mention 10s of thousands of steel, lead, acid...
---
It reminds me of albion online, except albion eventually forces you to go into the pvp enabled zones to get better loot
---
I can give you food and water when you start :)
---
Ah a man of culture as well
---
I would love it, but then there‚Äôs always the fact that you can move it for free if your camp spot isn‚Äôt free. Soo sometimes I like to take advantage it
---
Bethesda doesnt ban glitchers, only hackers or I call script kiddies who pay to use hacks that others have created.
---
agree with you on the run better, on the ps4 it run like ass, but still if you can mod the game we want too, I don't want to be behind on QOL like you guys already have Perks profiles we don't isn't fair put both together.
---
Hey mate, are you on PC? I've been searching for serums forever and can't seem to find any... What serums do you have?
---
The odds of running into a person who bought an item off eBay is very slim. I can understand your hate about bloodied builds killing everything in one hit.
---
It‚Äôs got to be a engine limitation
---
Because there's no text chat and I don't own a mic?
---
Pumpkin house, probably power plant
---
It's hard if you don't own a headset.
---
I don't have a mic :/
---
Crossplay for this game doesn't matter. The game has plenty of players on all platforms. I agree, there is no need to put us together
---
I know you're unaware of the cultures of the various tribes across the united states; but we have no "witch doctors" in any tribe that I'm aware of.
---
On days with this challenge that's being a douchebag.
---
Lmao
---
This was actually a core feature of the Public Event overhaul part 2. I‚Äôm not sure when this is planned for release, but I‚Äôm sure after the success of public teams, there will be a higher interest in the second overhaul.
---
Take down the post now to avoid exposure
---
I don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt just make the pip boy light beige like the rest of the games UI. Instead we have a pale green eye sore for a light. Hell why not make the rest of the pip boy interface beige for that matter.
---
I don‚Äôt think there is a single person who captures a workshop with the intent to do pvp. Having someone come into your workshop and kill you just ruins your day because you‚Äôre either trying to do a challenge or just building something. Workshop pvp are also really easily abused since the attacker has all the power and can insta kill whenever they want, leaving the defender unable to do anything. I‚Äôm talking about a designated pvp zone. That doesn‚Äôt rely on one specific person to make the first move, need level ground
---
There are really cheap ones. There are headsets with a mic that go for 5 to 10 dollars.
---
Ive been saying since the moment I laid my eyes on it that it should be put into adventure mode as a social space + trading area. Some of my favorite aspects of games (especially from this past gen) have been social spaces. Weve seen them in MMOs for ages but Im talking developer made social spaces like in Destiny or Warframe for example. Keep in the ability to trade and it would be amazing. It would also serve as a staging area for meeting people to group up with.
---
We‚Äôre did you happen to find the plans?
---
No but would be damn nice if you could
---
I'm sorry to hear that brother, know that no matter how dark it may get you will never be alone
---
I just got the camp bundle for shits and giggles
---
That's Nuclear Winter baby, and I am your storm
---
There‚Äôs the metal helmet. It‚Äôs kinda looks like a baseball helmet or motorcycle helmet. You can find two at the mezzanine level of top of the world in the store called peak condition.
---
Fuck a fallout game set in russia dont sound too bad as the soviet union did dissolve in our timeline albeit much too late
---
Unfortunately Bethesda doesnt ban Glitchers, just people who use 3rd party software aka hacks.
---
Also, for events that have guaranteed legendaries (ex.: Faschnacht, Free Range, Uranium Fever, etc.) there was a planned change to only require a specific amount of participation from each person to get the legendary. This was also talked about for overhaul part 2. That way if the boss dies immediately, you don‚Äôt miss out on the legendary.
---
Same its a main reason i never make alts, the whole level ranges really stopped me ever bothering.. And no you cannot avoid the higher tier mobs as many here like to say you can.
---
If your that poor to afford a head set then idk what to say. A cheap head set with a mic can be around 5 to 10 dollars.
---
I just don't get the douche mentality, that's why I hate NW mode.
---
I try to throw ideas out that me and my friends agree on or things that other games do. But 90% of the time I get downvoted into oblivion. This game could be great in its current state with no new content but with some tweaks and UI/QoL improvements but Bethesda seems set on just adding new shit instead of fixing what's broken.
---
I want it as a cool fireplace, not a door lol
---
So we can have an empty zone with the odd griefer just like the Division had.. what a waste of code.
---
It absolutely is on the roadmap.... did you look at the roadmap before saying you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs on there?
---
Not a douche mentally just gave you a tip on how to revive people. Then said what I would do if you tried to revive someone. I literally warned you on what might happen. Take it as you will
---
I use Weapon Artisan 3 to repair mine to 200%.  Adding the forceful stock makes it much more durable.  I don't run gunsmith at all any more.
---
"I've done a few times" why bethesda didn't ban this guy yet?
---
If you have empath, you take more damage while your teammates take less. BUT if your teammate also has it, it cancels out your negative damage and you give each other the buff. With the new team system as long as you and 1 other person have Empath, you're all gravy.
---
Hey if the developers make a swiss cheese engine customers will go through the holes.. Seriously.
---
To be fair, it really should be an ingame slider in options.
---
I loved the dark zone in division, it became empty because people stopped playing the game.
---
This is why the zone would need really good loot, like it should be a prime location to farm legendaries and there should be pure flux deposits. I would farm the hell out of the area for pure flux
---
It's a waste of money for someone that doesn't use it right? The ones that come free with the console always get tossed because I don't use a mic, that's why I don't have one.
---
I would imagine it has something to do with your Live or PSN profile too, in a PC person so I wouldn‚Äôt say. But they did with Fortnite and such.
---
Gotta suffer for fashion
---
I would believe it is supposed to apply health like the All Rise hammer, but it does give extra disease resist and less AP drain from sprinting. Potentially Bethesda did it this way on purpose.
---
It never has, same thing with fallout 4.
---
It is canon that death claws can crossbreed in a sense
---
super sledgehammer skin, PA skins.
---
Well I don‚Äôt have many friends and I rarely use a headset. But it‚Äôs nice to have a useable one around Incase you want to chat with friends or people. In your case this game.
---
Who cares if Bethesda can't make a game without exploits why should customers not use them?
---
Pretty sure there is one just called hardhat
---
Yep, just happened to me with the Robot challenge.  Shows completed, got no reward.  Interestingly enough, I checked my 'Collections' tab and everything comes up 0 except caps.  When I check it against whichever vending machine, it shows correctly how much whichever script or token I have.  Dunno if this is a know issue or related or what. But, it's Bethesda so...bugs...yeah, I don't know...
---
I'll be honest, I think that PA is ugly AF.
---
Suit isnt required for stealth, but it's simple to use and amazing in nuke zones. Also when  you repair the armor, you just repair 1 piece and not 5, it's also nice to have full FOV instead of my gun taking up half the screen. So it isnt required to be a bloodied stealth but it's fun to use and simple.
---
Yea it happens sometimes after a nuke ha fizzled our. Protectrons also
---
You can‚Äôt use usernames in your posts; edit or delete.
---
next NW game spawn near your teammates, build a camp, place a foundation and a stairway as high as you can, do the "come here" emote  and jump off off the stairs 
---
In my experience they'll get the idea lol
---
Last summer I had thoracic outlet surgery, and the incision and subsequent swelling in my neck meant I couldn't speak for several weeks. I used emotes and the occasional DM and things worked out pretty well (except for a couple of incidents).  Never went back to the mic and really haven't missed it. Don't worry about it, most people will understand.
---
Is there a search function on reddit?
---
This is going to get pulled for violating the witch-hunt rule. Remove the player name from here and report him to Bethesda. 
---
Thanks for the heads up though
---
A working in game add on, I say 2-3 years
---
Looking forward to November 2021 ...... damn skeleton crew running a whole game
---
Derp lol I glazed over it I‚Äôll hold that L
---
What?? 
---
Can anyone understand this post?
---
This.  Goo/ash piles often turn into glitched spawns with enemies naked and unkillable.  Many times with no heads.
---
I don't recall Bethesda ever actually making a public statement on the matter, but that's certainly the best guess of experienced modders I have listened to.
---
I love the floors and the decorations and the soccer balls lmao
---
wish we could use that stuff in our camps 
---
I would make a soccer field so fast
---
I think you need to go back to COD lol.
---
Where do you find the calendar?
---
No reason to downvote, the more attention it gets the higher likelihood Bethesda hotfixes it.
---
Too many cooks in the kitchen for sure
---
I just throw them lmao their shit
---
Yeah I try to as well, though sometimes after getting in and out of power armor, which I try to do the previous weapon switch, it actually switches to one of my other favorite menu weapons ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
They already tried. They made it so you can‚Äôt get god mode by yourself but other players can still put you in it. So, they did a half assed fix and probably won‚Äôt bother to fix it anymore lol
---
It‚Äôs actually a whole studio.
---
I just did some emotes with a teammate asking them to follow me as I jumped off a cliff. They revived me. And they jumped off. Thumbs up all around. 
---
I hear ya though. Definitely the most time consuming and not fun challenge.
---
You don't need 1st, you need to learn inventory management and farming techniques.  
---
Steel, plastic and even adhesive are easy enough to farm on an as needed basis without needing to rely on vendors or the scrap box.
---
An assault rifle scraps down to 20 steel meaning a single trip through West Tek can net you upwards of 400 and the occasional plastic from laser rifles, plastic can be farmed from whitesprings golf balls or from all of the cutlery in the Morgantown and Watoga high school cafeterias and adhesive can be crafted from vegetable starch.
---
People that complain about stash space need to dump all of the junk they're holding onto that's taking up space.  Every other camp you visit has hundreds of pounds of trash three star legendary weapons and armor that they're never going to use and no one is ever going to buy or people are hoarding the wrong types of junk that they can just farm easily on the off chance they ever actually need it.
---
i feel like the reason they didn't implement changing pip-boy color in this game is because if you modified it in the .ini it also changes the pip-boy color of every other player, but only to you. honestly it's such a minor "bug" that it wasn't worth excluding the feature (but not really since you can just do it in the ini).
---
I take it as douche mentality. It's why I don't do things like NW.
---
No problem and thank you for the heads-up about the rules
---
What are you doing to level? I'd like to trade ideas.
---
Right now I have about an hour during weekdays. 2 hours during weekend days. 
---
With XP and INT food, Uny armor, and bobbleheads, XP in public teams with Inspirational seems to do pretty well. Although, I haven't swapped to Herbivore yet for Cranberry stuff.
---
I try and only do efficient events, like SBQ and Radiation Rumble (or others that I know have good spawn rates).
---
I haven't tried crafting for XP, but I remember that being pretty good last year.
---
Sell them at a vendor bot.
---
If anything there are too many monsters considered cryptids. Anglers? Snallygasters? Those are no more a cryptid than a super mutant. There are only 4 cryptids in this game: The grafton monster, flatwoods monster, mothman and windego. Sheepsquatch is at least based on a cryptid, too.
---
I wish  there was an Ohio dlc , very least Dayton and Cincinnati would provide very interesting destinations,  especially Dayton what with the Wright brothers and Wright Patterson airbase's rumored connection to alien activity.
---
So it's useless?
---
Drop them or sell them to a Vendor.
---
Only the last one you picked up counts.
---
Is that a serious question?
---
That sucks but whatever
---
Yes, worthless to you and other players
---
Lucky Hole Mine without an excavator suit lands me with 80+ lead ore. Then Flatwoods gym, Penitentiary courtyard, and VTU gym are my dailies. Add in the above and OP will have so much lead theyll wipe with it.
---
No?
---
More like trying to find like-minded people to efficiently grind this thing out with the least amount of time investment.
---
Also gauge how I'm doing compared to others, I just don't have that much time to play lately.
---
What is the trap glitch?  I‚Äôm not familiar with this.
---
It's not entirely a lie.  The interface shows bulked material as weighing less because it consumes the plastic in the process, so technically the end product weighs a few plastic less than the materials that went into it.
---
Hey, thank you I missed that post!
---
Although I think I saw another post saying it wasn't accurate, but didn't pay much attention to it.
---
‚ÄúUnlawfully lol.
---
It seems accurate to me. A lot of people are spouting bad math on here. It takes into account double xp and double score weekends. Anyway it‚Äôs a good reference.
---
Is it though
---
Does anyone really think that is not what happened?
---
Lol same. I finally got that stupid sword by following a couple lvl 100+ guys during a nuke.
---
Fallout 3 had it, I'm just saying New Vegas also had it, it hasn't been a thing since Fallout New Vegas.
---
Have you done the enclave quest line?  They always spawn in the white springs bunker inside the military wing in the downstairs rooms with all the desks.  Just pick one up there and fast travel, takes only a few minutes.
---
They sould add this back
---
They said they were investigating the water wheel not spinning too, do you know how long it took to fix? 1 month and ten days, for an item that cost 10 dollars. 
---
It seems like every couple of days a great majority of redditors here get amnesia. I've been here since the beginning, and this is par for the course. Every patch they introduce between 10-20 new major bugs and fix 10-20 old ones poorly if at all.
---
They can drop with explosive from the Ally weapon crate quests.
---
It does. I had a pile of like 65 of them once. I figured, ok, there's 65 times I can do Forbidden Knowledge without having to rummage for Data.
---
Nnnnope.
---
It depends on your preferred weapon.  Assuming you want to run melee and auto or semi auto rifles it could go something like this:
---
Strength: Martial Artist 3, Iron Fist or slugger with expert 1 and master 1.  2 points for bandolier or incisor.
---
Perception: Concentrated fire 1, Commando/Rifleman 2 in all three forms, tank killer 2
---
Endurance:  Adamantium Skeleton 2, Livegiver 3, Fireproof 3
---
Charisma:  Tenderizer 3, Travel Agent, Lone Wanderer/strength in numbers 3, pick one more.
---
Intelligence:  Gunsmith 5, First Aid 3 or Stabilized 3 if you ever run PA and heavy guns.
---
Agility:  Adrenaline 5 (when they fix it) Sneak 3/Covert operative 3
---
Luck:  Serendipity 3, Starched Genes 2, Bloody Mess 3
---
Swap in situational cards like Super Duper, Weapon Artisan, etc. as needed.
---
I joined a building team twice today, and the owner removed me from the team. One was a guy by himself, and the other was a group with three total. It was weird.
---
Oh yes please. I would love an ammo scrapper.
---
I just want a pink pip boy hud 
---
Watch alt colors be sold on the Atom shop
---
It‚Äôs gonna cost ya.
---
Thanks
---
That's not how it fucking works.
---
Stash space does NOT exist just to fuck over the players and force them into purchasing an alternative.  Every time you open your stash the game has to retrieve the inventory from the server in the form of unique ids for each unique item, the more unique items you have stored the more item ids the game needs to retrieve.  If you have a lot of crap in your stash you can actually feel the game lagging when you open it.  Having a stash limit puts a soft cap on how many items are likely to be stored by each player to limit just how much stress is being put on the game.
---
The scrap box gets around this limit and allows "infinite" storage because at most it only has to load the ids for thirty something types of scrap and a variable for how many you have for each.
---
I play 3rd person as I travel and 1st person for combat/exploring buildings. Always loved seeing my weapons on my back.
---
Because very few people do encryptid because people can sell their fixers, both legendary and non. Same with paradise and free range. 
---
Everybody has to do the vault raid if they want any gauss weapons.
---
No it became empty because PvE games make terrible PvP games.. It was full of exploiters, full of script kiddies and griefers are a minority in these games.. No one went there because no matter what rewards they added the toxic populations weren't worth dealing with.
---
They have nothing in comon aside from the explosive effect and ammo used tho.
---
Well, the CMs arent the game devs. So all they can do us relay the message
---
You have to make sure to reblog in to adventure mode before relog if you log out in nw or are on at time of reset you get that bug
---
And even worse people have posted ticket responses from Bethesda saying they cant refund lost score because of this bug either
---
Which is a much better use of their time. I'd rather they ban the asshats who fly way up in the air killing people in NW with hacks than someone who got a monkey backpack before me.
---
Stuff like this is what people should be concerned about since it literally effects other players ability to enjoy the game.
---
https://i.gyazo.com/95b043d9619a13aba5c42e7510529f05.jpg
---
Isn't that extortion and also a violation of the rules? Report, block, move on.
---
Charging them up. And the kick are similar.
---
you clearly need to level more and get some gear that isnt shit..
---
Then little Tim don't get it.  It was  item available for a certain time and if you didn't play during that time you don't get it.  Think of the exclusive Legendary weapons you got from the hardcore servers doing challenges. There no longer a way to get those either.  What would be the point of doing the event for items you can get when you feel like it later.
---
This is why the game suffers with new customers, Bethesda said they were reworking levels but nothing has been shown or added since.. The main issue is certain areas always have higher level enemies and higher customers cause the rest to get higher anyway.. when you wander into them you die with no way to survive..
---
My only thought is get a minigun or similar with faster fire rate as a stat then you will be able to kill stuff much higher than yourself.
---
I‚Äôm hesitant to prime my 50 cal until I can get another good one so I can use both ammo types lol
---
No difference except if those weren‚Äôt duped, majority of the player base would never have em due to how ridiculous RNG is
---
Agreed lol
---
For the ability to play without other people being there too.
---
Are they bitches though? At best they bring attention to Bethesda to fix the problem (hence this post), at worst they get banned (unlikely). If you make your game poorly so it can be exploited with brand new hacks every single patch, and you make the system so grindy that you push people who normally wouldn't even look for cheats to do so, then you have a recipe for a very healthy exploiter community. Not to mention the atrocious [real world item market](https://www.g2g.com/fallout-76/item-25467-25473?platform=29385&amp;sorting=price%40desc) that survives on these insane hacks that bugthesda cant or wont close for whatever reasons.
---
oh nice !!
---
You need the standard ammo to make the ultracite ammo. So what's the difference? I just want the bloody thing to make plasma cores.
---
Yessir
---
Man you are in every thread with snarky negativity.
---
I've been playing for a year with no mic and voice chat muted. Listening to squeaky kids having domestics kinda kills immersion for me lol.. So don't sweat it, nobody cares if you don't respond to chat!
---
True
---
Some youtuber put up some new video on a glitch,  don't be suprised if you see it while hunting resources.
---
[u/LadyDevann/](https://www.reddit.com/u/LadyDevann/)
---
Backward compatibility. Shouldn't be a problem hopefully.
---
Hmmmmm, thanks for the info
---
If you're near a location that's spawning these higher enemies, I'd say quit out and server hop to at least try to reset their levels closer to yours if possible.
---
Another thing I've found that helps, is if you're not set on a build (like sneaky) yet, grab a (for you level 30) combat shotgun. Floaters will be your biggest issue, as they're just hard to kill. But aim for the legs of the ghouls and the arms of the gutsy, even at your level, you can take them down relatively quickly if you take away their ability to attack you! :)
---
I do not believe so....I did it all at once
---
Yes! This! (And make it transparent...)
---
Easy.  I run full unyielding, nerd rage, herbivore.  Eat Brain fungus soup and cranberry relish.  Use Berry mentats.  Stay well Rested/Fed/Hydrated.  Wear Vault underarmor with the shielded mod.  My Intelligence stays around 40.  That is an 80% boost in XP gain from INT plus the boosts from the relish and well rested. All in all about double XP all the time.  LVL 68 Super Mutant Warlords give me about 360 XP, so one run of Westek yields about 120 score.
---
I run a loop of DMV, Golf Course and Westek.  Then (on a private server) go back to the DMV, log off and back on and repeat.  Can get three full loops in an hour for almost 900 score.  You could add bobbleheads and magazines for even more. I only do events that are quick. I spend more time just grinding XP.  So far, it is working for me.  Crafting for XP seems too slow to me compared to just grinding mutants and ghouls.
---
AMEN!
---
That reminds me.. I wonder if unyielding boosts do as well.
---
Have done Ash Heap and Toxic Valley? Both are good for your level.
---
This one isnt bad if you have a friend or a mic to cordinate.
---
I fear for the get 5 kills in NW daily, im gonna skip that one
---
Yes.
---
It's a bug that was introduced with the new update
---
\+3 to all stats except endurance.
---
... after all my time playing 76, I have never noticed Sexy Sleepwear didn't exist in the game. I forward this, bring it back! I also agree with whoever said it earlier, make it transparent.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Nope and it's a shame, this wallpaper would make for a great ceiling.
---
It should since it boosts your int
---
I'm only gonna ask this one time, give me the naughty nightwear....... 
---
I really hope I remembered that right
---
It‚Äôs the worst when you‚Äôre in a hurry and need to repair!
---
After I am done with my script for the day I usually put that kind of stuff in my machines for 100 caps per star because that's what it would be worth if I were buying it. It's trash script after all. You shouldn't have to spend even close to your daily caps limit for script. My two cents.
---
Spot the lawyer LOLZ I didn't even see the wording I used....
---
My main thing is my stash is full of bulk junk but I don‚Äôt want to have to pay a steep monthly fee to fix that problem
---
Snallygasters are based off German mythical lore.
---
the dots make it very ominous
---
I feel like when I get on, I chase away everyone else! Public teams vanish, players log out, nobody likes having me around! :O
---
Appreciate that info.
---
No problem
---
Relaxing really isn't my "thing" but I'll give it a shot.
---
This is why Humanity hasn't made any progress in the Fallout universe.
---
Vault raids didn't fail just because of the lack of a convenient party feature... being unable to easily form a group was the least of the problems with the entire system.  
---
The raids were overall an unrewarding sink of ammo and meds, boring as all fuck to do since they were primarily a series of mini fetch quests for unmarked items, annoying as hell because of time limits that existed just to artificially inflate the "difficulty" and a pain in the ass to organize since you needed voice chat to coordinate everything. Then you have to factor in the additional annoyances like the ridiculous lag and that you still needed to be able to form a group from a third party site or get lucky enough that enough people just happen to be on the same server and interested.
---
Vault raids are likely to continue to be a failure until at minimum we get some proper matchmaking, dedicated servers to reduce lag and deter crashes, text chat to allow for communication between all players and some proper objectives.
---
The people who have high priced junk items don't buy mine to resale cause theirs don't sell is the point. They do still try to sell the junk I sell at 20 for like 2k
---
Well I learned something new. That's pretty cool. I still don't know why anglers count though.
---
If only they'd let us use them on the ceilings.
---
Here is a tip... I save lots of legendary armor sets. four characters and full sets of unyielding, trouble shooter, scorched. I mod legendary to be lighter. Takes up stash space. Only my primary set has full potential upgrades.
---
ex...my unyielding has deep pockets.
---
It doesn't work, when I was doing the ministry quest line to get the old sword near the whitespring there were level 62 charred ghouls even then and regular level 52, only 2 were level 15 ghouls I tried 4 times in different worlds I finally finished it in the end only because of the whitespring robots.. I just used a canned coffea to outrun ghouls and lure them there this sucks..
---
The incentive is the SBQ, which draws most of the server every time. People seem interested.
---
Ghouls habe better manners- they don't attack their own.
---
Can I use that and a drug to get the extra 1 I need or does it not stack for the checks?
---
It never stacked
---
:-)

NEVER use the retry feature, always leave manually.  All the game is doing when you select to find another world is logging you out and then immediately logging you back in, if the world you just left hasn't filled up or a spot in an older world hasn't opened up you're getting sent right back where you started.  Doing it manually gives you a few extra seconds for a new server to become available.
---
Yeah, the anglers are a head scratcher
---
Please share your math with me.
---
I don't really have any need to save them I have all secret service limbs and under armor, just saving for the chest. Well less saving and waiting to turn in gold bonds cause daily limits and what not
---
roleplay loser
---
Because the game was not designed to check for that.  The game was designed to just load you into the world and that's that, checking for your spot being free is something they had to jury rig on top of everything later on to shut people up..
---
its the truth..
---
people can argue the whys of it to their hearts delight..
---
the most helpful real information is.. more levels.. better gear.. Fact
---
you can block me if youd like.. I wont mind
---
that link brought me to pornhub involving squirrels ...
---
If it was instanced you would still get locked out of firing the nuke if someone launched that silo before you. At least this way you can see who is stealing your nuke.
---
LOL
---
I tried that with a random group and they just let me die.
---
LOL, so what you really want is a single player fallout game, where what you do has persistence between sessions. Are you listening, Bethesda?
---
My mule evolved into a food build. (level 178). All the carry perks and Full unyielding set with deep pockets and some type of weight reduction. (weapons,ammo,food).
---
I just wanted to let you know that not everyone appreciates your approach.  Try being tactful and helpful maybe.  Try some kindness.
---
Yes, it definitely does.
---
I agree. I'm almost 350 hours in. Level 125. And I've launched exactly 1 nuke. After I saw what I got I did some research to see if there are better things I can get if I keep doing it and nope. No special plans. No special weapon. Nothing specific that you get for doing just those. One for the achievement and done.
---
New(ish) player here, totally thought I could do that already in the gold press. Thats depressing.
---
get a console if you don‚Äôt wanna deal with cheaters. doesn‚Äôt completely fix it but for the most part it really does.
---
Prehaps since your a programmer you could explain why in the flying fudge I get 10 frames when at a cooking workstation trying to spam craft fooooods because it‚Äôs driving me crazy :(
---
No, it's highly likely to happen because of how easy it would be to track.  
---
Bethesda knows exactly how long it should be taking people to complete this thing without using exploits and can likely track how fast people have progressed.  The fact that all of these rewards are unique to each player means they don't have to restrain  themselves from hitting innocent people like they would if they went after people with duped/glitched weapons who may have "legitimately" bought them from the actual cheater.
---
uhhhh w o t ?
---
I like where this is going
---
They're should be a bounty card that rewards like 5 caps per kill
---
Rofl I'm sorry man. If I were there I would've revived you.
---
Ya been removed from a fair number for some reason, I'm high level and active (not that it matters to the bonuses). Only thing I could figure was they were trying to cycle through for fast travel points or to get their friends in the group.
---
Did you check the min spcs for the game?
---
I play in first person so..
---
whatever it takes to get you through the day yo
---
Bethsda doesnt give us new content just new grind, why not break thie game.
---
Up to 3 per armour piece. Use formula p for 5 or grape mentats. Or sweet roll. Or a bobble head. You could have a drug and a food and your armour.
---
The Gauss rifle is such in a pityfull state in vats i forgot to mention the charging mechanic ... x) feels meh to charge 3-4 shots and realise they all bug-miss even when you re enter vats in chain, its why i do a mix of quick-charged shots ( love this kind of versatility ) sadly the recent patch destroyed it for now ( 10-20% of dmg if not charged a bit...), hope it's temporary i guess even the shotgun is affected.
---
No problem, just mentioned this for someone out there reading this.
---
Can you explain it from your point of view?  I‚Äôve just never seen this I do before.
---
run the quest on the left side of the map to fight the wolves .. where you get 3 of them in a row .. I forget the name .. but I do this first thing on a new character and get a bloody .. whatever then you should be able to kill shit even with a level 5 .. or it's a start at least
---
then head to top of the world to the arena area and loot all the dead raiders and get grenades
---
then send me your profit cause I am your messiah
---
ps4 has the achievement we‚Äôre u launch it then jump into the nuke zone and get killed by your own nuke
---
it's rebelling !!@! kill it!!
---
He still walks around in my experience but hey, he's not so big
---
You must be the only one left not glitching silos.
---
Not gonna lie, I'd laugh out loud to that
---
I guessd correctly.. this is about hoarding mountains of useless crap and every mediocre legendary trying to get max top dollar for it!!
---
that never happens!
---
Signed!
---
Haha me and my buddy did it that way. Poor teammates without mics probably thought they got teamed up with some nutjobs....
---
.......they were right
---
He‚Äôs standing on the chair to show his dominance. He‚Äôs taller and bigger than you so this why you felt threatened and had to post this scene here to feel that your not alone to take down this monster.
---
bulking junk doesnt reduce weight.. only 2 items weigh less.. lead and aluminum I think
---
Int is Int however you get it.
---
Thanks so much!
---
We should already have persistent workshops. We should already have a larger camp budget. We should already have an ever evolving 1st exclusive cosmetics section. But no. We don‚Äôt have any of that despite it being advertised when Fallout 1st originally came out.
---
Valid.
---
It would help my colorblind ass tremendously.
---
they could do that if they fix all the dupe glitches, never gonna happen
---
Heresy!
---
it‚Äôs well above the minimum, update your graphics cards driver and mainboard drivers, also check you pci-ex in bios is on auto or gen3.
---
Cool.  Thats irrelevant to my post and I know I'm already right.  The eastern boundary to west Virginia, by Pennsylvania, is north/south and doesn't follow the Potomac until further south.
---
Nobody had mics but I quickly caught on! I had earlier tried to rad poison myself and have my friend revive me, spoilers, it didn't work.
---
the mob asked for it..
---
the mob has not yet learned to be careful what they ask for...
---
I'd love this back. Having red would give the mothman outfits a better eerie vibe to it
---
I feel like they should have done what they did in new Vegas and just update it slightly to fit the game.
---
You would be surprised how often I have people ask me where my vendors are.
---
stop using logic .. this is a bethesda game
---
they could have even tied it to ammosmiff .. point 0 takes 10 ammo you don't want to 1 you do want and point 1 takes 5 of the ammo you are converting to make 1 of the one you want and point 2 takes 3 of the ammo you don't want to the one you want so on and such
---
You can upgrade your under armour to increase special stats.

Fallout 76 Infinite Container Inventory Glitch - EZ Technical Data &amp; Floater Grenade Farm! https://youtu.be/c_biGLftq2c 
---
I‚Äôd assume this is what he‚Äôs on about
---
Almost like I hinted at that possibility in my post.
---
I would probably use it as a scrapper even with terrible rates.. not so much now...
---
honestly.. even still.. I would probably be dumping my ammo in train station containers because Im not going looking for one when I need it..
---
I do most of my stash juggling at train stations.. I dont really have a base
---
yeah you're like super mean yo and you made me eat ice cream while I cried
---
Such a great idea, so naturally won't happen, lol.
---
 Would save me from having to hunt down 2* weapons for that last 30 scrip because it won't let me take a loss of 10 on another 3* weapon.
---
Oh shit, theres a ton of hidden mechanics and things I can do that I still haven‚Äôt learned yet, thanks for the heads up
---
I‚Äôm not understanding how this relates to PvP or anything else
---
Lol that NCR Trump is great
---
I always thought that whole "I feel personally attacked" thing was just a silly meme until now.
---
The game eats up slightly over 7gb of vram worst case scenario for my pc on max settings. That cpu will be the cause for stutters if your trying to go over 60 fps but it should be doable
---
Visual bug that has been occurring since they introduced NW.
---
tough love yo.. tough love
---
Imagine this, you go through all the trouble, prep the launch, and then go to the fissure only to have someone with his duped legacy superweapon melting the queen and leaving you with out any drops,how does it sound?.
---
The hell is happening
---
They could‚Äôve just made ammo sellable or scrapable but that‚Äôs too obvious
---
What I‚Äôm getting is the OP contested the workshop of someone doing that glitch and the original owner got salty and processed to threaten OP
---
Charred ghouls are tough. At level 110, I still struggle when I find packs of them. Light machine guns are a good bet if you can afford crafting the ammo
---
One issue with this is weight. Components weight more the ammo. Gunpowder is heavy. It would take more of stash space
---
I found it in there Facebook page
---
My monitor is a 60Hz display. Will there be any stuttering if it‚Äôs staying at that rate?
---
I never would have guessed a 270x was faster than a 285.
---
 [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html) 
---
Even doing monkey math just based on daily's/ weekly's your hours/day would be higher. Even if you're using exp boosts like crazy. Grinding the exp/score is not just time consuming it takes more time than doing daillys.
---
To clarify not saying getting to 19 is not possible. Simply your hours/day are low. Youd have to grind more to be where you are since a lot of things that are supposed to give score are not giving score and how you get score is limited.
---
Not just a female, a female that plays 76. Yeah, men will perve over much much less.
---
clearly my reading comprehension was not up to par this morning.. lol
---
Screws? Don‚Äôt buy them... If you have Super Duper (ideally rank 3), steel (easy to get, anywhere there are enemies with guns that‚Äôs steel) and time (not so easy to get), you can just do this for screws:
---
Equip Super Duper.
---
Craft an assaultron helmet. 
---
Scrap the assaultron helmet(s).
---
Craft assaultron helmet(s)
---
Scrap assaultron helmets(s) 
---
Repeat until you have as many helmets as you want screws, and scrap all assaultron helmets. Then scrap the assaultron heads.
---
How this works:
---
If you‚Äôre using Super Duper when you craft the assaultron helmet, you have a chance to make two. When you scrap the assaultron helmet it‚Äôll turn into 1 steel and a scrap assaultron head. Since making assaultron helmets requires an assaultron head and 2 steel, your net input is 1 steel. 
---
When you scrap an assaultron head, you will get 1 screw, 1 silver and 3 circuits. Silver and circuits are both sellable junk items at the vendor.
---
I agree
---
Hmmmm ok thanks
---
Nope. Just a bunch of gibberish, as far as i can tell at the very least.
---
Welcome, you must be new. Remember the rocksy glitch and how a huge majority of the player base got max raider rep before it was mathematically possible? I remember.....they're all still grinding away.
---
This is true. But they could have the option to bulk gunpowder or something to make it lighter. But I guess people would most likely use it for crafting right away so they don't have to lug it around.
---
It‚Äôs a visual glitch when you leave me and go straight to adventure of a nuke is there. 
---
Makes me want to experience a nuke this huge when ever I see it.
---
"Give me the Naughty Nightwear" is such a classic FO3 line.
---
When you‚Äôre lvl one million you‚Äôve done it all in your sleep, time and time again. The point here is that the end game content is lacking actual content. It‚Äôs just currency grinds.
---
So you want the scrip limit set to 300, but the hard way? What am I missing?
---
I've noticed it a lot lately (last two days) with feral ghouls. They stand there, breathing or whatever. I can kill and loot some, but some just stay standing. I shoot and the kill sound effects play, but I can't loot.
---
I do get some headless naked scorched and ferals, though. They don't aggro, and they can't be killed. It's creepy as hell, and I keep waiting for it to aggro the one time I ignore it.
---
Glitches don't get banned. As a matter of fact, glitches CAN'T get banned.
---
Think about it. This whole game is such a buggy mess, you can experience all kinds of beneficial glitches just by accident. If they banned everyone who benefits from glitches, Bethesda would have like three players left.
---
The godmode glitch works entirely without any third party hacks; all you need is to get ash piled and be quick on the revive. When you're in godmode, XP boosts stack, meaning if you use two XP boost bobbleheads, you get twice the effect. It's buggy as hell, requires no hacks, and will not get you banned.
---
I say go to town. Screw this dumb season pass. Grinding is for scrubs.
---
the red power armor lamp mod was the best fo76 purchase i've ever made.
---
there's a baseball cap, a miners cap and a steel workers hat .. plus a atom shop truckers hat
---
the colors are all different though but they appear similar
---
I'm just your friendly neighborhood high level player
---
Probably not, but I alsk use some ini tweaks to further change what the game looks like. I used to have an I5-7500 which is probably 3-10% faster than your I5 and it would stay at around 70-100% (with nothing else running in the background) utilization when I capped the fps to 60
---
It will be for sale in the atom shop when the season ends, just like all the other unique rewards. It exists for Bethesda cash flow.
---
I just take a junkies ultracite. Practically unlimited ammo. So just never stop shooting her. Even with glitch weapons she always lands at least like three times.
---
How much
---
Yeah that's the one.
---
Supposedly the Xbox will have Backwards compatibility all the way back to original Xbox, and certain titles will be enhanced, so here's hoping FO76 will apply.
---
üëè
---
Workshop persistence on private worlds was originally advertised as a feature bethesda plans/ planned on adding. But they've kept quiet about it ever since they initially talked about it...
---
i mean i guess that‚Äôs what i ended up doing so you have a point.  it‚Äôs probably just the tone that gets you flak.
---
From NexusMods...
---
 It would appear, while there isn't a slider in the ingame settings changes to the Fallout76Prefs.ini file located in your documents folder "C:\\Users\\YOURUSERNAME\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76" does allow changing the colors of your huds.  
---
Incase you want to go back to default:  
---
DEFAULT FALLOUT76:  
---
fPipboyEffectColorB=0.5000  
---
fPipboyEffectColorG=1.0000  
---
fPipboyEffectColorR=0.1000  
---
Here are the codes that correspond to previous fallouts:  
---
CLASSIC BLUE:  
---
fPipboyEffectColorB=1.0000  
---
fPipboyEffectColorG=0.8000  
---
fPipboyEffectColorR=0.1500  
---
CLASSIC AMBER:  
---
fPipboyEffectColorB=0.2000  
---
fPipboyEffectColorG=0.7000  
---
fPipboyEffectColorR=1.0000  
---
CLASSIC GREEN:  
---
fPipboyEffectColorB=0.4500  
---
fPipboyEffectColorR=0.0500  
---
CLASSIC WHITE:  
---
fPipboyEffectColorR=0.7500  
---
You could also do this with other colors too if desired, use Fallout 4's ingame sliders plus Fallout4prefs.ini for proper code conversion of your color choices
---
They sure do have a hard time "fixing" things lately. He still wanders around, at his trailer, right next to the instruments, even found him by the elevator.
---
glad you were able to advance..
---
as far as the rest of it.. Im not really sweating what someone on the internet thinks/says about me
---
keep on knockin' em dead slugger...
---
?
---
Asbestos is needed for repairs of secret service armor, if you find your stuff needed constant repairs.
---
The map area levels have been the same since beta. Stating the obvious, don't go into areas you can't handle.
---
Can‚Äôt remember now, just answering your question.  I came across a player vendor selling it so I can say for certain someone is selling it.
---
Oh I will pay anyone for some
---
Agreed. Especially since end game builds can one-shot most everything. I'd even be fine if it were reduced XP, just give us something!
---
I miss the bright white light. Made it feel like a real flashlight
---
IMO Bethesda/Zenimax ought to take the cash shop model that Cryptic/Perfect World has.  Sure, you can subscribe and get an expanded amount of inventory slots, ship slots, etc.  But you can also just straight up buy those things to have permanently from their cash shop without the sub.
---
Scrap Box should be available for purchase with Atoms in the shop, for example.  Same with the player camp.  The choice should be "do I want just a few cherry picked things that the premium service offers as a permanent unlock, or is it better for me to sub every month to get those things PLUS other bonuses?
---
Well I pay you if you find it again
---
Good idea for categories.  But some ‚Äútrash‚Äù might actually be there to sell to lower folks or whatnot.   It‚Äôs not always bait and switch.
---
I will
---
Yeah my idiot teammates just leave if they get downed. This game has no communication in it so this challenge is virtually impossible solo
---
Now that‚Äôs a nuke
---
No one kills the queen instantly.
---
Plus half the challenges are auto completing and not awarding score. Bethesda support said they won't give it to you. Fuck em glitch to the top.
---
yo yo dog, far harbor be up it that maine shizane n shit, it is a real island in maine named bar harbor, also fuck Maine's name, it doesn't fucking Austin correct (autocorrect not Austin correct wtf)
---
Counter point: I‚Äôm not hoarding legendaries.
---
What makes you think I am? I have 4 legendary weapons that I carry around on my character. You know what the rest of my stash contains? A few power armor sets and a shit ton of junk. I don‚Äôt have enough space for all of it so I will continue to pester Bethesda about it seeing as this is a looting survival game and we can‚Äôt separate our stuff into containers
---
the toon im leveling still has shit gear.. I need the lone wanderer right now...
---
was thinking about it tho..
---
stop cheating you degenerate!
---
Oh, level 62 is fairly normal for charred ghouls. Yeah, I just found it best to sneak in there and grab the sword and run at low level for that quest. At your level, if you can get ahold of a plasma pistol and find the flamer tip mod for it at one of the station shops (can't remember which ones atm, the one by top of the world perhaps? but look online) that flamer effect helps alot with groups of ghouls!
---
I think the big issue is Bethesda's ability (or lack thereof) to design effective crafting UI, if they won't/can't do a simple thing like allowing purified water to replace boiled water in recipes, then making a bench based ammo exchange is way out of their league.
---
Sure, then people who are sitting on millions of gold scrap can get all the plans instantly and sell their account for real money.
---
I'll give you one for free if you still need it
---
You're probably right, I do qsueeze in an extra hour or two here and there, and the day after it went live I had a 3-4 hour block to play (although a lot of it was wasted just managing inventory, and redoing my shops)
---
Did you find them or buy them? Cause you gotta find them
---
We don‚Äôt need yet another form of currency.
---
Got it
---
pc? cuz I was doing that for people a lot earlier today lol
---
Yea it's says an equivalent of a R9 285 but I'm not far from that and a freaking 650 ti boost was able to run it
---
They‚Äôre so heavy, they‚Äôre an utter waste of space for the damage they deal. Not unlike missiles and mini nukes üôÑ
---
I‚Äôve been dropping them.
---
Bethesda: ‚ÄúWAIT! Are you sure?? These are *special*! Dropping will destroy them D:‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm very, very, very sure.
---
I shouldn‚Äôt have to leave valuable gear on the ground because of scrip limits. Essentially you‚Äôre saying I should just stop playing after I hit the daily limits and that‚Äôs horrible game design but great mobile game design
---
they should have a legendary perk that makes grenades explode on contact
---
When half the challenges auto complete not awarding score and Bethesda says sorry nothing we can do I really don't feel bad if someone does it.
---
This is why I'm wearing the imposter sheepsquatch suit, gives my bb mothman some super huge hair.
---
how bout' fuckin' Alabama, deformed humans due to incest (just like real life ;) )and there can be some sort of Confederate shit due to Alabama being important n shit also, fuck Alabama I like Hawaii more that you. (fuck all 40 other state only these states are good, Kentucky, west Virginia, Alaska, Hawaii, Maryland, Maine, Wyoming {even if it is fake}, Ohio, Texas, and Mississippi.).
---
But that‚Äôs entire point of bulking it so they need to address that
---
no wonder i‚Äôve been going around and no one has had it. i‚Äôve been checking aid on the world map!
---
Hmm, that seams reasonable.
---
Wow, the level of cluelessness here is breathtaking.
---
Read the terms of service, by playing this game you agree to not
---
&gt; Promote, upload, transmit, encourage or take part in any activity involving hacking, cracking, phishing, **taking advantage of exploits or cheats** and/or distribution of counterfeit software and/or Virtual Currency or virtual items.
---
Just because Bethesda has a history of going easy on people, both to likely avoid public backlash but primarily for the fact that the game is so shitily designed that it makes tracking cheaters difficult in the first place, doesn't mean they don't go after people and won't go after more in  the future.  Like I said, the reason Bethesda doesn't ban a lot of people is because they have a hard time telling apart the actual cheaters and hackers and the people whose only "crime" was buying something someone else cheated to get.
---
There's a difference between a glitch and an exploit.  If I find out I can make myself immortal and stack an exp bonus, I report it to bethesda, I wait for it to run out and I don't try doing it every again.  That is encountering a glitch.  If I find out I can make myself immortal and stack an exp bonus and then use that knowledge to make myself an unkillable god that can level up from farting on a radroach I have taken that glitch and exploited the ever living fuck out of it.
---
It is going to be ridiculously easy for Bethesda to track the people that have been using these exploits and hit them with the ban hammer without the need to worry about hitting a single innocent soul.
---
There is very little I can think of that I think maybe we shouldn‚Äôt bug Bethesda about
---
That's great if you have a portable camp - mine is fit to a riverbed and it wouldn't place anywhere else. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to place it in the exact same spot again.
---
Why the fuck are you taking a generic statement and taking it as a personal attack?  Take the stick out of your ass and then leave it on the ground instead of putting it in your stash.
---
Yes pc!
---
Look for camps that have hundreds or even thousands of plans in their vendors.  They most likely will all be from the duped holiday gifts, which the plasma mine was included in.  Don't pay more than a couple hundred caps for it, there are tons of them out there.
---
And you think punishing players for not grinding every day is a good thing? You do you but they are cutting it really tight. 
---
A better incentive would be offering extra rewards for those who finish faster. Nothing that makes you feel like you‚Äôre missing out - perhaps just a player icon or something so that way you can show off your grind while simultaneously not offending anyone who completed it slower. This way they can give extra time for the season without ignoring those who dedicate their time and money into it more than others
---
The entire point of bulking is taking pieces of scrap whose values would be fractions of caps and allowing us to sell them to vendors.
---
Not for most Ultracite ammo.
---
Tell me about it, the lack of stash and, more importantly, the lack of that mothman emote are starting to kill me.
---
Every time I do Path to Enlightenment and I‚Äôm surrounded by people doing the moth man dance and I can‚Äôt join in I‚Äôm like - FML.
---
Same here. I've had it since it showed up last year and when they added it into the atom shop again it takes my cloth and gives me the xp but doesn't put the hat in my inventory. Sad panda.
---
Thank you for someone who understands
---
VS the first reply person.....
---
Couldn‚Äôt wait anymore and did it at lvl 48 and got the weapon but level 45. Doesn‚Äôt bother much to be honest since I can start working on notes and gold
---
Fine that too. It costs me plastic dammit lol
---
No clue why people are down voting a great feature they advertised.
---
I like to move around a lot so I‚Äôd rather move my camp for free on worlds that it can‚Äôt be placed.
---
With that engine I bet it is. It wouldn't be that hard to implement (load some camp positions first, as in, just a point, draw a circle around them and compare to the point/circle of the player), but even I would place that pretty low on the neverending list of stuff that needs fixing/rework.
---
10 within the last 2 days, I report nothing happens
---
I honestly expect the ammo converter to show up as a reward every season.
---
No I want it so my gf and myself and my 2 other feidns don't spend a hour each session building everything back up vs maintainer
---
u/msrsegraves talks good sense.
---
And if you don‚Äôt have either?
---
I could understand if I had to recapture and all the stuff I built is there
---
But to fully regain it all and build it all again.... Ugh
---
LMFAO
---
And people say
---
What about blueprints
---
They never ever work.
---
Noted
---
Then why can't I host my own private.
---
To add to your nighty nightwear party,
---
Have everyone in the party stash all their weapons and armor before drinking the nukashine. They then have to try to make their way back without fast traveling....
---
Yes !
---
You're assigning value to things that are by all means worthless.  If you don't want to use something then what value is there in keeping it in  your stash?  If no one else would want to buy it what value is there in putting it in  your vendor?  If you can pick up a dozen more tomorrow  to trade in for scrip what value does that particular item have right now when it's just dead weight?
---
Just because something exists doesn't mean you have to extract every ounce of value from it or you're missing out.
---
Where I placed mine I thought no one buildon it, yesterday took me 20 mins to find a open world.
---
For each piece, so up to +15.
---
Maybe but you have to deal 1000 dmg to get a drop, it has happened several times to me, someone with duped legacy melting her before people deal enough damage.
---
The outfit has been bugged for a while I‚Äôve heard.
---
This is a known bug and has been known for a while now. No fixes mentioned
---
You are aware thats a meme and nothing more right?

Egrogey is my player name ill be on in an hour or two

üòî
---
Normal programming knowledge doesn't seem to apply to Fallout 76 hahah  
---
Ok, jokes aside, i figure the game clients awaits a response from the server synchronously before proceeding. That gives a ping in the figures of 100ms which is not unusual (which means that the game won't proceed until the server responds or the connection times out in which case you'll be bumped to the main menu)  
---
They may do it because in the case the server doesn't respond you won't loose your crafted items and/or materials.  
---
Also, Just to be clear: i'm a programmer but never worked in the game industry. Still there are lot of things that i can know. Writing a spinbox for each digit in the vending machine's pricing popup is trivial. Changing HUD colors and storing the setting in some file should be trivial and may other QoL tweaks like most stuff related to the GUI.
---
Also don‚Äôt forget to share cards sharing is caringüëç
---
Why didn't you just disconnect....
---
Spoiler: it doesn't.

If I can turn that scrip in now then I won‚Äôt have to spend time doing so getting more drops tomorrow and when there‚Äôs absolutely no way to have a good chance to get what I want the most efficient way I can go about doing I want to. Idk but I‚Äôve never played a game where I‚Äôve had to just walk away from potentially useful gear either I could sell it or something but this game is so capped it‚Äôs crazy
---
I actually originally bought Fallout 1st with the Microsoft currency (It didn't ask me for a backup payment option, bought it immediately when it went live last year) so i don't see why you wouldn't be able to do so. As for Gift Card itself?: VERY good question OP, one that my girlfriend would like to know as well.
---
I'm pretty sure you could; I mean if you can use your normal Microsoft/PlayStation currency for it then I'm sure you can just type in the code of the Gift Card and get it like that. But very good question nonetheless.
---
This particular question i have goes out to current Fallout 1st members (Hopefully one of you may know what I'm talking about/have an explanation as to why this happens):
---
Weird thing though: When my girlfriend tried to get Fallout 1st via Microsoft currency (She had over $180 worth of Microsoft currency at the time on her account) it kept asking her for a 'Backup payment option', weird how it never asked me that. Even today (when i looked at it on Xbox.com on my account) still no 'Please select a backup payment option' requirement. (It's optional on my end though)
---
So I'm not entirely sure why it asks her that, i would like to hear what other Fallout 1st members (Who pays with the Xbox/PlayStation currency) have to say about that. Because I'm still stumped on that, i honestly can't figure out why it even asked that even though she had well over the required amount to pay it for a year. I tried personally looking it up for any reasons as to why it would ask that for (I even looked again today because 'why not' plus it still boggled my mind.) Could it have been an error or something else?
---
Again I'm very curious on that one Thoughts/suggestions?
---
How do yall even hit the scrip cap?
---
Don't you put that evil on me, Ricky Bobby!
---
Jesus Christ, how fucking hard is it for Bethesda to make it that players can't be turned to ash/goo, God Mode disabled.
---
Also thank you for the pleasant back and forth. Always happy to hear the game is improving. Very glad to hear it all. :D
---
What if the whole map got nuked.
---
Damn right.  I turned off line wanderer and shared bodyguards for everyone.
---
omg you're so mean I wet myself
---
You also get more than enough of it from scrapping other things, I end up needing to sell ~20 every time I visit a vendor
---
(MODUS intensifies)
---
(Synths show up, with crypto currency)
---
damn synths
---
I try to message people and ask what they have before I throw stuff on there so I don‚Äôt mess up someone‚Äôs build those berserkers and bloodieds get mad when you mess with their builds üòÇ
---
It may be easy now, but who's to say after the season ends how something was acquired? They obviously have very little to no audit trail for anything that's happening in the game.
---
Make a reddit post/friend that can help ya now and for future ones.
---
Or an alt, but thats a bit of a pain.
---
i would say that for some of us rnjesus hates us and he was clear about not wanting shop spawn
---
Ward parkour
---
Ahh I might be passed out by then haha it'll be pretty late here
---
Tomorrow then
---
Start a new character every couple of days for the level up.
---
Ditch better criticals. Criticals are only 50pct of the base damage and are not affected by rifleman perks, adrenalin, covert, sandman etc..
---
3 points equals 20 pct more damage on a shot which only processes once every 3 shots at the most.
---
If you do the math 1 perk point towards better criticals equals 2.2pct more damage per shot at the most. Not worth it. Critical Savvy or Grim Reaper is where the value is.
---
Getting downvoted by Todd‚Äôs boot lickers I see. Well, my single upvote won‚Äôt fix much but every little helps.
---
Also: Free fast travel to their camps and tents. Cuts down a lot on travel costs.
---
The funny thing is that it's literally an option in the INI. They just need to (mostly) copy paste the menu options from FO4 to make it active here, but asking Bethesda to get one of the interns to put a couple hours towards a much requested feature *might* be a bit much for them.
---
I don't think there's a legacy that can melt the queen
---
Its easier to get rid of the trap as it would give then resources and take them like one minute to find it to get rid if it if it was actually hidden
---
I am indeed. 
---
Adrenal reaction, bird bones, carnivore, speed demon, herd mentality, marsupial, scaly skin, healing factor and eagle eyes right now, with caps for one more
---
The fireplace and the planets/stars wallpaper. So far to go :(
---
Yeah, it would be nice to have several raids where groups are mandatory coupled with a find group mechanic. Kinda like Division does it, just set difficulty and hit search - it should also search globally and not only on the current server.
---
Lower levels enjoy getting those things.
---
That works I have the day off!
---
Awww, She missed you!
---
BETHESDA NEEDS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN! 
---
The undersides of the ceilings are so ugly, no reason they shouldn‚Äôt be wallpaperable.
---
True, nobody is gonna buy a 3* shit gun for 6999 caps and so on. Stash space is fine as it is
---
Well it's not going to solve my issue right now so, what's the point?
---
On my PS4 the audio is off by default and I have to manually enable it every time I play under settings &gt; chat
---
Cool it with the personal attacks. I know what I'm talking about. I've glitched plenty in this game, things I should have gotten banned for many times over, and I'm still here. It got so blatant that at some point I didn't even try to hide it anymore.
---
Bethesda. Does not. Care. A lot more people than you think are using glitches and exploits to shortcut the dumb and pointless grinds in this game and get straight to the fun. You should try it sometimes, it can be quite liberating.
---
Thanks. I know the lyrics. I just happened to be out walking those mountains last week and it was on my mind.
---
Well I got it and it's great looking! Only problem is I'm not able to place certain wall decor over it? Keeps reeling me the item needs support :(
---
You are right about the event group thing. I have started avoiding those groups when do dailies and instead join the builders groups (or start my own). It gives me more freedom to do what I want.
---
On console it's been pretty common for people to use the phone app to send messages via text. Lots of people don't have a mic for a variety of reasons. Most people won't get annoyed if you join a team without a mic and for the rare ones who do, that's their problem and you can always just leave and join a different team. ;)
---
Never seen the trap
---
Yep. It‚Äôs no mothman PA.
---
Actually they haven‚Äôt had any decent-looking skins (apart from mothman) for ages now.
---
I'm like 90% certain that the game often sees the player hitting retry as the obstacle blocking camp placement on subsequent attempts.
---
Oh it is I don‚Äôt do the NW quest an been using the 10k exp one to fill the gap just hit Lv 26 with the very well rested buff from a lunch box was getting like 500+ exp a kill on some max level stuff if I could have that all the time omg lol
---
Wow thought there would be more positive comments
---
Y fix godmode? Being able to get lvl 100 score in a couple hours and not needing to play for 4 months is the best thing to happen to this game
---
It's less of a "can't" and more of a "won't", because it's only an engine limitation until it isn't. Remember, they told us for years that it wasn't possible to separate physics from FPS, but the moment people figured out they could use that to their advantage they patched that shit out within days of it becoming an issue.
---
its content, if you dont like it you dont have to play
---
I've got such a problem with being close to max caps that I recently swapped out Travel Agent and have completely given up on reducing fast travel costs. The game has become much more enjoyable not sitting through double loading screens all the time trying to minimize my spent caps. I'm still making more caps than I spend even when I'm regularly spending 55-60 caps going from one end of the map to the other.
---
I suppose this is more of a humble brag than anything since I know that my situation isn't the normal for the average player. But oh man can I tell you how nice it is not caring about caps and just playing the game.
---
I would like some prostitute outfits from New Vegas, especially for a male, would love to turn my character into Van Darkholme.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Chained_prostitute_outfit
---
Thank goodness, I thought I was the only one who hates this yellow, I just want my green for aesthetic beauty
---
as long as they dont have those timers. that shit made it impossible due to server lag (even after they "fixed" it". either that, or they have to just be 100% combat and not be reliant on a bunch of interactable objectives that relies on server communication.
---
with bethesda track record however, they would likely release a raid with a 10 second timer and delete your account if you fail, so im not holding my breath.
---
Let‚Äôs just meet in the middle and call it laziness because if they weren‚Äôt cheap/lazy they would‚Äôve scrapped this engine before f04 even came out
---
I‚Äôm saving that one for when I really want something in atomic shop lol
---
How about diablo where you leave anything thats not unique on the ground? Make priorities. Back in the day we used to leave anything that wasnt tse on the ground, kids these days are lucky useless crap legendaries even have a purpose
---
I second this... you know, for science.
---
What is the "new" content ?  I see the same content we had with a skin on top. If your only defense is dont like it dont play it, that's a pitiful response to criticism.
---
It even goes against logic and justice in the game. I have become accustomed to using friendly fire to heal allies, as in the paradise project or the west tunnel, but that prevents me from shooting the attackers or the alpha, so I miss my rewards, although many times my work is key to the mission goes ahead. Yet another inconsistency.
---
For me it's junk. Each time I get to 700/800 stash space, I've got to dump my junk.
---
but can you still complete the gold star one?
---
lol thats gonna be a no for the PvP, i have enough things in my life liable to give me cancer, i dont need another.
---
That one above the mire town is fantastic. Giving me fallout 4 vibes. Is that harpers ferry or Berkeley springs?
---
Idk I don‚Äôt play Diablo but in Diablo was it just because they were inherently shittier quality or because you couldn‚Äôt do anything with them such as sell them
---
Well as for the hud, it can‚Äôt be recolored because it‚Äôs not monochrome anymore, the pipboy would work just fine but I bet it gets complicated when the new alternate view pipboy is involved.
---
My grandmother put Alien on for me when I was seven and watched it with me. She laughed at all the scary/gory stuff.
---
I... did not lol.
---
I forgot how to sleep for the rest of the year but damn, did I think she was just the coolest bitch ever. (She was, too.)
---
lol
---
Both. It was same principle where there was multiple tiers of rareness and each tier having more and better effects. After hours of playing and dealing with incredibly small stash you realise f everything and only pick up the best or make mules
---
If you were on Xbox I would have given you some!!! I‚Äôll upvote though!!
---
Also, the gore is mostly ridiculous in FO76, not scary.
---
I challenge anyone to equip Bloody Mess and not laugh every time a ghoul explodes into a stupid pile of limbs.
---
That glitch Works on every system sadly
---
I can never get enough high radiation fluids. I have near 300 of both mass's on a mule.
---
I see your point and Im just getting back into the game after a long break from launch. Im only level 27 at the moment and I havent met the limit. I do agree that the cap limits should be removed though. It just makes more sense. Or they can have a limit per stash box and just have to build a second one for more space.
---
Community managers frequent here, so I figured they wouod be able to ask
---
This is a dumb question. But is there a reason why empath is popular right now? I thought it made you take more damage which is probably not good for a bloodied build.
---
That sucked. 
---
I had not even seen a colossus up to this point.
---
I have literally never seen this in FO76, but even if it did, as a kid I remember a few tiny edgelords who‚Äôd come to school and trot out all the hideous racist jokes they‚Äôd no doubt learnt at home.
---
Kids are going to get exposed to racism wherever they are. Rather than shielding them, better to teach them how to respond.
---
I estimate I have turned in about 400 all together. I have gotten 3 Paladin and 1 Elder.
---
God...400. Those were the days, when you couldn‚Äôt stay in a server for more than 10 minutes without crashing. When it was a 50/50 chance if your quests broke and you were just stuck at the same point for days. In all seriousness, this game has issues, but I‚Äôm so happy with how far it‚Äôs come.
---
If you‚Äôre happy to not access your camp for that session, it will still be where you left it next time you log in.
---
I got you if you need the flux, Add me X_Gil225
---
How does this get 1k+ upvotes when this is suggested at least 5 times a week?
---
Most of us are but are checking on venders for something to do
---
I have done so so so many technical data and only gotten Knight and one other lesser rank plan.   I saw Elder for sale in a vendor today for 13k and I didn't even hesitate.
---
Yea i only sell ammo so yea üòÇ
---
Its even worse now.
---
Throw some mediocre scrip weapons on and you will sell your ammo better
---
Hey man, it‚Äôs what makes it even more fun! I‚Äôve been playing RDR2 for months and I‚Äôm STILL finding new, seemingly obvious stuff. It‚Äôs awesome!
---
Had a moment to look at the link, but don't see where it calculates XP per minute.
---
Radiation Rumble, Ward hopping, SBQ, are what it try and focus on, oh, and Distant Thunder, and others I can't remember the name of.
---
That seems cruel üòÇ
---
I stopped keeping track a long time ago
---
Honestly, i stopped asking for things when each fix made the game worse. There is 1000s of things we would like to be fixed but i doubt they ever will be unfortunately.
---
If this new rewards system necessitates a burner alt, that's distinctly a problem on the reward system's end.
---
no, no, not at all. People will buy scrip weapons if they are cheap (generally 100c per star is acceptable). I buy scrip weapons if I feel to lazy to farm for legendary's that day
---
Hey now! Those low level knuckles will sell one day! You'll see! You'll all see!
---
you can pick up the plan for the small backpack in the morgantown airport.. skins work on that too..
---
Degenerates like you belong on a - nah, I'm just messing with ya, I'm all for this.
---
Is it moddable? I want to make it high capacity.
---
They don't have the Spank! version from the game anymore. They used to, but it was only a partial version.  It's disabled now.
---
It's a shame too because the voices are wonderful for it. It's absolutely my favorite version of the song.
---
They do have the full version of the same group's cover of Ring of Fire.
---
This actually worked...helped that the guy had a mic and I used the emotes...he needed one more revive too so it worked out great for the two of us.
---
Yes, but the capacity is lower
---
What's your Xbox GT? I'd love to add you as a friend.
---
Anyone know if this was fixed?  Worked last night and this morning, hasn‚Äôt worked several times this afternoon and evening.
---
Do you know how much lower? I‚Äôve been over encumbered for 2 irl days because I‚Äôm over my carry weight by 65.
---
Sometimes.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Small_backpack
---
Source?
---
Ill check just tell me how to recreate! I need to know now.
---
I think so.
---
I would be okay with not being able to equip armor if I got this outfit or any of the other prostitution outfits.
---
It‚Äôs an anti-social game... like there‚Äôs not even basic text chat, it‚Äôs just FO4 modified to allow several people to play at the same time. There wasn‚Äôt even matchmaking until a few days ago
---
Also legendaries should automatically go to your inventory. I can‚Äôt stand doing encriptid the hardest and worst event in the game imo and then looking around for the metal pile among the dozens that actually has the drop
---
Is it only obtainable in NW?
---
glitch nukes is a thing
---
Ah i see i may start doing that. 100caps per star seems nice
---
Same, I always go white. I don't care for a white HUD, but the flashlight looks the best that way imo.
---
Ah ok. Thanks!!
---
It was the single biggest problem with the raid participation, a huge portion of the player base never even entered the vault because finding an interested group wasn't easy and the confirmation terminal put them off.
---
My group found them fun, they were far from ideal, but should have been tweaked rather than removed.  They were the most interesting, challenging content in the game, requiring great communication for expert was awesome.  When things didn't bug the chaos was perfect.  
---
I agree rewards should give ammo scrap supplies and some meds to make it worth it, and definitely scrap the time limits, enemies should just be buffed for difficulty.
---
Public teams aren't the whole solution, but a step towards one.
---
Ah that would be a huge help, lowest level you could make it would be great. I could provide the screws if you want, what‚Äôs your PSN?
---
the small backpack is ok, but the possum badge high capacity was a relief, BUT a grind (8 posssum badges). the repeatable quests help get possum badges (stings and things, waste removal, and campfire tales event) ended up completing 5 of the possum world challenges, and got 3 badges from a week of doing the dailies. Worth it in the end.
---
Did I say it would always be easy?  The important thing would be to catch the people being flagrant about it right now when it is.  
---
If people would be "smart" about it and just exploit bit by bit each week to give themselves a believable edge or make up for missed challenges it would of course be more difficult to catch, but that would also require a level of restraint you're unlikely to find in these sorts of people in the first place, cheaters aren't  going to cheat so they can eventually unlock something two days ahead of everyone else a month from now.
---
Nuke tangara with a buddy the next chance you get. Then look for the YouTube vid.
---
I have full t 65 and my main complaint is that WHY the hell is there NO bright headlamp!!! Or any headlamp for that matter!
---
I'm 13 and would also like to say that this game is actually not as bad as everyone one is saying. I was originally probably never gonna buy the game because of all the bad reviews, until I was at a Gamestop one time and saw Fo76 for only 10 bucks (pre-owned) I got it, it was in great condition, I tried it and was in love with it. I think Fallout 76 is a pretty decent game in my opinion... Except for all the bugs, crashes, etc like you said. Had the game for some where around a month or two now. So I'm kind of a newbie... Even tho I am lvl 118.
---
you should try regular armor.. 
---
unyielding set would probably change your life..
---
Just hit 26 grinding like a mad man lol
---
It just means you are switching to a berserker build!
---
That actually makes sense, since I play from NZ my ping is around 160ish so that explains a lot! Thanks man!
---
It‚Äôs not that there‚Äôs a lack of said rule, it‚Äôs that there‚Äôs a lack of enforcement of said rules.
---
With all my rounds this is such a waste of time.  Please clear the beach, 1 grain of sand at a time.  This is just an insult thrown at the real people supporting this game.
---
And to get tadpole for you have to do the exams and the challenges that correspond to the ‚Äústat‚Äù or are there daily quests for those?
---
I think they‚Äôre talking about the mining helmet. I wish they were talking about the mining hat cuz it‚Äôs my go to
---
Yep. Cranberry relish with herbivore and strange in numbers = 25% xp boost. It is easier to obtain the ingredient as well.
---
It isn't Repcon?
---
Bruh when do they ever fix things
---
I feel like it has been happening to me with the settlers...I‚Äôve seen and helped many throughout my travels and I swear it‚Äôs taking FOREVER to progress.
---
Two words: bloatfly syringer. It will change the way you farm.
---
Lore reason, it's a gen 1 pipboy.
---
ayy
---
Cheating as usual.
---
I‚Äôm a huge Fallout/Bethesda player, and I finally got back into 76 after the Wastelanders update. I‚Äôm loving it again. That being said, I only realized YESTERDAY that sharing perk cards is a thing. I‚Äôm reasonably intelligent, and, I thought, pretty observant, but I never noticed the ‚Äúshare option‚Äù before. I joined a public team yesterday and saw the little card icon next to my teammates‚Äô names. It dawned on me what this meant they were doing.
---
I thought this may be a small part of the problem, that it‚Äôs not ‚Äúadvertised‚Äù very well that we have this ability. Or maybe I‚Äôm the dense one.
---
I couldn't agree more
---
Intersting, it says on meat items 0 for the buff, but I never tried it, going to have to try.
---
Agree. I am huge on action points, so I love action boy and lone wanderer. That may change with public teams where I‚Äôm trying to max my XP for the Legendary Run.
---
They‚Äôre bringing 76 to game pass tho
---
If they were built before the patch they are grandfathered in.
---
But I can tell you there is another method that works
---
Almost every MMO ever?
---
I'd say it's definitely my favorite vault.
---
The clipping is really bad, so is this a bug on my character then, really odd.
---
FO4 has diamond city radio and classical versions and the radios have those and the minutemen radio as well. Don't get why juke is stuck with classical and the radio is only Appalachia.
---
They are rare to trade for because once you learn a plan, it will advance to the next available.  To find an 'extra' copy you'd need someone who sat and farmed whatever rank.  Just make it part of your regular 'route' and you'll get them all eventually.  PITA for sure, but not too hard to do.
---
Combo it with a gas mask. I use the moth man one from the atom shop
---
Just hit 25 grind grind grind
---
God mode with a laser and then using leader bobble heads or Nuka cranberries, placing items in your camp will give you something like 8,000 xp per placement
---
it's the side quest "The Order of the Tadpole"
---
some quests that become dailies, and the world challenges (go to map-&gt; challenges-&gt;world, scroll down to find Tadpole challenges)...
---
and yes, must do the exams for them to complete (there's lists of the answers online)....
---
after that you become a possum, snd then do the world challenges (w/ more exams) to get badges, but they sometimes drop from the dailies (helps to just go to the noc, or build a C.A.M.P. computer console to see if they're active
---
Has never worked...
---
In four days. 1/4 of the way. Yep 100 really does seem impossible doesn‚Äôt it lol.
---
Yeah! That's also super great. But 76 isn't anywhere close to the original games. The og games are top down tabletop esque role-playing games with a huge emphasis on story
---
I saw someone post yesterday that they were on level 30, they were grinding xp like crazy tho. He had a picture with the spaceship. I‚Äôve been grinding pretty hard and I just hit level 21 a couple hours ago
---
Elder is the last one.  If you learn it you won't get any more PA plans.
---
This is what I feel it should have been from the start. It makes no sense to be able to own one of these machines and in fact, build it yourself out of scrap metal and coffee makers, while having to still use its proprietary points.
---
[SS underarmor clips](https://imgur.com/gallery/1dgVmic)
---
Yes I‚Äôve played them but I‚Äôve never tried wasteland and idk if I should I‚Äôve also played fallout tactics
---
Yeah I got lucky today, got it in about an hour or so. I really hope they don't do things like this in the future.
---
It's honestly a really good game and I'd recommend it.
---
When did they add "fun"  back to the game? Last I checked they patched out "fun" after the first week of Wastelanders.
---
Honestly, I came across a trap camp with punji boards, confetti pitfalls, radiation emitter rooms... I thought it was amazing. A true Fallout experience. Like falling prey to a cannibal predator. Keeps you on your toes, and if you're dumb enough to fall for it a second time, then by Darwin, you probably deserve it. I'm expecting a lot of butt-hurt downvotes with this comment.
---
Just curious how you hit it so fast? Through the xp repeatable score right?
---
I just want the basic game to work. The 250 DRWR bug is still there, they just broke adrenaline, shotguns still rubber band like crazy, but are ungimped/bugged (how it should be) if you have specific less damage effects on armor....  Fix the basics is all I want.
---
Ok I may give it a try
---
Let me know what you think! It's a bit obtuse to get a feel for, but once you figure everything out it's a blast.
---
Thanks everyone, I got the Ghillie but what coat are you talking about? I was pretty consistent in the last 10 and several times finshed second to a team of three. I was dying from one shot even though I have a very tanky build and It was difficult killing others.
---
Another feature by Bugthesda
---
Oof, shouldn't have done that.  Not that the price was unreasonable, but you'll lock yourself out of the others you may not know.
---
Not really. Done the daily each day but not the NW one on 3 of them and I‚Äôve completed the weekly. Which took about an hour.
---
damn synths...
---
(yes, it's a bug, something fell into the underworld as is hitting you (somehow) from there)
---
Lol it‚Äôs a joke welcome to the new gaming world catering to the casual player as a beta player this is sad
---
Lvl 50 AA/25%ffr/15%crit meter the fixer
---
Anyone doing this on Xbox? It took me forever to get 1 revive and I suck so bad at NW that I usually just die before I even get to do anything.
---
But the NW quests can actually be fun. Like today's for example, watching so many people jump off building for revives was pretty funny.
---
Yeah , they still break shit lol
---
I missed the first day. Not sure what rank I stopped at earlier. The one where I unlocked the bow skin??? I‚Äôm about to unlock the first card pack. Saw someone with the jangles backpack already and I was like ‚Äòhow‚Äô....
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying, but imagine a low level losing a bunch of junk because someone decided to be an asshole. 
---
Also a trap base is one thing, but being invisible in your base waiting for me to purchase some junk (i.e. flux) then killing me isn‚Äôt ‚Äúamazing‚Äù.
---
Playing lots lol. 10000 cap isn‚Äôt a huge amount. Adds up. Like I said I‚Äôve not played a tonne
---
Yet again time to be afraid what they break IF they manage to fix Adrenaline...
---
It's on YouTube, not quite the same but it's something
---
I usually go for the high capacity and the Armour plated so that‚Äôs 13 badges, it took ages the first time but did all the tadpole badges and 5 possum badges yesterday.
---
I should get the other 8 in the next few days by doing the quests and a few more challenges.
---
Once you know what to do it‚Äôs relatively quick, for example 10 minutes in Morgantown can get you several challenges completed, killing mobs at rail terminals can also complete the musical weapon, fat man and railway gun challenge, etc
---
I think there was a guide &amp; map around a while back that showed where to go.
---
(player returns to watoga, after they went through nuke zone in only their hazmat suit) 
---
"No... no... NOOOOOOOOO"
---
I saw a video of a guy dropping a stack of punji boards on customers... THAT is not ok, I agree.
---
No just assume that your friend is jealous of your spot and wants you to move so he can take it.
---
not so secret underarmor
---
Secret Service UA is a stocky UA which I love. The thinner UA are BOS and Wetsuit.
---
https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/woman-drinking-wine-from-pringles-can-on-cart-banned-from-walmart
---
It‚Äôs a thing
---
Thanks I was scared
---
It‚Äôs technically using an exploit, which is bannable, but I don‚Äôt think it really makes a difference, nor do I think it‚Äôs a giant concern to the devs.  
---
Just don‚Äôt get all nefarious with it.
---
It is. It‚Äôs called Bethesda Austin.
---
Same here. Ive tried not skipping through the conversation. Sometimes that works. Sometimes it doesnt.
---
18/100 and lost about 1000 score I think it was to 3 auto competed dailies.
---
I‚Äôve barely done a thing today, been playing NW for the Christmas beanie and outfit I missed.  
---
There is also a datamine of a repeatable being for events so perhaps it switches to that next week.  
---
Keep in mind the levels get 25 points tougher each day, so at one point it‚Äôll be all of your dailies just to get one level, then that won‚Äôt even do it.  Only a fool is going to spend atoms for level before the last day or two
---
if your base is deemed "incorrect" by bethesda, it'll force you to relocate (pack up all your stuff into storage, so you don't recrsft it, just place it. and an angry Vaultboy will shake his fist in the air
---
Good to know. im relatively new, (overseer 12, level 25 main story) so im not too familiar with the bugs. Pre-ordered the game and was dissapouinted when the game kept crashing and server booted me enough to quit till now
---
At 16, fuck Bugthesda 
---
Never gonna make it to get those gillie paints anyway so, only things i want
---
And what's wrong with that
---
I have low level alts hold my overflow legendaries until I can grind them up. I also have alts holding high value, but bugged weapons (shotguns, 250 DRWR, etc.).  Tempted to trash the 250 DRWR weapons as BGS is never going to really fix this. It's over a year and they canfian't fix a basic element of the game.
---
Enforcement of the rules is down to their limitations on tracking things, the difference here is that the usual limitations aren't involved.  
---
These aren't hacked weapons whose ids might otherwise be indistinguishable from normal weapons or duped items that have been spread throughout the community, they're very specific items they can easily look for that can't leave the accounts that unlocked them.
---
It's likely they have a system in place to track peoples progress so they can gauge how well the community is progressing and plan any tweaks or extra bonus weekends and they'd be able to pick out the people whose score points are beyond outliers.  
---
Even if they couldn't track that then we already know that it's possible for them to scan player inventories looking for items, if they know that no one should be able to have reached a certain point by now they can scan for that particular unlock on someone's account, likely extra easy since these are atom shop flagged items, and then flag the accounts they catch for review.
---
I wouldnt care id be beyond happy with that
---
This!
---
-Team Rewards for Quests
---
-XP Boost or other Team Perks
---
-Share Perks
---
All these things can happen naturally with randoms wich works great.
---
This challenge is discriminatory towards Bush Wookiees! Leave the safety of the bush to heal someone!? No thank you !
---
Put your tent completely on the road directly behind the middle opening in the fence and point the stairs toward the fort. If it works, they should all drop right in front of the sonic generator
---
Yep and 10 weeks is 70 days. By the time it becomes a level a day your going to have more days than levels left
---
It was actually like this at launch, but they changed it to how it is now
---
Well with the increase in score needed the last 1/4 will be as long as the other 3/4 of it XD
---
I had initiate and Knight for the longest time.  I was sure that having initiate bugged me out (have been around since beta).  I broke over a year of bad luck a few months ago and got knight cpt and srg I think it was with a few days, then back to nothing.  Perhaps they fixed something with a patch awhile back.
---
ü§¶ I feel so bad. I never actually read your post just the question (title of post) I actually have a spreadsheet that lists what's most important to keep and specific amounts. Here's a [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sg7L4P7UT4mycr7JF-aXvf5gjFtsyAfUH3qjeiV03y8/edit?usp=drivesdk) to it. It also says if you can and should bulk it or not. 
---
Note: I got it from a Reddit post that was posted like 2 years ago and has been archived üòÅ (if I knew how to tag people I would tag the creator of this spreadsheet). I use it all the time even though I have Fallout 1st.
---
I don't think so, but it's as much XP again to earn the next reward
---
Jack o lantern armour is 7k XP, glowing skeleton is 14,000
---
Yep so you‚Äôll have to work for it. But the daily‚Äôs take an hour maximum and if that‚Äôs a level a day it‚Äôs easily achievable
---
You can't do it with the clean one! For no reason.
---
it‚Äôs in the nuke silos
---
Angry turtle posted a video about alternate uses for some of the silly group types in the public groups and he recommended using building as the default for being solo grouped/ for non-event groups. I like the idea so when I'm not doing events I always either join if one exists or start if none exists a Building Group
---
Correct. I haven't learned yet hoping to get a couple more elder plans.
---
I had a similar occurrence yesterday. A bag full of plans at Pleasant Valley Station ‚Äî like hundreds of plans including all the Raider PA ones, the mounted heads from the Scorched event and heaps of others. I kept what I didn‚Äôt have and left the rest. Thanks fellow plan hoarder!
---
I love this game and I‚Äôll probably get to 100 but dam it does not seem worth it tho, I just hope they leave the XP repeatable there for double XP, if they do that I‚Äôll forgive them for the bad screaming eagle and ammo converter XD
---
I want a Transfer Box that can hold.. I donno... 200lbs.   And it is like a shared bank between my toons.
---
It's useful for making crossbow bolts out of .38 &amp; 10mm ammo. Arrows and bolts use adhesive and aluminum to craft so that's what I'm using it for ( and probably will only use it for that). Let's see what they come up with as a 'fix' to the crappiness it is now.
---
No it‚Äôs just legendary mods only, but yesterday with the lunch boxes and all the other XP buffs I used I was getting around 850xp per super mutant kill, so I got too 23 so far
---
Ok thanks for being in depth. Guess I‚Äôll just buck up. Hahaha.
---
There‚Äôs a datamine if repeatable events as well.  I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs not that one for double XP
---
Or, I don't know, don't tell people how to play and let them play how they want to play? Scavenging is a huge part of the gameplay loop...
---
i‚Äôm sorry to be the one to tell you that Dr. Zorbo isn‚Äôt a real person.
---
So 4x xp on the queen. That helps!
---
Should have both on at the same time
---
Nope and everyone else‚Äôs pip boy light will be that color
---
Yeah, don't learn it if you want to farm paints.  I had to use a 2nd character to get them all because I learned Paladin? and missed all the Knight ones.
---
Yeah but tbh I lose IQ every time I go three that nuke silo XD
---
Must have done it over 1000 times now
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking before but I wanted to get a second opinion first, I was hoping that my pip boy would be unique with a different color lmao
---
The basic leather armor looks pretty bad ass as a set.
---
Playing Uranium fever like 2 or 3 times (assuming people let you hit enemies before killing them)
---
That would just improve the value.
---
Not being able to trade or even having restrictions hurts their value.
---
Fuck Bethesda and their unnecessary and unrewarding grind.
---
This post is correct. Seen a lot if them, anywhere from 100 to 700 caps i would say. Just don't get stressed out when you see it expensive, it is not uncommon i guess and prices are all over the place.
---
legacy punji camp blueprints
---
Her companion quest or the repeatable? Guessing her actual quest but if it's the repeatable you can server hop
---
They locked it because they're updating it for the brotherhood's arrival in autumn, I would have expected them to catch that though, you'll probably have to submit a bug report
---
Well as of now only like 1.2% of PlayStation users have the achievement for being allies with Crater so I can‚Äôt speak for every console but seemingly almost no one here much cared to or knew how to cheat Rocksy lol
---
Gotcha. Yeah, I definitely see that, then.
---
Could be worse, though. It could be on the same update pace as RDO... Lol
---
Nah Todd daddy wouldn‚Äôt like that
---
Good thing it's not necessary then. For high levels, the level up daily works nicely with the repeatable XP challenge. 
---
And maybe this is a hot take, but players that only log in for 15 minutes every day to knock out the quick challenges shpuldn't get as much SCORE as the players putting in an hour or more.
---
What are you talking about?  This is new engaging content.  I enjoy after working a full day, coming home and having only a short window to unwind at home.  So I choose pop on Fallout 76 to do short rewarding quests with my level 350 character like collecting wood.  Then I get to switch to a level 5 character and run around land get 1 level.  Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt have time for my favorite Fallout related activity, sitting crouched in a bush.
---
If I could take a moment to give the designers a few ideas for additional daily quests for the currency SCORE or as I like to refer to it...SNORE:
---
250 SNORE:   Let your controller idle and allow the camera to spin 50 times
---
250 SNORE: Be in loading screens for 30 minutes
---
250 SNORE: Get disconnected from a server 5 times 
---
Hope this helps!
---
10 years along? Congratulations dude, my condolences im sorry for your loss, this community can be incredible at times please take care.
---
My friend, if the score challenges aren't giving score and you still have to do 90% - 95% of the challenges to get to max, then plenty of people won't hit it. It might not take long if you're adamant about the challenges. But for a game to cut it that close on the season pass promotes buying tiers. The fact that people are doing xp glitches to hit the max bc the system is so flawed is a staple to the design of Bethesda. Make the game ludicrously difficult to grind (not missing more than 14 days) and adding in paid tier-ups, all while presumably banning people that exploited to the top (bc it literally affects nobody except Bethesda who loses money.) I admire your optimism but it is a bleak outlook.
---
Okay so an edit is in order here: The first section has been easy to get through. That's the half I was refering to. Getting to rank 19 with dailies and weekly's, and some side missions. Even if it does get more difficult to get the repeatable I don't forsee a reason I couldn't finish the entire season. Granted the 15+ hours a week I put in is probably more than most people can do.
---
Even if I do wind up having to spend some atoms at the end to finish the season, most of them will be the free atoms I earned along the way. Render unto ceaser...
---
Random Thought:
---
Nuka Shine event where everyone in the event drinks a nuka shine at the same time and whoever gets back first wins. No ft and no map.
---
You're almost a quarter of the way there, mostly just from grinding the thing that give you the *least* amount of score... I'd say you're doing just fine
---
Well damn....fuck that.
---
My FO4 was insanely awesome.. that's all I'm gonna say ;)
---
What I‚Äôm talking about is the daily level grind. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not referring to any of the other challenges.
---
Not only that...but also in the Pip-boy
---
The Plasma Mine plan was basically priceless before the Holiday event.  The Plasma Grenade got all the attention because you need it to complete the scout stuff.  Both dropped from the same pool, equally rare.  Some people are unaware of the problems that came with the gifts and dupes, sadly neither are worth much anymore.  (Traded a huge load for Plasma Grenade, but I AM the scout master)
---
Well I can‚Äôt speak for every console but as of now only 0.6% of PS4 users have the trophy for being allies with Crater. So technically almost nobody cared to cheat or grind Crater lol
---
Nah dude I can drop the sbq in a hit with my bloodied ffr gauss shotgun it means that‚Äôs a power gun
---
I‚Äôm just not looking forward to the last 25 levels of it since the score required keeps going up, it feels like the last 25 levels are going to take just as long as the past 75
---
Holy shit, this! I have a 720p LCD. Ancient by current gen standards. I have such a hard time reading text in the game. Depending on how harsh the contrast and light is behind subtitles or viewing player vendors, I don't even try to read it. Anyone else have this issue with the game? So, besides custom colors, customizable text backdrop shadows would also be very nice.
---
And what the fuck is it about the map screen options? The bid selections are clearly highlighted, but Photo Gallery and below are smaller and very thinly underlined. Many times, I'll mean to click on Photo Gallery or Settings and hit the option next to it. That design choice has always perplexed me.
---
I only got 1 response about the weekly challenge bug. I am waiting a second response now...
---
My guess is the system was chosen for stability reasons. You convert items from player inventory into seperately stored tokens now. Breaking down would split each .38 into a primer, casing and bullet which would add even more items for the servers to track. Right now i just collect .38 again (which i left behind before), convert those and let it hand me .45 ammo which still sells, but slower.
---
Thats kind of bad damage tbh...
---
Truth be told, buy legendary mod thing for 50.  Buy em up and save them till you get 50 and finish the storyline and can make your own legendary weapons
---
But the best tip would be to only spend atoms on the last day, for example if u spend atoms when your low on the pass your not really getting your money‚Äôs worth since the lower levels are easy
---
It's just that I dont even have commando perks, I'm a heavy gun build.
---
Unless you're at cap don't spend any before level 50 unless it's on vault steel or modules.
---
I use gunsmith. But with the amount of repair kits you can pick up and the relatively easy repair costs of a 50 cal you‚Äôll be fine with one or the other. And you could probably get away with not having either.
---
Facts
---
Someone did a calculation, and as long as you're getting your dailies and weeklies done, along with hitting the repeatable 1000 XP challenge at least once per day, you will be over the score requirement for all of the levels by like 7000 points iirc. Just keep it up, no need to grind so hard unless you *really* want those rewards early.
---
Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt even gamble with the purveyor before 50.At your level I would stock up on legendary modules then once I got to 50 depending on the rolls on my weapons  at lvl 50 I would continue to stock legendary modules for my ss armor rolls. If you are a Power Armor build then you can focus less on those legendary modules unless you want a Gauss mini gun or shotgun, in that case like I said. Before Legendary Modules
---
Oh crap lol yeah my builds hand crafted to put out a ridiculous amount of damage I bet ur gun is glitched where it‚Äôs base damage is nuclear winter plus the legendary effects same thing happened with laser weapons awhile back
---
I guess I wanna grind now so I have an insurance on getting it ya know? Because I don‚Äôt want to hop on this game every single day for the next 10 weeks straight
---
I know right, they're inferior. Like, I'd like to see them try to get past my typewriters.
---
Glad you were able to play again it really does help i know from personal experience, im sorry for your losses. Just remember they are always with you. I have lost a lot and gaming helps. And now I have my 9 year old gaming with me he even has his own profile and plays 76 with me bert102176 on Xbox.
---
I agree killing animals isn't fun, but you will rather starve to death then? I have a family of 5, what should my kids eat if not "murdered" animals?
---
Than what were ypu spending the free atoms on (before this score debacle)
---
No I feel you. I would give up all my legacy and broken weapons for a balanced Fallout experience. One that actually works and is full of content
---
Can I ask you one question, did you try regular armor?
---
Well I'm not a SMG or rifle build, I just picked it up and started using it
---
Us high levels have been in this game longer then a lot of you. We have as much as a right to play this game then anybody else. Not to mention you only need a few hits on a legendary there is none telling you to get the killing blow. Plus high levels will join events to farm rewards because it is literally the only end game content we have
---
You've got 7000 more to go. I just got the glowing skeleton suit tonight. I started from zero. It's the Christmas one that doesn't stack points.
---
Unyielding more AP, carry weight, xp etc
---
Might I direct you to r/eve?
---
Lots of credit card warriors there...
---
Understandable, neither do I. Just reassuring you that you dont need to grind unless you're wanting ths stuff earlier
---
Yeah exactly, to make the game challenging and the group events challenging more challenging instead of someone with a hacked weapons dealing 4K plus damage per shot
---
I was agreeing with you, albeit in a roundabout manner.  I pointed out that I switch characters to a lowbie if I don‚Äôt have the time to grind a level with my main.  This is of course ridiculous, that the most time efficient way to do the level up challenge is to be forced to switch to a level 5 or so character.
---
This coincides with other poor designs choices.  The most efficient way to level in NW, if you are not capable of consistently winning, is to sit in a bush and watch Netflix.  Again not fun or engaging.
---
Still don‚Äôt feel guilty about that one lol
---
Thank you for downvoting. I guess it's politically incorrect to mention "pigs" and "bacon" in USA these days. I feel blessed that I live in Europe.
---
somehow that is even more depressing.
---
Sleeping bags allow stacking now
---
Not that it would make a difference, but I'm level 344
---
No Legendary Effects = Balanced game :)
---
Nope, there‚Äôs still a way. They didn‚Äôt fix god mode either, you can still become immortal with little effort.
---
Shhhh!!!!
---
So, that's the one programmer's name?
---
I‚Äôve heard from others I should make a second low level account I may do that to ease the grind
---
ü§£
---
Love the positive attitude! It doesn't matter what the reviews are or what complaints other players have, as long as you're having fun when you pick up the controller that's all that matters. Also, if it was as bad as some people act like ut us, they wouldn't still be playing. I have a great time with it too and I hope you meet many like minded people in the wasteland.
---
Untrue. I only play a couple of hours an evening for the reasons in your reply and I've done every challenge aside from NW passively while playing the game for a couple hours a night.
---
I can kill the queen solo with my Deathclaw gauntlet. It‚Äôs more about playing the stats and bonuses of the game hard. You should get enough damage to get loot. I think you only have to do like 1500 damage to trigger it.
---
If you *can* pick it up you *should* be able to sell it. Like in real life. Like in every other fucking game.
---
I've logged into my account on my brothers xbox and played my game. I dont see why next gen consoles would be any different. As long as you're logged into your xbox live account it should load your game.
---
I just play the game. The skins and whatnots aren't an incentive for me to go ape with this grind. I just play like I usually do and make sure I do the dailies. If I'm behind, who cares. That PA skin doesn't make my armor better. Just a big spoiler on a stock Honda Civic.
---
I agree - a cleaner game play with less glitches and OP builds would be better...
---
..... but in the meantime.... canIhaveallyourOPlegacyweaponsifyouaren'tusingthemjustsayin'.....
---
I've gone full easier because they seem to be the only ones who get decent PA skins.
---
This Brotherhood DLC better be packing because this legendary run was a massive swing and a miss for me.
---
Haha XD
---
No kidding, they drag shit out as long as they can, it‚Äôs exhausting.
---
Pringle4One screws are no problem :)
---
Did you play every day?
---
If you herbavore use cranberry relish for a 25% exp bonus with brain bombs for a 5 or 6 Int (don't remember exactly) boost and boiled scorchbeast brain for an 3 Int boost
---
If carnivore use canned meat stew for 12.5% exp bonus and boiled scorchbeast brain for an 8 Int boost and brain bombs for a 2 or 3 Int boost
---
Both of these are with strange in numbers as well
---
This way you maximize exp from kills. Just run through West Tek, burrows and white springs (ghouls and robots). You'll get a ton of exp.
---
Hahah well I seen someone using a handmade with some energy weapon barrel and he instantly killed the encrypted boss solo in less than 3 seconds :/
---
PA stealth boy needs rebalance, stealth field should not break while we are still crouching
---
If you read that elder plan you just locked yourself out of ever getting the others to drop. You'll need to buy it off someone or farm it with an alt.
---
If you have wardrobe or stuff like that try to move them away from the wall, place your wall decide and then place your "wardrobe" back against the wall.
---
Hope that helps
---
While I agree with you, you should be able to do _a lot_ of things in this game. 
---
That being said I do love it, and hope to see many of these great opportunities play out, this included.
---
This
---
I‚Äôm actually really disappointed they didn‚Äôt give the combined stealth suit and helmet a stealth buff when you use your light so you can still use it without being detected. I believe they had something like that in New Vegas?
---
It‚Äôs not hard to drop her as soon as she exits the fissure. It‚Äôs not legit, but it‚Äôs not uncommon either. One dickhead in god mode can kill her in an instant, and many people run it that way on purpose.
---
Ya i run a full unyeilding set for my bloody rifle/melee build and its the best. Granted mine is Secret Service set so bolstering isnt necessary.
---
+1
---
Big mistake mentioning you‚Äôre female on here, the neckbeard redditors are slithering over here as we speak
---
Before the game came out I hoped it was a feature and I could run around with a pipe pistol on my hip, but switch to a fatman and instakill any player I came across when they let their guard down. This game had so much potential
---
He was sitting backwards for me yesterday lmao
---
Not a fan of what this game is doing to fallout lore
---
Its frowned upon. But a friend of mine had her underground camp featured in Kataku and hasn't been hit with the ban hammer
---
Ah same, sent ya a friend request. I‚Äôll wait for you sometime tomorrow.
---
I have 4 characters all Bloodied. Unyielding on the Rifle, heavy, and pistol. Bolstering on the shotgun. I don't notice a difference in DR but it may have something to do with only wearing Raider type armor.
---
Do you know if Inspirational stacks if multiple people are sharing it? I jumped into a group earlier today, and I already had Inspirational as shared. Someone else in the group was sharing it as well. It didn't force either of us to switch perks, but I had 3* while the other player had 2*.
---
For that matter, do any of the perks stack if multiple people in the group share the same one? I just don't want the perks to be wasted, and I have plenty of other perks that I could share instead.
---
PvP build is far different with Adventure build, aids like Nuka Cola n Chems are very important
---
People hoard useless shit, that‚Äôs pretty much it. I‚Äôve got one set of armor, two weapons, and only the junk and aid I actually use. The rest of it gets sold, dropped, or scripped. I play with someone who carries like 4 sets of armor, 15 different weapons, and all kinds of useless garbage with no real value. Always overweight, has to run every weight reduction perk just to function, forever trying to manage weight while keeping every single thing. They don‚Äôt need more space, they need less shit.
---
Was at whitespring ended up at where the scorchbeast queen was
---
Allow me to romance other players, not because I don‚Äôt have a relationship, but for‚Ä¶ you know science
---
But I love my Bloodied Explosive 700+ Range Nuclear Winter Laser Rifle
---
It lasts for ten weeks. We haven't even finished the first. I'm not worried.
---
The 114 fire rate is not high enough to trigger the magic effect.  You are doing normal damage.  If you have 5 addictions, it is doing about 90 per shot plus any damage perks you have and possibly sneak or headshots.  I'd expect it to drop a SB in a clip if you are using it right.
---
I‚Äôm sure you do XD
---
Cant you mod the pipe bolt action with a rifle mod and get the benefits of both pistol and rifle perk cards
---
oh icic, my intelligence after armor and stuff is around 30 i think so thats probably it. Also my exp boost stacking was ok td
---
For some weird reason, weird being a the good type of broken, those challenges reward you the score before you complete the challenges. 
---
In your case, you'd of got it when you had collected 3/5 of the materials.
---
Thanks.  I was pretty sure I'd seen it somewhere.
---
A lot of people with families don‚Äôt get to play a couple hours a night. Of three friends at work with families, two might get a couple of one hour sessions during the week and then get to play a few hours over the weekend. The other one gets about an hour a night before bed. It‚Äôs different for everyone.
---
I‚Äôm not saying saying they should change it, you can‚Äôt cater to everyone, but those people will not make it to level 100 before the season is over. Especially if they want to actually play other games too.
---
Not an issue for me, we chose not to have kids and we currently have no one else to take care of, so I have plenty of time spare. Whether I want to spend weeks grinding these boring challenges is a different story.
---
I made a new character for when I am unable to or just level up my main character, as I refuse to grind for that long to go from level 230 to 231, and so on. This way I can complete all the challenges without the aggravation. I am hopeful that they remove the whole level up once a day from season 2.
---
Its not necessary at all though, its just a trick to save time. Its the same as achievement or trophy hunting...you have the right way to do it, and then a way to spam it to get the bleep bloop earlier.
---
Vats been broken since Wastelanders was out. Patch 20 made it worse for some guns. Can Miss if you‚Äôre 2 cm away from target with 95% chance
---
There is a alien gun mod to use fusion cells. Its in the tnt bunkers
---
I can't speak for everybody but it has been my experience that generally speaking people who use microphones like myself will query via microphone and if you don't respond at all i assume that you don't have or use microphone / headset and will switch to emoting in attempts to communicate, if you respond via emote I will assume you can hear me, but don't have or use microphone, and obviously if you respond via microphone well then duh.
---
 But I have never been down on somebody for not having or using a microphone
---
I dont know for sure but I doubt they do actually.
---
Othwise we could repair stuff to 300% ( 150 + 150). Because that sure wont work I doubt that any existing Perk stacks while being shared.
---
Crap really? That sucks...
---
One or the other will trigger. I don't think the percentage is additive and I have no idea if one is prioritized over the other but if you equip both sometimes you will get one and sometimes the other .
---
Unyielding for strict bloodied builds.
---
Bolstering for builds that use some of the perks but don't intend to go full bloodied.
---
Don't do it then, it's not mandatory. You're right in saying they can't cater to everybody. The system is supposed to reward people for playing the game, if you don't play so much then why would you expect to get the rewards? This is the same with any battle pass ever made in existence.
---
I'll probably be off in a while but all our EU players should be waking up soon.
---
thx
---
That makes sense! I might have to get some friends together to do a little testing, just to make sure. But yeah, I doubt they'd let us get an extra 60% xp just from that, unfortunately
---
I don't know of any calculator, but the difference between them in real world protection is pretty slight.  You are right about diminishing returns. DR only applies to about half of the incoming damage anyway, so that narrows the gap even more.
---
Same
---
Lmao, " welcome, you must be new."
---
Can confirm. Never noticed the vats issue until update 20. Now all my energy weapons are pretty unreliable in vats. Not sure if the issue is related to the type of gun; just something that I noticed. 
---
A workaround I found is to quickly leave + reopen vats after acquiring a target. But that‚Äôs annoying af.
---
She has massive resistance to explosive damage.
---
Multiple posts all over the sub
---
Pipe Bolt Actions can benefit from both rifleman and pistol perks IIRC.  If that is still the case, the Pipe would be quite powerful if spec'ed right.
---
Gotta get them food buffs going
---
Honestly who doesn't? When I first played Fallout 4 I was hoping that all of the cool looking weapons would be holstered or on my character's back, but they weren't. When I heard the way you move in 3rd person in FO76 was sorta like the way you move in FO3 and FONV I was excited because I thought they would also add holstered weapons back too.
---
Rank 100 give 500 atoms once ya hit 97 you can buy the last 3 and still come oit with 50 atoms
---
I feel you there. But I'll cry if I lost my legacy TSE Gauss rifle. It's kinda trash but I like having it xD
---
Honestly I barely left the forest, ash heap, and toxic valley until I hit level 50. Take your time, there's so much to explore!
---
That‚Äôs crazy, usually the high rad fluids are the hardest to find.
---
;-;. Welp, there goes my dreams of reliving ww1 eh. Well, if that's the case then why dont we just bomb the crap out of people
---
Or maybe they could let you choose any legendary effect in replacement for removing the legacy affect, that would be far and I‚Äôd love that for mine
---
With a proper melee build you should be able to do hundreds of points of damage per hit when she lands, more if you stack food chems and stealth buffs. Basically, you clear out the ads until she lands and make sure you get a good five or six decent hits in and you should get loot off her. If you get set up properly for stealth you can crouch under her chin and hammer away at her head and she won't even notice.
---
I seriously doubt you are doing 32k damage with a shotgun.
---
Bolstering adds damage resistances but at some point it dorsnt matter if you're wearing heavy combat,  scout, marine,  or SS. You're dr is so high that the extra doesn't help much
---
Not everyone plays GG EZ mode. 
---
Taken 8% extra damage while your team takes 33% less is amazing.
---
Does Mother Russia üá∑üá∫ care about damage resistances? I think not comrade....
---
Points ‚òùÔ∏è
---
No, if you turn it into a rifle, it will need the rifle perks and the pistol ones will lose their effect.
---
There's a location where a briefcase always spawns, could be that and not hacking.
---
Fuck damage resistances. Imma blow her out of the fucking sky! I dont care if I hit enemy players in the process. Imma fuck them up too and get a bounty! I say we get as many artillery as we can, mainly because idk if there is a limit to how many you can make, plus would every mortar fire the usual 5 times? Or does all of them all together fire 5 times?
---
This post actually concerned me and made me look in my Library in fear it would no longer be in my library. I found I t‚Äôs not available on Spotify after a search for it, but it‚Äôs still available on ITunes/Apple Music.
---
O on ps4
---
I think that would create more unbalance. Most legacy weapons are TES which isn't bad but it isn't the most powerful by far.
---
Plus I was joking xD I wouldn't mind losing one weapon I keep because it is legacy if it meant a more balanced game. I'd prefer that actually.
---
Your welcome!
---
I think you need about 2k dmg to get the loot. But bc of the massive flat reduction in dmg she does to all attacks, slow rate/high damage per hit weapons like melee need to have a decent dmg number b4 buffs and sneak if u can get it. My DCG can get about 1.7k base with ironfist,bloody mess,nerd rage and around the 2.2k with whatever kinda buffs i got on hand like bobbleheads food chem ect. But the big thing is trying to get some sneak hits in so stay crouched and after the queens reductions to your attack dmg u can get like 1.7-2.5k per hit on crit sneaks which is more than enough to get the loot but the real problem is getting her to land with crippling not working. If u dont want to lug around a heavy get something high dmg like a lever action that can fill your crit meter while shes in the air and tag the mobs.
---
Y'know, I honestly want this to happen to me. It hasn't yet. Haha
---
Personally, I don't use gunsmith at all except to craft. Guns are super easy to repair and at a certain point you will have more screws than you know what to do with, plus if you kill the queen a lot you'll have tons of repair kits, though intend to use those on armor because no matter how much I farm I never can seem to get more than 100 ballistic fiber.
---
When she lands, hit her in the face. Doing so will earn you enough damage dealt to get loot. Also make sure you are apart of the event, if it's not in the top right corner or in your pip boy, you're technically not in the event.
---
seen it at Pleasant Valley Station next to Top of the World
---
Sad but not shocking
---
Dodgy isnt a chance to avoid damage, its 30% damage reduction, but only when you have 30 ap to spare
---
Damn I missed that! Vault-Tec really snuck that into a ‚Äúnormal, non-testing environment‚Äù Vault, huh?
---
It sticks to the system you bought it on.
---
For example if you had 1000 atoms they would only appear when you used the Bethesda launcher.  You'd have two separate atoms 'pots' but the things you bought with them would be on both.
---
I thought we were gonna do that for wastelanders. We had an operation clean up Appalachia for when wastelanders was supposed to launch, and I thought it‚Äôd have lasting consequence. We killed millions of scorched. Literally millions.
---
The only colour paint available for T65 is the one in season pass, but let‚Äôs hope that Bethesda will update the existing T series bundle in future
---
If you xan confirm I would like to know aswell! Cheers.
---
Some of the atom shop paints you can put on T-65 but it's never explicitly said that so we're left guessing(and wasting atoms trying to find out).
---
like that would be really cool but i‚Äôd expect super hard to implement
---
Yep, they clearly don't understand how their own playerbase functions. The "level up while X (0/3)" challenges were already cancer before, but now having a daily score challenge for leveling up is still awful. I want to play on my level 348 main but that means I'd need 56k exp every single day to reach that. I enjoy playing the game, not grinding west tek for 3 hours, so no thanks on that
---
only for what system you purchased on it‚Äôs on the website
---
If you were on Xbox, I totally would've shown you the ropes. Could use new friends.
---
Definitely not patched, I got the winter armor tonight. It's just a major grind.
---
Judging from my downvotes, y'all like being put at a stash and cap limit?
---
It's interesting to note that Vault 8 (Vault City) was also a control vault that was supposed to have a similar purpose, but they were able to keep using the vault for its medical facilities and computer archives. They were issued a GECK, however, whereas Vault 76 was not.
---
This is true but every level gets harder.  At level 40ish you need TWO lots of dalies to get one level and it again gets harder and harder.
---
#FUCK YOU
---
I loathe limited time stuff like this, if I was a new player a year from now and I find out something incredibly useful like the ammo converter was apart of some limited time thing and I can‚Äôt get it anymore, I think I‚Äôd just quit playing the game. I hate this ‚ÄúOh if you weren‚Äôt playing the game at this specific time you just miss out on it forever‚Äù BS that Bethesda keeps doing, it almost feels like punishing new players because they didn‚Äôt play the game sooner.
---
Just like the mountain scout outfit only available to players if they played 76 before Wastelanders, easily one of the coolest outfits they‚Äôve added, but if you join the game anytime now after wastelanders you‚Äôre just SOL, and that‚Äôs just pure bullsh*t.
---
(Honestly this ammo converter thing would have been much for suited to be a new item added to train stations.)
---
SB is not replaceable, meals made with SB‚Äôs body offer good hp regen n stats buff 
---
But we may get the chance to have expedition, which enable who completed the current main quests n coming BOS quests to travel to outside Appalachia
---
They have Sleek faster stealth movement
---
Didn't Bethesda use the same engine to make fo76?
---
I would give an award if I could
---
We need tanks.... Lots and lots of tanks....
---
I'm a melee but I use a Gatling plasma for scorched earth and final word for silos. I am constantly looking for, buying, and crafting ammo, yes.
---
Yup, and many of the single player stuff carried over...
---
I‚Äôm looking at your dev room :P
---
Those paints is not colour paint for T65, they are layered paint that change the overall appearance of the PA, I m using a Excavator with waster layer and my X01 is painted with blackbird
---
I'm still looking for gram I need the disco ball plan
---
build a terminal in your camp it will give you the quest to find him
---
I agree with you. I'm getting tired of these legacy weapons. I would give them all up &amp; rather have a balanced &amp; fun game.
---
I swapped from X-01 to T-65. From my experience (I know it's not an actual %) T-65 is very minor in terms of energy and ballistic damage but much better than Ultracite for radiation damage.
---
If you're thinking of swapping, I'd say don't bother if you don't want to grind it as its a only minor difference.
---
Sorry for not offering a calculator to get a exact amount. No idea if there is one tbh.
---
Yes, and lots of artillery. Anyway, would you legit be up for that? I would have to move my base from the forest to the bog but I'm willing to set up a little outpost if you're willing to help get supplies so we can bombard peeps
---
He spans there or, wavy Willard's, the Camden park, landview lighthouse, miners monument, ect
---
Thank you
---
Wait. I'm not that far into tadpole quest yet, but (w/o spoilers): do you tell me i need the plasma grenade plan? Could have bought it yesterday for 49caps...
---
Since Wastelanders released, I've mused that it would be interesting if Bethesda could manage to functionally implement something like Elder Scrolls Online's zone phasing. So a new character would start out in a largely dead Appalachia on Reclamation Day, just like release. But as various quests were completed, folks would start arriving and things would start getting built up until you got to the Wastelanders version of the world. 
---
It would largely be an illusion of world change and progression, but a bit better than the static world we have now (w/whole settlements and the like materializing fully formed over the course of a patch day).
---
I wish they‚Äôd add a new nuke silo that launched a megaton nuke that makes a zone this big, except the inner circle would be so irradiated even having a hazmat suit you‚Äôd still be sucking down radaway every minute or so. But it would guarantee something like a colossus or queen or some other raid boss in the center. Or maybe every enemy in the inner circle would be legendary? The outer circle would be just like a normal nuke zone. (The silo would have to be way more tougher and time consuming than a normal one though.)
---
About the music: do holotapes last forever?  Maybe not...
---
Thats the max lvl for plasma related rifles pistols etc
---
Not especially, in comparison to introducing npc‚Äôs, instanced interiors, 2 new joinable factions with their own narratives and hierarchy etc etc. All you‚Äôd need to do is remove all instances of scorched assets and quest markers ID‚Äôs in the editor, and spruce up the scorched area‚Äôs of the map. The hardest part would be generating a new narrative to replace the threat of the scorched. We have some new stories now, but the scorched is definitely still the main focus. We could‚Äôve had a memorial setup for those we lost during the great scorched war and had a new end game developed.jm1	  ¬ß¬ß¬ß¬ß¬ßan	(sorry, that last part was my cat, but i thought it was a good point so i left it in)
---
I'm not too bothered as Elder and Paladin are the only ones I really want. I'll just buy paladin if I see it.  I have an alt if I do ever feel bored / desperate enough.
---
Seems more likely you need to get closer to the queen. Those "noobs in shiny PA with silly skins" would of done around 2k damage and you are not. 
---
I'm not joking by the way by get closer. I literally need to crawl into the queens asshole in order to hit her sometimes.
---
If that is not the case, there is a bug which happens sometimes, pretty rare but you might just have gotten very unlucky.
---
if you don't have the terminal yet you can claim it for free in the atom shop
---
I understand that. I‚Äôm still meandering along with a 1\* vampire switchblade as my primary, ghoul slayer switchblade for WS, and a few other weapons for special purposes....and my main PA is Excavator.At L209, they‚Äôve served me quite well so far.  
---
And I havent decided who to side with for the vault raid :)
---
Personally I‚Äôd like to see multiple tracks of battle pass where you can continue an old one even when a new one has started, but let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs not about giving players cool stuff, it‚Äôs about trying to make people play as much as possible through FOMO. I get it, it‚Äôs a business.
---
Yes and others, Plasma was left out of most of drop pools until the gifts. FYI you also need 6 INt to craft them.  I'm proud that I did it before the dupe.
---
Ok, thank you for advice.
---
Magic weapons have around 200 fire rate. Some legendary effects like explosive will double it but scorchedbeasts are immune to explosive damage.
---
ah ok but what about the other benifits of fallout first? are they restricted to the site i buy it from?
---
I'm level 16 now, close to 17. I've done all challenges but the first two days NW. I'm sure I'll get to 100 in time figure I'll get to 20 in the first week. 35 by 2nd week, and so forth
---
You're welcome. BTW I might of joke about attacking her behind but go for the face. Much, much easier to hit.
---
That will give it an hour or so of use given how fast it breaks at 100% :P
---
It doesn't have to be 200. 182 is close enough for the effect to work. Just don't miss shots.
---
Serendipity is checked first. If it doesn't proc, then Dodgy is checked.
---
Its not patched, I can't talk out of experience because I grinded them all out. But it seems random what you get from what I've seen. You get say the glowing skeleton outfit first, then the first presents 8 matches later.
---
Any love for the new fertilizer fart grenades? :)
---
Yeah I'm sure they will do a better job
---
Using vats shouldn't drain fusion cores since it doesn't have anything to do with power armor.
---
I'm PS4 but I'd so be down if this was on my platform. Id keep trying to get it going because peeps would wanna do this!! I'd be hella drunk for it though I'd defs get some good vodka and the fur hat.
---
They should just hire fallout modders to fix the game and add things like cosmetics
---
Pretty sure 2/3 of the pipe pistols can benefit from both pistol and rifle cards unless it was patched recently
---
Nothing to do with your character. They just like clapping throw amour and outfit. Its extremely annoying and only skin tight under armour seems to not do that.
---
I agree, I did change them by editing config files, but it's not the same as doing it more easily from the settings menu.
---
Any editing of game files will result in a permanent ban...
---
My own experience doesn't match that. But honestly, if its a bug. Then I might of not had it happen to me and that it does other. I've not used pipe weapon since the recent patch so I can't comment there.
---
I edit my game files and nothing has happened even though I have hundreds of hours
---
I hate the cartoon comedy it's turning into. While there was some in previous titles, we are loosing the Darkness.  
---
This new power armour skin looks awful too.
---
Yep, it is. Another reason not to worry about this Season Stuff.
---
It's a live service game, of course they want people to play as much as possible. FOMO is what these games are built on. It literally is what Warframe is all about, but people seem to love that. This game isn't half as bad as that.
---
Yep. That's pretty much the same story for every county in the state. I'm a West Virginian, born and reside in Boone, County. Plus the southern counties have only gotten worse since mines have shut down or laid off due to EPA regs under the Obama Admin. Still wouldn't trade the mountains for anything in the world though.
---
It's been around since 2018. Pipe bolt action works for sure, you just need to have forceful stock on the weapon for it to work.
---
I'm in the 200s too, I've actually been enjoying this part because it takes me half as long as it used to. Cranberry Relish with Herbivore and a maxed out bonded team means I gain enough XP (and SCORE) just running around with randos. I've been wanting to respec into melee so I'm using the extra levels for that.
---
Some player don't like, PvP is only one reason though those types hate my rocket turrets more.
---
You won't get band. If Bethesda wanted to do something about it, they'd do the same thing as in the past which is to remove it (everything get  stored) and you'd have to build it again. I've only seen this happen if they chose to not allow camps there no more.
---
These mods were stupidly difficult to initialize, for what they did.
---
He also still wanders around Foundation sometimes...
---
I would like an option ro rename my character. Most for roleplay purposes. I had a melee build that was my main character. Then i got hacked and lost everything. So i started to use my secondary rifle build. And the name i chose is terrible.
---
I wouldn't say that the only reason people didnt do them was because of the inability to find a group. I think it was more the fact that the rewards for it were so lack luster for how much of a pain they were. It wasnt worth doing unless you really had to have that strangler heart/ thorn/ solar. And for most players apparently, it wasnt worth doing. If you really just wanted a challenge, you could go into the burrows and clear it out with a non legendary, lower tier gun that you're not specced for. Doesnt sound like fun, does it? At least, most people I know felt that way. There was one person I knew who just paid to be carried through them. So even he didnt care about them, he just had to have strangler heart. And even for the guys carrying him, they weren't doing it for the challenge or the reward, they were just doing it for his money. I would love to see the vault raid return, and perhaps even the two other vaults get raids. Man, what I'd do for a cryo version of strangler heart. Server stability isnt the giant issue it was, but I still had trouble with it up until the last time I did a raid (about two months before wastelanders). The "challenge" of you just shooting/hitting bullet sponge enemies while doing timed fetch/interact quests were boring and weren't really challenging. It was a test of dps, supplies, and repetition. Vault steel as a reward is awful. Being able to make only one piece after several successful raids and being subject to rng 2/3s the time while also needing an additional not raid specific resource 2/3s the time was bad. The raid should have dropped the items, not the plans and a tiny part of the material needed to make the items. The items also not being tradable was a bad idea. It just subjected people to even more rng, as you couldn't trade the item you had for what you needed. Man, this vanguard ap refresh thorns piece is pretty cool, but I run unyeilding....so I can choose to keep this nice armor piece as extra weight forever...or just script it and pretend it was another exterminators lockpick piece. They also tried to half ass set items, by making you have the full set instead of giving you increasing bonuses for having more pieces. It made it even worse to try and get a full set because your items were effectively less useful than what you already had until you completed your set which could take months. The vault raid failed because it was poorly thought out. I'd love to see it return, but it needs a major overhaul. And at this point, with all of its loot so easy to get, there is almost no incentive for anybody except the few die hard fans to even go in there. Sorry for the negativity, I really do hate that they removed a chunk of content from the game, and probably cut the other two raids.
---
Make a new character, sprint from 76 to the wayward, talk to dutchess, exit craft a leather chest at the overeers camp and done.
---
Fair enough. I dunno if I tried that stock, I have used bolt action pipe rifles but normally with a new character for the old level up challenges.
---
Weird. Still grinding events as we speak.
---
If you can't enter vats at all, log out and log in again. It happened to me a few times recently...
---
Oh wow. Those are some out of the norm weapon choices. Good for you. I like seeing people do different things
---
You never got a timer? I‚Äôm just gonna let it finish restarted the game
---
Bugthesda says they fix alot if things that stay broke :P
---
It‚Äôs because everyone‚Äôs stash is full. I‚Äôve been dropping legendaries everywhere the last couple days, the daily scrip limit is killing me
---
How does empath work if more than one person on a team has it?
---
Don't think that would be a problem since these models already exist when aiming and the like. I thought they wanted to add this to FO4, but due to the difference in size of the weapons e.g. 10mm compared to deliverer, it couldn't be solved in the short time before release.
---
Details?
---
13k?!? Damn I just sold the paladin paint for 2k
---
Id like to see them gone. Scorched are very bland enemies and sb are annoying af
---
I believe they occasionally reboot some servers on a rolling cycle during the low pop hours
---
Daamm
---
Well that‚Äôs good news. Thanks guys!
---
I do at least 5 to 10 daily and i finally just got a couple after months of farming, then the other day I got 3 back to back but forgot to read the plan so I got a duplicate
---
Are you on PS4?
---
Got plenty to tell been doing courier work going on two years now got two groups ruining my reputation stating I‚Äôm a scammer making fake badges but yet no one of there guys can show any proof of me making fake badges or scamming one another now been kicked out a few groups and tonight had a scammer messaged me stating he‚Äôs friends with 3 admins of those groups and had me kicked bc I was taking all the business from them and actually not stealing peoples stuff ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Lol no they couldnt, unfortunately theres more to making a game than the ability to code. They do make nice mods though.
---
Yes sorry i didn‚Äôt mention it in the title
---
I've wanted to know this as well. I'd like to switch to red on PS4, but somehow this wasn't on Todd's to-do list when making a game that just works.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not a fan of Warframe. Way too expensive or grindy even for a free game.
---
Fallout is heading down the path Destiny 2 did with battle passes being used to make up for lack of meaningful content, and I‚Äôve now deleted D2 and moved on because of it, so we‚Äôll see how long this keeps me entertained for. Shame it‚Äôs impossible to create new content at the rate we can consume it.
---
Most of the math is wrong and inconsistent, I saw one guy say you'd only get to lvl 50, one said lvl 70, one said you get enough to reach 120 if there was that many levels.
---
I'd think of it like any other battle pass. Most of them require you to grind a little and do all the challenges. Most people never reach max level and pay for ranks. This battle pass seems no different.
---
Plus if we are not meant to be able to compete it I wouldn't be lvl 19 right now (only did 2 nw challenge) and some people without glitching are over lvl 30. It comes down to how much time you put into it.
---
What's your PSN? Can do it now if you're on.
---
My psns OG-KingOfManga I‚Äôd really appreciate that
---
Yeah i wish they were gone too. They cant properly balance the game with these crazy weapons still around.
---
With the daily‚Äôs by the last level I think all the daily‚Äôs will give you one level near as dammit. So even if u just did those you‚Äôll
---
Make 100 in 70 days
---
I'm at 16.  I don't do the NW stuff.
---
Oh look , Todds boyfriends downvoting again
---
Yeah your right, I just think that modders have more of a sense of what the players want and how they would like to receive it, not some 300 atoms points for feature previously shown in the last fallout for free
---
I agree there is definitely too long between updates, especially hotfixes. Issues like score not being given and adrenaline being broken should be hotfixed straight away, there is no urgency it seems with Bethesda.
---
Yeah, also the vats bug.. one would think that they would give priority to such huge issues, but alas..
---
I never confirmed it was a First Nation tribe (hence the 'some say...'). If you want to call it a 'medicine (wo)man', go right ahead. That's the power of role-play and imagination: you do you, it can be whatever you want it to be. :)
---
Yes they are. Everytime I'm at my camp, Scorched are always attacking. They are annoying.
---
You should write their forums btw.
---
Man, we totally need a r/fo76 sleepover at a pioneer scout camp. I'll bring the s'mores and deathclaw hands.
---
True, im mostly a solo player.
---
Unyielding is so good for many reasons right now, it makes a huge difference with all the xp grind requirements of challenges too. I honestly see it getting nerfed at some point. That will kill me inside.
---
This is great advice üôå
---
*Suit*able, you say? ^Sorry.
---
God modes still a thing lol they dont patch bugs they change them
---
Do you even get the Berserker bonus with 140dr?
---
Unless they make the human model better with the option to increase booty &amp; boob size, then I don't see the point. But seriously, why Sophia can have a bigger bottom and I can't? :(
---
Platform? I'm on xb1, think I have one not 100%
---
I read this in an Australian accent
---
Thats true , i read that
---
What about black bird? I like it
---
I don't understand why they even added that shit, in the rep grind too. They are useless. I should be able to play a grenadier build and be viable.
---
Thank you!
---
I'm on xb1, rep increase works fine for me. Went from neighborly to silly today
---
Are you able to do this at the moment? I‚Äôve yet to complete the NW daily yet sadly.
---
"Lmao Bethesda you need mods to fix your games"
---
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE USING IDEAS INSPIRED BY PLAYER MADE MODS PEOPLE LIKED NOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
---
That would be great, I will add you on friend
---
Appreciate. Yeah at this point I've already grinded out everything but the Emergency Protocols. smh. I guess I got it to show off, that's about it? Should be good in pve but since when do we need help in pve anyway. *shrug* Why doesn't Bethesda just introduce Legendary PA already
---
I'm not on par but as a tip, do Morgantown, go to the camp at top of map should be able to find more than 4 stimpaks easily. Then go to edge of map, build a 2 or 3 story camp. Jump off and have teammate revive. Lather rinse repeat.
---
You should check out r/VaultDwellerCouture!
---
Didn't know it only applies to half of incoming damage. Interesting. I don't get why Bethesda doesn't share this stuff with us. Like, a character sheet showing real world damage reduction and dps of equipped items would have been freakin great. Instead we're left in the dark googling far corners of the internet scavaging for even hints at what could be true to even begin to test for yourself. Yet they seem retry focused on PvP... and we've got no idea what our characters can do
---
I don't know what are those guys thinking who price their masks for that much. I have a couple up for sale for like 10 or 20 since the event ended, and couldn't sell one.
---
Lol
---
I regret buying the damn plans. They‚Äôre a waste now. I never make them or use them and now there‚Äôs no point to making them because I‚Äôm inundated with them.
---
Im almost 17 and that pace is plenty to finish ahead of time. If you play on double xp and double score weekends you should be able to miss a week or more of daily/weeklies and still make 100.
---
Working great as far as I can tell, including the SCORE level up. Thanks for the tip on clicking and dragging. Now I just need to fix my INI file for the 5 millionth time to make notes readable again :D
---
What FOV do you play at?
---
the reason they do that is because of the gun mods, from what i remember correctly.
---
I'd imagine that they haven't added legendary PA because that would render non PA builds pointless.
---
I'm PvE true and though tbh but any small advantage in PvP can be useful. So I'd use it if you already have.
---
Makes sense i always thought that courier crap was shady.. I personally would never use one.
---
You didn‚Äôt state your price
---
scrap it, you can't store it and keep it, and once you leave after a bit it'll cycle down and you'll lose it anyway.
---
Don‚Äôt forget joining a building team for extra int.
---
Yea Ive giving it up now too way to much drama
---
Well there was one person who got over level 30 fairly early on, in about A dozen days you can combine that with people like me who had a bleep load of atoms and can instafinish the game and still have atoms left over... well...
---
You could collect unlimited of the "scrip notes" much like treasury notes, but only convert so many to real scrip per day. Hence on days where you end up with way to many legendaries you can turn them all to scrip notes and then eventually into real scrip over a few days time.
---
Although fixers are godlike in PvE, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre useful in PvP. Anyways, I guess I‚Äôll go with the junkies. It‚Äôs all about delivering the most amount of damage as fast as possible.
---
Sorry I'm confused by what you mean there.
---
Liberty prime and red rocket both work on T65.
---
Cheating
---
All your base are belong to us
---
It would be a clipping fiesta with half of the outfits but would love to see it either way.I miss the heavy weapon unwieldiness (not sure if thats the right word for it) if your strenght wasnt high enough for it.
---
Also all of the different ammo types like hollow point,armor piercing etc.
---
There's supposed to be expeditions outside the map, is what they want to do.
---
Workshops are not persistent even in private worlds they get reset.
---
As I understand it after a few minutes if no other fallout first members are in the world it gets reset, also if you leave private and join public it resets immediately. Tou can leave change characters and go right back in and it will still be there 
---
Workshops are meant to be used and discarded.
---
Tip: when building in a workshop if the resources are green its using the free resources that come with the workshop and bot your personal stash.

Now that you know the plan for the fusion generator you can build it any time at any workshop but treat workshops as disposables. If you cap one for a reason like to get fusion cores just pop the gen down wire it and come empty it from time to time don't make the mistake of spending hours building it up, just do the bare minimum which can usually be done with the contractor perk and the free provided materials from the workshop.
---
If you do invest your actual junk in building something you can get a small portion back by scrapping it but if you store it and leave the server its just gone.
---
Um Xbox games you can actualy play on a pc. Same with PlayStation. That‚Äôs been possible for years now even without a ‚Äùdev kit‚Äù
---
Lol "PvE games make terrible PvP games." I guess the Dark Souls PvP community missed the memo about that. Let me go over and let them know. 
---
Seriously though, this is a stupid argument. Especially when PvP is completely optional and if you still don't like it you can avoid it and leave it to the people that do. Why the PvE community is so hell bent on disallowing a completely optional feature players were promised since the games announcement is beyond me. Don't like it? Don't participate. Simple as that.
---
Level 43 is when it starts to need more than the dalies to level up.
---
It takes 2025 XP at that point when dalies give 2000.
---
I think the daily rewards add up to the same as one level at level 90+ so if u do the daily‚Äôs you‚Äôll gain a level. It‚Äôs 19 weeks so 70 days. By the time you slow enough where it‚Äôs a grind is going to be around 50-60 which you‚Äôll hit in 2-3 weeks leaving 35 days to grind out the last 35 levels or so. At 1 a day just by doing daily‚Äôs
---
Because, logistically, it's a strategic location.
---
Not in my case just been playing a while i have many good weapons i like to use its boring using the same build so i like to change and making a new character is a massive chore so becuz of that i have massive space issues
---
so which rifle would you suggest for PVP?
---
If you just unlocked the Jack O' Lantern combat armor skin it will take 7,000 XP to unlock the glowing skeleton outfit, between them you will unlock the Nuclear Winter beanie. 14,000 XP after the hat you will unlock the Fur-lined jacket and jeans.
---
Just by definition handing your best stuff to a complete stranger is down right moronic imo no matter how many social media randoms claim otherwise.. Just seems to me to be a virtual theft waiting to happen..
---
I personally would never steal another persons stuff if they asked me to trade it myself but what proof do i have to give to random players.. i have none so trust is non existent..
---
I have a spare plan you can have for free if your interested?
---
Ah ok. And with the weekly total and 7 days of daily‚Äôs it‚Äôs over a level a day right?
---
Camp opposite the Wayward, here. This is one of my huge annoyances in an otherwise mostly annoyance-free gameplay experience. I am going to have to move eventually because it wastes so much time serving hopping, but it's a pain because I use that space to deposit extra food and guns into the overseers cache for newbies, and Duchess is an easy place to trade caps.
---
Forget rifles man, have you tried energy weapons/  Tesla‚Äôs? That‚Äôs the meta right now and they‚Äôre the most broken weapons in the game.
---
I'm at 17 myself without NW but have got at least 1 level worth from repeatable XP.
---
yo tbis is legendary, do you mind if I start doing this lmao
---
I honestly don't know why this is not a thing, it really boggles my mind.
---
You can change it on PC through the  .ini files
---
Wait... you can read the notes? Too small for me. Different FOV values seem to be in different .ini files. Which one do you need to see?
---
Well some one solved it because by the time Fallout 4 existed no scorched existed..
---
Thanks for the offer but you don‚Äôt have to waste your rare plan on me :]
---
Hell yeah man! Go get those toilet kills!
---
Edit: Fixed Imgur link, first time using.
---
I have spent thousands just visiting camps to even find someone selling serums. It's ridiculous. Also, traveling to player camps should be free.
---
it‚Äôs lame would be such a neat lil feature if they implemented
---
I dunno i put all dark souls style games on my ignore list as soon as they get added to steam..
---
And i'm not wrong when was the last time you entered any division Dark Zones, they are beyond dead..
---
Just saw a YouTube vid for unlimited Xp finishing the battle pass in 5 min using god mode glitch.  Save yourself some money.
---
I never trusted Facebook Courier (no offense) and only used Reddit Couriers or from the PSN Comunity F76-Mediations.
---
But thank you for spreading knowledge, I and I think many others too appreciate it.
---
Get some nuka cranberry gives 5% too
---
No problem bud anytime
---
Nice one wasnt sure. To be fair hadn't been too bad I haven't mobbed fatned just done the occasional queen with dailies, I think what helped me was starting to use cranberry relish and brain fungus whilst being in a building group
---
I'm a vats rifle sneak build... its been rough.
---
I'd rather not get banned,  they can see who's completed the pass
---
stress for the most part, i‚Äôve been playing at least a few hours everyday on console for the past month or so and I‚Äôve only run into a few possible cheaters.
---
I did Radiation Rumble today and there were dozens of meat piles to go through. Some of them I definitely missed because they were on top of eachother. I felt lucky to find a legendary. It was still worth it to go through all of the piles for bullets and scrap though.
---
Agreed but devs these days omit text chats because of the new rules that devs must comply to when making them.. or so i was told.
---
Its crazy that standard social tools aren't added to games these days.. Why even have online multiplayer if no one can talk to each other.
---
These limits are bullshit, everyone knows that. This kind of shit belongs to F2P mobile games, not in a paid AAA game. I personally like to have options, like in ever Fallout game I always kept at least one from every type of weapon and armor so if I want to change things up, I can do that. And this game have a lot of gear combination, but if you don't commit to one certain build with one certain set of weapons, you're fucked. Even tho several explosive weapons in the game, most people just don't use them, simply because the weight cost with these storage limits makes not worth it, which is the dumbest thing. Let us play the damn game as we want and as we could, because all of this on Bethesda and their stupid design. You don't get to say why you think everyones fun is wrong.
---
Alcohol is separate from drink, so armor, a drink or food, alcohol, chem or bobble head or magazine, to effect a particular stat.
---
The next big thing for the atom shop I guess. ;)
---
Destroying their camp is justified
---
Ya i just recently started using the public teams too, should of from the first day. Hit the xp score like 3 times from dailies and just 1 queen fight
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they go after people on this one, as it's a threat to potential revenue. The more people who complete it, the small the pool of possible people buying atoms to skip levels.
---
But I am also expecting them not to as well so lol.
---
I feel ya.  I hope they all get banned,  but I doubt they will.
---
What? From levels 100-1000, it takes the same amount of XP: 15880.
---
Doing it every day is still tedious, but it's still just basically an event, the daily scrip quests, and maybe some random sidequests/killing. Definitely not 3 hours.
---
Same here
---
That's ridiculous. If true, I wonder which government is calling the shots on what can and can't be said.
---
Bans are done in waves to allow time to flag as many people as possible.  Smart players can dodge the worst of it but some leeches do get removed this way.
---
It's ok, I have 3! I'm gonna stop playing for about a year so it's just gonna sit in my stash. I might as well give one to someone who needs it. My Psn is MadRumbler, I'm on now, come see me and I'll put it in the nearest container for you.
---
I personally never use vats, its terrible i prefer my own skills to shoot something not some badly scripted game mechanic.
---
You sure you don‚Äôt want something for it?
---
Is it really that hard to find one person to deploy with and jump off a 2 story ladder? The camp at the. North edge of Morgantown is perfect, lots of stimpak spawns and isolated if you go to the storm edge. Plenty of time for both of you to jump and revive the other twice. My gf and I did it and still had time to run to the next circle
---
i play exclusively in 1st person so i don't even see my character, plus i use the chinese stealth suit so even if they added holstered weapons and i used 3rd person it would be immersion breaking for me.
---
You have to purchase it in steam if you play steam. I hope you didn't buy the years version lol
---
There are switch options in the power connectors. Just turn your vendors off for a few days turn them back on later.
---
Hi,
---
Would this be Scorched Earth to get the plan?
---
Mike
---
Yup. In just 12 irl hours I can Max out my allotment of vendor caps and sell the leftovers for less at my player venders. People see I'm selling water for 2 caps each and it sells for 4 at the vendors so they double there money without having to build there own purifiers. This is why I have a butt load of gold. I get a bunch of caps from vendors and players, go to the wayward, exchange those caps for gold bullion.
---
Thanks but I don't need anything.
---
Last i heard it was some weird EU laws..
---
Ah, I see.
---
Its Betgesdas fault for making it so grindy  behind time locks.
---
If getting score could be done reasonably without having to log in every day then there would be no need for people to cheat the system.
---
Honestly, something they should have done is reward A-Notes the same way they reward T-Notes; exchangeable for any type of ammo at the ammo vendors.
---
Because seriously, why are those ammo vendors a thing and why do you randomly get missiles from completing events.
---
I shouldn't have to use switches. The game should be way more accessible than it is. I should be able to choose when I turn on and off my vendors without having to close them down for a few days. I can shift max caps on Junk in easily under 30 minutes but I should be able to do that in the same server not have to jump to a private one quick as fuck so I dont lose caps on any additional purchases.
---
Or... bear with me on this one... lift the limit! It would be much easier than implementing a new system.
---
Love this idea. Can nuke a ton of legendaries on my alts.
---
Wait, the rewards are available again?
---
The only good thing about the skin is mixing the front sight with a dotted reflex sight and you get the most pin point sight ever, I snipe Scorchbeasts easier with this, but I definitely want them to try to make a difference and try to add new animations as supposedly there are more variations of this coming up as it was datamined  so they better get their shit together
---
Also the other thing is the continuous loop of being placed in the same server where your camp spot is taken, oh holy heavens I despise this, had to restart my xbox to get a different server.
---
I finally saw him today and he didn‚Äôt have any different plans, it was disappointingüò¢
---
Wait you can still unlock that? I thought the costume was from a seasonal rewards last year
---
I feel your pain! My Gatling laser and plasma and Final Word are the only big guns I keep ... I‚Äôm glad I kept Final Word because I haven‚Äôt started running solos yet. Hey at least we don‚Äôt have to craft more ammo for our regular days in the wasteland.
---
I think this power armor actually has a quest in Fallout 4 that connects it to the lore. That was creation club content so the canon aspect is up for debate, but it does exist in the fallout universe
---
I have an ushanka and a gas mask, and a few bottles of vodka. I mainly needed the vodka to create some molotovs, or as I like to call them, Russian Engineering Bomb. Because it was made by a Russian who is somewhat of an engineer
---
I want the Jukebox from the Sons of Dane compound.
---
Give me dat twang.
---
What I really don't understand is that since fasnacht, that player has been using dupe glitch. Until now, he is still safe. Can't Bethesda detect his data abnormality?
---
And it's from a Karen too... Or at least spoken about by one.
---
You serious right now? Meat can be fully replaced by vegetables. Put this meat down the throat of your kids. Dont tell them where it comes from, dont show how animals are treated and murdered. Dont give them choice, let them eat dead animals without any knowledge. If there were only humans on the planet, they would eat themselves saying the same.
---
Hi Mike.
---
The event you're looking for is called "Encryptid"
---
It is the last step in a series of quests that begin when you read a "sheepsquatch ate my brother" poster. These posters can be found at some train stations as well as a couple other places that I don't recall the name of. The quest will take you to Lewisburg in the Ash Heap to a taxidermy place and proceed from there. After you complete the series of quests you will be able to initiate the Encryptid event (I recommend a team for this as it can be very tricky to do solo without a strong build.) Completing this event has a chance to drop the fixer plan.
---
Okay, wait. While I agree with most of it, you‚Äôre not seriously complaint about workshop pvp when they warn you about it before even claiming it, are you?
---
If that is the case, remember there are weekly too. That would in this case, I'd say push it to over level 100 in that time time frame. I do dismiss 76's hate train because it lies too often or twist facts. But your numbers seem like it came from someone who shits on the game a lot (no offense meant there). 
---
Those numbers would mean that in 10 weeks you'd be around level 40. But a few people are level 30+ already, which would give them a lot of spare time and spent less time to get there. So if one day's of dailies did give 1 level at around level 90 (which most likely is the case). It seem you'd be there if you kept up with it around week 8-9. We are already too ahead for a 19 week battle pass.
---
There no way to tell right now, but most likely all the daily and weekly challenges will get you around level 90 in 10 weeks and you'd have to grind xp for the other 10 or so levels. 
---
That would put it in line with a normal battle pass where of you do everything it wants you to. You only have to grind a few levels or grind them.
---
Yep.. Read the comments below. Anthem didn't get a chat because of this as well which a bad game even worse.
---
As someone with a fair deal of MMO experience but barely 8 months in F76, I'm surprised by how prolific bloodied/uny is. There's little reason, min/max-wise, to use anything else. I mean, dear God the special boost is insane.... 
---
I don't call for anything to be nerfed as I play solo in private server, so OP builds don't phase me at all, but if I swapped to it I think the game would almost be *boring* people are that strong. It's piss easy as it is. 
---
If Beth wanted any other sets to be viable, the writing is on the wall with bloodied. I feel for everyone grinding out their perfect set the day that happens.
---
Thank you my friend, I have that quest line started but not completed. Its a shame if it isn't dropped when I get to it.
---
I'm at level 0.. because i don't care.
---
Yep and 100 every 10k xp. And maybe even works with the double xp events? Isn‚Äôt a huge grind over 10 weeks.
---
I'll be honest, I played the Division for about 5 minutes and never touched it again, so I can't really speak much on it. I've seen just as much toxicity if not more come from PvE players in this game though. Online games are always going to have toxic players because there are toxic people in this world. Removing PvP content doesn't remove the assholes or deter them. At best you're maybe dealing with a different group of dickbags.
---
I understand that it's easy to have a bad experience going against another player and instantly write off PvP in any game. It's easy to think the person who killed you is a bad person since they just caused a good deal of frustration, but in reality they're just playing trying to play the game. It really doesn't help when players all have different maturity levels and expectations when they play. I think ultimately the fan base in general is just not capable of handling a competitive environment.
---
I don't like playing with others it annoys me.
---
I‚Äôve only been back a month and I‚Äôve never had anyone try and pvp me during capping a workshop.
---
Add in that you spawn with nothing in your inventory, but you can pick up things along the way, and make the destination change to give different obstacles, thats what i want üòÄ
---
Better yet, the main character will be the "Florida Man / Woman" and spend the entire game screwing everything up.
---
The "Low intelligence playthrough" will be MANDATORY, and you won't be able to raise your INT above 3 points.  The goal of the game won't be to slowly fix everything up and save the state, but to slowly screw things up an become the final boss.
---
And if you win the game, everyone else loses.  The "endgame" will be you and all the other Florida people (who are all clones of each other) continuing to hold back the forces of competence, intelligence, and progress back by forcing your stupid opinions on everything and screwing everything up, one day at a time.
---
And violently sometimes too, because you gotta have a raid or three.
---
I have a JSS wood board
---
Removing pvp significantly lowers the chances of assholes interacting with others, not completely but to a point we can pretty much ignore them.
---
Pve games do not make very good competitive environments because the mechanics aren't equal and are not designed to work in a competitive way..
---
F76 without legendaries would be interesting to say the least.
---
The ability to transmute legendary features for writ would be better- why should *only* luck determine a players strength and relevance?
---
I'd burn 300+ writ per feature happily to choose each of my three legendary aspects. Possibly more given what I've lost to bad rolls.
---
A *lot* of people would be upset by that. Mainly because of the time/effort required to get said weapons.
---
Just checked and currently on 18, didn't do the NW one today but have done the rest.
---
Makes sense to me.  I mean, the entire Fallout landscape is already basically Australia.  I don't see how Florida could get worse because of nukes.  Actually might be an improvement.
---
The sun kissed perk is the biggest offender for us bloodied builds
---
I don't know how I got so many but I have over 200 of them.
---
It's pretty shit.
---
Imo, Fallout 1st should be way cheaper especially since on consoles, players are ALREADY paying a subscription fee to even play the game  *at all.* Not Bethesda's fault but still.
---
On too of that, a much cooler and less b.s. thing Fo1st could provide was early access to new things. For instance, they would have gotten the Legendary Run like a week to a month before everyone else, giving them a big headstart. Everyone else would still be able to unlock everything (theoretically, no idea how many people will be able to actually get everything without paying to advance levels even now)
---
That, plus the monthly allowance of extra atoms is nice. It could also grant them access to next week's deals &amp; bundles as well, though I still hate their roving inventory system -- just let people buy what they want! I know why they don't but that just makes me MORE upset lol.
---
Honestly, with the state of the game... Fo1st is a total ripoff aside from that scrap box... which is still a ripoff because such a vast quality of life improvement shouldn't be locked away behind thst extra subscription.
---
Isn't it exactly doing that? My CAMP spot was taken yesterday and the game offered me either put my CAMP to somewhere else or find another server. It couldn't find another but that's another story for another rant in this sub.
---
It seems to be a bug. Sometimes the workshops appear as the new icons and other times they look like they used to with the Workshop symbol. I'm not really sure what's causing it, or how to fix it, but it seems very inconsistent.
---
You can in .ini my pipboy light is white
---
I know builders group doesn‚Äôt make sense, I just want that bonus intelligence for the xp
---
And since we have the quick switch between two weapons, we already have an easy way to tell what weapons to show
---
how did you get that far already? i just got to tier 15
---
I had a really tough time around that level too. It will get better the more you play. I started out using shotgun, archery and rifle perks, but I really needed to narrow down to just one weapon specialty. I like using rifles so I maxed out all of the rifle perception perks with bloody mess and my character is so much better. I'm currently just over level 100 and those charred ghouls aren't so bad now. 
---
Also, you will have an easier time if you max out the class freak and starched genes luck cards so you can better use serums. Serums are pricey and it takes time to level up to accrue perks, but hang in there! You'll get though!
---
I've missed this feature since FO4 and would love to see it make a comeback in future fallout games
---
Each to their own! I just find it a bit subtle/boring.
---
I moved from Xbox to pc because of the bad load times and frame rate, I really feel for you but hopefully the new Xbox play at 60 FPS on fallout
---
If I hover over the icon it lists every resource for me so idk
---
Lil Steel
---
And strange in numbers (charisma) to actually get 25% that is
---
This has happened so many times that I don‚Äôt even react anymore. Just boot back up and go about my business.
---
I like the loud/ridiculous ones.
---
I've done public teams and most of the time I'm off doing my own thing.
---
I‚Äôm at 16 right now. I missed doing a few from Friday because it just felt like a chore to even launch the game, but besides that I‚Äôve done all the challenges, including the NW ones. Which I don‚Äôt see why people don‚Äôt do them. Besides reviving other players, they‚Äôve all been super easy.
---
They seem to be interrested only on people who dupe items and sell them for real money online. There have been loads of well known dupers / hackers around for months and months and they have been reported countless of times. And nothing has been done about them. There has been atleast two "banwaves" between. Using exploits/cheats/dupes is pretty safe in this game it seems.
---
Ah the unique flora of Wal-Mart creatures. Now that is a whole new beast in itself.
---
Level 17, no NW unless it's the easy ones done in under 5 minutes. Mainly grinding repeatable. Goal is to dailies and at least 400 or 500 in repeatable xp till I hit the end.
---
Same here. I've sold about 20 violet flux for 100 caps a piece in the last week.
---
You believed Bugthesda when they said the 'fixed' something?  Can I recommend investing in some 'beachfront property' in Arizona? Or maybe a bridge in Brooklyn, real cheap?
---
Ya i played all night on a full public team, didnt interact once with them, and nobody talked on the mic
---
It was great
---
Sorry I think I might of muddled my massage. Its going to be a grind xD Just a possible one. Battle passes are big grinds by design as then most people  won't/can't do it. Thus playing for levels.
---
But the way it's looking to me, doing all the adventure dailies and weeklies with some grinding should get you have. But miss a few days and you best do the double xp and score weekends.
---
Just aim? I mean yeah vats is nice, but I‚Äôm a stealth rifleman build and I don‚Äôt need that one mechanic.
---
Tesla is a rifle.
---
It takes about 30 minutes for me to level up at level 140~ , I dont think level exp increases after a point though so it should be pretty achievable.
---
Its been around since beta, I've lost hope it'll be fixed by now.
---
Admittedly it usually takes more work to balance a game for both PvE and PvP unless you make the rules separate (which they've already done for this game), but it can be done. Games also don't need to be perfectly balanced for them to be fun, especially when it's in the context of a completely option aspect of the game.
---
You say removing PvP will cut down on assholes, but like I said, I've encountered far more assholes that were PvE only players than toxic PvPers. It's all about perspective, and I think a lot of PvE players will jump the gun and call normal PvPers toxic just because they're emotional and upset over losing. In my opinion that's far worse than simply killing someone's character in a video game that allows it.
---
I toss them in my vendors for 50caps and they usually sell withing a day or two.
---
Thanks for info
---
True, but I was thinking he was talking about ballistic rifles since he first talked about the fixer, but thanks for the heads up anyways.
---
But seems like it‚Äôd save server load if that was one of the first things checked prior to fully loading, could even be an option that pops up as it‚Äôs loading on the load screen.
---
LoL no, check my posts &amp; comments if u think i defend em. This was intended as another bash
---
I don't necessarily mind it on mooks, but it needs to change on legendaries. Especially in events. There's always that one prick who one shots the legendaries so no one else gets a chance. 
---
I don't mind if there's someone sitting around in an event doing nothing just to farm legendaries, I'd rather have that than miss out on them
---
Not about the pvp, but the fact I'm being stealth sniped from max range when I would've left the workshop and nothing was locked. Lasttime some lvl 600 stealth sniped me after i turned around from talking to grahm, I couldn't see it was contested due the how close Grahm walks by the border of sunnyside or whatever it is. It's not necessarily the workshop pvp but pvp in general. It's usually players with no skill trying to cap farm others. If they wanted to actually pvp and not stealth snipe or explosive tesla that'd be a different story. I usually set up a workshop and leave it for whomever might want it, I capture the low lvl area ones fix them up with gens and things then server hop so someone else can have it. Regardless it wasn't the topic and was a tangent.
---
Yeah, I've done some perk card switch ups. My build is horrible lol.
---
I don't want it to be nerfed, but there should be viable alternatives, right now it's just ridiculous, and if they don't go the way I suggest and instead nerf bloodied, then 90% of the player base will get upset, I know I would, I have worked super hard in these three months to perfect my build and I'm still not done.
---
When it shows the old workshop icon yea, when it shows the new fast travel icons no.
---
Basically this. It‚Äôd be a lot smarter even from a programming standpoint if it were implemented first prior to fully loading the world (or even during), but it‚Äôs something that came after the build and for either dumb happenstance or possible intentional reasons they didn‚Äôt add any code to check beforehand, and they‚Äôre likely not going to do the massive costs associated with moving it since ‚Äúit‚Äôs not broken‚Äù on their end.
---
So what if someone turns up and doesn't do anything?
---
It's not like there's a player limit on events. So it will literally make no difference to you if that person is stood in the background or not.
---
i just want the fireplace door...
---
the helmet is gonna be about 10k or more
---
Well a well oh well, you have legacy weapons you no longer want? Well I sure want them, because I‚Äôm a PvPer and as we all know, PvP is only half a gear check. You have to be able to use the gear well. You can beat a guy using a legacy laser rifle if you have the skill... Legacy yielder tried to take me on while I was using my melee character who was at the time level 41 and stuck using a level 10 BSS sledgehammer. Because I was able to get close, I smack him with a power attack to stagger, and finish him with another blow. (As for how I could get close, I was using a Chinese Stealth armor. He was using SBs as well, but if you have good eyes you can see a stealth field‚Äôs shimmer as they move. Alternatively use Berry Mentats.) But I could use a legacy for this character...
---
All of this is a joke. I wouldn‚Äôt ask you to just give me your legacies. Unless you want to of course...
---
The PvP stuff is sound though. That‚Äôs all legit, but the best way to kill a legacy yielding asshat is to become one yourself. A legacy or melee is the only way to push through Quantum spamming.
---
And...? So what? How will that negatively impact your ability to complete the event?
---
Can you randomly find them or was it just from the mole miner event?
---
Some are Atom Hoarders
---
Your exact words: "forget rifles... try a tesla".
---
no idea^^
---
Ohhhh yeah I get ya I mean unless you suffer from really really bad short term memory loss it shouldn‚Äôt be detrimental...you are 100% right it should always show. Also a weird thing I‚Äôve noticed is when an even pops to defend a workshop if you fast travel to the even it‚Äôll cost caps so you have to make sure to fast travel to the WS and not the event which can be annoying when the icon is covering it
---
I still don‚Äôt fully understand why god mode allows you to stack bobble heads.
---
People can still buy from vendors with the power cut to them. I made that mistake.
---
Are you breaking down the junk?
---
Having to create a burner alt just to get a challenge done makes the system sound really stupid and broken.
---
It's a feature.
---
Only save the major components: screws, gears, adhesive, nuclear material, steel, lead etc. 
---
Based on your build. 
---
Either that or subscribe to Fallout 1st for a separate scrap box. You can subscribe for a month, fill it to the absolute brim. Then cancel. You can still take stuff out once you‚Äôre no longer under the subscription but can‚Äôt put any in.
---
Yes, it's thousands of materials though and it seems to add up. I have 0 actual items in it
---
In reality--make the other traits viable. Respect players work in getting these sets. 
---
Their parent company ZOS and what they did to us in ESO- nerf bloodied, and anything else fun with a goddam sledgehammer.
---
RIP Earthgore. It's not like I had to get help in Bloodroot Forge or anything as a new healer. Hopefully someone knows what I'm talking about.
---
I hate the fact Dynamite isn‚Äôt on the Loot tables of Human and the like NPCs
---
The quantum ones are so beautiful even if they‚Äôre hard to use (for me)
---
Same. I scripted it cause I‚Äôm Straight Egde tho
---
Throw away ammo you don't use if you dont wanna use ammo converter.
---
Throw away any aid you dont want to use. No reason to have water or stimpacks in there in the long run.
---
Actually build a decent camp fill with every kind of bench 
---
Throw away/sell/breakdown any weapons you wont ever use.
---
1. Make sure you are breaking down junk into its pieces before putting them into the stash.  
---
2.  Make sure to bulk what junk you can.  This reduces its weight further.  
---
3.  Set a hard cap generally between 50-100 per item that you keep for each item.  Mark what you go through heavily so you can make sure to gather what you need as you walk around and then clear out the extra random stuff you build up with.  
---
Personally I have my junk set to 150 max outside of lead and steel.  Lead I stock up on constantly and steel I keep at around 300 since I use a lot for bullets.  This puts my stash at around 600 units I would say roughly and each day I clear out the previous days haul to use up my 1400 cap limit at the vendors.
---
LMG is an absolute unit in kill potential but heavy like others pointed out.
---
Handmade is kind of assault rifles.
---
Do your self this favor. Max gun crafting out to level 5 and buy the handmade plan at white springs resort.
---
Craft about 40 to scrap to learn the mods you want.
---
You should Vats them like a real Fucking Wastelander
---
Actually, it's really no advantage.  I have the cooler and just scrapped it for the Ammo converter.  The cooler didn't keep the tatos cold enough for the next adhesive harvest to mature. If it were marginally better or equal to the fridge backpack it would be worth it. Gimped, it's just decoration. better I carry tatos with the good with salt perk and convert my scrap ammo into arrows/bolts (which is aluminum/adhesive intensive to make in quantity).
---
Oh man! It does not necessitate it. It makes it easier. It is a shortcut for people that think it is not worth their time and still want every reward.
---
Why they down voting you, they know you're right!
---
Could be i suppose. Judt irritated me that it was the same player each time and each time it was like it was targeting me.
---
I don't "need" vats to hit things... I can aim.
---
However that being said I have perks I chose around vats like Gun Fu, concentrated fire and better critical for example it's nice when there are 4 or 5 targets you pop vats aim at head and just pop off 5 shots and get 5 kills and then better critical perk for a slightly tougher target which a few and far between.
---
But regardless if I want to free aim or be a lazy vats sniper the feature should work when called on, not be 2 feet away aim at torso and miss 10 shots.
---
Didn't they ban people because they found a way to exploit the gold and SS? I'm sure they will do the same with these people. Just play the game normal like everyone else cheaters.
---
Totally agree
---
*bethesda adds this simple feature*
---
me: throws harmless tato at random
---
*bethesdas harmless new feature auto tags everyone on server to me for pvp*
---
*sigh*
---
They‚Äôre called No Lifers and probably don‚Äôt understand the concept of Body Odour
---
Honestly who wants these dumb ass skins anyway the best things in Fo76 are in Game.
---
They need items to fill up the legendary run.
---
It's a current bug and not supposed to be normal Icons. It has been recognised by Bethesda and they are looking for a fix.
---
I'm not so sure about your number. I could easily level daily when I was in the 200's, but it was (before latest patch with all the xp boosts) much harder once I reach the 300's.
---
This happened to me yesterday at Camden Park with scorched. I noticed their heads were missing too.
---
Pathetic. Those are rookie numbers. My record is 67. I struggle to put my strength that high using glitches and aid.
---
HA HA MEME NUMBER
---
The whole game engine would need to be redesigned for this. The magic weapon effect is likely due to server delay/latency/high ping damage calculation and validation. That‚Äôs why sometimes vats does not register, enemies springs back health, etc. 
---
That‚Äôs the kind of thing that a subscription free online game will less likely do.
---
If people don‚Äôt I will consider doing it.
---
I'm well aware there are no Native American witch doctors. The original post was about a made-up tribal culture, not specifically Native American.
---
That's awesome! If you want to boost the damage of the Power fist a good bit, the twisted muscles mutation will increase the damage by 25%, however it does lower gun accuracy by 50%. Overall this is huge for my melee build.
---
Needs to be done though, never seen a triple A game have these type of issues for this long
---
Got it, thank you!
---
A lot of people would be pissssssed if Bethesda removed legacy weapons, people legit spend real money on those guns... hell who cares about their feelings, I say remove em and balance the game!
---
Gimme ambidextrous two handed pistol perk card to *blam* *blam* the wilderness - then I'll be happy!
---
I‚Äôve run into one on fairly recently who still managed to somehow get himself stuck in place during a nuclear winter math, and another months ago who was somehow no cliping through buildings around at the top of the world.
---
Exactly! I have those legacy weapons and they ain‚Äôt fair, especially the explosive effect on the energy weapons, I would be happy if they took mine alone with everyone else‚Äôs
---
I don‚Äôt use a vats build but I do a 3rd of the damage when I freeaim with my double barrel.
---
Ah, then you must learn The Way of The Bush.
---
I'm honestly curious how you managed to rank up that much already. I've done 80% of the challenges up til now and I'm only rank 12 :(
---
We need sexy women and girlfriends for our camps!
---
I'm not a fan of NW either but because you can't or don't wanna get the 250 SCORE points from nuclear winter you've decided you don't want any of it? You'll still get a decent amount of progress even without doing NW.
---
2. Only aluminum and lead are worth bulking for weight reduction. Other junk components weigh the same no matter bulked or not.
---
A lot of this stuff isnt exactly canon though. Aside from that, the lore in this game is canon. Not sure how they are gonns fit the BoS in though.
---
I never knew this.  Though will respond with that you need to bulk them to be able to sell them for point 3.
---
Fuckin brilliant
---
That was one of the first things i did in the game, i hate the green color. Changed it in the .ini files to the same color as new vegas and the pipboy light into a warm yellow/orange. this is it if youre interested:

I suppose. Doesnt it come off a bit tone deaf to you to mash together different tribal traditions with little regard for their purpose or origin and play it off as roleplay? It comes off as offensive to me; but I do understand where you're coming from, more than likely having little exposure to american indian culture. While the above stated are gross caricatures, its better than you trying to weasel your way into our traditions and practices and declaring those to be your own.
---
Changing ini on pc. Other  people still see green though
---
They did, but it wasn't very a accurate haha. That was a great DLC though, I loved Fallout 3 and the DLCs they had.
---
The game is currently giving away that stuff in NW due to a bug.
---
You can also put the brawler mods on your arm pieces, pretty sure its another 20% damage.
---
well at least you got completion xD when i join its usually downed in literally 5 seconds from 1-2 guys with hacked weapons XD
---
yeah I guess that‚Äôs the upside to consoles, less hackers if any at all
---
I keep one vendor machine only, this way I limit my sales to the more valuable shit. I don't have a huge turnover but I rarely have to power it down.
---
Plus, I feel like I have a better feel for the market when every spot NEEDS to have something that'll sell. I scrip anything that's not actually usable for an endgame player.
---
What do you do to level up?
---
The only other way to do it is by dropping things (such as in a world container like a suitcase) and returning to the same server with the other character to retrieve them. This is safest with a private server because you're given a five minute window before it'll refresh the server. If using a public server, you'd have to "join" back on someone who was in that same server you dropped the items in, and even then it's possible someone else could stumble across the container and take whatever you've dropped by the time you return. Unfortunately there's no simple or 100% safe method to transfer items between your characters.
---
get fo1st
---
In fact, I met him in the real money trade. I bought be plasma from him for the first time. Later, by accident, I entered his world and found that he was using dupe glitch. Then I reported him to Bethesda. You know, this is on the PS4, which is far worse than the PC
---
For it's a trap if you can find the beast's spawn point, which is usually somewhere just outside the event area, you'll normally find it's bugged out if anything attacks it. It'll gontonthe event as soon as you kill whatever, just don't kill the beast.
---
These are the guys to complain that there‚Äôs nothing to do
---
My main is a rifleman/commando with a tse handmade. I switch the mods on it based on the situation, and while it's certainly not a one-shot-the-queen type weapon (which I wouldn't see the fun in anyway) it handles nearly anything I come up against with relative ease.
---
Awesome I appreciate the information, I have Fallout 1st so doing it on a private server is definitely a option :D
---
Yup.  The ironic thing is that the player base fixed the problems for BGS in the previous games.  If you ever played FO3, NV, FO4 the Unofficial Patch from Nexus was the first thing most people installed along with a ton of other game engine patches all developed by the coding player base.  That's why the classic games still sell and run great.  Not because BGS did anything officially. They're treating this game like FO3 and FO4 but didn't realize that all that support is non-existant and, quite the opposite, VERY VULNERABLE to manipulation which is catastrophic in FO76 with real-world monetary incentives to exploit the code at the expense of the game economy and player base.
---
I have a TS FFR handmade and that thing is amazing. Wish I could find a TSE! Either way, great rifle. Biggest problem for me is the ammo. That‚Äôs why I really enjoy the lever action, as .45 is quite abundant
---
Oh yeah, that's the best method then. I've done this hundreds of times because I've got 4 characters. Have yet to lose anything doing it this way.
---
Yeah, it's definitely easier to find .45, wouldn't need to craft nearly as much as you would for 5.56.
---
I use my quad ammo, +10%dmg +1 PER Black Handmade for general junk farming, taking unowned workshops etc. Such a 'do it all' where I can now down shitty mobs without reloading. First 3* I ever got with any decent traits so it has sentimental value.
---
yup, in the Cranberry Bog almost every time I've done it the SB gets stuck on the NAR repair yard fence and in the mire it can spawn underneath the cliffs. When I'm power leveling I don't have time to wait for that jibber-jabber.
---
I was thinking the same thing, that would be so awesome if we could launch a mega nuke
---
I finished the crafting weekly one and it was horrible. My main just hit 53 and my other two are 35(I think) and 23 respectively. NONE have the mats to plop down 20 light sources.    
---
The collect wood one was "Collect 25 times not pieces."    
---
I tis frustrating but I get why some of them aren't as easy and time consuming. In any job or hobby, the harder you work (with experience and skill) you are rewarded with better things. I have yet to see something like this in any game so it is a flawed system. It's not even a week out.
---
Only if they bring back the stocks too.
---
Most NW challenges have been really simple. Missing the odd one isn't going todo that much harm, it's only 250 points. If you stay in groups in adventure, use xp boosts like cranberry relish and inspirational perks and buff intelligence you can easily make that up. Make sure you hit the big scoring events like scorched earth, line in the sand and guided meditation.
---
Serendipity
---
Remove Legendary Effects? Hard NO.
---
How do you know he was duping?
---
Not legendary effects, the broken ones that ain‚Äôt supposed to be on that weapon
---
instigating limb dmg .50 hunting rifle, I think the other effect is less cost for vats crits or whatever, but this rifle is popping heads like no ones business!
---
I suspect they realized early on that even NW was a bit of a non starter for a lot of people which may be why it‚Äôs only a daily.
---
granted a lot of the daily‚Äôs so far have been either Meh or annoying. ttodays was annoying. Me entire nw set of runs I only got one chance to Revive all night.first match turned into a punching match early do because it seemed like 2/3 of the players selected the same freaking building, by the time that match thinned out there was only one of my team left, and he was out of ammo. Second match I picked a spawn point at the last min because no one else Did, and we all ended up scattered over the map.   
---
later match, well at least we were all together... 3 instantly hiding in the bush‚Äôs nearby, And me at least trying to put together some kit. I think they all probably went afk Because when we were inside the fire zone..,and I think I was the only one to move...
---
This was my idea as well, and I tried asking a couple groups but no responses cause nobody in this game has a headset. Ended up getting the revives in regular gameplay when a teammate was knocked down and the enemy just ran off and then in another round a teammate of mine just randomly fell from too high up and go knocked down.
---
I'm really looking forward to it. I have the standard Xbox One and I'm praying that playing on the XSX will be a lot better. I'm sick of having to deal with performance issues constantly.
---
The fight is more beneficial if it‚Äôs dragged out I find, more mobs = more Xp. As long as you don‚Äôt fail it‚Äôs fine I think.
---
I'm not a huge fan, so I'll pick and choose. The one the other day was so easy - place a camp 3 times. Just spawned in, placed camp 3 times job done. Didn't matter what happened next (I just played bush wookie waiting to die. Came second as it happened, so it went well!). 
---
So far they haven't been too bad really. I skip ones that rely on other players like the revive one, but that's OK. So far the rest of the daily/weekly challenges are simple so should be fine.
---
... I didn't even think of this. Good idea!
---
I was under the impression that it would be difficult to complete the series without doing all of the challenges and nuclear winter seem to be about 10% of the challenges.
---
I have over 4k steel, 1k glass, 1k cloth, 2.5k wood and well over 100 of the rest. Any way to convert these into a product?
---
#BethesdaisLAZY
---
Nah. The problem is junk taking up 75% of our stash for no reason.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox if you still need someone to do it with (I need to do it myself)
---
I'm only level 15 in Seasons.    
---
I don't like the NW ones b/c I never got into it.    
---
Some of the Challenges are easy which I like and others are straight up Alabama thinking backwards.
---
did you put the supply drop dcument thing into the computer?
---
If you bulk them at a tinker bench you can sell the bulked item directly to a vendor.
---
I get super frustrated with this too but I‚Äôve found that if I tap e twice really quickly rather than just pressing it once, then it most often works. I guess if you‚Äôre on console maybe double tapping whatever button you‚Äôd use to confirm where you want to fast travel might work the same way?
---
I'm confused. How can experience point buffs help earn SCORE points?
---
All the math I've seen doesn't include the repeatable experience challenge, but it does include all the leveling up challenges.
---
Since Leveling up needs experience, you'll be doing more than enough of the repeatable XP challenge to cover the costs of the missed NW challenges and then some, so  ignoring NW is not really a problem.
---
When I entered his world, I found several 2lv accounts. Then I found that they were surrounded by a box. When I went to the box, I saw dozens of the same weapons in it. Then I took them away. Finally, I went back to my private server. I had 30 more BSS powerfist.So I'm sure he's duping
---
I have a fast tapping finger and it still doesn‚Äôt work lol. Some say it does but for me when it stops working it stops working.
---
I prefer solo, story driven games and have played most of my time in 76 that way. I have played in random teams in it more than I ever have in my life before it.    
---
I wish they could get the chat thing working better.
---
It's gunna be tedious either way. Bethesda designed it so it makes people have to play everyday in order to complete all 100 events. It's been calculated that just completing every daily &amp; weekly challenge won't be you enough to get all 100 rewards. The X-factor being that repeatable 100 SCORE points challenge. It's a dirty tactic I don't agree with myself.
---
üëÜ
---
Not sure the weapon, but some exploding thing (harpoon gun or broadsider?) sent the instantly dead queen from ground, flying up, and into some slow motion ragdolling as the SBQ corpse flew off into the horizon and out of sight
---
Yeah, it's pretty hard to revive other players when I'm always the first to die. Forcing me into NW is a detriment to whatever team I end up on.
---
Wait why was he putting them in boxes where was he? Does sound very sketchy
---
also, check the daily weekly etc quests from the map screen, some of that junk could go towards completing a few (build 10/10 floors, walls, etc)
---
You get 100 score for every 10k xp.
---
WoW had/has an in-game mail system. There are mailboxes almost everywhere and you can mail a limited number oi items and gold to ANY player as long as you know the name. Myfirst char was 80 and doing very well before I considered making another.    
---
Point is, it would save people a lot of time. There should be a small fee per mail, with a limited amount of slots/weight. If you wanted it delivered directly to you it would be through a cargo bot that only you can open. You'd get have to craft an easy item for summoning it.    
---
You could send/receive from any Train Station and if mailboxes are a thing could do the same.
---
Well I just happen to agree with you. And I‚Äôm sorry you have 12 downvotes. But you need to learn you‚Äôre not allowed your own opinion on Reddit. Especially not this sub.
---
I wish that the Fallout games had a weapon carry set up like MGSV. Pistol on the hip, rifle in the hands and large rifle/RPG on the back.
---
You are not alone, but we are few.
---
I spare the teams from myself and play solo. Works out OK for me on the whole. I've never won (2nd was my best) but consistently land up in the final 10.
---
I lost out on 1,250 points too as they auto-completed for me this last time around  You should still be able to get to level 100 (if that's your goal). Especially considering there will be a double xp weekend and double S.C.O.R.E. dailies for a weekend too.
---
part of what made fallout 4 kind of bland was the lack of visible weapons.
---
going into diamond city, picking a fight and suddenly half the town pull out rifles, pistols and shotguns when it was clear they weren't holding one before makes for immersive times.
---
Surely, out of your butt, is holstered...?! üòÑ
---
That technique is great for newer players who have trouble killing enough mobs to get screws from, or don't have caps to buy them. But, I'd rather buy them than have to deal with doing this. Caps are easy to come by, and I can have 50 screws in a matter of seconds and then go do something else.
---
I am getting so fucking tired of explaining this shit I wish there was a sticky just to explain basic game mechanics to people.
---
Stash limits do not exist just to sell the stash box.  Online games use these things we call "servers".  Every time you open your stash the shit inside doesn't magically appear, the ids representing each unique item needs to be loaded from the server.  The more items you have in your stash, the more ids need to be loaded and the more strain that is put on the server/game. If you have enough shit in your stash you can watch the game lag as it's loading the contents.  Stash limits exist to put a soft cap on the number of ids the game needs to load at a time to reduce the lag you experience as much as possible.
---
14 had some social activities and some stuff to learn.
---
You‚Äôll get the hang of it. It‚Äôs not like previous titles.
---
Options are
---
get fallout first..and even then that‚Äôs a crutch. if you don‚Äôt....
---
bulk the One item you have the most of and sell it At a train station. Replete when your stash gets full.
---
Scrap weapons and armor. Also think about Getting rid of excess clothing. Those you can at least technicaly sell.
---
if your finding your fertilizer count exploding, think about harvesting less food. It spoils if you don‚Äôt cook it then eat it. That said...
---
go to your chem bench and turn spoiled food into fertilizer. You realy don‚Äôt need 100 pounds of rotting biomass.
---
***For the love of God get rid of Grenaids missiles and mini nukes. If your not using a bow, crossbow, or railway riffle get rid of Spikes arrows and bolts. You can now at least convert some of that crap into ammo you will actualy use.***
---
I don't know why he put those in a box, which is 0 / 0 with no weight limit. I'm not sure if I can translate it correctly (I'm Chinese version), which is probably a dynamite box next to the dock bar. I tried to enter his world several times later, and the same thing still happened. I even used stealth to record him on one side until he found out, and then deleted my PSN
---
Pictures save to the console not the account! We jump between a couple of consoles and they all have different gallery‚Äôs. Best thing to do is just save them to your Xbox feed that way you keep them all
---
Heh fair enough. If you have a high enough xp buff you could always use those events to just farm the scorched that spawn if nothing else better is going on. I had a huge buff yesterday and was getting around 350 a kill for conquerors.
---
I accidentally skipped the dungeon portion of the event by entering the car garage next to the site and using the basement entrance of that..it takes you directly to the computer for the plans and registration site.  Easiest way for first half.
---
I have a scrapbot and junk extractor at my camp so I had enough items to build it no problem.
---
It‚Äôs not even as good as Fallout 4. Fallout 4 was good. There were no caps. You didn‚Äôt have to go through 482829383948293839473993938294839472737193738472938 hoops to get a good set of armor. You don‚Äôt have people with 84748393848393882738193838393848383¬£372728483748384748 Nuka Cola Quantums and BETSFEFFRFR2525 Gatling laser plasmas with Strangler Heart or T65 Power armor, or non PA builds, UNY/ASS/AP/SENT/CAV Secret Service jetpack armor fucking your ass in PvP, neither do you have the same players decimating every single legendary in 0.00000000000000000000000000000000001 seconds so you don‚Äôt even see it spawn in. And guess what? I could *relate* to the characters in FO4. The storyline had me hooked, wanting more, staying up for 50, 60 hell even up to 80 hours at a time because I was so engrossed in the lore... But not so with 76. Fallout 76 is a series of simultaneous time gated grinds. There‚Äôs very little content compared to the other Fallout games.
---
This.
---
They can't.
---
It's apparently a problem with Amazon servers, not anything on Bethesda's end.
---
It's been found that fire rate helps. But is not nessecary. It's more about hitting the same limb
---
The monkeys paw
---
Ah that sucks hope there‚Äôs not a dupe on console
---
I just feel like I've earned multiple overseer ranks since getting the jack o lantern and i still don't even have the beanie. Maybe I'm over estimating the xp I've earned.
---
Especially when some of them seem to be missing. For some reason, I don't have the 'gift' emote anymore, and it's just the waving the wad of cash...which isn't a gift. That's "Hey, I want to buy something."
---
How much exp would you say you get per hour.
---
If your main isn't 300+ you'll probably still want to level them for when legendary perks are available so you have more slots.
---
I only have 1100 Atoms and spent 500 on a camo PA paint. IMO, I would wait towards the end of the season to jump ahead. If every level costs 150 Atoms then the ones further down the board would be the ones best to spend them on.
---
How could you possibly have that information? Do people run around saying they bought their weapons off eBay on your servers?
---
By the time I unlocked Super Duper, I was one shotting Scorchbeasts with a level 10 BSS Sledgehammer in a Chinese Stealth suit. But then again, I specifically planned out a 2H melee Queen killer build.
---
Hey i got fallout around the same time and im 13.
---
Just a tip. If you grab a workshop, you can use the workshop's resources to craft lights and such. Keeps you from wasting your own materials and also explains why you may come across workshops full of just chairs and lights....
---
Serum-wise..I carry all but plague Walker, talons, twisted muscles, and herbivore. With full freak and the new team format that allows solo play but still crediting being on a team its almost all benefit and little to no negative. Bird bones, herd mentality, healing factor, and egg head are close to no brainers for stealth non laser and range build. Adrenal reaction takes away 12 AP and provides the bloodied effect to your dmg output. Grounded and scaly skin not far behind with lots of dmg protection boosts and small hits. Carnivore helps with the eating challenge of SD and still allows plant effect bonuses.
---
I would love it but it'll never happen
---
Lots of mods do better than Bethesda devs. fallout 3 for example, doesn't launch on Windows 10. Pull a mod, change a thing or two and it runs like a charm
---
YES PLEASE GOD
---
The Ammo Converter takes forever to use. I had over 3800 rounds of .38 I should be able to Convert as much as I can to hit the 2000 max, spend points, repeat.
---
Id suggest a mix of T-51B and X-01  
---
T51B arms fit nicely on an X-01 torso  
---
but its a good mix of damage resistance and the X-01 helps with the rads  
---
paint it in military green and it looks nice
---
Hey listen I‚Äôll safely dispose of any old legacy weapons you‚Äôre not using you can trust me the random dude on the interwebs :)
---
Absolutely, i miss having my revolver on my hip playing cowboy with the song "Big Iron" stuck in my head.
---
Ever since 4 i was a fan of that bull barrel 44 Magnum, but stupid that it couldn't sit on my hip. Even worse now tho that in 76 there's no such mod for the weapon.
---
Ive always had an idea about the strangler plants and hearts taking over the wasteland!
---
Wish I didn't finish all of the main and side quests already.
---
not sure, haven't really payed attention as this Covid thing that was supposed to just go away has been putting up MASSIVE NUMBERS, but at that season start i was level 290 and now I'm at 310 I haven't been West Tekking and such much though.
---
Just stay quiet, if they're intelligent they'll figure it out. If not , that's kind of entertaining.
---
The other challenges aren‚Äôt that bad but boy the level up one is just a slog. I don‚Äôt like NW so I‚Äôve almost given up on the gold star a few times already
---
Ill hit you up in a few, ill make it for free.
---
that tiny squishy baby man looks silly, clearly not mutated enough.
---
That sounds logic and all, sadly thats not the method they use.
---
this is not the tradeing sub my person
---
I never got AHK to work in 76. Do you have the script somewhere?
---
Ya that happens for me during events a lot. Also mine will swap to a different weapon in my wheel that wasn‚Äôt the last one I used and not the one I need, drives me nuts
---
Stealth sniping is a perfectly viable way to pvp. Would you prefer they had to walk up to you and declare they going to murder you?
---
Placebo
---
Cranberry Relish + High Int + Westek
---
Gauss rifle with tank killer perk if in power armour and just use any assassin's gear when in pvp
---
200 are still newbies. I was told this isnt true about that fight though, weird since Ive been tanking her since +3 months after release. But I swapped to gauss shotgun so havnt really felt the need to melee her.
---
Could you leave me your xbox live gt so i can see wgen your in please ?
---
Probably the repeateable.
---
Thats why its best to just nuke the bunker and force people to go to her. The less people standing in spots she cant reach the better the chances she lands.
---
He likely did the repeatable 100 SCORE per 10k XP.
---
Yup, melee weapons in particular.
---
I prefer not to as that will make me end up on google results, ill leave you a message right now on xbox.
---
Saw you on caps discord earlier, nice job man
---
Tried Bloodied with him. Still trying, it's really nice... Until you get found out, or something with rads starts being a dick, then it's just a real quick ticket to trying to get away.
---
Yeah probably wrong sub. Just look around vendors though, I see these in vendors all the time, especially speed demon and marsupial - really popular serums to sell.
---
They are still at the top
---
You can still get plenty from dailies and events. I took ine of my toons from level 200 to 207 yesterday with all the buffs. It's just a matter of buffing intelligence and xp as high as possible.
---
I would rock my Bloodied 33/25 magnum if I could equip a bull barrel but these devs are lazy. The Blue Camo skin literally has the bull barrel on the image yet they can't add it after all this time? And we can't have an extended tube to hold more rounds in the lever action? Its .45 not 45-70, .45 is a smaller caliber and should be able to fit more rounds. If it was 45-70 then it should be doing more damage.
---
What...
---
You might have fun with the story but when that ends you'll be back to the reason you left.
---
If you prime the gauss mini gun it‚Äôs not so bad with ammo smith and super duper, the flux farm is just time consuming . My bloodied gauss mini is a SBQ melter
---
(Angry Sunny noises echo from Foundation)
---
You are getting the points and you got them after doing 3/5 parts of the challenge. This question has been asked 1000 times at this point.
---
I‚Äôm in on this. 
---
Imo nothing should be able to be called legacy. 
---
If an item is not supposed to be in the game I think they should remove them all together and make some sort of compensation if possible.
---
You need all silos for possum too if you want that stuff
---
It would be worth to many people.    
---
My main is 53 and has no end-game gear. A few good pieces but nothing Ultra-anything. it took awhile but I managed to go from less than 500 .308 rounds to over 1000 for the Brotherhood Recon Rifle.
---
Where did you read this?
---
It‚Äôs interesting actually.
---
Against normal ass SBs, just peppering the wings makes them drop, though they like to drop right where you don't want them to. You can keep peppering them though and makes it easier. Head knocks out their screaming (I think. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't), their legs makes them slow to a craaaawl, which is super handy. Q/E combat shotgun is the end goal for all that, and the bonus is the level of it means fuck all so you can use any level. I had snagged a Q/E/I think it's -25% AP Level 35 pump shotgun for the wife and she's been using the fuck out of it to knock shit over. I got a Mutant's Explosive combat shotgun on one of my chars, just slapped a drum on it. If I can't cripple whatever it is in 12 shots, I'm better off running and jumping away.
---
I totally agree with you on that! If Bethesda can take the time to remove the legendary effect on the Radical mask, they can remove certain legendary effects on weapons
---
I have been successful enough converting ammo to caps and then other ammo, with the exception of 40mm, missiles and mini nukes.
---
u aint popular
---
I usually keep around 100+ junk of each type, but now I'm crafting daily gauss miniguns (enough for 150 daily scrip) and those need a lot of junk + what about good and god rolls? Weapons weight 10-30lb and that is much - I have around 10+ of such and sum of them are trade-only, so I won't sell them for caps and need to wait for someone to want it for something I want. 
---
I am always sitting around 700-800 stash space, so practically always full... So not even hording anything, this is not good considering this game is actually about going around the left world and collecting resources, ammo, weapons, armor, etc.
---
Overall, this game has too many limits, which is the most frustrating thing for me. I mean like every little thing in this games has limits that don't allow you to enjoy it.
---
I keep seeing these survival tents floating in the air at SBQ. How are they doing this and is there any gameplay/strategy point to it?
---
This has nothing to do with popularity but safety and privacy.
---
BE HM &amp; a limb damage fixer for up close.
---
(takes all the mutagens)
---
It's not too difficult if youve spent the past couple of days no life grinding with all xp boosts and maximum efficiency
---
I think he‚Äôs commenting about the fact that you can be pvp sniped when your no where near the workshop? For example claim the food factory workshop, get gunned down in the Morgantown airport, or claim the ammo Plant get gunned down In Nuclear feaver.
---
Just scrap her terminal, not store, and rebuild. She'll give you another quest. I keep scraping until I get a weapons case recovery quest
---
Wait, I bought my copy on GOG and it runs perfectly on windows 10. Or at least I haven‚Äôt noticed any issues.
---
Ahaha no young padawan it does not. Xp increases at every level.
---
How did you do it all at once? It has 5 sub tasks to do
---
I used to farm play time daily with all my 7 toons with no issue. Now i can't do that. 3 different accounts. 
---
Pass the buck was an useless event, but now working towards score, where you need to complete a daily, that and buried with honor arr a couple of the easier ones to do, time wise
---
BTW I was not on timeout. As i said, I play with 7 toons, and usually pick all junk around to reset the 120 picked up so usual items respawn. I haven't seen a shovel there for at least 3 days now
---
I felt that way today, I was on an event team and they all left and started a new team with someone else lol. Cut me deep
---
YES. PLEASE. AAAAND separate LEGANDARY from NONLEGENDARY items, too!
---
The server still needs to check if ur camp is taken so the save isn‚Äôt much
---
Nerf the buff stacking as well
---
Cold? You think these are nuclear powered as well? Wait.... how do the fridges work? ...I have to go do some thinking.
---
With so many people doing bloodied builds I‚Äôd get adrenal reaction
---
I wish more modders would share their work with the community even if they risk someone copying or stealing it. Isn‚Äôt it better to know someone finds enjoyment in all the hours of work you‚Äôve put into it?
---
I've been doing most of this anyway. My biggest challenge is finding the right sugarbombs.
---
You remember when you got those points for seemingly no reason? Those were your rewards.
---
Well yeah those random encounters don‚Äôt really give more than 10-50 rep and 6000 is required for the last level. 
---
I hear you though. It feels like it‚Äôs completely still..
---
Since you're lvl 300 ,make sure you don't open any perk pack untill legendary perk come. If you do,you risk getting doubles of maxed cards and those will just vanish.
---
Today's challenge was the only one I'd been unable to complete, tbh. And not for a lack of trying- I don't have a mic, so I'm not able to communicate that I need help doing it, and trying to do it naturally has just gotten me killed a bunch.
---
Ya the colossus drops like 300 to 500 caps. Noice!
---
Well DUH on me.  
---
I was in a Building Group and got that one last night so it's too late but that's a GREAT tip.
---
Gotcha.
---
Would require actual know-how and now just not making some more skins.
---
What about workshops like red rocket and the converted munitions factory? They both have no nearby fast travel point, which is annoying as you will have to walk a long way if you want to claim it.
---
if vats were enabled you'd be oneshot even moreso than you already are lol
---
just hide in bushes or try and get the perk that lets you breathe underwater 
---
surviving til the last 10 standing gives more xp than any kills will, so if you're having trouble aiming, focus more on staying alive and out of sight
---
One word, double score weekend, find out the date save your weeklies of that week for that day and do them
---
Fire place hidden door!!!!! Also I‚Äôm a heavy gunner so the Appalachian thunder stick skin looks awesome and the power armor skins
---
That‚Äôs more or less the first thing I did on NW last night. 
---
One pf the randos and I jumped grom the cliffs in Morgantown and revived eachother. 
---
Damn, I love this community xD
---
I usually hide in the bushes and try to survive for minimal 10 minutes. I only get a kill when somebody stands still.
---
Magic weapons exist on consoles.
---
Then skip it. You can make up the shortfall in other ways by earning xp and completing the repeatable 10k xp for 100 SCORE. Use buffs to xp and INT and utilise public teams. Theres a double xp weekend and a double SCORE challenge weekend coming. Theres plenty of ways and time to make up any shortfalls. Dont get panicked by some of the Math being tossed around
---
You needing to pick up your loot bag is warning enough.
---
You people are writing like someone has a gun on your head and is forcing you to do this stuff. If it is so tedious and boring don't fucking do it.
---
Please not another useless currency.
---
Just let us turn gold into bullions at a specific rate.even 1/100 if necessary.
---
The fights for that gold workshop would spike lol.
---
Sorry that sounds like total BS. A lot of things run on amazon servers. Why don‚Äôt they all do this too?
---
Pvp isn't for you.
---
Ohh cmon, i'm already ally, but good eye Sir.
---
I played about 8 games yesterday and never got 1 shotted. My main issue is sometimes people load into a match quicker than me for some reason.
---
Quad ffr Tesla, gamma, railway and/or gauss.
---
I've lost about 10 matches, still no closer to reviving anyone, probably made some enemies in my own teams though by getting them killed. Not fun for me
---
hydroelectric power, they fixed the rustic watermill in the last patch :)
---
(points gauss shotgun at enemy)
---
(charges up shot)
---
(release trigger)
---
(character furiously shakes)
---
Just died again after 30 seconds, shit is a joke. Lol!!!
---
GOG usually include fan-made patches IF said patch is needed to run the game on a modern system.
---
Do you think that will be enough to make up for no more NW?
---
Not when you are editing the settings .ini that doesn't give you any advantage.
---
Fuck sake.
---
I pvp all day long in the normal game, win 80% of the time without stealth boys and Tesla‚Äôs......so?
---
The game actually has very little incentive to kill other players as it highly rewards you for simply staying alive. 
---
The only time to fight is if you have to. As there isnt really that great of loot to even get. 
---
You can ignore your team if youre not even going for the win. Consistently just keep staying alive as long as you can and you'll level up a lot faster than if you actually played the game.
---
The GoG version has the GFWL stuff removed.
---
Try Welch station and Camden park. Those are liste don the wiki. Also there is another Vendor bot Greg in Grafton that operates from a bulding in town
---
is it due to unlucky spawns or what?
---
It‚Äôs broken because you aren‚Äôt good? Don‚Äôt spawn near people and run out in the open. Stay crouched. 
---
Unless you‚Äôre on PC then there may be cheaters.
---
Dude get it even if people say it's bad the devs already said its being reworked
---
Seems a lot of people are super op. I guess
---
What do you then? You can't fast travel so I guess you start crafting. What's best to craft for xp/used materials? Machete?
---
I struggled with NW alot when i first started playing but ive slowly gotten better, the revive teamates thing is next to impossible though so i skipped it and made up for the missed SCORE grinding events and stuff
---
I‚Äôm up the creek from helvatia, I get attacked by scorched sometimes but they‚Äôre always level 5 so my heavy laser turrets smoke em. I like the forest region it‚Äôs much nicer looking than most of the map
---
The plans can be purchased at Grafton station, Welch station and Lewisburg station at random times from the vendor. The plan is called "Lever Gun."
---
Drops at a high rate in the deathclaw cave at the abandoned waste dump in the far east.
---
let me know if your on pc, i can assist you and make you some if you want
---
ign pc, sonofarobot
---
Thanks, never thought or that....üòÇ
---
Bloodied explosive lever action. I‚Äôm a heavy build but with just 3 points in rifleman I can pretty much one shot most things whilst wandering also. 
---
It‚Äôs also a massive ammo and time saver as well as pretty fun combined with mutations and secret service jetpack. Jumping and flying around doing reverse skeet shooting from the perspective of the skeet is real fun.
---
&gt;(And if one person says ‚Äúgit good‚Äù and aim. Guess what, when you are old and have poor eyesight this isn‚Äôt an option.) how are people actually playing this........ Absolutely broken!!!!!
---
Well you clearly acknowledged that it's a personal problem, then made the claim the mode is broken..
---
The mode isn't broken (maybe on PC with all the exploits, but on console it works just fine)
---
Depends,  I'm a power armor bloodied and I have 710
---
It‚Äôll account for about a bit under half of the nuclear winter challenges. That doesn‚Äôt account for the repeatable one though
---
That means nothing. nuclear winter is true pvp, everyone has the same opportunity, no legendary gear, no spamming nuka quantum, no vats.
---
Love satire this is great
---
I got it in about 5 minutes with randoms.  We took turns diving off a cliff and got it.  Should make a thread here next time to organize it if you don‚Äôt have a mic.
---
Start your own public team and you're in a group,even solo.
---
you might be confusing it with how many of the daily challenges your completing, not actually events, noticed we‚Äôve had a few of those days events recently
---
It probably should be fair for all players, not just hyperactive teenagers. Right
---
yeah some of the NW perks are more powerful versions of the normal ones, so people can be tankier or have more armor penetration than you're used to dealing with
---
it makes the first few games really rough til you have your own build, but it does get better imo
---
They should give a debufff every 20 secs of bush wookying in NW these are some sick mofos watching me 1 vs 3 like a Spartan o
---
Oh yeah I noticed that! Awesome.
---
Presumably it's because there are people who don't care about camp building and would rather get into a server quickly. Perhaps for an event, or perhaps because that's where their friends are.
---
It takes to long, genades should be something you throw and forget like blocking a door or path and not a tedious vats target
---
Well maybe just make it an option in the settings
---
Yes.... They brag
---
Funnest one I saw was the mini gun mirv orbital rocket launched
---
They would server wait us sometimes while killing sbq
---
500th searchable repost today?
---
aimbot cheaters or you just stood there and got killed, happens to me, but i sneak hide most of it, only played 4 times recently, it‚Äôs gud but meh could be better
---
I normally just pick a location I haven't done in a while and kill everything inside (assuming its a place which can spawn at max level). WS Golf Club, West Tek, Rob-Co, etc. I think this will be much easier once they make mobs level to you, that way you can choose anywhere.
---
I quite like it
---
This.  Turning in a daily to Rocksy and choosing the option on the screen to leave to convo and noticing it provides rep while not finishing the quest isn‚Äôt hacking.  It‚Äôs in the game.  Not bannable.
---
This is why I always hate pvp. I was shooting some dude in the head for like 10 seconds before he turned around, sprays a few bullets and I just die...
---
What event? Was it a public or private team?
---
How annoying. How is the game even fun if you‚Äôre just buying the best weapons, the best part is grinding for legendaries and finally getting the god drop or vendor hopping to find stuff you want
---
Looks amazing ! I‚Äôm one away from this and really looking forward to it
---
This is absolutely false!!! levels or 50 may not matter much now but are going to matter again when legendary perks come out, I've been people do the math to max every legendary perk you need to be lev 1000
---
probably good spec pcs, or net connection, doubt server just puts everyone in at exact same time
---
pc specs?
---
You also hinted that maybe OP fucked it up.  Merely pointing out the fact that no Fallout game map has ever been shaped exactly like the real world locations.
---
I thought about the WoW mail system but realised the issue there is you are always on the same server. It would be far trickier to do on this game.
---
While we are on the subject; why do players not like other players shooting the sbq while airborne? Dmg is minimal anyway so the chances of actually killing it while airborne is minimal
---
Mine is a FFR limb damage Fixer. Lethal. I'm not a bloodied build but today my Ally gifted me with a Bloodied Explosive Handmade. Could be the perfect weapon for someone?
---
I'm 28, I only game casually and can usually win 1 every couple rounds. You don't need to run around killing everyone to win, you win by playing smart. 
---
Sneak around, find good positions, wait out on the action until everyone else kills each other, then ambush the players that remain.
---
There is a bit of luck involved (getting a spawn to yourself, finding good gear in crates) but you can get by with strategy as opposed to twitch-shooting skill.
---
&gt;It probably should be fair for all players
---
So what you want some accessibility or handicap options because of your eyesight?
---
The warning system is the sound of their wings. If you hear it, crouch down and make sure she doesn‚Äôt see you!
---
What do you think this is?? Fallout 2?? Lol.
---
Dude dont listen to the na sayers with full biuld team and everyone pop a lunch box (108% total bonus exp on everything that earns exp) I went from 119 to 132 in just a few hrs
---
No, not true. I'm not touching NW.
---
Harmless? Nah, put a few razor blades in there.
---
Yeah I agree, i only claim workshops on my private server. Scarred by the early game griefing, lol.
---
Maybe you misunderstood me, cause when i said stash limit i meant the scrap box solution they sold us a few months after they said we can't have that due to limitation.  
---
I didn't mean that we should store infinite items.  
---
You should stop defending a lying company.
---
As of right now, my best are instigating lever rifle, or 50.cal anti armor hunting. I switch them around. Lever is better, but i just love the bolt action mechanic.
---
I like this idea and give it my full support
---
I said even a fraction of those numbers, not the same exact numbers. It doesn‚Äôt matter about the sales either, because only the active player base is buying the microtransactions. 76 and 2k only have a 1-2k player count difference in 2k‚Äôs favor across all platforms. The limited time nature of the microtransactions is a huge motivator, and as someone who plays 2k from time to time, those sorts of motivators just aren‚Äôt there for the cosmetics.
---
Moving your C.A.M.P module will change the location where others spawn in. Players will spawn roughly NW of the module so just move it until you find the best spot
---
THIS! Someone yesterday said they spent 4 hours in NW and only got 1 revive. I was like 'You could have earned 25000xp in a fraction of the time' People are silly.
---
Coming from the the regular games pvp, where I win 80% of the time to a nuclear winter where I lose 99.9% of the time. Doesn‚Äôt seem fair or well thought out. I don‚Äôt think people are cheating, just a very unbalanced system...
---
Same here...doing a decent job of moving up on the "GRIND". It. helps being on a building team with food/drink bonuses. With double XP events coming up. I will make up not doing NW.
---
I have this problem with Sofia on my new toon but every other ally works fine and my older toon does not have the problem at all.
---
If you're on PS4, I can help. I have FO1st, so we can use my private world if you want.
---
You do not have to do anything you don't want to. Nobody is forcing you. You are a free man.
---
Hey you know what, I did think something  was missing. But never realized that was it lol. Indeed this would be a very cool feature. Upvoted.
---
Easiest way i found when i did it was to grind the Leader of the Pack event. Theres 3 easy legendaries there. Uranium Fever also has 3 legendaries as long as you can manage to get a hit on them.
---
What do you mean by nw I heard that around?
---
I'm sure alot of people are leaving me because I'm still low level and they feel I won't contribute enough to team goals...? But when they leave and make a new one without you? Maybe jump in the cleaner waters instead of Toxic Pools for your baths perhaps? Or perhaps take off the Ritual helmet and sacrificial cultist dagger? :)
---
Slugbuster is anti-armor, and energy. It reduces the energy resistance, and so, it deals higher damage.
---
Try it with an anti-armor ballistic gun.
---
"NW: Revive another player" is quite extra dickish too. Lets go ahead and waste another person's time along with your own..
---
pc?
---
They could literally just add a slider.
---
I got mine at Whitespings Resort
---
not too good with tech, hope this is what you're asking about?
---
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz 2.60 GHz

Installed RAM: 8.00 GB

---
When I first started playing this game what seems years ago I watched a YouTube video showing how to best manage the then 400lb stash. I'd suggest you do the same.
---
I love to play dress up with my character. My stash is full of junk and cosmetic items
---
Yep. I dont mind playing NW but I utterly suck at actually killing players which is why I solo it so todays was never going to happen for me. If i can achieve it in a couple of rounds then Ill do it. If it takes more than a casual effort then I can do better with other pursuits
---
Just toss them at other players and weird them out with the sound effects.
---
Causes a ram memory leak every time FYI
---
What is the gold star do
---
GAIL IS NOT SMILE, YOU MAKE GAIL HURT FACE! GAIL TELL RA RA YOU MEANIE!!
---
I miss having the ammunition backpacks for the minigun, or the Gatling laser :(
---
Good joke...let me picture how Bugthesda QA  works. 
---
1 dose the game crash when lunched? Yes: let's try to make it work a bit untill crash; no: good for release.
---
2. But we broke a lot of stuff with this release...back to 1üòì
---
I always used to wonder if Ohio would ever get a fallout game, or be a location in one. As it turns out, it is. As a tiny island in the worst fallout ever.
---
Well, we had the option of both before.
---
Exp required is like (160*level)+200. If i remember correctly
---
I'll do it
---
Yes, you need to add a line to the [Interface] section of your ini and they will show up normal sized:
---
fNoteDistance=12.0000
---
Fix works in in Fallout 4, too.
---
oh?
---
A legendary perk that let grenades explode on contact would be nice.
---
Mines that attract enemies is another cool idea for a legendary perk
---
Drop/destroy them, dont worry about it
---
Just like how throwing Mudballs at people in ESO is one of it's best features.
---
Yesterday when the daily challenges refreshed 4 of them were done without doing anything and without getting rewarded... 1250 SCORE i cant get anymore. Thats so annoying üò™
---
Steve Austin???
---
I believe the double is only applies to the dailies. The weekly's don't apply. However, I hope I'm wrong as I would love to do that too
---
What do you play on?
---
If she's staggered, it may cancel her landing animation, which makes her airborne one more round. And again, and again
---
No it does not
---
Where is vault 51 actually located? Can he find the door in adventure mode?
---
Constantly make ammo to keep lead, steel and gunpowder numbers down, and ammo high!
---
yeah
---
To add to that, how come the oldest profession in the world doesn't exist in a game set in an alternate timeline of \*our\* world ü§î
---
What's magic effect
---
Wow, thanks! I'll give it a go.
---
There's an exploit where you can stack the survival tent on itself over and over again to make an impromptu floating platform for yourself. The only reason to do it is to keep away from the adds during the event... But it really screws with the SBQs pathing and prevents her from landing.
---
In general play an intelligence boost may well give more xp over time, but high level players will be completing a lot more events where the bonuses add up.
---
I had the same issue when I first started nuclear winter. Try using vats less in adventure mode so that you can practice your aim and pick less populated spawns. After many deaths, it does get much better. Some players are just really good with their aim, I try to rely on explosives such as grenades and even well placed mines. Those are lethal if you equip demolitions expert and grenadier.
---
no m8. gunsmith does not work with pipe weapons. 
---
licensed plumber only.
---
(unless there‚Äôs an exploit I‚Äôm not aware of)
---
:)
---
I sell everything cheap. Only because I want it gone. I don't have the ability to login daily to sell the legendaries to the machine for the limited amount you can. That or just go to vault 76 and wait for a low level to come out and just give it away
---
INT apparently only gives more xp if you‚Äôre doing quests, or pottering about the map, not for events. Most people are just hitting events right now. Plus you can replicate the effects pretty well with drugs and certain easily made foods.
---
according to angry turtle it works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqwoKVJQ46A 
---
He puts the results in the read more which is nice of him.
---
Here are test results:
---
77 damage taken solo without empath or lone wanderer
---
57 damage taken solo without empath and with lone wanderer
---
114 damage taken solo with empath
---
84 damage taken solo with empath and lone wanderer
---
77 damage taken on a team only me with empath
---
67 damage taken on a team me and other person with empath
---
67 damage taken on a team me and 2 other people with empath
---
46 damage taken on a team me and other person with empath plus empath serum active
---
45 damage taken on a team me and other person with empath plus empath serum active, plus strange in numbers (not working on empath but works on scaly skin that's why 1 less dmg taken)
---
58 damage taken on a team only me with empath plus class freak equiped
---
51 damage taken on a team me and other person with empath plus class freak equiped
---
I get that, I'm over lvl 300 but the int boost helps when you're doing dailies, quests, etc... When you join an event, switch the team close to completion and then back again
---
Separate explosives from weapons, legendary weapons/armor from non legendary, and then next level shizzle:
---
- go into your CAMP terminal and be able to set a search üîç for ‚Äúbloodied/junkie/explosive/ffr/...‚Äù so when you look at peoples camps on the map, the üîç pops if there is anything available... i mean the pipboy has the technology for junk...
---
Why don't we fill a nuke with some nuka 'my blood is in it' and drop it on fissure sure prime
---
The questline where you have to repair the scorched detection system should have added an alert system to your pipboy which would have let you know this
---
It's her strongest attack only used in her mist desperate of times
---
It's not the quantity, but the cuality of your legendaries that matters. And if you make caps so quick.... why are you complaining then? Take it as a cap sink, and a way to give some caps of your huge emporium to help new people
---
Yes. They totally have the power to do it. 
---
I just don‚Äôt know what will make them change their minds. 
---
I guess that a lot of players will become very unhappy since they spent a lot of real money or in game caps to acquire them...
---
But yes I don‚Äôt know of any other game who does it this way.
---
I'm just fucking pissed about the nuclear winter ones. Like I have revive two players rn. I don't think I've ever revived one player. The circumstances are rare.
---
At this point you can be level 15 (just about to hit 16) If you have done all dalies and weeklies.
---
Anything over is a bonus from the repeatable.
---
It's annoying, it's not hard to search the sub for an answer.
---
How do you use the excavator suit? Do you just get more by mining in it?
---
Even better: a headshot briefly "cripples" the target's head!
---
I see, I rest easy now, knowing that it‚Äôs all apart of Todd‚Äôs grand plan
---
Oh, nevermind, thought you two were talking about throwing them with VATS like in the single player games, not shooting them. Was reminded of my Evil Karma thrown explosives only character in New Vegas. But yeah that's certainly a nice legendary perk idea.

RIP your pipe revolver collection then
---
It was very effective
---
your videocard doesn‚Äôt support the game
---
And there's the other half of it. It wasn't just fun aesthetically, but it had tactical purpose too. 
---
Though one thing I'd like to see in future is small stealthy weapons not showing up like that/certain outfits hiding certain weapons (like how switchblades should be pocketed not sheathed, and it was weird seeing Benny pull his pistol from his waist ingame when he used a shoulder holster in the Cutscene)
---
Hello. In steam right click it and go to properties. Then verify game integrity and try again. That‚Äôs all I have for you.
---
Can confirm now i have one magic shotguns are just silly
---
add me sonofarobot i‚Äôd like to team up and just kill everything, your right about the xp bring better in building
---
Not for events no, but for every mob, quests, etc... So overtime it'll give you more if you actually play.
---
If you're just hopping events then yes, the other team is better.
---
As an old guy with shit reflexes and even worse eyes I recommend hiding in the bushes. I am not a pvp guy, ever. Pvp just isn't my thing, I prefer a nice coop game any day. I actually find myself leaving adventure mode for a few rounds from time to time for fun.
---
 I'm actually having a blast playing NW as a bush wookie. I just look at it as a big game of hide and seek. It's a lot of fun trying to sneak through the whole thing. Using photo mode like a periscope to look for the next hiding spot or checking the area for enemies. I end up in the top 10 more often than not and have actually won two rounds.
---
Lol. I feel your pain. This is every map for me too üòÇ
---
I‚Äôve had it ( the elsewhere than the workshop sniping) happen twice. Most times  if pvp hapened its was at the workshop. But now fallout first I‚Äôm more likely to run one while farming in a private server as reclearing the workshop breaks up the monotony.
---
enclave events are easy, some spawn a legendary
---
The event honestly needs a xp reward for hauling ore.
---
Then it the runners won't feel like they're" taking one for the team".
---
West tek. Rinse and repeat.
---
Bagged myself 2 God guns recently there.
---
Update:
---
Got some new weapons BE25 Fixer and a BE90 handmade so my damage is alot higher but still ive now hit a point where i cant play due to lack of ammo / mats to make more ammo so i think ill have to find a new build to play so my next question would be an ammo efficent build , looking at V.A.T.S gunslinger or rifles maybe. my heavy weapons guy also has ammo issues .
---
would a vats gunslinger thinking somthing like 10mm pistol / Plasma flamer maybe a .44 as well be any good from what ive heard pistols are kinda useless. still wouldnt want to be bloodied though
---
Or maybe the new chicken coop reward.
---
You can harvest the eggs and use them to cook with, or let them spoil and they become a throwable weapon.
---
I'm skipping this one. Knowing my luck, the score will get bugged and won't give me shit anyway.
---
That's helpful to know. This had been a discouraging experience, and I was here to have fun.
---
They can add it, Fallout 4s engine. Fallout 4 Prydwen got spawned in once, everything is in here so they can. Why they won't is beyond me
---
I have poor eyesight and I don't have trouble killing them sunsaguns
---
My character only has 5 intelligence. How much xp gained from extra 4 intelligence? ü§î I think most of the events team are unyielding builds
---
My version goty from Steam
---
I am on pc.
---
Not entirely sure but something with high rate of fire weapons that make them do a ton of glitched damage, if you've ever seen the queen die in less that minute that's most likely the cause
---
You can continue to raise their reputation by doing the daily quests for them after you side. Everything will still be available to you to purchase regardless of side you take
---
I found a spot south of Max's Farm.
---
Beautiful sundew forest wiew, water acess, cranberries for relish, wood for cooking, flat area for construction and farming.
---
You can get everything but whoever you don't side with will take longer.
---
Awesome. Then what was that warning mean?
---
So far, people abusing God Mode to this caliber having been getting banned.
---
Sounds silly, but I'm a big fan of that hanging cage tree
---
The same, NW is boring gameplay
---
Oooh ok. They should reword the warning sign then. Is it at max reputation to get ammo maker?
---
The warning means that you will be locked out of the remaining 2 or 3 quests in the chain for the other faction. They are just the actual raid quest for the most part
---
Ok. So yeah they should really reword that warning sign. It makes you think that you cant do any quest (daily quests as well) at all.
---
I assume so. I've not bothered too much with grinding so only got as high as neighbourly and it's still not available.
---
Dang that sucks
---
can you explain what you mean by this?
---
I, for one really enjoy it. I don't play it near as much as adventure mode but it is a really cool mode imo
---
8% increase.
---
I've only run across one English speaking player thus far, one maybe Arabic, and three that I couldn't identify. Very few mics in use it seems.
---
They haven't added it because they're probably trying to figure out a way to lock it behind a paywall first.
---
Nice shots!  They added a pretty nice photomode.....even if I only use it to capture stuff like stretched out player models, ward sleeping in a cabinet and stuff like the game spawning me inside a contstruct-a-bot pod with no way out.
---
I can help! I also need to do it so it'd make sense. Dm me if you still need help
---
Haha no.
---
Dude I was just talking about it today! I miss fallout 3 adventures with my trusty rifle visibly holstered on my back. I just don‚Äôt know how it would work with power armor tbh
---
Now that Allies outfits xan be customised, yall want the naughty nightwear
---
If enough of us make a noise about it maybe they'll add it in!
---
..As a Fallout 1st exclusive knowing Bethesda.
---
And if you are mostly doing events then small bonuses to dailies and quests will achieve much less. Why even worry about if other teams show up as long as yours does?
---
For the same reason they can't be bothered to fix the light machine gun after 2 years of players asking. Cause fuck the player we don't care about you we just want your money
---
I really love the game mode but like everything it could use some improvements like the loading times like loading in and out it‚Äôs really annoying but the actual gameplay is great fun
---
You don't have the gift emote as an alternative option in that spot?
---
You dont need fallout first if you have brain
---
Some simple but effective emotes could include
---
Pointing: like the thumbs up, but with a pointing index finger forward. Used as a 'you' or an 'over there'
---
Me: character points at themself
---
Laugh: a heart chuckle
---
Heartbreak: like the heart emote, same slot
---
Shock: a hand over mouth action, can also be used as an 'oops!"
---
Penniless: the character turns out their empty pockets
---
And bright white is amazing in all environtments. Much more than this weird 80s green.
---
Not gonna lie, you had me in the first half. How old are you?
---
Ahhh thank you so much! This was such a damn mystery to me. I thought a few patches ago madd her immune to cripple and staggering though?
---
If you side with the settlers you can get some fun things but if you side with the raiders you get a unique legendary plasma rifle The slug buster but there is a trick to get max raider rep in half an hour by doing the rocksy daily quest glitch
---
I think it's mostly due to the bush wookies (people afking since XP rewarded is based on placement), and the various hackers that seems to be a thing.
---
If only you could do this with the combat helmet.
---
0/10
---
Fortnite 76**
---
From what I've read it's not much more than an ornament anyway lol.
---
Huh. Never thought that there is a glitch for daily.
---
Thanks for the answer, you toxic man.
---
Buying Tayo mod plans
---
Oh yeh do rocksys retirement plan tell her Appalachia has a new corpse choice the leave the conversation and enter it again you will continually gain the rep
---
I am 32.
---
What is wrong with my post?
---
The Ammo maker? I don't believe it's an ornament because there isnt anything we have to skin over.
---
Huh. Never thought of that lol. Weird.
---
It seems to be hit or miss with that.
---
Sometimes the flapping of wings gives me enough time to take cover.
---
Other times, I'm already in [danger] before the flaps sound
---
Yeh then you can buy yourself some gauss mini gun plans and robcoamunition plans
---
The entire system is done bad as hell only to make you log-in daily for shareholder numbers. My "Delete" character agrees a he get used to die and face swap everyday.
---
I stopped using gunsmith for other perks like batteries included and the double fusion core duration. I didn‚Äôt notice any difference since heavy weapons don‚Äôt need to be repaired as often. Never had a problem.
---
Plasma is pretty unique in that its damage is spit: half ballistic and half energy. Without a meta endgame build you usually see around 80 damage on both numbers, with you would assume to just add up and have your final damage, but the issue is that it's also reduced by a targets ballistic AND energy resist, greatly lowering damage, but throw anti armor onto a max lvl fully upgraded plasma rifle in the hands of a rifle build character, and you've got a pretty powerful weapon
---
Get a mic then?
---
No dude
---
Just happened to me. It sucks. But it was a easy fix, so I'm leaving it here for posterity :)
---
Just googled for DirectX and and the first result solved the problem, I was redirected to a DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer:  
---
[https://www.microsoft.com/pt-br/download/confirmation.aspx?id=35](https://www.microsoft.com/pt-br/download/confirmation.aspx?id=35)
---
Once it was installed, I could launch the game directly through Steam.
---
Wow. Didnt really thought that there is a gauss mini gun.
---
Most of these weps are hacked weps
---
The mirv mini gun was the most server distructive
---
I want them to add a 'Nuke Run' team
---
What's the do?
---
That's the thing though. Adventure mode PvP is an unbalanced mess. People rely on gear and OP builds as a crutch. 
---
NW strips all that from you and puts everyone on a more balanced field. Sure, there's no balancing out some people's ability to jump around and wipe you out without you getting off a single shot, but that happens in any competitive shooter.
---
You can definitely get by in NW without having that shooting skill, like I said you just have to be patient and use strategy. 
---
A lot of people just hide in bushes or underwater and never even engage in combat, and they can make it to the final circle that way.
---
I‚Äôm just not into multiplayer shooters. I play Fallout for the story mode and nothing else, so when cool cosmetics etc get put behind a mode you have no real interest in, it makes that mode feel even more obnoxious.
---
I wanted the ghillie suit and got it last double XP weekend while you could still get the suit. XP was best earned by hiding in bushes until as late into each game as possible. That got tiresome pretty quickly. So glad I got it done in about a day.
---
Also, there‚Äôs nothing I hate more than multiplayer shooters having people jump around all over the place. It‚Äôs just a silly way of having gun fights.
---
Without paying the patch makers, I imagine.
---
God CDPR is such a shithole.
---
I got it but if you need me to help you get it I'm game.
---
Atomic shop item incoming....
---
Totally bro. I don't want to waste my bullets on xp. Let the other folks waste it. I already get the loot from teammate kills, but xp too? Shit, sign me in! 
---
It will go very well with my event afking.
---
That mule I wanted to level up? Just gimme a chameleon piece, I'll just afk while my friend oneshots these high lvl mobs giving me free 1-50 leveling in a few hours. 
---
/s
---
I just mean it doesn't produce much.
---
Watch me pull my quad barrel missile launcher outta my ass to shoot some big-ass crabs
---
That entire estate with the hedge maze, skeleton with an axe etc. 
---
Also I think there might be redrum blocks in the asylum? Or it‚Äôs also in that mansion. Can‚Äôt remember.
---
I definitely need the help also
---
*autistic screeching*
---
That is the dumbest dupe yet.
---
System?
---
xbox
---
Brill thanks, any ideas why they are in there?
---
I like multiplayer shooters, I love battlefield and is my second most played game behind only fallout games. I‚Äôve been playing battlefield 3, 4, 1 and 5 for almost a decade. 
---
but fallout‚Äôs engine and overall mechanics are a huge turn off for pvp for me. it just doesnt work.
---
I play every once in a while, specially during double xp, to try hitting rank 100. currently at rank 38. but I just cant enjoy it. 
---
I dont hate it, just dont enjoy it...
---
Try spawning close to the border and use gamechat. Me and 2 other helped eachother to finish it
---
I don‚Äôt even level up in 4 hours some days. I play fallout to socialize and  mess with my camp most of the time. I level once every 3 days on average. I had to create a low level burner alt to delete every ten levels so I can just be carried a level in minutes.
---
I assume just a fun little Easter egg with the devs having a little fun. There are also a couple of breaking bad references among other things.
---
It depends on what Platform you playing on and many think pvp doesnt belong in a fallout game and i guess many that played the prior fallouts are used to single player
---
Cool, I enjoy things like this.
---
I get +1000xp from the sentry bots in whitesprings, level 91 glowing deathclaws, and about 300xp from each super mutants. Well rested, canned meat stew, and full unyielding armor works wonders.
---
The "Is it because you guys suck" part
---
I like it too the only things that trigger me are that you can't push a button after a match which just says, *search another match* or something like that.
---
 The second thing I don't like is just on point in the balancing I think is a little to strong (explosive weapons and grenades)
---
The last one is the respawn delay we're players start before you. 
---
But I really like the mode except that one point its perfectly balanced and a lot of fun, especially if you have a team that speaks with you or play with friends. I'm not a fan of battle Royale but this is fairly decent.
---
My son's age...
---
Oh yeah great
---
As we don't have cars (so therefore no car exhaust pipes) we should be able to ram them in enemies guns
---
What good is the Luck bonus of a casual team? Serious question; I'm oblivious.
---
These are great!
---
Three words... Personal Computer Hacking.
---
Spudgun but with stupidly high damage for the fact it shoots spuds
---
Ward is bigger than bethesda now. He is out of control
---
I don‚Äôt think it needed the logo on every shot though the first one suited it
---
Yeah. The first thing is annoying me a little bit. Hopefully, that gets added later on.
---
1. I don‚Äôt like that the way my cards can be slotted is tied to my adventure build.  For me to be slotted with good cards like frog legs, I‚Äôd have to respec my Unarmed build.
---
2. Too RNG based, between if you are lucky if no one else spawns at your location to what‚Äôs in the actual chests, you can get screwed to an  early loss if all you find is some wood ammo and grognak axe
---
3. XP is not rewarded properly. To maximize your XP in the mode, you‚Äôre best bet is to go bush wookie and just take out the Mobs that spawn.
---
4. Similar to the RNG issue and the character perk cards, it‚Äôs too slow to earn good perk cards
---
5. Since so many rewards people want for adventure are tied to overseer rank, you may get teams of people that just want to sit there and earn XP
---
6. also with teams, not enough people on mics, making it basically solo in group
---
I dislike it because it feels so disconnected from the rest of the game and was a really weird/desperate move from Beth. It takes resources away from the main game mode which desperately needs all the resources it can have.
---
I think BR overall is not a very popular genre among people who play games like Fallout.
---
I personally don‚Äôt play fallout for a battle royale. I assume most people are the same but I don‚Äôt actively hate it. I just don‚Äôt really care for or about it. I was right at the start of the BR craze and in the thick of it, and now I‚Äôm....not. It kinda had its day for me. 
---
Having said that it wasn‚Äôt until these challenges started that I decided to actually give it a go. And you know what? It‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs a good mode all things considered, but I‚Äôm really just not interested in BR anymore long term personally. 
---
It is a cool little distraction but it‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm here. I don‚Äôt hate on the mode anywhere, but I believe the reason some people do is they feel they are being forced to play it for the score rewards. 
---
Sure you could ignore it (I have ignored the revival one) but it‚Äôs still there and making people feel they have to do something they have previously avoided or been uninterested in is not the way to endear it to them, or create positive feedback in forums. 
---
So I guess people are just salty and having the usual reaction to grinds including things they don‚Äôt usually do. Also I have seen next to no real complaint topics about it relatively, and I‚Äôm here a lot.
---
I saw a player wearing it in NW.
---
After patch 20 dropped found some in a crate in the Whitesprings parking lot and though ‚ÄúOoh nice, haven‚Äôt even tried these yet since I haven‚Äôt done the story.‚Äù
---
Threw a couple of them at the ghouls and thought ‚ÄúWow these are really shite.‚Äù
---
How can floaters blow up with such a large radius and then the grenades suck ass with a tiny radius? There‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs intentional.
---
Nothing sounds worse in  this game than what you just said.  It‚Äôs also why people are going god mode to stack duped bobble heads and gain 1000 levels in hours. Simply then building and rebuilding stacks of rugs in a camp for serious amounts of xp. It‚Äôs funny because the notes said they fixed god mode. Nope just chuck testa.  Guess that‚Äôs one way to get your daily in.
---
it‚Äôs a glitch where you go into god mode and the xp keeps going on for the repeatable score challenge
---
food buffs, you can get over 100% more damage combined with carnivore right now (super mutant hounds will alone get 2 of them)
---
Yes, let's sarcastically keep a less enjoyable experience for every leveling groups across the entire playerbase because a minority of shitters might get free xp, I'm sure it's entirely impossible to have a minimum threshold of damage done on a timer instead of per-target to avoid this. Buzz off
---
What I don‚Äôt understand is people agreed with the thread but not these messages somehow while nobody properly explaining why.
---
I guess they need some more time before they realize they‚Äôre mostly just standing around in the events rather than playing, especially after legendary perks arrive.
---
If they want it then lets keep it on the private servers. Unless it's F.I.S.T.O...
---
PC players get a lot of hackers, and that's mostly who complains about it. I think it's a relatively fair PvP mode. No fussing over OP shit like in adventure, no legacies etc. Now if they could get rid of the bug that allows you to vats grenades in NW that would be cool. You don't even have to try if you're doing that exploit
---
Dude, only agility has the best perks. The others are not so special üòÇ
---
Do you mean the security door on the left of the main entrance won‚Äôt open even after you power it up? If so I‚Äôd say a glitch. You can definitely get back into that area. Try server hopping.
---
Weird, Gross Harmless Wasteland Snowball is my band's name. Feel free to come throw tatoes at us when we play at the beer hall.
---
Was this supposed to mean something?
---
Yeah, I dealt with this before. Server hopping seemed to fix it for me.
---
Happens in private teams to. Leader has to kick to logged off player, seems like a bug toe.
---
Yes and no? I mean sure you‚Äôll get your 2k atoms early. Then there‚Äôs nothing left to earn. No matter what there is a maximum amount of items you can earn here. Once that‚Äôs spent you‚Äôre still gonna have to buy anything in the atom shop anyway. It‚Äôs not as harmful to them as you‚Äôd think
---
Considering it's 76, not surprised. This happened to me twice. Crashed the entire server.
---
Just fast travel to watoga station if that happens and her body will spawn on you.
---
Railroad spikes. Not 100% sure on the xp, but with no perks, it's 7 steel for 3 spikes, which can be traded for 10 ammo points. With ammosmith you get 5 spikes for 7 steel, which is almost a 1:1 (include super duper and you can get the ratio to better than 1:1), meaning that every steel becomes equivalent to about 3 ammo points. Plus xp earned along the way for crafting using one of the most readily available resources in the game. Convert to your ammo of choice or to whatever you prefer to sell.
---
Yeah, I miss the 2nd week of Fasnacht aka afk simulator. Or the campfire tales, I like to watch youtube during that event. If your ideas are totally rewarding afkers, i'm 100% in. Free leveling for all! 
---
BE handmade does it all
---
luck increases the rate you fill your crit meter and increases the durability of found weapons and armor, increasing their sale price at vendors
---
a lot of the team options are better for low level
---
I didn‚Äôt have issues with rubber banding heath bars till wastelanders dropped, now it seems to have gotten much worse since patch 20.
---
No. Right now this game is a shit show. Everything explodes. Every enemy melts. I love this game so much but for some time now it feels like I‚Äôm playing in a server with all the cheats turned on.
---
are you selecting them from the stores tab?
---
I wanted to make it for a friend, he doesn't have the Perk to craft power armor. He gave me matrials to craft it at I thought it might be some nice experience.
---
it can spawn in a few places. if it doesn't get stuck you can drag it all over.
---
No I'm not ..should I be thanks for the heads up.. I simply go to blue print, then scrap as I can't place them, then build the house again with the scrapped materials and then it says I haven't got enough wood for example
---
What outfit is this then?
---
Yeah the glitch still works after Bethesda said they patched it
---
I could never find one that didn't still show it while you had the weapon drawn. Kind of dumb to show a combat rifle on your back while you're also holding it in your hands.
---
Says the guy who suggests that people don‚Äôt like a particular game mode just because they suck :/
---
Another tip if you just can‚Äôt put it down, bulk it and sell it
---
I'm not wasting my money, a guy gave me almost every plan for it when I bought a few Supply drops for like 5 caps each. I also got most a few plans from scorched earth.
---
I would like a "no legendary mode" like if they brought survival back but no legendary anythings in it
---
Bulking and scrapping would make more sense, truly.
---
Woosh
---
Thanks for your feedback!
---
I tried to make them look like real loading screens and therefor the logo. 
---
But I‚Äôll keep it in mind for the future!
---
Use food and drugs to increase intelligence. Under armour vault 76 can be mod +2. PA builds can add intelligence in helmet mods.
---
The shots are good for sure
---
One wasteland has the potential to fix this.
---
Maybe if you were as good as OP, you‚Äôd be okay with that comment being in there.
---
T65 is very good for pvp if utilised right because every bit of energy resistance counts against armor penetration energy guns which are more used than ever.
---
They need to add a new emote quick response with:  
---
  
---
Yes  
---
No  
---
Maybe  
---
I dont know  
---
Can you Repeat the question  
---
Your not the boss of me now
---
sure, i can do that! what's your user? i'll just build some stairs and jump off a couple times if that's cool?
---
Proceeds to throw them at Davenport after doing the faction side of the photo opportunity daily
---
My gf puts hers in for a 100 ea on almost everything lol. But for the other people, myself included, we got baited by that price check website. It‚Äôs telling me some of my gear is worth max caps. Either way that‚Äôs probably what‚Äôs going on. Everything I price check tells me it‚Äôs either scrap fodder or over 15k caps.
---
I'm ashamed to admit that I'm still confused about the WC. It can spawn outside of nuke zones, right. Like, it doesn't need a nuke, it just spawns randomly?
---
Yeah, I think the main draw for a "casual" team isn't for the Luck bonus - it's to find other casual players to hang out with. 
---
Most of the other teams make sense from a strategy perspective - Intelligence, event/legendary exp gains,  things like that. But the Casual team is... well, just that. Playing casually!
---
When I don't feel like grinding xp I make a new character, level 3 comes pretty fast especially with the wayward quest right at the vaults doorstep.
---
Life is unfaaaaiiirrr.
---
The mode is fun enough, but there are hackers on PC, the scoring encourages camping, and there are much better BR games out there if you want a BR fix. All that said, when I queue up on PS4, I get a match in about 5 seconds so it seems popular enough.
---
I like it because I can see the other players camp layout and see what kind of cool things they used the lay of the land for . Usually my camps better tho so I just gank thier resources and switch servers .
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter, any weapon you use will hit the 110 damage cap easily. PvP is garbage now. Bethesda would rather release a cosmetic circle jerk of a battlepass then focus on adding real content and fixing PvP.
---
Been trying to do this for a couple days and it's not working. Can someone tell me how exactly to completely destroy someones camp with explosive bait? Thank you :)
---
That would be awesome!! Fuck legendary effects and your op meta builds I‚Äôm tired of it. Why? Because it‚Äôs unbalanced because everyone is bloodied because it‚Äôs the best by a million miles. Take that stuff out and all you have to show for your build is your actual build. And that‚Äôs the way it should be. Could you imagine if we actually had to strategize tactics for the queen fight? Omg I can hear the bloodied explosives cringing. Seriously though it would be nice to have a balanced fallout online experience. All I do now is grab some popcorn and watch the exploiters rape the queen in a split second
---
id say make them craft-able "Spoiled Tato" 1 Tato + 1 Fertilizer = 1 Spoiled Tato, it acts as a throwing knife, deals 0 damage, and May attract bugs (PVE Only)
---
Absolutely not. I‚Äôve had an underground base for months without a ban. I doubt they can really detect which bases are underground given it takes just a couple of normal objects to allow you to start building underground
---
from what I've read it's really only difficult/tedius if you have thousands of ammo to exchange..
---
Add acid to that list...
---
It won‚Äôt get people banned Bethesda don‚Äôt care
---
It needs to be in a nuke zone, where an assault event would normally occur. It can follow you out of the nuke zone; it's a long battle.  So say, these folks engaged him in a nuke zone but fell back to watoga station to get more guns/ ammo, it would have followed them there.
---
Between 450-550 depending on what is proc‚Äôd and what I‚Äôm doing, and even that is too much considering all the evidence (and personal experience) showing the diminishing returns on resistances after like 380 or so. 
---
Im as tanky in stealth armour at 360~ as I am at 550 honestly but yeah. Aim for 400 endgame and it‚Äôs fine.
---
Lots of mt emotes have gone. I still have the gift one but the salute has gone and others
---
They‚Äôre gone as soon as you switch consoles or reinstall the game. Save your photos and back them up somewhere! On Xbox I save screenshots of my photos and copy them to my personal cloud. Don‚Äôt want to lose some of those memories and even the max 50 the game holds isn‚Äôt enough.
---
Ah, okay. Thank you. This puts my paranoia at ease.
---
Are they toxic? Or is it because you suck?
---
That last sentence ruined your entire post.
---
hey man add me on there. dr pelliper is my gamertag. i need to do this too
---
I just used a new character and am leveling him up got 3 lvls in 35mins with a friend and a lunchbox (20-23)  
---
that said I feel it should be gain XP rather then gain a lvl as this would make it a nice challenge for all levels instead of a grind
---
right, i forgott the AA effect. i witched my lever action from executioner to an anti armor and its like 50% more damage.
---
Awesome thanks! You can revive me too. I‚Äôm using Fallout 1st so shall I add you into that server?
---
I can also assist. I've done all the Tadpole badges. I'm currently on the Squirrel ones. GT is HPD99
---
correct, the server load that is saved from doing the checks before letting the player fully loads into the server is very minimal. but doing that will save massive amounts of the player's time for not having to reload the entire game every time we have to find a new server
---
Well that's interesting. Like others have said I've been experiencing it since beta. But I've always heard it's mainly caused by automatic weapons. 
---
Did you either start using automatic weapons after wastelanders or start partying with people at that point? I'm thinking maybe you were a solo player that used melee or semi auto weapons up until wastelanders and now you're either using or partying with people that are using automatic weapons.
---
I'd be curious to know your answer.
---
yea, my gift emote is still there, but my 4th of july salute or whatever you call it is missing since update 20
---
40, my CSA is enough :D
---
With full PA T-65 suit, like 500 something for physical.
---
They just implementations this new technology in other games called a text chat. Maybe the will implement it in fo77. BTW there is a mod that add chat on PC and makes the game a billion time better
---
Wasnt the captain cosmos pa already in the game?
---
Or was it in fo4 creation club?
---
I had a BE plasma and when the fun of having a legacy wore off, I quickly learned how detrimental that weapon was. It boasts large damage for little effort which discourages proper aim technique and gives a false sense of confidence.  Or maybe it is just me.
---
well to be honest the way I finish off most people who are harassing me 
---
1. sing take me home country roads with as much enthusiasm and as little skill as possible in local
---
2. play a 1 hour loop of dial up tone
---
3. and finally start following them talking to them about the lack of toilet paper in the world today
---
if those don't work have a character who never completed the karma dart mission and just shoot every large animal they get near
---
yeah. using all rifle damage perks and crit related luck perks buffs every rifle this character gets his hands on. i used an instigating mutants plasma rifle first, and it resulted in similar powerful hits. thats why i had the impression of plasma effecting SB¬¥s better.
---
yeh i closed the game and reloaded and it was open, was really annoying trying to figure it out
---
If you aren‚Äôt pulling from the stored tab, you are building with new materials. Check out what is in your stored tab and select those materials to rebuild.
---
Legacy effects should just be turned into a possible effect, like fire rate on laser weapons.
---
And yea the bugged effects need to be fixed too, then the next biggest problem is how broken stealth is, anyone with half basically never gets detected (and the few times they do escape artist just resets everything..) and the sneak damage output is way busted, sneak damage should only be for the first bullet per individual enemies and not proc in caution, that way high damage-per-shot weapons like sniper rifles can still have a spot to shine and automatic weapons aren't basically just better.
---
Absolutely, couldn't believe this wasn't a feature when I started playing not long ago.
---
you can actually negate around 70-80% of the damage of tesla so they only do 10-15 hp a hit if you stack the right perks and mutations 
---
specially with the new teams don't cause pvp triggers now
---
of course this never works for most people cause you have 2 charisma \*\*mutters something about people being stupid and not reading\*\*
---
It is the strongest stat in game, no competition.
---
1st idk honestly but second for some weapons its lvl 15/25/35/45 handmade is one example
---
If you need help on missions, I can help. I'm a level 202. Don't worry, I'm not insanely powerful. I'm more or less balanced. I also have Fallout 1st, so private servers! Anyways, if you wanna add me, GT is HPD99
---
Why? Did it ruin your experience or impact you in any way?
---
I would like a laugh emote and a sorry emote. That is all.
---
They really just need to rework the Queen to be programmed to land after all the mobs are killed and just have it be a waves thing something akin Heart of the Swamp.
---
Well how come I can have over a TRILLION items in my stash over on OSRS? And how come once I got fo1st I could put my 90k junk items in my stash and load into the game within 10 seconds? And opening my junk box only takes 1 second still? You‚Äôre way off for such a dramatic reply lmao. Really, think about it. The duper‚Äôs with 1 million junk items in their stash still load in just fine, and don‚Äôt crash your game. Camp size, maybe. Stash, absolutely not.
---
if you've played Subnautica, that first time you hear then see a Reaper is comparable..
---
When it first happened to a friend of mine &amp; I, we went for the button (annoyed cause ghouls exist) &amp; when we see it didn't open, we were a bit worried. Fortunately, server hopping seemed to fix it. Anyways, good to hear it fixed it for you.
---
AFAIK the vault exists in adventure mode, just not marked on the map and just like all the vaults, you can't open and enter it
---
Most importantly (as far as I am concerned), this would fix the issue of bad math leaving unredeamable scrip. I got 148 scrip today because I had no way of getting the exact right combination of items to equal exactly 150 scrip. Having a currency that I could get for the remainder would allow me to cash in even just one more piece for my full daily allowance without losing out because they assigned stupid values to things.
---
yes if overcapacity, you can do the same for armour and weapons with the right perks
---
Thank you for this man i just got a sweet wooden door plan man i know its the wasteland and all but i couldn't stand that broken door with the broken windows i was legit just gonna have doorways with no doors  üòÇ
---
Nope, I‚Äôve used an automatic handmade  since way before wastelanders and I didn‚Äôt have an issue with rubberbanding health bars except for maybe shotguns outside of vats, after wastelanders dropped now it seems all my weapons have the rubber banding thing like shotguns have. And after patch 20 I tried to kill a scorched beast and shot three whole clips into its head and it‚Äôs health went from zero to full again several times. I mostly see it happen on scorched beasts or scorched.
---
Ahhh, great to know, thank you.
---
Where abouts is the vault? I'd quite like to go and find it
---
Actually you're wrong there.  Lower levels don't have access to all the perk cards. 
---
Also there are huge advantages based on your special points.
---
They were crafted at 200%
---
Been that way since BETA.
---
Before this change I was having to level up while in a certain outfit, in a certain place, while diseased or whatever. This change is massively welcome by me.
---
Bethesda don't take away my free points because other people don't want to get them.
---
This is misinformation.  114 fire rate won't trigger magic without explosive.  If you say it does, post vids.
---
For someone who's never played NW (me), can someone explain how it's like. I'm very curious now.
---
Have you done it yet or still need it? I'm available if I can get one done in return
---
I have been scrolling through the subreddit now that I understand what most people are talking about and I'm not as nooby as I once was, and I keep seeing West Tek being brought up. I'm level 60, got me a full set of T-51b and an untracite gstling laser that shreds anything I come into contact with, would I be able to solo West Tek? Or should I bring my friends? Are those god guns you mentioned legendary drops, or just event/quest rewards?
---
Bruh I miss my "chainmail bikini" outfits
---
But everyone has access to the same perk cards and the same gear.
---
If you want to,  you can re spec. If not, pvp isn't for you.
---
It's okay if you don't believe it works that's fine. Everyone can believe what they want. As for editing a video to show a stranger proof because they asked. I'm good if you don't believe it then we will leave it at that.
---
Excellent, I have the perks for overcapacity armor and weapons but can‚Äôt find the one for cores
---
Awesome, do you know what perk helps with that?
---
I have read that a sorry emote is on the way. a laugh emote would be a logical addition as well
---
I remember the armed to the teeth mod on skyrim where your favourited weapons would show on your person. 
---
Something like that would be sick.
---
i still have to do it. sounds good! my gt is fiftybarrett
---
Why are you getting downvoted? This season pass doesn't affect other players in any way. If someone found a way to cheese it, who cares. Your experience hasn't been impacted in any way at all
---
I had 16 before bed last night and still got 2 challenges to complete today before the reset.
---
Awesome I'll hop on now
---
I use a VATS Lever action build and I oneshot max level suoer mutants all the time. Cant even share xp in this build w/o using a different weapon :(
---
if you know what you need then pick out the mods, you certainly don't need my help
---
just invite me when you‚Äôre ready :)
---
Yeah, I joined a scorched earth event last night on Xbox and the queen was dead the moment she landed on the ground. Luckily I got in enough hits to claim her loot but almost no one else did. 
---
I imagine someone was using a limb damage heavy gun or another bugged heavy gun.
---
The issue is for those 200+ or even 300+ to grind a level
---
Gross Harmless Wasteland Snowball rules!
---
Ammosmith under Agility. Don't forget to use Super Duper under Luck when crafting :)
---
It's not even that rubberbanding is the entire problem. Damage in general is broken. Using a two shot plasma caster  it'll one shot just about everything under level 40. Randomly a lvl 5 scortched will survive with 1 hp. I've don't other tests with sneak attack damage and melee. Sneak attack does let's say 200 damage and removes 40% health. Using a power attack it does 600 damage and only does 80% health. Both headshots.
---
"but I like that it contributes (XP) to my adventure mode character"
---
Ahh, that's solved a mystery for me. I've taken to logging out for the day when just below my next level up. Yesterday I played a little bit of NW to get some dailies finished, then later (after the reset) when I logged onto adventure mode I immediately got the score daily for levelling up. I thought I'd got a beneficial bug, I didn't realise it was because XP from nuclear winter had carried across.
---
Oh hell yeh. They are usually level 62 supermutants. Around 7 of them outside. And 15 inside.
---
I'm a bloodied stealth build. So it's super easy for me. But a large majority to the reason of west tek. Is that in the second room, there's a decontamination chamber, on the floor is "Toxic Goo" this stuff gives you a shit ton of rads when consumed. Without getting any deaseases or mutations.  So it's super handy for me to pick 10-15 of them up before I venture across the cranberry bog. I can take radaway diluted and toxic Goo to balance my health to 20% for nerd rage buffs and Unyielding armos buffs.
---
I'm 1 level off the 1st one. just from repeating the xp one.
---
Interesting observations. I too mostly experience it with scorched and scorched beasts. 76 is one of the glitchests games I've ever encountered. It seems to affect everyone differently from what I've gathered. Even playing with my wife on equal PCs from the same connection in the same house produces different results.
---
She‚Äôs immune to crippling but she can still get staggered. Also she can still get stuck in an endless stagger cycle where she just floats in the exact same place for the duration of the battle.
---
Cool, thank you. Will let you know :)
---
and now there's an 'extra well rested' or similar for 25% -- not too sure how it happend.
---
My glass cannon bloodied character plays it too close to the edge to survive every sitch. I fall over 3 or 4 times a day. Having to redo the well rested is a bummer for sure.
---
No, its a repeatable S.C.O.R.E. challenge.  
---
Just go from place to place killing super mutants, while in groups, and hit the queen when she gets summoned.
---
710 with t65
---
I do sbq often enough and I've never seen that, but I'm on xbone
---
It takes 5 minutes to bond though, unless you mean they should switch the team goal
---
Maybe it does and you just haven't spoke to the right people. I feel Duchess would be down for enough caps...
---
Ah this isn‚Äôt related to the rubber band thing,  but have you noticed scorched lost their death sound after wastelanders dropped? 
---
Used to be you shoot them and hear ‚Äú*Splak* UGH!‚Äù Or something, but now they‚Äôre completely silent when you kill them.
---
It is 7% per piece of flat Damage Reduction, and approximately 90% Radiation Reduction for all power armor.
---
Thank you I'll deffo add you I'm level 60 now
---
Any time this comes up there's tons of people saying that everything else should be buffed to the crazy levels some legacies have. Which should not happen. TSE was bad enough before the nerf. I should not be 1 shotting a level 68 super mutant by shooting the floor a bit near them.
---
There's balance issues to fix though absolutely.
---
I remember seeing this glitch with some Scorched &amp; on some ferals. The most scary experience I had with this was when I was exploring the sewer system in Harper's Ferry. There were like 2-3 glitched out charred ghouls.
---
We nuked and found the Colossus once at Hornwright Estate and once in the blast zone, right in the middle.
---
For sure! I'll add you back, man.
---
Grounded and scaly skin (and literally no one uses refractor) aren‚Äôt gonna negate 80% of damage from a bloodied FFR tesla. Having just gotten bopped by one two days ago, with all those tanky perks and many more, (704 DR/627 ER) and 447 health, didnt matter. Instantly died.
---
Multiple posts and my own personal experience.
---
That or it was a bloodied sneak build of either melee or commando
---
Yeah the whole event team not showing up to the events... makes me wonder if they know what they are doing... at all
---
Alright. Good luck on your badge collection!
---
I haven't noticed but now that you mention it I don't recall them making much sound at all these days. I will definitely be paying more attention to that now.
---
You are a good amongst men. Thank you.
---
Leader of the Pack is easy. I think I played like 2 of these events and did 4 Enclave events by hopping the servers.
---
Oh awesome!  Didn‚Äôt know armoursmith worked on plasma cores!
---
What do you mean by dock bar?
---
I'm betting right now that this will be implemented as a joke but every single other possible flaw in the game that's been around for ages won't be. Cool idea tho
---
Switch team goal. It can be done in like 2 seconds.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs like that satisfying headshot like sound they make is gone. Hope they bring it back eventually.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's how it works on plasma cores :)
---
They added it in a few patches back. I've had her die out of bounds a few times.
---
It was because of clipping. There's an interview where it's talked about for FO4, so I can assume it was just carried over.
---
Of all the clipping in the game, they didn't want weapons on your back or side to have clipping. They've also stated it's the same reason the outfits with backpacks won't show your own backpack.
---
Do u have a headset so we can chat in game?
---
Batteries included is the perk card you want for energy ammo.
---
Being a super smarty allows for crafted core ammo to yield "overcharge". Overcharge for plasma cores can allow them to fire up to a MAX of 500 shots per core, highest i can get with 20 int though is like 350 instead of 250. same applies for fusion cores
---
Yeah, I have a headset, don't worry man.
---
You're never too old to learn, and in this case. You can't play a game long enough to stop learning new things
---
OK great I'll add you in a little bit I'm out atm
---
Imagine how sick a pre fallout 3 Pitt dlc would be
---
I‚Äòm a heavy build, but my rifle build friend uses the Fixer as his main weapon. His second weapon is an explosive handmade, non-bloodied, and his third is an instigating Gauss Shotgun.
---
My build is currently using a furious Gauss Minigun, a Furious Two-Shot Gatling Laser and an instigating Plasma Caster.
---
Yeah, take your time. You're cool. :)
---
LOL I always join building teams if they exist
---
Don't like it solo her on a private server. Otherwise deal with it. 50 posts a day complaining about this.
---
They have stated the reason why outfits with backpacks won't show your own backpack is because of clipping. In an interview for FO4, they did say the reason holstering was removed was because of clipping, so it was probably just carried over.
---
It may seem weird, that of all the clipping in the game, that's what they decided to do about it.
---
Just say "go ahead and report me"... Not like Bethesda would do anything even if you were maliciously glitching, which you weren't.
---
Finally a good use for Fire In The Hole outside of Dross Toss.
---
Can confirm.  This is good info.
---
I wish we could explore it in adventure mode to be able to actually read/listen to the lore for more than 20 seconds
---
I do not order my supply drops any longer. What I did was to order it, then wait until I get a quest marker, which can take a LONG time. When I get the marker, I rush to the supplies. That mostly works.
---
If there is a dupe on PC involving multiple accounts and a world container, which I'm pretty sure it's like the original dupe when the game came out, then it probably can be done on consoles too.
---
You stress the, "multiplayer" part as if this is EQ1.  Almost everything in this game is doable solo.  Hell, most events, enemy camps and the entirety of the main story seem to be tuned around a single person doing it.
---
My favorite leveling location was the bugged Glassed Cavern. You can spawn infinite level 68 Scorched in there by using a bug.
---
Upvoted for learning about deathclaw cave plan spawn.
---
Extreme tatoe ball
---
Throwing rotten eggs is like the WMD of the neighborhood....
---
I could solo west Tek at like level 20 with a switchblade - the spawns scale to your level so it‚Äôs not difficult at all
---
I honestly don't care. I have regular weapons and pretty much melt everything instantly anyway. Plus it's not the weapons it's Bethesda. They wouldn't balance anything right anyway.
---
Batteries Included will only reduce the weight of your energy ammo. To craft plasma or fusion cores at above capacity you need to have high intelligence.
---
Has anybody made an image post of where to nuke for the colossus? I haven‚Äôt seen one yet.
---
This is not true tough is it? If I sell crap leg is so that other people can get scrip for them and around 100 caps. I currently have 5 light weapons in my stash and not much of anything else and still I'm stuck. I want to hoard stuff in case I want to toy with another build one day. We need more space end of
---
Events are any repeating quest that appears as a hexagon on the map, like public events (blinking exclamation point) or Back on the Beat, AWOL Armaments, Mr. Messenger, etc. If you're ever unsure, they all show up in the events category of your quest tab while you're doing them.
---
Well, example: if you have 3 separate wooden logs each 1 pound, they would still be 3 pounds when put together, and wouldn't weigh any less... Logic.
---
This is the right answer here
---
Just high intelligence?  I‚Äôm at 14, just don‚Äôt see a perk card for it.
---
I‚Äòm not a fan of bloodied builds... everybody does one and the Whitespring ghouls can literally one-hit you even with good armor. I do mostly use Vanguard stuff, which fits my build much better.
---
Really great images! Just one question, all of them are from game but what about that with moon and Jupiter (I think)? Is there some place in game you can see that?
---
They really should add it back
---
in power armor 503 DR, 543 ER, and 500 RR (Strangler + Scaly Skin + Grounded)
---
out of power armor 290 DR, 280 ER, and 1000 RR (Chinese stealth suit + Scaly skin + grounded + Armor plated Backpack)
---
I don't understand this response.  I'm only lvl 3 and I only have like 5 perk cards.  None of which I want.  How do I access all these other perk cards?
---
Thanks! That makes sense. I think ‚ÄúRetake [workshop]‚Äù appears in the Events tab, would that count too?
---
Has rewards been sold in the Atom Shop?
---
Yes that one is also from in-game. 
---
The planets are right above Wrens head inside her little communication area at the crater.
---
Try loading in and out of an interior cell.
---
If you‚Äòre on PC I‚Äòd be glad to help you out with one of my suits, just tell me which one it was. (I‚Äòm currently unable to craft T-65 Power Armor)
---
Thank you! I gotta check that out, never noticed.
---
Tato receiver, a Spud gun!
---
You needed a pair of mods to make it look right - one for display and one to swap to a different display when drawn. Wasn‚Äôt seamless, but it did make a model rifle, shotgun, etc. appear holstered on your back or side and then swap to being just straps or an empty holster when drawn.
---
Sell some of your bulked junk? You can always get more. Just sayin'-
---
AMMOsmith
---
not ARMORsmith
---
We need Local world chat so I can shout ‚Äòtake off One Man Army ffs‚Äô
---
Yup, sorry... autocorrect was messing with me
---
Well, it's a glitch. They're risking a ban, which makes it less sweaty IMO
---
You can easily sell cheap items for scrip. I buy and resell a lot of good gear for decent prices though, and I‚Äôm always browsing shops for the few plans I‚Äôm still missing.
---
Level up.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt want to hear your gloating until you reach 69!
---
I find this particularly frustrating as I play an unarmed build. Most of the time I am punching the adds waiting for her to land, then sprinting over to try to get a few hits in before she takes off.
---
If only our characters at least turn green when they mutate
---
Interesting, thanks for the info!
---
No prob Friend. 
---
I don‚Äôt even know how I noticed it myself lol
---
You want more story or lore or what are you getting at. There's tons of quests and story in the game, if you've finished it you're free to repeat stuff for levels, cosmetics, plans (which is content, yes)
---
Or just make them bounce less
---
It happens when you have all levels of a card and an animated version. Basically you won't be able to buy that card from the buy cards menu,and if you get one from a card pack(that is not animated),it will disappear.
---
It's hard to explain but I can assure you that if they don't change that stupid legendary upgrade system, your best act is to first upgrade and scrap animated versions with your points and card, and only then open your saved perk cards. This way you'll only lose the few doubles of those you didn't scrap.
---
why does it have to be one color, I loved using the mod in fallout 4 where everything had it's own color.
---
Flat 450 I think with one missing van ss, all upgraded and no cards? I'd like a full set of vanguard rad str/agi but, well, yeah, them rolls on the last one... I'm also heavy that runs in and out of pa so vamp gats, flamers, and 50 cal, toss in an odd vamp tesla, and it's a party. 
---
You can boost it up with perk cards especially if you want to not rely on PA. I don't do nowhere near the damage that bloodies do, but I can face tank imposter for a while with no stims. It's... more fun to have a tumble with things for me I guess? It's different for everyone, no one play style is the same and there's always the secondary/third stats to considder for armor.
---
What is your desired build, play style and current DR?
---
Because you signed not to do it when you clicked 'Agree'.
---
But with junk it takes up far LESS server space, hence why the junk box is a thing. All you need for junk is junk ID number and number of copies. That does not exponentially increase server load when you get more of it. They could have coded a junk box with the base game but they decided they'd rather make junk a management problem and then sell a solution.
---
1 flare/smoke 2 it doesn‚Äôt drop immediately if you are over exaggerating the wait time
---
God I hate it when people do thay
---
I'm talking about seasons, seasons give 0 new game play elements. There for seasons should be a free for all to glitch, bethsda doesnt deserve money for a half assed update
---
yeah i use to run that perk as it made sense for a heavy gun build at first glance. Knowing what i know now, i never run it anymore. Just bloody mess in its place.
---
Thanks!
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs Berkeley springs, right where the enclave event tells you to go to safety distance I‚Äôm pretty sure.
---
I know right?!
---
I really wish mutations had visible effects and would add more diversity.
---
That would be coool. And not impossible to implement
---
Alexa is there a search function on reddit
---
Hahahahaha
---
There's nothing out there, just endless forest.
---
The guy keeps walks past my camp regularly, but sometimes my turrets attack him for whatever reason and then he destroys an oil lamp and calls it a day.
---
I have a feeling that when the next story dlc drops the public teams that boost charisma may be more widespread.
---
you‚Äôre right and i agree but it doesn‚Äôt matter. Have fought the queen in the storm and people will still stand on their tents, broken down buses/buildings, anything they can. I don‚Äôt know why. Just make it easy for the poor gal to figure out how to land
---
Never gunna happen, also Beth need to fix SBQ not make me/others swap perks coz the fights fecked up....
---
A Bethesda Bug to get you to go gaga about playing it! Works for me! :D
---
I‚Äôd be down for that. 
---
Also I a super rare plan for a legendary flute I can craft with fluxes and other end game materials, that allows me to make small animals follow me like the pied piper. 
---
But as an aside, most of all I want confetti mess in the game full time.
---
I was trolling OP a little bit, that B33 Gauss shotgun is actually my current weapon
---
It said complete an event as part of a group. It might not have counted it because I was only on a team with one other person.
---
Here https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg 
---
Just nuke those assault spots
---
the bonuses need to be adjusted, the exp % should be on all teams but they should also have some unique quirky bonus.  the legendary perk system they first introduced suffered from being so generic also.
---
Sometimes after updates they disappear from your wheel. You need to go into the atomic shop, emotes section and checkmark them again.
---
I don't join build teams because.......... boring, sorry.
---
Also if you are scraping everything... you don‚Äôt get all the materials back that we‚Äôre required for new construction
---
Amount in my stash:
---
-20: glass, steel, wood, cloth, asbestos (easy to find if needed)
---
-50: silver, gold, adhesive, oil, circuits, aluminium (not rare but harder to find)
---
- 75: steel, acid, antiseptic, lead, copper, fiberglasses, plastic (either harder to find or needed a lot)
---
- 75 min. -&gt; open end: gears, spring, screws, ballistic fibre &amp; gunpowder
---
May have forgotten some, but that's my scheme. 
---
If i massed up steel &amp; gunpowder i craft ammo and sell it. 
---
Any junk above those numbers is going into my camp vendors or just gets dumped (wood, glass, cloth). Asbestos, gold and silver just stays in my inv since it can be sold unbulked to robots / traders.
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again.  The SBQ is legitimately one of the worst boss fights I've ever experienced in a game.  
---
If they can't design a halfway decent fight, at least let us cripple the stupid thing so we're not stuck watching it blatantly clip through the environment over and over (and over and over and over...)or randomly fuck off 3 miles into the distance.
---
I just hit ally with settlers and I've been excited for the turbo fert because I thought it was a stink bomb you could throw at other people. Still is technically, just not what I hoped for lol
---
Is the perk bugged?
---
yes events and teams should award items and xp for nearby kills even if xp is reduced to like 80% or something.
---
I dont think it's that bad myself but alot of people complained about it
---
This was a bit of a pain to do even with a group who was specifically doing it. First time it was like half the server picked the same part of the map to cliff jump, it was a bit nuts trying to sort out who you were actualy suposed to be helping Before everyone was running from the wall of fire. Oddly I don‚Äôt think anyone tried to shoot at annyone untill some of the other survivors fimaly showed up And probably wondered just what The heck was going on with the big swarm of mostly unarmed people Punching each other.
---
No one will steal the coverted ammo workshop you drop a nuke it's all yours
---
There can be a way around it. The mail system doesn't need extensive graphics or anything. I'm sure there's a way to do it regardless of server.
---
It doesn't seem efficient at all tho. Crfting machete or board swords would give you back materials for other crafts and get you more xp(remember you already need a ton of xp buffs to pump that crafting xp to some decent level).
---
Also,and more important in my opinion, what happens if I ultra buff myself in god mode and switch server? In the next server do I keep the ultra aid buffs for their lenght and can simply re-enter god mode? Or do I have to rebuff myself up?
---
Because if all the aid buffs persist,then all we said before is just crap and you can simply westek,god mode,buff,switch server,god mode and repeat untill the buffs last.
---
Do you have experience on this?
---
Sounds like you didn‚Äôt build very well.
---
Best place to farm high radiation fluid üëè
---
Ok, incidentally way too early in the am for me,  I was wondering if that was auto incorrect or what
---
This would be awsome pvp event like snowball fight mixed with paintball lol
---
You realize it's not actually building right? It's exactly the same as the event team..
---
Yeee, 1\* Quad Single Action Revolver for 2000 caps
---
You (and preferably a couple of friends) tag some enemies with the syringer. Kill the enemy and there's a high probability a bloatfly will spawn. Hit the bloatfly with the syringer and then kill it, and so on. Each one will drop components, and about one in 35 will be legendary. It's most effective if the nuke zone contains a farmable ultracite vein for unlimited scorched.
---
Very late in the PM for me too, sitting up with a semi sleeping sick kid, so proofreading isn‚Äôt my strong point at the moment!  Thanks for making sure though!
---
What's a legacy weapon?
---
250 DR and 350 ER. I run around with only underamor and a light leather chest piece. I rarely die.
---
Ironically, I joined an Event team yesterday and half the team wasn‚Äôt even even doing events.  The other guy and I did Project Paradise alone.  They were over Level 100 so I don‚Äôt quite get it.
---
Oh and yeah, Building teams are better because you get more XP for everything.  If you‚Äôre the team leader you can quickly change the objective to Events before an event ends for more XP.
---
Let's just not say this at every occasion tho.
---
Playing with my Favorite Weapon - the Classic Gauss Rifle but the Damage is still on the lower End - and the Charging Bug cripples my mood everytime.
---
I wonder what language this was before google translate got a hold of it.
---
Ngl sometimes I feel as if the witch-hunt rule should be expanded upon. Some people need to learn that you shouldn't behave like a complete a$$hole and that there are consequences for their actions.
---
Actually no I put mine away from the main staging area but close enough to run too. Just sick of seeing 50 posts on this. If I drop a nuke I'll put it there because I want to farm hoards but if it's someone else's I'll put it well away.
---
This guy gets it
---
Competing for kills is not fun, especially with your teammates.
---
Have you ever seen the Pied Eyebot? It plays music while a line of Radrats follow behind it.
---
Try finding the path that is the most flat, the back end of the forest, and leading it around that way? Pathing for anything in this game and in prior bgs games are a bit... unforgiving. We always go in from the east, and there should be a spot if I recall on the west side that has some less plants and more flat ground.
---
It's all badly designed.  Buff stacking, food, perk, mutations, legendary, stealth, crit.  If you play the game you want to play you do double digit damage, if you stack all this stupid crap you do quad digit damage.  It's really really obnoxious.  Then you get rubber banding, all the new perk bugs with them not working, VATS bugs with misses.  It's a huge mess.
---
I tried that but someone nuke the area again so we only found it's corpse üòÇ. I guess I'll try again next
---
Really? Huh, you'd expect to reach the end of the map or for it to be unrendered land. Thanks!
---
yeah. i‚Äôm doing it with someone at the moment and people just keep killing us üòÖ
---
Really?  I find it much easier to level my 200+ guy, though I do have a lot of INT that helps with all the exp bonuses.
---
A little googling confirms that the leveling "curve" is fairly flat
---
* level 50-99 (7880 XP)
---
* level 100-999 (15880 XP)
---
So my lvl 200+ guy does take a chunk of exp per level, but i simply annihilate everything short of scorchbeasts in 1-2 shots.  It's more efficient than playing a sub-50 that struggles to kill things IMO.
---
Just nuke prime and include the pink forest on the immediate left. It can spawn there and it's the easiest place to fight it.
---
I think it‚Äôs a matter of proof. This sub doesn‚Äôt allow video so it‚Äôs literally word vs word. There would be plenty of people that would abuse that. In other subs people will get banned with evidence.
---
Weirdly I haven't, first I've heard of it actually. I'll have to keep an eye out.
---
Glad to help
---
The All-Black Mercenary suit sounds perfect for you. You need 4,000 Mr Fuzzy tokens.
---
Can confirm. Did this for my daily challenge yesterday.
---
It's a shame we can't cripple her wings anymore, fkn hate that """"fix""""
---
I don't even see the point of any team beside the event and "building" one.
---
Awesome!
---
This would actually be extremely fun. You could get together players on the server that want to attend and offer some low tier reward for the winner.
---
You actually bought something in this game for real money? That‚Äôs on you my friend.
---
That would be cool actually. Kinda like rockstar is doing with in game pics
---
I cant find it is it called mercenary suit?
---
This! please! Legendary effects are IMO possibly the worst addition to the franchise. They completely ruined balance and ruined the unique weapons we used to have.
---
I vote for a new survival mode that just totally removes any legendary effects. Either everyone has to start with a brand new character or keeps their gear but legendaries are suppressed. 
---
That would be my dream for FO76 ... it would make balancing so much easier and put everyone on a level playing field for things like PVP.
---
Challenging*
---
And yes, this is also how I used it in the beginning haha. The stretched player is my absolute favorite lol.
---
400 ballistic 740 energy
---
I‚Äôve noticed adds don‚Äôt spawn if she doesn‚Äôt land sometimes. Not sure if that‚Äôs just anecdotal or not. So if she‚Äôs in the air longer, less mobs.
---
Keep looking
---
It's a boring Battle Royale, since most players hide.
---
It's a great Hide &amp; Seek game with guns.
---
It doesn't have a solo only mode, which would be a big draw to players like myself, who don't want to burden a team, but don't want to face off against them either.
---
It also seems to lack variety in weapons, we have all these mods in Adventure Mode, but almost none in NW.
---
Overall it's boring, unless you're actively hunting or in the final circles.
---
I recently just traded away my AAE Laser cause I'm paranoid of this and didn't want a useless/valueless gun if they did decide to do something.
---
Thats incredibly ironic. The adventure mode pvp is the one that's unbalanced. 
---
All guns in NW besides 1 or 2 are generally balanced. However people can make their own perk builds which definitely boost their use of weapons above others. 
---
A rifle build can one shot to the head with a scoped lever action. 
---
An auto build along with an overdrive can shred you within a few seconds. 
---
Its all about learning your own playstyle, making a build that suits you and also also learning when to use stealth boys, serums, chems etc.
---
Remember that out of 52 people, there is only 1 winner. So yes, you'll lose 99.9% of the time if you don't take all those other factors into account. You can expect to hop into this mode and start winning unless you know what you are doing
---
Party leaders should give the ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù emoji once they see an event starting. Me and a buddy played last night and he claimed to never see the pop up in the corner. That may help with some showing up.
---
Damn, that‚Äôs unfortunate. I haven‚Äôt even reached the second level for the reputation.
---
750 Dr 680er 200 rad resis 3bolstering 2 unyeilding ss
---
It's a misc. Quest. It opens one of the miners lockers in a random mining site. Check your map. There's never anything good just random junk or common weapon and some kind of ammo. But the XP is better than nothing
---
I love the green radiation hue. I walk through just to have it. Radiation rumble is great too, i can run around being flourescent shiny green. üòõ
---
Should be in one of the quest tabs, under miscellaneous. It's just a key to a locker for some loot.
---
Okay thanks
---
Are you certain the increase is that drastic? I've seen the reports and attempts at calculating but that's a huge increase.
---
Mole Miners will occasionally drop a Miner Key.  It leads to a locker that has loot.  It should show up on your map if you have the quest active.
---
Top left of the entire map. A little road leads up to it with trucks in front.
---
Random locker location on the map. Usually at mine/mine related locations. 
---
It's nothing to write home about, just a little side mission. I'll grab them if I'm nearby and it will move on each login usualyl even if you don't do it so if it's in a bad place just wait until it's closer I guess. 
---
Last one I had was in the glassed caverns and it's really not worth that effort so I waited until it was at hornwright.
---
If you‚Äôre a low level I‚Äôd reccomend staying away from workshops. You‚Äôre going to get killed a lot.
---
You don't play with anyone? With a team mate you just have to jump off a cliff. No stims are needed to revive. I'm pretty sure you could even post on marketplace for help.
---
They are banking on people buying atoms to finish up the legendary run
---
This needs to be a thing so badly. You could use the D-Pad or &lt; &gt; to change songs.
---
If I offended anyone, I'm willing to apologize, yet a lot of Fallout is a gross caricature. It is a fictional world which resembles a real setting, which uses a lot of caricatures. I think most of us are adult enough to realize this is not reality, nor an attempt to look like it. 
---
And again, it is role-play and it can be whatever you want it to be. If you don't want it in the game, that's fine; if you want to give your spin to it, maybe make it more genuine or 'real', again, that's fine as well.
---
Actually yes, I forgot about that aspect
---
I am on ps4 just have marsupual and sell at 350. Always empties out üòè  working to getting speed demon next again will be 350.
---
Im almost certain that Vault 8 couldn't be closed properly though after it was opened. 
---
Appalachia wasn't directly hit and I'm sure they thought that part through, knowing how it was a relatively rural state.
---
I‚Äôm with you on this one.
---
OMG!!! Your salute is gone too? Jeez, I thought it was just me.  I sent in a ticket to Bethesda support,  wanting an explanation...haven't had a reply yet.  Hope the emote comes back as I used it frequently.
---
people just hate pvp in this place
---
Summerville Bridge is a great location for this, jump off near the missing planks. (Or go to Encryptid, folks constantly die in the pond).
---
It‚Äôs probably there from pre patch
---
Just camp items.
---
I've been playing for maybe a month and a half.  I have no legacy weapons.  
---
The idea that removing legacy weapons will suddenly make this game balanced is laughable.  Without having a single shotgun perk equipped I can still one-shot most regular enemies with a double barrel.  A 1-star Gatling Laser is shredding everything from Behemoths, to Deathclaws to Legendary Scorchbeasts.  I'm sitting on almost 600 stimpacks because I almost never have to use them.  
---
 If you want a challenge, this *entire* game would have to be reworked from top to bottom.   
---
 Leave legacy weapons alone.  They aren't the issue.
---
Awesome. Thank you for the info!
---
There's no perk... The higher your intelligence the higher durability your crafted items will be... If you can drive your intelligence up beyond 15 any core you craft will be above 100%
---
Thanks :) I‚Äôve now done the bit I need to do with help from HPD99 :)
---
Maybe it was an ultra cute fusion core?
---
The ones I'm missing aren't even showing up in the atomic shop emotes section anymore. Its like they've disappeared completely üò≠
---
Maybd have a ''tatobot'' the gives you a ''you have been tatoed'' note.
---
yeah because 'astral of six' is a direct reference to you as a person or wut 
---
u will be safe
---
Brilliant this need to happen, especially the spoiled ones.
---
It's not a secret the how to do it is already everywhere and if Bethesda try to fix it it'll just break more stuff.
---
Well he point is that I shouldn't have to coordinate with teammate to have them almost die.
---
But yeah I hopped on game chat like the other person suggested and swapped it with someone right away.
---
Bloodied Lever Action Rifle.
---
I have Bloodied Combat Rifles and a Bloodied Fixer, but the LAR simply hits harder and is generally more fun to use.
---
In theory, the other weapons are useful when I need to spam a lot of bullets quickly, like if I'm making a panicked getaway, but in practice, the damage rubberbanding has become so bad that it's pretty unreliable.
---
Maybe a chem, bobble head, revenant or some other perk?
---
Any leftover ones will stay. Also stacked Punji Board blueprints work still. Dare I say Legacy?
---
Get rid of those legacy weapons.
---
If they blueprinted them, they can still place those.
---
Awesome bro. I havent launched a nuke yet.   Looking forward to it.
---
Update: Just had 74. It took me about 8 minutes of failure, rage and deep breathing to make it that far.
---
It's not just you bro it's super laggy #Xbox
---
No because my gamertag will be linked to multiple searches thats why i don't include it. 
---
My reddit name is not the same as my platform name unlike yours.

---
Quad Cryolator and 2000 rounds puts an end to her when she wont land... But if she does land it makes up for the 20 minutes of flying around. She will die. Let's the melee boys go to her face. It does cost me a LOT of materials to freeze her compared to my Prime Ultracite laser or .50 cal.
---
Ah yes, the lucrative Legacy Punji board market will arise.
---
I got it! Cheers!
---
*Proceeds to spam throw tatoes and The Scrochbeast Queen‚Äôs head*
---
That would be awesome!
---
I got pretty far but didn‚Äôt wanna die out there so I turned back there could be an end I just didn‚Äôt get there. It is serene and enemy free.
---
I'm honestly surprised at the lack of basic remotes for Nuclear Winter.
---
You know stuff like:
---
"Enemy Over There"
---
"Ammo?"
---
"Stims?"
---
"I Have A Nuclear Keycard"
---
I'll do the trivial NW ones, like taking pictures or placing the CAMP.  (Hard to say if the sitting-around-for-30-minutes one is worth it compared to 30 minutes in Adventure).  But Reviving Players?  Screw that.
---
I think having these NW challenges ultimately screws the normal NW players, because they have to play with those who are just there for the dailies and aren't interested in actually playing the game proper.
---
All I want is a middle finger emote, but yeah, people without mics have a hard time trying to comunicate
---
Camden is where I bought mine.
---
Huh... Weird. Do you not have a limit of 150 scrip per day? I do... So... I should just what... Drop them? 
---
Or, instead, in a game about picking things up off the ground (literally comprises of 50-60% of gameplay time) maybe not limit stash space? Is it really so tragic to ask Bethesda to look at those 1's and 0's a bit differently, so that it doesn't bog down the server when I put bits in a digital box? I'd be willing to bet the way they're tracking items for each user is some archaic SQL table/method that doesn't do so hot with large amounts of I/O operations because it was designed for \*gasp\* single-player games...
---
Tatoe mod for paddle ball
---
I‚Äôve honestly never thrown enough to know. But consensus is they suck more than regular grenades. And regular grenades suck.
---
Did you answer that you actually the first time did the power up yourself and not came and someone else had opened it the first time.  Once you have gone all the way up to flip the switch and then drop back down by the door, then what others say would work.  I have never had it glitch, I have had it lag and delay, but it has always opened?  I assume though you have done the power up once and thus a glitch?
---
Please stop dropping your survival tent at SBQ fights.
---
Sincerely,
---
Literally everyone.
---
Now this is redicolous,Over 2 months of grinding
---

---
The courteous thing to do is to disable team fill when you highlight Nuclear Winter on the title screen, so you can play independently.  That way, no crew of serious NW players is stuck with a teammate who is just doing to die/logoff the moment the challenges are done.
---
Fissure sites, Wes Tek, BUT The Forest event Leader of the Pack is three guaranteed.
---
Make it a Plasma Thrower. 
---
You trade the range for being able to melt anything in game in like 3 seconds flat
---
I‚Äôve completed that challenge by myself in a public team of 1
---
Yes it does
---
Nope, It just happened to me even tho I let him die and so that has nothing top do with it.
---
Barbed tato
---
Royalty costs
---
Is this the reason why I feel like the weapon is weaker than the number displayed? As a Brotherhood of Steel role-player, they really screwed over Energy Weapons overall. I still use them, but they should be better.
---
Uranium Fever event at Blackwater mine
---
The adds are spawned only when she lands.  
---
It's a mechanic.
---
This is the first NW challenge that pisses me off.
---
This comment had me thinking. Wouldn't it be cool if we could find as a super rare drop like a single-use legendary Camp trap. It could be any of the turrets or flamethrowers or anything like that, but would be a bit stronger and have an additional effect.
---
Get your intelligence as high as possible. So unyielding armor on a bloodied build, egg head and herbivore and herd mentality mutations are a must for maxing out INT. Then cooks some Cranberry Relish and some Brain Fungus soup, take a nap, and top it off with Berry Mentats and join a Building public team. Have been able to juice level 68 Super Mutants for about 500xp a pop with that and a Wes tek rum gets me at least 10-15k exp. server hop, repeat.
---
Dude, you deserve the ban as much as he does, it's funny how stupid some people are.
---
I was recently told "it's not my fault I chose good perks, maybe work on a better build" in regards to 25 minute scorched Earth's caused by air staggers lol
---
Have you tried using follow me and startled emote?
---
Also any ‚ÄúHorde‚Äù event is a hunt for the boss legendary.
---
My most expensive plans are PA jet packs. 450 caps other than that 250 for weapon plans depending on what they are and 150 and below for everything else. Camp plans 50 caps each.
---
I'm a shotgun build.  No rush in fixing the VATS bug for me, enjoying the one-shots.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought. So if dudes stay in the sky or on a tent, she lands less, therefore less adds spawn... so drawing out the fight in this manner doesn‚Äôt help. 
---
I just wanted to make sure it wasn‚Äôt just only in my experience.
---
every point of int gives a 2% exp boost, a full bonded party should give 8%. But that's what people have told me.
---
Exactly, and then folks complain that the game is too easy. Why not just pick a different build that isn‚Äôt so OP? Oh wait...
---
It's honestly not that bad. I'm level 451 and started at 437 when The Legendary Run began. The key is obviously high INT and XP buffs. I have my base INT at 15 (easy to do since Adrenaline is currently broken), Internal Database helmet, Tasty Squirrel Stew, Broiled Scorchbeast Brain, Well Rested, Building Team. All of these get me over 30 INT easily (not bad for in power armor) and just go kill a bunch of super mutants. This is even more sufficient out of power armor with Unyielding.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen before, but it stopped happening recently for me. It might be because I‚Äôm on Xbox but I‚Äôm not sure.
---
Where do they spawn? Is it inside a radius or is it from where she‚Äôs standing when they spawn? I‚Äôve noticed a bunch of times when I‚Äôve been stabbing up her flabby udders that I‚Äôve been instantly surrounded by mobs.
---
Wouldn't even call yourself a returning player when you never even broached into mutations or solo nuked.  
---
Pretty much every mutation is useful to have aside a few depending on if you group often or not.  Empath and Herd Mentality are the only ones I do not have personally.  Not counting Herbivore since I use Carnviore and those are mutally exclusive.  
---
As for leveling the best spots are Whitesprings, West Tek, and the Burrows.  Clear them out, server hop, and repeat until happy.
---
Also worth to not that with public groups you can now make a group yourself if you do not want to join someone's and benefit from Charisma perks like Inspiration to get a 15% (at max perk rank) flat xp boost even if noone else joins you.
---
Ok, I guess I was on private or something.
---
owww say so then, silly
---
If you get multiple people doing riding shotgun I've found more enemies spawn with about 3 legendaries per run, it takes as long as clearing westek.
---
vendor will have that mod for 6k
---
Doing so should be a requirement to engage PVP
---
You are not wrong
---
Defend events are great for XP farming on an event team. I‚Äôd like to see a dedicated team take as many workshops as possible then run defend events and see how much XP they can get.
---
How is the best way to go about getting an unyielding set?
---
i've been doing the leader of the pack event up near tyler county fairgrounds because it has three legendaries!
---
Ya I noticed this first day. They gonna have to adjust it because this was not likely expected from them even though it should have been.
---
If you're not a power armor build stealth heavy guns will triple those numbers, you fire in bursts for the most part but stay further back to not get detected and you can fire a whole clip doing 150-200 damage a shot when she lands.
---
Yup this.
---
Trade other players on the market.  You can check vending machines but directly socializing is faster.
---
That's because they both completely change the armor's model. The old paints are just different textures. They'd have to completely redesign them to fit the T-65's new model. 
---
Which is a problem for people who both want to decorate their T-65, but still want everyone to flex how they spent all that time grinding for the T-65.
---
Or ... you know... a friggin chat box? Why pour dev time and ask for a ghetto ass system when the most elegant solution is world/region chat? Maybe that's just me tho...
---
I've seen him jamming one of the instruments, sleeping in the bed, hanging out at the entrance complaining about something and, once so far, sitting at the desk he's supposed to be.
---
The only thing this patched fixed was people using Adrenalin, because that's now broken and useless.
---
Haha, understandable. Alright then. The more you know, right?
---
You really need to grind for it, because ammo is #1 problem in there
---
If you can wait till tomorrow I need it too
---
What ?
---
Just to be sure, do you have +250 while reloading ?
---
Yeah I mean like, I dont mind some certain weapons haveing an effect like the special named weapons you got in past fallouts, but theyre eclipsed by the legendary system that takes away all specialness from getting these
---
The perks of taking a break from 76 since it was trash for the first half.
---
The cons are i missed out on good shit from the atom shop :(
---
Nah, that was a joke.
---
This kind of ppl r the reason y PvP should not remove from the game
---
On the plus side, perk loadouts are coming in winter (if you dont already have the mod) and swapping perks wont be a pain in the knob (unless bethesda gets the ammo converter sydrome on it)
---
Communism detected...
---
Either Fireproof or Dense torso mod will make you immune to the sonic attack.
---
I'm having the same problem. I haven't played the game in a month, and now when I try to play in get the 1:5:1 error message over and over again.
---
Think about bud, imagine a room in your house filled with glass. 
---
Nobody needs 1k glass
---
Wait a minute....there are Squirrel badges üò±.  I had no idea.   I've only a few possum badges left and ive really enjoyed doing them.  Looking forward to completing a whole new round of badges.
---
Nah dude I‚Äôve trade it mine fair and square, is the only thing that makes the endgame enjoyable, if not anyone can get them well stop crying and get grinding this isn‚Äôt   communism.
---
2 - they were supporting you by giving you caps, and allowing you to resell items they can‚Äôt use. 
---
Can I ask my own unrelated question to the group? How do you launch a nuke when you‚Äôve already completed the quest?
---
PC as well
---
&gt;As a Brotherhood of Steel role-player, they really screwed over Energy Weapons
---
Me too man.
---
I was one of the few fools to play the Gatling Laser since Day One.
---
And it was a broken Mess to begin with. Charging the Barrels was bugged / Gun broke too fast / Damage was bad / no Legendary Ultracite in the Loot Pool / Ammo was empty upon starting the Game every time / Legacy.
---
And now that the Gatling Laser is fixed after all that its still super outclassed by .50 cal and LMG and Gatling Plasma - and barely being on par with the Minigun - but I guess also outclassed by Gauss Gatling.
---
Then Gauss Guns got released and they forgot to fix the Rifle completly and now even a Quad Version feels inferior to a Laser Gun. Sadly I love the Guns too luch but what a Joke.
---
And make a pvp event around it like monster mash where you use tatos only and its like NW where you all have the same armour so its fair and all health,rads, mutation and buffs are removed, to be fair it will be more fair and fun than NW
---
So you don't want any actual challenge in the daily challenges?
---
I like this idea!
---
Yeah, there's Squirrel. Tbh, I stopped for a little but cause one of them requires me to craft a serum. I didn't buy any serum plans cause I don't use mutations. The recipe for the cheapest is like 20,000+ caps. I honestly don't wanna spend that much for something I won't use a lot but... the badges I do want. Haha.
---
I did my first a few days ago, it was so hard! Congrats! 
---
Also I accidently scrapped my flux components ahaha.
---
It's entirely possible that someone else in the event had tenderizer equipped and you fired a volley while it was in effect, and then the next volley the effect had ended for some reason.  It only lasts 5 seconds iirc so if they stop firing it will end quickly.
---
He was probably shopping when they came across him. Or maybe he was just out for a walk.
---
You know, I was thinking the same thing just the other day.
---
What if you join Events but just do your thing and not join  game events ? Is that bad form ?
---
Legendary tatos
---
ahh, ok that makes sense (in a bethesda we do whats easy not what makes sense) way lol
---
I'd do that
---
thnks, gotcha
---
It still amazes me how they can bring old bugs back, after fixing them once already.
---
If that's the case.
---
I notice stealth is a bit off when I first join the Queen. Doing non-stealth damage for the first few clips then all of a sudden jumps up to stealth damage.
---
Queen fights, project paradise and radiation rumble seem to cause alot of random issues.
---
Yep but Tenderizer never show the numbers it gives sadly.
---
because of course bethesda couldn't implement a complete fix, just half measures lol
---
Because some people are in very desperate need of a life.
---
Did not know that.  Time to add it to the list of damage buffs that dont show in numbers I guess.
---
Well yeaaahh, that would be eXtRa WoRk
---
they just need to make a new level cap , have under level weapons do less damage %. Would solve a lot of problems by resetting the armor / weapon grind and is no different that what every mmo ever has and continues to do with new expansions
---
To launch a nuke, you need a Nuclear Keycard that you can obtain from a Strategic Air Command Cargobot &amp; you're gonna need the launch code. I know of a website that puts up the weekly launch codes.
---
Love this game but they have to be out of their goddamn minds if they think I‚Äôm bothering with their dumb ass challenges,  I‚Äôm just legendary farming like normal and I‚Äôm at rank 13.  Where I end up is where I end up,  they are not getting a nothing dime from me.  I already pay for their lovely sub service *cough* scrapbox on top of paying for the game.  I guess at least I bought it used so Bethesda can get bent.
---
&gt;*level 100-999 (15880 XP)*
---
Yeah... I'm going to have to disagree with that . I'm 400+ and I get multiple 10,000 xp weekly quests completed during a single level up.
---
I‚Äôm all up for this!
---
And breath lol
---
Or Bethesda could fix their shit so that tent thing is impossible
---
Who cares all the rewards are pretty shit
---
Haha fair enough.
---
All Scorchbeasts please, not just the Queen. At least force them to stop screeching until they find a suitable place to land after defeating all the summoned scorched mobs.
---
*#meleebuildsmatter*
---
Well the Capitol building is a 'instance' you load in and out of the building . Thanks for the offer . On xbox though , and I guess it's more sentimental value . All the work and gathering for mats . My first PA that I crafted from scratch myself.
---
There is always 1-2 building teams on any given world I go to so they're around.
---
RIP the other team formats.
---
If you were on a team and usually aren't while someone had strength in numbers shared is one explanation. 50 pct is a pretty significant boost so that could explain part of it but not all.
---
Someone else here mentioned chems, bobbleheads etc. that is a more likely explanation.
---
What level are you?
---
Yes. You don‚Äôt need to hoard. Somethings I only keep between 50-100. Some over. Ballistic Fibers, screws, gears, springs, aluminum, copper and plastic I‚Äôve got hundreds of. I seldom keep steel or wood, since they are the easiest to get from scrapping.
---
I also bulk those up and put about half up for sale. That way I can make money but if I need a lot of stuff it‚Äôs there. 
---
As such I don‚Äôt pick up all junk when I‚Äôm out running about.
---
You're not the only one. However, I don't think Bethesda will ever fix it. It doesn't earn or lose them money keeping things as is.
---
yeah he just sprinted straight at our public team and stood in place after completing the poseidon event. very random
---
Tatos are food, not ammo. There are starving people two miles from us who would kill for a tarp. Literally. They are raiders.
---
I keep seeing complaints about challenges. Anything that requires any sort of work is apparently horrible. It's like people want to play as little as possible, So why even bother to play?
---
You can switch your team from building to event and back? How do you do this?
---
1&gt; please don't use obtuse emojis.  your red lootbag emoji thing tells me nothing and makes your question extremely disjointed and unclear.  in terms of server hopping, no tricks, just blind luck.  tried hopping to find the bow plan trader lady.  spent hours hopping at a location i'd seen video proof of her at.  was pointed to another location, lo and behold there she was, without even needing to hop.  some items are keyed to you and you alone.  meaning until you spend some time in the game, after you pick it up once, it won't respawn for a bit.
---
2&gt; what hitsworth said.
---
3&gt;  find your own groove.  my vendors are always full, so unless i want a legendary item, into a the scrip grinder it goes.  i know i've grinded big money items, but i personally don't have the patience or the stash space for waiting for trades.  so either i want it, or it fuels future rolls.
---
4&gt; asking them and deciding you can trust their answer, or just not caring.
---
5&gt; i have not messed with beckett yet, but my sophia does get a bit restless at times.  pacing and goofing off and sometimes wandering herself into getting stuck on geometry.  i've seen her go back and forth between my armor and weapon bench near instantly.  as quickly as her animation for a bench starts, she'd stop and go to the other bench, and then back and forth for a few mins.
---
Yes, I've bought some things. It's too difficult for me to acquire a top-level weapon. I played radiation 76 for nearly 2000 hours, and getting the best weapon myself was just a be hm
---
It'd be so easy right now because it'd be impossible to get it legitimately right now.
---
Report them if you come across them.
---
... and to get that cargobot you need to use the correct terminal in the military wing in whitesprings bunker
---
It's a huge bummer, for sure. Hopefully one day they will actually address Energy Weapons properly. It would also be nice to have Legendary Power Armor, but I know people would flip out if that were to happen.
---
by doing the quest over again, this time by memory and no markers i think.  there might be a way to restart it, but i dunno.  still haven't dropped one myself, so i'm just running off conjecture here.
---
Had this happen to me the other day travelling to the bunker, i actually spawned in as the nuke landed so it wiped me clean out and then i died about 10 times before i spawned out of the zone, i just waited it out when i realised i couldnt make it out.
---
Joined in once i was in the clear and still got full rewards tho but yah i feel ya, fucking annoying. They also seem to increase the respawn time too like i was waiting 20seconds by the last few deaths before i would respawn.
---
The queen fight before that one my game crashed after laying about 1500 rounds into her, i was apart of a public events team and for some reason when i rebooted the game i was still joined to it so i reentered the same lobby but unfortunately missed out on all rewards, rip lol
---
I prefer my BTSE Potato scrubs /s
---
To make it easier, yes. I have like about 7 Nuclear Keycard a &amp; that was simply by chance. I never had to spawn one in.
---
I'd emote you a "hell yes" but I don't have it.
---
why?
---
1. World items and containers wont respawn with a server hop. The consensus is either wait 20 hrs, or loot 180 items for them to respawn. If hunting for something specific, however (ie outfits), if you don't pick it up on one server, you can hop to try again.
---
2. They were just being nice.
---
I cancelled FO1st. The Queen can't land on my tent if I don't have a tent *points finger to head
---
Hapyy its still there, as its a good starter "bio suit" but imagine how much theyd be woth if not
---
good info to know.  as a psa i'm gonna ask ya'll to pay attention to if other people are nearby and make sure they get a hit in on the legendaries.  with score on the line now we really can't afford the parade of wankers that kept one-shotting the sloth.
---
Vendor bots at the stations sell it. Also, the Responders bot got it as well.
---
I feel like if they implemented that, shops and display cases would break again. Because Bethesda.
---
I‚Äôve been having better luck leaving Forward Station available in the lower right of the map. There is also a Power Armor station in there for scrapping.
---
Achievable with right bloody melee build.  Can hit 30k damage with right combo of stuff.
---
 Apparently the creation club.
---
Yeah.... *sigh*
---
&gt;Legendary Power Armor
---
Dont even get me started with this MASSIVE Balance Gap between Armor and PA.
---
My Huge Problem with this Game is really how balancing is not adressed. PvP is broken and for PvE -- hell we are basically back again at the TSE Meta but this time its Bloodied / Uny.
---
Im really interested in what ONE-WASTELAND is supposed to do. As far as I can tell they try to normalize the enemys and the dmg numbers but they gonna fuck it up and roll it back to how it was before ONE-WASTELAND.
---
Same with Survival and the Mess NW is.
---
no.  100% no.  with the current state of bethesda it would be a garbage fire of a rollout.  prolly locked behind some kind of boring timegated grind.
---
old bethesda might have been able to do something cool with it.  modern bethesda lacks the heart to do anything smart with it.
---
There's a intel perk reducing material cost for constructions "Contractor" do you have it ? might help building it back.
---
I like to throw the air strike and scan gernades and then shoot them in vats!
---
and for putting together T60 sets ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
And some people think this is a bug to have SB and SBQ body spawning on you when you fast travel...
---
The leftover ones remain. üòà
---
Thats what I think has happened here ü§î gonna be online tonight to do some quests was just rebuilding my camp last night
---
There‚Äôs also technically a ‚ÄòClandestine‚Äô one in the ATX files that matches the Gauss weapon skins, but for some reason they haven‚Äôt released it yet.
---
Thank you üòä
---
How do you turn on the damage indicator? Is it only PC?
---
Dumb question, who's a mule player? The one that carry over stuff of high players?
---
How do you get the perk thank you üòä
---
This is great advice and if you already were bloodied then the best course of action.  If you were not bloodied the good news is with the Secret Service armor many are doing that to get their Unyielding, which means you may find some decent prices on other unyielding which before was hard to find.  That way you can buy the armor to match the build.
---
If you are not or don‚Äôt want to do a bloody build let‚Äôs us know and we can offer other advise.  One thing I do before getting any mutations in my opinion is get Starched gene 2 perk card in Luck.  That way when you get the mutations you can keep them.  Second in my opinion Class Freak in luck 3 stars is also a must to counter the negatives on those mutations.
---
Nice! I‚Äôve been doing Scorched Earth like a maniac lately. I have seen so many different setups now.
---
I‚Äôve had is spawn me into the fissure. Definitely annoying. I throw on my stealth suit before I fast travel to the SBQ fight. Been burnt too many times.
---
So you don‚Äôt have to waste atoms: Currently the only paint you can use on T-65 that DOESN‚ÄôT just completely change the armor‚Äôs appearance is the Atomic Onslaught one unlocked via SCORE. There are no Atomic Shop T-65 paints that have been released yet.
---
Started a lvl 1 yesterday got it to level 3 and got nothing.
---
well it didn‚Äôt
---
It also dupes all items in both your inventories.
---
i just want to see the whole server throw potatoes at a beginners exiting vault 76
---
If only. Would love to turn into a Super Mutant
---
He was getting more damage than normal though and then dropped back to norms.
---
FWIW, I haven't had any problems with my legendary with that effect.
---
He‚Äôs a two-day old troll. He doesn‚Äôt know any better. 
---
He just jumped on Reddit and started blastin‚Äô. 
---
I wish I could give you an answer, I reinstalled it via steam and it worked. Bethesda didn't offer any working solution at all.
---
Brain bombs with carnivore?  Do they provide a bonus?
---
Simply scrapping it and craft new ammo on the thinkers work bench. Is that so difficult? 
---
Bethesda gives me headache
---
Yeah it would be cool if i could transform in a mutant.
---
Repair kits
---
And how would that work for deaf or mute players?
---
Sorry, you just meant this as a pithy, offhand, snide comment meant to make you chucks to yourself about how clever you were. Not as a serious suggestion, right?

---
You don't need anywhere near that amount. Easy 500 steel at Westtek and  glass is for repairing laser rifles, you probably don't need any at all. Bulk 90% of everything and sell it all. The only things I have more than 100 of on a regular basis are acid and cloth. Lead and Steel are easy to come by.
---
In the options menu "Display" category I think, is definitely available on PS4.
---
Tatoenade get it done Bethesda
---
I have only used this exploit to take photos from higher angles.
---
Click your icon in the menu, where you also see your faction rep and click on change.
---
Same, i was just a random unoptimized heavy gun build a few weeks ago (first time back on since shortly after launch) and the queen made me realize i was doing shit for damage. Now i watch her health drain at the end of my .50 cal or flamer and see all those sweet sweet numbers pop up all over her face, so satisfying
---
I basically played the main story and wastelands using a semi auto combat rifle. It was my go to.
---
I still haven't found a legendary combat rifle. Which is amazing. I'm melee right now but if I found a junkie combat rifle I'd probably go right back.
---
\&gt;They also seem to increase the respawn time too like i was waiting 20seconds by the last few deaths before i would respawn.
---
I think they do that for all events, the respawn timer is longer the more times you die.
---
Do you only get bonus xp for then event itself or do you get bonuses on the mobs you kill while completing as well?
---
Considering the secret service armor is more powerful than any of the power armor, I have to disagree.
---
Ok. New idea for event teams. Take all the workshops. The defend events count as events and you can get it to where you have one going off consistently if you take enough shops. With 4 dedicated teammates you should be able to really juice the XP.
---
It's more powerful than the T-65? ü§î
---
I miss when 45 and 50 cal was the best ammo in the game
---
0, berserker's for life, YA
---
Then I can one shot it.
---
Might aswell make it be a server wide event! Like the SBQ where it tells everyone that it has started. Just like a giant free-for-all!
---
Bethesda already made the mistake once of making a hat Best in Slot, there‚Äôs no need to do it again.
---
Levels are for the short bus version of game design.
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm pretty sure that this won‚Äôt happen, as Bethesda said (or at least I‚Äôm pretty sure I remember them saying) prior to Wastelanders that the Scorched are a permanent fixture of the game and will never truly be removed. At the very least, I think, the areas they can spawn in might diminish- like, maybe over time they‚Äôd be effectively ‚Äòcontained‚Äô in the Cranberry Bog or something- but I don‚Äôt think the problem will ever be truly ‚Äòsolved‚Äô for that reason. I think the best case scenario is the Brotherhood finally stops the source of the Scorchbeasts and nothing really changes in the world beyond some comment that ‚Äútheres a lot of Scorched left up here so we‚Äôll still be on cleanup duty for a long time and it can still spread to the un-inoculated, but at least we‚Äôve stemmed the tide significantly‚Äù
---
Plan: Tato Grenade
---
Requires:
---
4 Tato
---
1 Fragmentation Grenade
---
1 Fertlizer
---
2 Acid
---
No perks yields 5 tato grenades
---
Tato grenades deal same ballastic damage as a frag grenade but also deals area poision damage to nearby enemies.
---
Plan has a chance to drop from any settler/responder event.
---
Good Idea?
---
Forget the fertilezer, just let the Tato spoil!
---
Loool üòÖüòÖ
---
I didn't know Intelligence affected experience in 76. I know it did in 4 but the wiki completely omits that fact and just says it affects crafted item health and scrapping in 76
---
It took me about ten minutes and a some Google searches to convince my wife of that.
---
I can‚Äôt love this enough
---
Yeah, its getting really hard to keep playing when pts does not do shit apparently
---
That was so annoying. I was doing Fachtnet and the legendary was dead before i turned around
---
Yes, you drop things on the ground. It's what everyone fucking did before scrip existed.
---
I have a hard time just placing my tent, nonetheless place 5 miles in the air. Always get the error Intersects existing Object.
---
That wasn‚Äôt the mistake. The mistake was listening to haters and changing it after the fact.
---
Which time? The mascot heads with 1DR? The tactical marine helmet and chinese stealth helmet that have the effect of a gas mask *and* the marine underarmor? Or the radicals face mask, which was the **only** one nerfed? They are still on the wrong side of the line they drew in claiming that they don't want a best-in-slot ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Well, as long as it‚Äôs not ‚Äúlegendary,‚Äù I could see them adding a slot for a mod.
---
Exactly. I am not a fan of PVP in general, but when a person can kill me while I'm wearing Power Armor in a few hits is just absurd. Some of these Builds are really annoying as well because it kind of makes the gameplay narrow instead of being more fun. 
---
And I have been also wondering how One Wasteland is going to "balance" things. It might just be only in terms of PVE, but who knows what else could change.
---
Most of the good cards are specced for high perception.  Pvp is for me.  I do very well in NW and have a few solo wins.   
---
What I'm not doing is speccing a new character just for NW.  Saying PVP isn't for me when you have no idea how I play is just disregarding the issues with perks and special being tied from adventure mode
---
615 dr
---
They didn't have time to build good back end tools, so the game just throws you into a server that is "close" to you. That is the ONLY criteria. There are no tools for determining anything about a server from the menu screen.
---
Seconded. While we‚Äôre at it can we also get Blood Eagles ARMOR paint? They clearly have their own unique NPC armor skins. (And I dont mean their unique jacket, they clearly have a unique paint on say, Combat Armor and stuff)
---
I'd like a Thank You, a No Thank You, and a F*ck off you slimy one-shoting wanker.
---
Just start a new character or level up a mule if you have one.
---
If you run on public on a mule, join a building or events team.
---
If you run on private, make some cranberry relish on your main and transfer it to your mule.
---
Nocturnal tato
---
I could never understand why they removed it in Fallout 4 to begin with. And to think, some players started with Fallout 4 and 76 never got to experience that cool feature.
---
These are good.
---
Junkie tato
---
im pretty sure they said constantly that 1st and purchased Atoms are locked to the platform you bought it on, so forgive me if i seriously doubt that you looked all that hard for an answer to this
---
Bethesda is locked into the bad game design death spiral. There are LOTS of things they should have done and could have done if the overriding goal wasn't to build a mobile game as a service and pass it off as a non-mobile game.
---
Angry Turtle gave us a really useful video on item spawns. He showed that item respawn is not entirely based on a timer, but instead the game tracks recent items looted and that it only keeps a record of the last 255 (I think that was the number) items picked up. 
---
So what you do is you loot your sugar bombs in Flatwood and Moss Town, loot a bunch of junk, jump servers and they respawn. I just went and tested that to be sure it works, and it does. However what I was doing, since Brain Bombs last for one hour and a half, I really only needed to craft a few at a time. Then I would just play and pick up junk items along the way, then jump servers every now and then, and I would just make it a habit to grab my sugar bombs every time I Jumped to a new server. Over time, you build up a stockpile of sugar bombs, and then it becomes much easier.  
---
Here is a link to Turtle's video, this is really useful information for farming items.

---
Because that's not how it fucking works. You don't have twenty thousand pieces of fucking scrap, you have a single ID representing a particular piece of scrap and the value twenty thousand denoting how many you have. All that fucking matters is unique id's.
---
I run a few different ones, junkie extra crit lever action that is kinda so OP i only use it now if im in trouble
---
Bloodied HM extra crit 250 dmg resit on reload. I got the gold camo for this so i like to use it alot even tho im always having to find time to get more ammo for it its just a good time
---
Sometimes ill run an AA extra crit .50 cal hunting rifle but its set up to snipe so i gotta be in the mood
---
Ooooooh-hu-hu Kaiiiiiiba Booooooy!
---
Just did my first tonight too. Wasn't too bad.
---
With the right set of gear (5 pieces of Troubleshooter's armor), ample supplies (ammo, stims, radshield, radaway), and the right perk loadout, it makes the whole thing significantly easier.
---
Preparing all of the above is what takes the time. The preparation takes longer than the actual task itself.
---
It's much more complex than the radical mask, because they already remove ability to obtain this kind of effect on energy weapon, there is an "flag" on it to avoid this (and the "patch" is fucked up too because radium is "legacy" but in fact this is a ballistic weapon that fire .45 but it have an energy/ballistic flag so the "flag" for explosive effect on energy weapon overwrite the ballistic flag... And i don't want to miss my BE radium ^^).
---
They need to check every account to remove it i guess because if they fucked up (they can we all know) they probably gonna clear all legendary weapon in an update by mistake, so they don't want to take any risk to screw everything related to legendary effect and that gonna kill the game, most people gonna stop playing it.
---
Mmm pretty sure it was Pegasus but whatever. I'll get you back for this Yugi-Boy
---
I'm gonna be that guy.... you can't get a bloodied two shot.... sorry
---
They don't need to join the event for you to benefit,
---
Do you need all the code pieces for the silo or can you just use the nuclear keycard and code from website?
---
If your on PS4 I can make you one!
---
Praise Atom!
---
Yeah I think that bethesda should include some little tutorial on how to do it when you are finally able to share a perk card because it took me awhile to figure it out too.
---
Or just move your tent *points finger to head*
---
Rmt is against tos, if you sell or buy does not matter. You're like a junkie snitching on his dealer.
---
You simply need the Keycard. The website will give you the launch code for each silo respectfully. The website is nukacrypt.com
---
Coming from someone who DOES enjoy it- Because it‚Äôs flawed in a lot of ways. It has a total of two maps despite having been a feature of the game for over a year now and has seen very few significant updates; there hasn‚Äôt even been any update to the unlockable rewards, giving very little incentive for people past rank 100 to play, except for the limited time events which are few and far between (there‚Äôs been a total of what, 3?). From what I understand very little attention is paid to it on PC to the point that its essentially unplayable due to rampant cheating. And on top of all of that the mode is built in such a way that it actively encourages you to play PASSIVELY rather than participating in the actual battle royale; due to experience gained being heavily biased towards how long you survive in the match and not towards say, how many kills you‚Äôve gotten, it encourages people to hide in bushes rather than doing actual battle with each other, turning it into less of a battle royale and more of a game of glorified hide and seek; which can still be fun, but it isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs cup of tea.
---
In short, it‚Äôs a fun mode, but it‚Äôs been heavily neglected by Bethesda and has a lot of kinks in need of working out.
---
Weapon with an legendary effect that can be acquired anymore like the "double" effect or energy weapon with explosive effect
---
Have them press alt+enter after the game launches. Forces the game from windowed to fullscreen. Couldn‚Äôt tell you what the root cause is.
---
I don't think that stuff is out yet....the only 2020 roadmap was the one for season 1
---
Oh yeah, it's a great Team to Bond. I have a base Intelligence of 15, so it's really beneficial overall. 
---
I also would like to see the Roleplay Team have something other than Charisma, not really sure what it could do instead.  Although it could be great for everyone sharing different cards, but my base Charisma is 1.
---
I kinda miss the old skill system of 3 and NV.
---
It's in the latest ITV on the Fallout 76 website
---
If you just complete the daily/weekly you'll be where you need to be to get it done by the end.
---
Even if you miss some, you'll make enough atoms to just buy that last few levels, or can grind out some XP to make it up.
---
With how ludicrously easy it is to get XP anymore even very casual play should get you a few levels if you're smart about it.
---
How does  what your saying have anything to do with what I said?? Can you read? You said and I quote "No real purpose for leveling up other than the Legendary Run score." And I said that you need to lev up to max the legendarys perks what in any of that to do with cheating duping or even the legendary run system at all
---
You just want to argue with someone to feel important. Well your not 
---
And on a side note who cares if people cheat to get there faster it wont effect me or anyone else for that matter really those people are stupid cuz they'll finish with no effort then what...
---
I think trees were in the atom shop at one point? Not sure if they'd work in the planters though.
---
Fucking listen. Bethesda has NEVER said there were limitations from people having infinite scrap, the limitation is on people always asking for an infinite STASH. Infinite scrap is the easiest fucking thing ever that they kept out of the game initially because it did not fit their survival theme they were going for. Infinite stashes would lag the games servers to shit.
---
I Don't have 1st, because I'm not a child and have basic impulse control to not pick up every piece of shit I see.
---
The people who play on the PTS suffer through all this garbage and are constantly blamed for not finding shit while it seems obvious that the build on the PTS does in no way resemble the build that gets released on patch day.
---
" Tactical Marine Helmet and the Chinese Stealth Helmet both basically are  best in slot due to the fact that they prevent waterborne disease "
---
I don't think the Chinese Helm prevents waterborne diseases. I tested this out a couple of days ago and I was still receiving the UI danger alert when in water. Not sure about the Marine Helm. I've read that the Marine Underarmor is supposed to prevent diseases though.
---
It's very frustrating because it seems as simple as any of the other options available for walls and floors.
---
You‚Äôll hear the ‚Äúscorched earth‚Äù music if a scorchbeast is aggroed to you. If you‚Äôre on XB1 I can give you a 2 shot Gatling laser for free. Melts scorchbeast beasts aside from the queen in seconds.
---
I think I would instead make spoiled fruit have this option but either way would be a fun random feature added to the game.
---
Unless you‚Äôre in the Cranberry Bog, the ‚Äòwarning system‚Äô is essentially this:
---
Am I near a Fissure Site? If yes, high chance of Scorchbeast. If no, you‚Äôre probably fine.
---
This is obviously not FLAWLESS, and sometimes they‚Äôll show up in random places, but in my experience you‚Äôre far less likely to run into them when you‚Äôre not near a fissure.
---
When I confronted someone about doing that they said no one cares its low level. If no one cares why are you over here waiting to waste it as fast as possible? Asshat.
---
I just bought the helmet today and i agree. Even though its really good looking and i love the yellow light it emits, 1650 gold is kinda too much for practically a cosmetic. Love it though.
---
The chaotic evil we truly deserve.
---
I thought it was a bug.
---
I've had SB corpses follow me all around the bog. I figured there's no way that can't be a bug.
---
I'm a pistol/archer build so it kinda sucks for me
---
Last I read from someone else who tested it after Patch 20 dropped, the Tactical Marine Helmet doesn't prevent waterborne disease even though it says it does in the item description, but the Chinese Stealth Helmet does.  
---
But I guess it's hard to know what is a bug and what isn't atm; the tooltip could be erroneous, or  the waterborne disease prevention not working could be. Who knows.

You can edit the following settings in Fallout76Prefs ini file under Documents\My Games\Fallout 76.
---
bFull Screen=1

bBorderless=1
---
Jet‚Äôll make you jittery
---
We need a potato cannon
---
No one is ignoring anything, except Bethesda. Everyone else has just given up on logical suggestions.
---
Shhhhh lol
---
YES, THANKYOU! I have already made like 3 posts about this, it needs more attention and I hope someone from Bethesda eventually makes changes.
---
It was honestly 1 of the things about Wastelanders I was most excited about, I knew we were getting soil tiles and I really thought we'd be able to plant the trees.
---
My underground bar would've finally been complete with the addition of an underground garden.
---
I know about item respawns, it's just a matter of finding and remembering where things are lol.
---
Try hitting Alt+Enter while playing. 
---
Also after selecting full screen in setting did you restart the game or your computer?
---
Or you can google advanced ways to fix it in your steam setting. If you right click game and hit properties. There is a setting to change launch settings
---
What‚Äôs wrong with one man army? Is it bugged? I haven‚Äôt had issues with it.
---
Personally I‚Äôd prefer a tato launcher. Or a tato bomb.
---
Actually this could be fun, add a few other tato related items.
---
Instead of getting spoiled food, you get spoiled tato which can be thrown. Then the spoiled tato could be used in a recipie to make various tato grenades if not thrown.
---
A tato cannon would be awesome too, use tatoes to make weaponized tatoes for ammo, and give an explosive mod to the tato cannon to mimic the tato grenades.
---
It would also be fun to have a tato battery generator that uses 3 tatoes to give 3 power in your camp. This would actually be an awesome feature for things like camp shops because it would be small enough to place on top of them and power them separate from the rest of your camp without the ugly powerlines.
---
It would be cool if they did a little gag quest where you follow a scientist obsessed with tatoes who's demise was due to tatoes, but in is quest to research all the uses of tatoes created a large number of tato inventions.
---
I could see that being a bad one I think someone needs to make a list of bad perks to share for specific builds and you can obviously see who is bloodied and not in the groups
---
you... *passed* project paradise with 2 people? I can‚Äôt even imagine that lol
---
I bulk everything and keep it all below 10 at most and under 100 for the components that dont bulk, fiberspools etc. Usually ill sell at the start of a session down to half and then build it up as i play, craft whatever it is i need, bulk the rest and log off. Im currently sitting around 650-700 stash but its usually between 750-800 someone just brought all my legendary weapons i was selling.
---
Honesty never had any issues with crafting components for items other than screws and springs but you 100% dont need to horde that much stuff. If you are ever low on something just goggle locations to find it and do a run there, easy done.
---
One last thing if you find yourself stockpilling aid just sell it, this game gives you so much of it, some like radaway and radx i find myself constantly trying to get rid of them, its unreal!
---
Do you have a link I couldnt find it there?
---
&gt;My underground bar would've finally been complete with the addition of an underground garden.
---
Nice! I was thinking a Roman Vila with a central fountain and garden. Now if I could only cure Sofia of those awful headaches life would be good. :)
---
stop hoarding.
---
1 break all your junk and kept arround only 200 of each the rest you go to the thinker's bench and make bulk of it and sell it
---
2 screws, ballistic fiber, adhesive, hooard those like candy
---
3 med items keep some at your stash for emergency, keep some to use at the inventory(I keep 5-15 chem and what not and all stim packs) sell the excessive ones at a vendor or on the vending machine
---
4 we have ammo converter, convert all what you have to ones that you use or sell it at 1caps
---
5 don't keep gear that you not gonna use, disassemble or sell it or scrip it.
---
As far as I know all of the challenges relating to Vault 94 were removed when they closed the vault, the 94 icon and emote are legacy now.
---
I wish the player could collect the Holotapes and bring them into Adventure Mode. Most of them are a little bit longer than the whole countdown, and you lose them every game. And it would be nice if leveling was faster. All I want is the BOS Minigun paint, and the Outcast Paint for Power Armor. But I hate Battle Royales, so it's definitely a teast from Bethesda. I would rather buy them with Atoms.
---
Nah they said they would be made available through different means long before they closed the vault, and it was there until patch 20 when they added new challenges.
---
I can't second this idea because Bethesda doesn't seem to move us up, only own.   If they did more, we'd all have to use even our best weapon to just beat to death level 5 radroaches.   Ok, hyperbole, but I hope you get my point.   Once I spend over a thousand hours in a game, I don't want every kill to be a hassle.
---
The trees and shrubs are indeed Atom Shop items but they can't currently be placed in the new planters. :(
---
You freaked out on him for saying that ‚Äújunk takes up 75% of stash space.‚Äù You said they can‚Äôt fix that problem because of server stability, yet every fo1st has unlimited junk storage. So if it wasn‚Äôt just a selling point, and they gave it to every player, we‚Äôd all be fine. 
---
Here‚Äôs the other thing. You‚Äôre right in a sense with the unique ids. But at the same time you‚Äôre wrong. fo76 system uses weight to assess your stash, not unique ids. You can have 1 unique weapon taking 30lbs of your stash. In other games you can have 30 unique items each taking up 0 weight. The system is in place to sell fo1st. It‚Äôs simple to understand. Other games still limit you, but based on # of unique items, not an arbitrary weight system in order to sell memberships. I‚Äôm sure the stash box was on the radar from release. 
---
You‚Äôre just arguing to argue.
---
Yeah that would be pretty amazing
---
I played the game for so long and bought a lot of things, but I didn't report anyone except that he was seen using dupe glitch this time. I don't think it's fair. If he got the weapon by his own efforts, I don't resent paying a high price for it.
---
Not wrong though. Nobody wants to hear "git gud noob" and yet... the noobs gotta git gud. Complaining on reddit doesn't increase level though you'd never know to read it.
---
Stop trying to put square pegs in round holes people. Leveling up an alt is just about the easiest thing you can do. Heck I have several alts just for trying out different Special spreads and play styles.
---
No, you'll be fine. Just make sure to take advantage of upcoming double XP and double SCORE weekends.
---
Probably not.  Depends how much you play and how effectively you use teams.
---
If you can get 3x the repeatable you can skip the NW completely and still be up some XP.
---
There's some double XP dates and double SCORE days coming up they may their some more things in too....
---
No...
---
You get XP bonuses plus there is a double score weekend upcoming
---
What?
---
It's gotten so much worse after 20.  I'm getting damage numbers show up and no damage show up on the health bar all the time.  I'm frequently missing 6+ shots in a row in VATS 85%+ chance to hit with my gun in the enemy's head.  I'm getting all or nothing hits in VATS with shotguns making VATS often a very bad choice at close range.
---
This isn't true.
---
Only 1 of the 6? Daily challenges is for nuclear winter, and it only awards 250 points. Majority of points to advance come from the other daily challenges and weekly 1s.
---
If you were to do all others every day/week, you would likely reach 100, or very close
---
I‚Äôm sure people already answered this. But just in case. What I used to do (before I had fallout 1st)
---
Is join one of my friend‚Äôs on whatever server they were in. I‚Äôd fast travel to vault 76 and if you head to the right where the liberators are there‚Äôs a few containers there that you can drop your loot in. Put your stuff in there. Then leave the game, switch characters and try to join that person‚Äôs server again. If you‚Äôre lucky , you‚Äôll join right away. 
---
SOMETIMES you get really bad luck and the world is full. No big deal, just wait. Or you get really REALLY unlucky and you find out that friend has left that server, or the game in general. In which case, the chances of you joining the same server are 1%
---
If you have fallout 1st. Just basically do the same thing, the private world will still be the same world after you leave. But only for a good 10-15 mins. After that it finds another. So you need to be quick. 
---
Also, I don‚Äôt know if this applies to public servers, but when I joined a private world I just dropped all the items on the floor because I didn‚Äôt think looking for a container was necessary. I joined the same world, went to the same location. My loot bag was still on the floor but it was empty. Nothing in it at all. I quickly switched characters to see if my original character could pick up the items. But sadly no. If you drop it on the floor. It just disappears.
---
Bummer. I'd bet someone figured out a way to sneak them in the planters. Maybe the old rug trick?
---
I've had people join almost every time I make a building team.
---
I hit score rank 17 yesterday morning and, checking the calculator, that means I'm doing almost 110,000xp per day average so far. I've played more than usual but only about 2 hours a day this week, and despite being teamed I'm still playing solo just clearing muties and fissures and doing dailies.
---
Are tatoes soft like tomatoes or hard like potatoes?
---
I pretty much only convert 40mm grenades. They drop by the hundreds at line in the sand and roughly 140 of them will max out the ammo converter.
---
Id say nah man the NW challenges are 1/7 dailies. Its always 250 score and the biggest score comes from weekly challenges and they don't have a single NW challenge. Sure over a week NW challenges can net u 1500 score which can add up but I do not believe it is required to beat seasons. Keep doing daily ones in adventure mode and I believe you will have it complete by the time its done.
---
I do play NW little bit I'm lvl 20 started when ghillie suit challenges were out. Its a fun mode for a lil while good way to release from adventure grind, may even win a few matches, won 3 yesterday was fun af! I mainly log in to do the NW daily thou theyre usually pretty easy. One day it had deploy ur camp 3 times.. Can be done within minutes of entering a match. Another one thou was survive 30 minutes, or revive 2 players those can require more time or another persons aid to purposely go down so u can res em.
---
Like I said make it like Heart of the Swamp. I'm a tank Executioners/Furious build. I can technically kill the Strangler Heart in one mag but the game doesn't let me.
---
What‚Äôs the bug?
---
I believe when they said that they were referring to the armor and mask being made available by other means, namely gold. My 94 challenges definitely disappeared when they closed the vault as I was also right in the middle of one and lost it. If you search this subreddit for ‚Äúvault 94 legacy‚Äù you‚Äôll find several posts referring to the challenges and their rewards becoming legacy. I‚Äôm not doubting that you had the challenge available until recently, but I think that may have been the bug.
---
God mode ...
---
It staggers the SBQ and prevents her from landing. You need to let her finish the landing animation when she is targeting someone on the ground.
---
If the added the stocks, this could be a sort of short term punishment for players who get killed in pvp that had a bounty.
---
Teleports player to stockade, event starts for 2 to 3 minutes, everyone gets to pick spoiled tatoes out of a bin, and throws them at the offending player. The offender can throw out emotes while in the stockade to taunt the other players while being pelted with tatoes.
---
Everyone gets 5 spoiled tatoes to play with and a +5% exp buff for 1 hour after it ends and the player with the most hits on the offender gets an extra reward such as an outfit or plan. Lol
---
Score dailies are bugged for a lot of people.  They get auto completed.  Not sure why exactly.  But a lot were playing NW or logged in when doing dailies
---
Ah, I thought you said "all the others". Improved Repair Kits are not sold in the Atom Shop though
---
If you use voice chat it transmits to your team members no matter their location. Had a very chatty team leader the other day, it was entertaining  actually hearing someone talk.
---
Eh it‚Äôs not really a dupe tho. More of a way to refresh the inventory of the containers to farm grenades, plans, caps, etc
---
anyone who things that removing legacies would even remotely "balance" this game are delusional. 
---
all removing legacies will do is make some people leave the game, which bethesda cant afford. 
---
if they want to give us a challenge, it needs to be dedicated endgame like events and raids ect, the overworld shouldnt have to be hard if you dont want it to be, especially with the 850,612 times you will have to go out and farm something.
---
Both, at the same time
---
I think that's potentially where the problem lies. For 'Building', the icon, imagery, and even the name is not very enticing.  
---
In contrast, the 'Event' option says "BONUS EXPERIENCE!!!", and everyone joins those because it sounds good ...and then they don't even do events.
---
I think people just aren't reading properly, or Bethesda has done a poor job of promoting and differentiating what each team does. Or both.
---
Why does the ammo converter exist at all? This became more of an existential question to me the other day. I have a limited amount of gaming time. Which got me thinking; I also have a limited amount of lifetime. Here I am converting ammo. Screen after screen. Worthless rounds for more worthless round of ammo. This ammo will be used up in seconds. The river of time will keep flowing without us and well after were gone. These few moments are precious. I'm not going to choose to waste the one precious resource I have left, time. 
---
Instead, I'm going to keep spamming the Port-A-Diner. I can almost taste the perfectly preserved pie.
---
Pretty much this. Software dev is an incredibly trying pursuit
---
Quit and restart.
---
I did the same thing, where the two robots didn't spawn out of their stations just before the final room. I could hear the Protectron noises, but they wouldn't spawn out of their containers.
---
I had to quit and do the whole mission again.
---
I got my favorite gun (bloodied 10mm smg) out of a legendary that spawned during the first run. It wasn't a total loss.
---
I always hear it whenever I spawn in anywhere
---
Yeah I‚Äôm yet to land a shot on the sheepsquatch during encryptid and I‚Äôm no slouch. The alert comes up that it‚Äôs vulnerable, there‚Äôs a burst of gunfire from some one-shotter and it‚Äôs all over. 
---
Cranky emoting does not do much to relieve my feelings.
---
True, still boringly stupid, IMHO.
---
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing it but I also get it from time to time
---
I‚Äôve been too focused on getting my damage done to her I usually don‚Äôt hit anything else until she flys away. I‚Äôm always getting smacked by at least a lvl 5 radroach or a wolf when I switch my attention so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a secured point.
---
Bloodied tato ü§¢
---
Bloodied explosive lever action rifle. I have a bloodied explosive combat rifle which does more DPS but sucks bullets and is always in constant need of repair. The rifle is good enough on just about every enemy except SBQ.
---
Exactly!
---
When I tried to use it yesterday it was missing.
---
Gotcha. I‚Äôve only had issues with them giving credit halfway through so far.
---
I took 9 months off from this game and I am usually at work when they reset. Is it 10 or 11am CDT?
---
Yup same here, glad I am not the only one
---
I'll have to check that, thanks.
---
Maybe I should take my ally out for a dinner, could boost my RNG luck :P
---
All she finds for me is crappy one star melee weapons, like Nocturnal...
---
Potato skin outside and tomato flesh inside
---
is it the inventory management thing?
---
I had it available until recently as well though
---
Imo that sounds awful. Honestly, if you were an apex predator dragon bat how often would you land for the little people shooting you? Why would you land (Unless you got your wings crippled)? We can't complain about immersion and also complain about an apex dragon bat not landing enough.
---
It‚Äôs *possible.* But you don‚Äôt usually get great rewards. Like all PP runs.
---
Happens when you play adventure mode after having played Nuclear Winter in the same session. Same with the visual bug that makes the nuke radius on the map look huge.
---
We need a potato gun.
---
Austin, from Bethesda.  At least until he saves up enough to get his own place anyway.
---
I also get this from time to time, sometimes it replaces every "4th wall" fx sound for an hour.
---
The bass would be a nice improvement.
---
As it stands now, I get the beeping noises from Frag mines as my glitchy noise when I fast travel to my camp. Or just sometimes walking around.
---
The perk isn‚Äôt bugged, it‚Äôs actually working as intended. It causes the SBQ to stagger and you‚Äôll see it working when she jerks back while hovering, looking for a place to land. The trouble is that her landing behavior is interrupted by the stagger, essentially stun-locking her and preventing her from coming back down to Earth. She also needs a place to land, so if she‚Äôs targeting a player on the fence or on the Drop Site building, she has far fewer opportunities available to land.
---
Bloodied tato
---
There's likely a grain of truth in this; if you let associate-level engineers do the implementation, they'll likely come back with dumb excuses like the above. Worse, if you promote associate-level engineers to Engineering Lead positions, you'll take said excuses at face value and stop trying.
---
When I tried to use an alt character to do the lvl up daily because lvl 200+ is a mission to lvl up. It showed the task completed but didnt give me the Score points so I thought you had to do it on the same character?
---
Upvoting.  Happens all the time and respawning at the fissure is NOT the nearest point to where I died.
---
Ya it appears it's not, I just did some testing.  If those #'s still come out of the dat files than it might only be a piece of the formula, and there's a level modifier involved.
---
I noted exactly what my exp was in the challenge window, and I was freshly leveled so not even a sliver showing in pipboy on my experience bar and went through a bit of fighting to earn about 5.7k exp.  It wasn't near 1/3 of the way filled, more like 1/6.
---
Screenshotted exp bar, used paint to grab just the full exp bar and compared the # of pixels wide vs what part of the bar was filled, and it was about 16.5% of the way.  So at level 231 it's roughly 34,700 experience to level up.
---
You still have it. It's probably just you're emotes wheel has been reset, happened to me a couple times.
---
Go to the atomic shop, look in emotes, you have to select it for it to then be added to your interchangeable selection on the wheel once again
---
I keep a Fixer in inventory just for that purpose.   Usually it doesn't one-shot if I am not stealthed.
---
Yes a mule is a character created only for extra storage
---
It seems like it's as broke as adrenaline atm
---
As a melee build I can promise you I never leave empty handed. You‚Äôre most likely not doing enough damage to receive the reward. You need to do a minimum of 1,000 damage to the queen. That means if you‚Äôre shooting her, punching her, stabbing her. It doesn‚Äôt matter. You need to do at least 1,000 damage to her. If you don‚Äôt, the game counts you as ‚Äúnot helpful‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt reward you.
---
Happens to the best of us man. Ive had people killing me over Poseidon. Its good u wanted to apologise atleast :D
---
I'm not gonna do a bloodied build I was gonna go for a heavy gunner stealth build that I seen angry turtle do with a flamer. So how does the deal with this secret service armor that your mentioning go? I'm not sure I understand the process to the unyielding.
---
Depends how much you intent to play or grind overall, but generalyl speaking no. 
---
I am level 20 and I have missed two NW rewards so far, easy to make up with daily levelling up, and events have been announced already, including but not limited to a x2 XP weekend. With the right buffs and teaming up that can easy be a x5 for everything you do, maybe more. 
---
Missing the odd score stuff won't affect anyone at either end of the spectrum whether they're actively going for 100 or not at all. There is probably more stuff to come for catchup as well as the atom purchase for levels however distateful people may find that.
---
No. For many of them, you can just jump into a NW match, do them and die and it won‚Äôt take much time at all. Alternatively, just spend that time grinding some  XP. You get 100 SCORE for every 10k, which doesn‚Äôt take that much work to get.
---
I was the only one there doing melee and I was only hitting for around 4K but the rest were heavy gunners. They didn‚Äôt even give the queen a chance to mutate. A lot of people were throwing up angry emotes because they couldn‚Äôt loot the queen.
---
Legacy weapons would still be the strongest by far , even if they raise the cap to 100. This would only hurt players that don't have legacies.
---
If you already have the traps built at your house. Then everything stays the same. Which is why you see some trap camps still have them. I‚Äôm pretty sure once they decide to move their camp, that‚Äôs when they will no longer be able to do it. 
---
Just like the fog machine you can only have one now. But the people that still haven‚Äôt moved their camp from way before, they have up to 3.
---
I have never done that Event.
---
YES! Considering there's not highlight/tag system, the least they can do is that.
---
But there is already for a couple of those. Enemy over there is- PVP emote (finger guns)
---
If I get nuclear briefcase and need codes, I'll usually repeat the Nuke emote followed by the gift emote.
---
Was it red rocket?
---
i imagine when the season pass is over it will level out
---
ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ"....you slimy one-shot wanker". Too funny M8.  I actually LOL 'd reading that.   Thank you ‚úåüèº
---
It‚Äôs all fun and games till people kill the SBQ with only tatoes
---
Eso's loot all in area would be so much more efficient.
---
Do it. There's zero risk and the grind is an insult.
---
I didn't exploit but i don't care if others do, If Bethesda can't fix their game its not my problem.
---
11am
---
Neither Chinese helmet nor SS helmet prevent water disease, even though they say they do. I have both and both didn't prevent me from disease while swimming. It's probably a bug, as you say...
---
Might be a bug for you. But seemed to work fore. Because when I went back to my original character I ranked up. And got the points as well
---
I hear it every time I fast travel and when notifications pop up.
---
Assholes that can affect your gameplay are a lot more annoying than assholes that cannot, just my opinion.
---
Yea man if you want to win throw all you‚Äôre run and gun knowledge away unless you have a crew...find a Bush get in the circle finish your daily and exit NW is terrible but it‚Äôs equally bad for everyone so you losing gunfights consistently is probably due to them having a box route and better perks
---
only if they close the door
---
He sleeps in his cubicle, under his desk.  The vending machine food is getting old, and sponge bathing in the employee restroom with paper towels isn't helping his BO.
---
He's starting to go a little feral, making it hard to assign new team members.  They keep asking for reassignment after he asserts his dominance...
---
More generally, at the end of events and dungeons.
---
Another huge problem with this game.
---
You get your overpowered end game gear through...completely random drops from literally any legendary enemy.
---
It doesnt even have to be legacy,find a junkies ffr minigun,put the accelerated barrel on it and shoot her.
---
They patched it out in 20.  
---
I have all but the emote (damned ants) and they don't even show up as "completed" anymore.
---
People on Oceanic servers don't talk english much so i avoid them because we cannot be social.. At least if there was a text chat we could be.. so as i said i prefer to play alone.
---
You‚Äôre right I am just a stubborn fool at this point tbh ... I need to just brew in my anger a little more until I let the power of the dark side flow through me
---
Then you shouldn't be in that team since it gives nothing to you.
---
The disparity in weapons is not based on anything that one wasteland would fix. The problem is a damage multiplier that was never nerfed+ one that wasn't intended to happen. It will make it so a player with a level 15 handmade is boosted to the same damage as a player with the same handmade but higher level. A level 5 legacy laser , is stronger than anything you can ever get to drop in game.
---
You got a bugged shotgun with a magical effect (each pellet does different damage - multiplicatively more vs each other). Normally each pellet does the same damage so in VATS you can see how much each pellet does...
---
So jus curious. Where are you located and on what platform?
---
Thank you.
---
Maybe because its sonic blasts are more of a disorient effect and its bite and claws do significantly more damage so it would land more. I never die to the queen during the queen fight only mobs that catch me when I'm focused on her because she's finally on the ground and I can land some bullets...
---
Personally think the standard T-65 looks kinda ugly myself.
---
If you can't afford the subscription, cancel it, dude.
---
Gross
---
Gave me some hope now at least.
---
tbh, wtf is a dragon like bat in this franchise? the post fo3 games have been generous to shy away from *true* flying enemies (tho cazadores were still a bitch), and thats been for a reason. flying enemies in video games suck. trash the sbq, bring on a giant supermutie behemoth fev fused with a giant excavator (a la nier: automata). wed have mobs, a super tanky endgame boss, action sequences, itd be a blast! but no. giant gassy bat. fine. sure.
---
personally i want robot camp allies, the human ones keep leaving doors open and using my workbenches when i need to use them.
---

Exactly, wait the 2 weeks then sub again, resetting th he renewal date
---
Is fed76 a website or a subreddit?
---
Those are rewards for having the membership during those months. If you got every outfit and reward that is available for fallout 1st just for buying 1 month  what's to stop anybody from waiting months and months and purchasing 1 month of fall out 1st to obtain all previous rewards?
---
 That would a be a big NO from me. You only get the rewards if you are a membership for that month.
---
I think there‚Äôs only one robot workbench in the main quest, and they‚Äôre not camp items... yet.
---
It's on their website - https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates

Well there is the scavenger colectron but he‚Äôs not really a Allie

Two shot explosive tatoes...

Meh, I kill a level 95 behemoth in less than 3 seconds as a non stealth heavy gunner, best defence....
---
you gain 100 score per 10K XP you gain, people must be grinding the XP extensively, joining public teams for the boost, sharing XP boosting items/cards (lunchboxes included), some people are out of work/school thanks to the Coronavirus and enjoying their time away from people by playing games. i know i would if i did not have to go to work.
---
Ty so much
---
she's a synth, like Deacon from FO4, they're gunna replace your char, and you'll never know!
---
Yes, once or twice recently she has fast traveled with me from camp and stayed with me until she is downed, then she gets up and runs all the way back to my camp.
---
max level?

Ah k could make sense and have done and seen both üëç

Where‚Äôs the deathclaw cave?

You don't sell legendaries to the purveyor you sell them to the legendary machines there's one across the room from the purveyor
---
Best thing you can do is contact Bethesda and explain everything thoroughly and ask if the can find a backlog of you characters and restore from that point.
---
Nobody at Bethesda actually plays the game so they have no clue on things like this. It‚Äôs so clear
---
having an item that could be permanently missed being basically a must-have item was something that needed to go. It wasn't listening to haters it was listing to people who didn't want to see the game go to shit.
---
I agree, but I can understand why people would want to show it off. It takes a long time to get all the gold to buy the full set.
---
I made a comment up above about people staggering her and almost as if punishment from Todd himself, this exact thing happened to me 20 minutes later.  She was stuck super high up too so damage fall off was huge.  
---
Feel bad for the level 80 who launched it.  He was in that silo for at least an hour and then got this.
---
Also, if you get a disease, you may need to share the perk again once you're cured.
---
yup. When I'm out on my own I let em attack and do whatever they want and just ignore them. If they land, I kill them. If they don't, they eventually go away. My kills are always within 10 feet. If an enemy is farther than that they get ignored. Beasts are always a hassle.
---
Commie-tron is more of a friend then any of the current allies.  i keep Sophia around mostly because of the visit from A.T.H.E.N.A
---
Omfg. I‚Äôm an idiot. Jesus. I‚Äôll be deleting this post shortly
---
Last I played I would headshot in VATS and damage numbers would show but not register as hits. Frustrating to die like that.
---
Hiya, quick questions, does the flamer heal more than the shish kebab? Can you quickly tap for little bursts of flame to preserve fuel?
---
And if you put the extra flame mod on the shish kebab does it affect the healing in any way?
---
I just got 1/3 friendly fire today and I tried healing some random person who was helping at a workshop and it said I was attacking her. Then I tried it on my brahmin in my camp and killed it in one shot. Will have to level it up and try it in a group but just wondering if I should bother trying to get a 90% weight reduced flamer.
---
Did you reply to the wrong person? Cos i didn't deny or oppose *any* of that. There were multiple reasons, and they aren't mutually exclusive.
---
This happened to me when the BETA started. Because my specs were technically under, Bethesda support was uninterested in helping solve the problem. Only when I (unrelatedly) reset my laptop a few months ago could I finally get past the log-in screen and play, so it might be a firewall issue on your end. Our specs are pretty similar, and my game runs practically perfectly. Hope this helps!
---
\*screenshots\*
---
From what ive heard and seem its a slippery slope ypure on right now. Sometimes Bethesda says that they "dont have the tools to restore a character". But on the other hand youve got some players that were affected by the stash hack a while ago, and they have had there entire accounts restored. Even though the "restoration" was simply a roll back to a time before the hack/glitches were live. 
---
Sorry to if its not the news you wanted to hear.. But unfortunately thats how Bethesda chooses to handle these situations.
---
Well the multi coloured skins work on the T-65 as well.
---
Awesome, thankyou!
---
Fuuuuuuuckkkkk.
---
Lol you dork
---
1st has had content added to it every month since it started.  If you want special gear, you have to pay the special price.  If you missed it, that's on you.  Sorry 'bout your luck.
---
And no. They should not bring anything back that has been released for 1st "members".  That's the whole point of this type of subscription/club.  To get things that others don't want to pay for. It would take away the value of those items if just anybody could pick up all previously released items, whenever they felt like it, and then cancel their 1st sub. 
---
Maybe in the future, when they stop adding items to the 1st members, they will give it all away in an atomic shop bundle.  And consider yourself lucky if it's under 3k atoms.
---
the username fits  lol
---
I totally don‚Äôt sell my stuff. I‚Äôm a massive hoarder of literally everything. But my stash is full and there‚Äôs nothing I can move to scrap box, so gotta get rid of something
---
Why feel bad? That's the point of taking workshops.
---
misspoke - meant toon above 50
---
thanks for the information!
---
Still a dork lol

Pls where is it located. I need an Assaultron
---
^this.  Extensive grinding.
---
It's easy to test if you need proof. Berry mentats. It's small but calculable. 2% per intelligence point.
---
Super easy, you just need another person. The more the better. Wish I had people to do it on PC!
---
Go in with a friend. Click an ultracite vein, which will spawn scorched. Leave the cavern then return, leaving a person inside. When you come back in, you can click on that node and you can't loot it, but it will still spawn tons of scorched. You can only click one at a time though so it's not worth doing multiple nodes. However, each person in the group can do it so with 4 people you can get 40-60 spawns each time.
---
Bro, freaking Tato bombs
---
It is easy to level if you have the right group. First all of the sleeping and food buffs, team mate sharing l3 of inspirational. Start enclave path at level 3 friends carry you through the process, have friends  level qpp+ spawn in a westtek you tag each mutant, they kill them, kill the 10 legendary creatures, launch nukes about level 20, etc. It is easy to level without cheats with friends. Do not assume that everyone uses hacks as others suggested. Last double xp weekend I took a toon from the vault to over 50.
---
To double down on my previous example: 
---
"I lived so long and bought a lot of illegal drugs, but I only snitched on dealers that illegaly smuggled their illegal drugs into the country." 
---
Do you realize how stupid that sounds?

Fallout 76 Glitches | [Patch 20!!] Godmode, XP Glitch, Cap Glitch, And Max Special Points https://youtu.be/zd9ldyMymeA
---
Enjoy my friend. If you need more help leave a comment.
---
idk it just felt wrong lol im usually not the pvp type. Its the first time I killed someone outside of NW.
---
That's awesome, you're a monster! 
---
I have a day off from work in a few weeks, I'm hoping to get a nice 4-6hr block to shooting things in the face.
---
You're probably OK. Make good use of teams as well as as much xp/intelligence bisting things as you can.
---
The NW challenges give 250 score points, which you can make up by doing a bit extra repeatables. 
---
That said, don't discount doing them altogether. Some you can do very easily. For example there was one which involved placing camp 3 times. Real simple - join game and once you start just play camp down 3 ti.es from where you are. Job done. After that doesn't matter if you get killed in 1st minute or survive till end. 
---
I'm not a huge NW fan, and will likely skip lots of challenges for it - especially if they involve other players. But I will do some that are easily achieved.
---
Oh totally. I‚Äôm only on today to sell my stuff and get the ammo workshop. Then I‚Äôll just be sitting and grading papers while my shotgun shells are made
---
Most of them do, yes. However, some perks, like Team Medic, only apply to your "nearby" team members. You can still share it, but only team members who are close together will benefit.
---
What bugs you running into?
---
PS4 friend!
---
i am not talking about char lvl, i am talking about season lvl.
---
If you learn to spell on your own, you don't need Austin correct!
---
How much you want for 'em?
---
Yep I must've swapped it around in my head. The Chinese Stealth Helmet is bugged, but the Marine Tactical Helmet is definitely preventing waterborne disease.
---
I crafted both, let my character become starving and dehydrated, and took a RadAway.  
---
With the Chinese Stealth Helmet, I still received the tooltip every few seconds saying I was at risk and eventually I caught parasites.  
---
I cured the parasites, and equipped the Marine Tactical Mask. So far it has been 20 minute under the exact same conditions, and I have received neither tooltip nor disease.
---
Just posting to clarify, and also thought you might be interested.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it just part of a quest line and can‚Äôt be used again.
---
Or just do this
---
Not to mention every single person blasting away while she‚Äôs in the air wasting ammo making her aggro so she won‚Äôt land. She absolutely will land if you leave her alone and just pop her a few times. Tell that to server full of people in power armor with heavy guns. It‚Äôs a fun group event but mostly why I solo her most of the time.
---
You doing NW stuff? I was thinking of trying, to see if it's an efficient SCORE return method.
---
there's already yes (thumbs up) no (down) and i dont know (???)
---
may have
---
Sorry, misread.
---
I get where you are coming from but first I would like them to remove hacked weapons.
---
I‚Äôve always been confused though when people say it‚Äôs too easy when they use god tier kit. If you want to make it harder why not do it yourself. Don‚Äôt use mutations, playthrough limiting yourself to a certain weapon, don‚Äôt use legendaries, don‚Äôt play bloodied/junkies etc.
---
They still get the event reward even if they stand there like numpties.
---
The same happens to me, I create a construction team and nobody joins
---
Just remember the machines only have so many scrip so you can't sell all of em. It's 150 scrip per day so you might need multiple days depending how much you need to get rid of
---
Junkies for more damage. People in PA tend to be really weak anyway.
---
Funnily enough, the marine helmet does not state it gives those buffs :)
---
Yea then after the next update they could nerf them
---
How high is your INT?  That is what drives XP gain.  Mine is about 43 when I have all my buffs in order.  It isn't worth even trying to do the exploit.  43 will get you plenty of XP quickly.  Unyielding, shielded vault suit, plus buffs like cranberry food and berry mentats.
---
Watched the video but I don't understand how to trigger the damage bug. Or how the hell I would get 500 Nuka crans üòÇ
---
Yup. I‚Äôll have to come back next weekend apparently lol
---
Yep, same.
---
Bethesda can‚Äôt get rid of hacked weapons. There‚Äôs still a method to this day to create new ones. This game is a joke lol
---
Do this
---
Thank ya sir
---
This will probably happen when the secret service underarmor gets linings. Which is to say that I'm still pissed I wasted bullion on that, thinking it was endgame level underarmour when it's not even "been out of the vault for a few levels" underarmour. .
---
You can't build them
---
Well before the half assed patch Bethesda did you could get the damage bug by killing your self. Now, it only works if another player kills you. 
---
And for the cranberries you gotta get them duped lol, or just get lunchboxes or cranberry relish since in godmode every aid item stacks. So lunchboxes would be insane for XP gain
---
Increases by 160 per level, caps out at level 50000
---
Costs less to license the music and do a cover than it does to license the original recording.
---
robot work benches are not in game, it exists as a model in the Lying Lowe questline near the end. it has a blood splattered screen due to the story of the quest. it cannot be used.. id LOVE to gave more bots at my camp. Commie-tron is a good friend, but whats wrong with more bots?
---
Specifically the [Marine Tactical Helmet](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Marine_tactical_helmet_(Fallout_76)) - *not* the Marine Helmet from the Mole Miner event. It has the exact same item description as the Chinese Stealth Helmet.
---
You didn't reply to /u/Fallout4Addict, you replied to your own post
---
aside from people who have found a glitch. using a fully bonded group with a bobblehead leader, cranberry relish, brain soup, fully rested xp, Inspirational perk card and a lunch box you can healthly gain over 2k xp on some enemys around the map and over 600xp a pop on super Mutants. over 400xp on Ghouls over 1k on scorchbeasts.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt make sense though, would it?
---
If I have a suit of light bending camouflage, and then I put clothes *over* it, the camouflage would be covered by visible clothing. 
---
Think of H.G. Wells *The Invisible Man*. He had no CSA, but was himself invisible when naked. When he needed to be seen, he would get dressed, because people could see his clothes.
---
My argument is that when Fo1st started there was nothing for veteran players to do that we hadn't done in the previous year. If you enjoyed the absence of content during the release of 1st and wastelanders then good on you, welcome to the game. But there was nothing released in that time gap that made old players feel the need to join back. If you want to talk about fair that discussion was thrown out the window when the game was released and not even 2 weeks later people were buying it at half price.
---

---
Hmm... I actually was crafting one to test a few days ago and I could swear it doesn't say anything... I'll login after the daily reset and check again üòõ
---
They said they fixed it early last year. Then they had reports a day later of it still happening. Since then, they've been ignoring it and pretending it's fixed. So not much of a chance it'll ever get addressed
---
If you don't care, it's not your problem. In fact, it's no one's problem that someone has already finished the run. It only hurts Bethesda.
---
What do you mean?  My daily challenges yesterday refreshed while I was playing.
---
I was planning on immediately myself, now I'm wondering if that's safe or not. If no one knows, I'll try at five after and post again with results. I really do love the absurdity of this situation.
---
Linings were added with Patch 20!

Costs 200 gold bullion for the Shielded Lining plan, and the stats are...

You must be on pc. The only time those weapons appear is when a 3rd party software hack is used. We don‚Äôt have those on consoles.
---
Grafton: Sold by¬†vendor bot Greg.
---
Harpers Ferry: Sold by¬†vendor bot Wallace.
---
Watoga station: Sold by¬†Watoga vendor bot.
---
The Whitespring Resort: Sold by some of the faction vendors: the¬†Free States vendor¬†and the¬†Shopping mall vendor.
---
They made it where vendors sell them at any level iirc
---
Experience exploit. If you did every daily/weekly and even the nuclear winter dailies so far, you'd still need over a dozen million exp to have it right now. Even the queen farmers aren't going to be getting that legitimately in 4 days
---
I usually solo it. It's not easy but it is possible.
---
Monster mashed tatoes
---
It‚Äôs not level locked and is available at vendors. I don‚Äôt know if the normal faction vendors have it but I saw graham did yesterday
---
Some of the Free States bunkers would be cool places to live.
---
Some pictures make them look like tomato flavored potatoes that grow on bushes.
---
Need a lore check.
---
Bless you. If it was in the notes, I missed it somehow, but I know what I'll be doing now, next time I hop on 76.
---
Hooooooly moly that was close. Read your comment and logged out with 1 minute to spare! üòÖ  
---
Thanks haha
---
From what I‚Äôve heard, support staff can‚Äôt restore characters. Only developers can. I‚Äôve never had to use the support system. But see if you can find a ‚Äúbug report‚Äù and just also try reporting that you logged on and all your characters were gone. Don‚Äôt even mention the hacking.
---
Enjoy! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Why are you gay?
---
Bruh, bethesda barely banned anybody during past dupe waves. People with millions of nuka grapes/quantums or 10 of the same bloodied explosive handmade got away clean. There are still hundreds of hacked weapons on PC like handmades with beam splitters or miniguns with MIRV barrels that have not been removed and their owners not banned, even though it would be laughably easy to track something like that
---
Dodged a bullet there buddy üòÇ
---
I got a dastardly idea from this post. So you know how tomatos usually are depicted to stick to things when thrown? I think we may have the basis of a sticky explosive. Sure there could be a harmless version, but imagine popping off a super mutant head just cause you nailed them in the face with your tatoe sticky grenade.
---
So I‚Äôm level 15. Can I just server hop near Greg to possibly find it then?
---
Some of these flaws are so obvious, even someone who never touched a videogame should realize them. But Bethesda don't.
---
That's unexplainable to me
---
They do but there's a pretty widespread issue with the challenges autocompletiing and not being completable with being online during the rest. 
---
As to the OP, I usually log in right after and always been fine so far. just give it 5 mins if you like.
---
I just logged in at 2 mins after and I didn't lose any dailies ü§∑

She landed on the fence yesterday while I was there. That‚Äôll scare the crap out of the wire walkers
---
Aye. gonna cost you aboot 1800 caps depending on charisma and all that
---
Honestly, I agree, pain in the ass to get hits in and i prefer to fire through events not spend 20 minutes doing it when I could get more notes and Legendaries firing through Riding Shotgun then whatever event pops up during it
---
Should be in the vendor, whitespring usually has that plan but it isnt cheap,1k~3k if you have hard bargain
---
Own it man. I spent three nuclear winter matches figuring out how to place my camp for the daily. We all have our moments
---
That‚Äôs fine with me. Iv just been saving for this plan. I used to play on ps4 but recently picked up on steam so it was my go to weapon from the start. I just love rifle builds.
---
I‚Äôd love more peeps at my camp. They dint even have to give me quests. But provide defense or do repairs or whatever. 
---
It could be part of the end reward for different quests to help npcs
---
They did when N.W. first launched. But, now, you can find them on the wiki.
---
They need to advertise the N.W. events better, and earlier.
---
In fo4
---
Yeah it annoys me to no end when they try to force you play that shit mode.
---
 Some of them are easy to do though without even having to play a full match.
---
Use 3 stim packs in nw- find 3 stims and run into the fire to use them- log out
---
Lvl up in nw- if you been playing a while you most likely have unopened packs from a bug on one of your characters, use them for xp. Or bushwhack on a team.
---
Build 3 camps - simple enough, build 3 - log out
---
Choosing team mode gives you 3 less people trying to kill you as well.
---
Lmao that wasn't even the guy I was expecting. Still boggles my mind when I see this; the stuff is easily available online, the cheaters even show their profile info, they often have fallout 1st subs, and they can get away with teaching people how to cheat for over a year. At this point it's like bethesda wants them to be around
---
Correct. My problem is that there's no logical reason to not be able to wear underarmor with it.
---
Or bulkable to sell like scrap.
---
That‚Äôs all they have do to stay at my camp. Go around shutting doors. Nothing else.
---
Battlepasses are never designed to add gameplay elements, just incentive to play. No glitches in the game is a free for all, not even encouraing. Mentioned in ToS:
---
*"You agree not to access, receive, play or use any Service to:*   
---
*Promote, upload, transmit, encourage or take part in any activity involving hacking, cracking, phishing, taking advantage of exploits or cheats and/or distribution of counterfeit software and/or Virtual Currency or virtual items."*
---
If you‚Äôre logged in when they reset at 12pm eastern some will autocomplete with no reward. At this point it‚Äôs a widely reported bug and Bethesda needs to do something to fix it ASAP.
---
Five after, seems fine.
---
I wish but Bethesda will never do anything about it
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault\_51](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_51)
---
It looks like if you're logged in when the dailies reset, if the challenge is the same as yesterday, it remains completed.
---
https://i.imgur.com/KEF8PVq.png
---
Note that all of the dailies that are listed as "completed" are the ones that are the same as the ones from yesterday.
---
it's just a rumor, I'm skeptical, it would be pretty asinine of them to put something we worked so hard for on the atom shop, but I'm not as jaded as many here.
---
I didn‚Äôt even get the level up or complete 5 challenge daily today
---
With food rest and lunchboxes this morning I was getting around 400 xp for a scorched conqueror, around 700 for a big super mutant, over 900 for a glowing mirelurk hunter!? And around 1500 to 2k for things like scorchbeasts. Do a few scorched earth, line in the sand and guided meditation and that score soon stacks up. I'm running more than one account and have hit level 20 twice so I'm sure someone focusing on one account could be way further ahead.
---
3 days in a row, it does not affected me, I played in Adventure mode.
---
Yesterday, I was hitted by this bug.
---
Today, I do not dare to enter right now...
---
yep i lost out on 1000 score because of this shit
---
If you where on the x-box. It was me I personally had fun. It helped cut up the day.
---
Submit a ticket and get your atoms back.
---
Perhaps this is true, but wearing S.S. armor under clothing is somehow explainable?
---
Yea if your on xbox I'm with ya I'll take more overall exp any day
---
I don't quite understand your logic. If I don't see weapons being duped, why should I doubt them and the people who sell them, so I only focus on the facts I see. Even if RMT breaks the rules of the game, what does that have to do with reporting a bug?
---
It‚Äôs a catsuit. It‚Äôs form fitting by design. 
---
If you want to be fashionable and wear a snazzy little number on your murder journey, then the garment meant to render you impossible for others to see might not be the best choice for you.
---
\^THIS.   
---
What kills me the most is that this was not ONLY done already, but done in their own property. They could flagrantly copy it well within their rights, being as absolutely lazy about it as possible.
---
How are players players with lack of intelligence supposed to know, that they should aim for more intelligence?
---
My English is not very good, if my understanding is not correct, forgive me
---
u have to log out before it resets lmao
---
I have some trees and bushes that were from the atom shop. So you are correct.
---
I've done it solo many times but sadly with only 1 creature alive
---
Don't be logged on when it resets
---
A summon command would be great for such events, and if people didn‚Äôt attend in the group they could be booted
---
The current event rewards for halloween and xmas are an accident, or are you talking about the regulat level up ones right now?
---
If this keep happening I can't be bothered with the seasons anymore.
---
It‚Äòs Fallout!
---
You can wear any outfit over the biggest armor. Chameleon armor is working, too.
---
So what is your problem, peeps? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Especially if you read the fine print and the event team bonus only works on public events not all events
---
thats a lot , get  maybe 250xp for a mutant
---
It's not the jedi way!
---
I didn‚Äôt even get the option of the gold star or level up challenge today...  that‚Äôs damn odd (ps4)
---
Wow 5 days old and only 500 upvotes compared to the other patch notes .
---
I'm always giving away plans, friend me and I'll hook you up on my next batch.
---
An easy way to get a lot of base plans quickly is to take workshops, they are given as a reward. Badger0101
---
They definitely *look* like tomatoes in 76. So maybe the other way around?
---
Yikes. Junk is everywhere. It is easy to get more if you need it. Bulk some of that and sell it to robot vendors. 
---
Also, set up your vending machines. You don't have to bulk to sell your scrap there. You can sell them as scrap. I make most of my caps selling scrap. 
---
Here are my usual prices for scrap:
---
10 caps each:
---
Ballistic Fiber
---
5 caps each:
---
Screws, Ultracite 
---
3 caps each:
---
Aluminum, Adhesive, Copper, Lead, Springs
---
1 cap each:
---
Gears, Steel
---
Most of the other scrap doesn't sell. So bulk that and sell it to a robot. 
---
Most of the scrap I keep less than 25 units in my stash, because unless you are doing something specific like building a new camp, things like concrete or glass aren't useful. There are a couple things I keep around 50 units of: leather, rubber, bone shards, few other things, because I have weapons and armor that need those for repairs. The only things that I let get over 100 are: Acid, Lead, Copper, Aluminum, Adhesive, Steel, because I need those for making bullets, breaking down ore to make bullets, and repairing weapons/armor. 
---
As a long time player of Bethesda games (Fallout and TES) I am used to taking everything I can, so I totally understand how having to live with limited storage can be tough, but it is totally doable. 
---
Eventually, when your stash is full of cool legendary weapons that you aren't using, but just can't bring yourself to sell or scrip, then you will need to start at least 1 alternate character to use as storage. My advice there is have your alt(s) camp in the same spot as your main somewhere near a world container with no weight limit so you can transfer stuff between characters. You will need a reliable friend on the server so you can switch characters and rejoin the same server to transfer gear, but I haven't had any major issues with that.
---
What would prevent you from putting clothes on top of the *Secret Service* armor? (SS as an abbreviation for this is in very bad taste, no?)
---
Perhaps it should look a little bulkier when you wear clothes over armor, but there‚Äôs no reason I can think of to preclude the wearing of layers over ballistic armor. It would not nullify the effect like it does with the CSA.
---
Eh, there would be no reason to add primers and casings and the like to the mix. You can already craft ammo from scratch with just lead/steel/gunpowder. Reversing it to have ammo yield those same components when broken down would be so easy. All the other crafting systems in the game work this way, so I can't figure out why they have this ridiculous machine instead.
---
So what about chameleon armour? Or the fact that the gun in your hand also disappears when your suit is invisible? I don't think there is any specific logic applied. I vote clothes too, I love the CSA, but also like looking good.
---
Capture workshops. Don't defend workshop. Retake worskshop. Rinse and repeat.
---
Xp, loot, plans as rewards x 2
---
You'll be swimming in plans in no time.
---
Well this here is some grade a baloney! Goddammit! Guess I am screwed today then.
---
I wouldn't play for the 250 points, but you also get Halloween and Christmas rewards at the moment. So, points for legendary run, outfits and weapon skins plus the usual nuclear winter rewards...it is very rewarding at the moment.
---
The dailies have already reset, the bug happens when you are in the game and the dailies reset.  
---
I've always made a habit of logging out around reset time for about 20 minutes to be sure
---
I use about 600 cryo cells per sbq fight
---
When you start a new character for this, you can also do the Thirst Things First Quest. You have the chance to get a rare outfit!
---
Did not know this thanks.  I use this perk and frequent this event. Much appreciated
---
I hate that saying, no, beauty is not pain, you are just willing to subject yourself to obscene measures to try and appear as such.
---
If you leave it out, it will recall to you. So you have you to store it on you or store it in your stash.
---
Foremost it would be the developers task to create challenging opportunities for high end characters. All your suggestions are nice, but players restricting themselves to feel challenged is by no stretch of the imagination a substitute for a game doing that for them.
---
I actually made my last piece of Strangler Heart armor this weekend and the challenge reward popped up. I'm wondering if they just hid them from the list instead of removing them. I had that challenge marked before update 20 and I got all the plans in the vault, I just spent my vault steel grinding solar armor and only just finished my strangler heart armor after I got the solar armor I liked.
---
Oh I recently noticed that it notifies you as exactly what you said, thanks anyway!

lmg shouldnt exist. its a high rof weapon (and high af at that) using ammo from a "slower weapons" pool. .308 is used in bolt action rifles and bigger assault rifles, they just use less ammo by design. the ability to make .308 at the same rate as 5mm would give rifle go pew pew users a glut of ammo. .50 is already kind of bridging that gap (hence you get less units per batch relative to 5mm). 5mm only works in high rof weapons, so you get more per batch. the lmg is acting as a weaker .50 cal mg, but the ammo is *more* expensive. i enjoy the lmg, but like the flamer, its just too ammo expensive.
---
You make a good point about guns; indeed, I wear the CSA, but also the Mothman gas mask, the Old Fisherman‚Äôs Hat, and the Prisoner‚Äôs Collar; all of that should ostensibly remain visible but doesn‚Äôt.
---
No one wants anyone‚Äôs LIFE ended.
---
Yup
---
I had this as a _Daily_ SCORE challenge.  Gave up once I found this thread.
---
Interesting, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve crafted everything at this point as I was only waiting on the gold for the plans. It‚Äôs definitely not on my list after several relies though and I don‚Äôt have the emote :( I appreciate the info though I‚Äôll probably contact support.
---
And here I thought it was gonna be a joke about nocturnal rolls. Bravo!
---
It feels like blackface. I, myself, am Native American/First Nations, I have a dual citizenship. I'm offended on nobodies behalf but myself. All I stated was it was in poor taste. Do with that information what you want.
---
I would throw them at the vault 76 after each update in disapproval
---
It's deleted now what did he say?
---
Start a new character!
---
But not always. I was online 3 days in a row at reset time, and I was not bugged, but I got the bug yesterday.
---
So, something is realy broken :(
---
Shit whTs the glitch i dont want to lose my score
---
that sounds more like it. card packs? 150 atoms? wack.
---
You basically have to do an extra 30k xp in adventure to cover it but nobody can say for certain how hard a grind this will all be. A lot of people have just been overreacting without all the information. For what it's worth a lot of the NW challenges require very little effort or playing that mode so it might be worth at least doing the easy ones.
---
FYI plans AREN'T level locked anymore. All plans are now static to their specific vendors.
---
Ps4 just across from top of the world. With both characters.
---
Sublimt a ticket. A few days back i accidentally bought the Fly Boy bundle instead of the Fly Boy outfit, I got 400 atoms back AND got to keep the items from the bundle. It all got resolved within 12 hours
---
Thanks for the help. I‚Äôll try Welch to see if it‚Äôs there.
---
It just happened to me just now. Yesterday I was logged in when the dailies reset, but there was no problem.
---
Just now I was logged in when they reset, now 4/7 of the dailies are already complete, one of which is the "complete 5 challenges" challenge. Meh.
---
They know their game is dead so they need all the players they can get. If anything, letting people continue to show off all these glitches will keep people playing lol. It makes this dumb game less boring
---
If they have chat muted then they wouldn‚Äôt hear it. I enjoy played mic‚Äôd up so it isn‚Äôt an issue for me. My aforementioned buddy does not.
---
Didn‚Äôt think of checking there. Would be easier since all the faction vendors are at one place.
---
its a song dude
---
Thanks for the advice. I‚Äôll stop off at Camden and Welch as well.
---
It was a holiday weekend, hoping Adrenaline gets a hot fix on Tuesday.
---
This isn't the issue, because I was on with a full group, all of us just standing around, three people had theirs reset fine and my other friend had his bug out and auto complete
---
Has not affected me yet. You could just power the repeatable out, not too hard plus it's stuff you would of been doing otherwise.
---
Yup I agree, I checked using a score calculator and a normal one and I could complete the pass in 65 days from now and I can buy 55 levels with the atoms I have on my account from just daily and weekly challenges that I stored up
---
And there could be a Pipe Tato Launcher. It could work similar to the 44 Grenade Launcher or be a heavy class weapon like the missile launcher or the fat-man.
---
You can only rank up with Atoms starting third week :)
---
ive noticed in xbox, most multiplayer games dont do lobbies. you just get randomly thrown into a map. no ping, ppl on server, other contextual info. wuddup wit dat?
---
Murphy is laughing right now.
---
&gt;me: throws harmless tato at random
---
also me: falls through the scenery and CTD.
---
Doesn't mean it isn't the issue, just means it didn't effect everyone. If it truly effected everyone it would have been addressed already.
---
Maybe because futuristic 50's era had more decency?ü§î
---
Noted üòò
---
But still people kill people all the time.
---
Is he on your friend list?
---
smh
---
Yeah I was surprised because they removed it from the list. I haven't checked if I actually got the icon or not, but I definitely had the pop-up. Did you make a mask too? Its possible you need the mask.
---
Maybe not Vault 51, since that kind of holds a lore purpose in Nuclear Winter...
---
But reopening 76 for exactly this would be great. Could even add "interior camp/house rooms" that people have been asking for.
---
Then don't hide end game skins behind 80+ ranks of this bullshit and take away sever thousand monthly atoms to do so
---
No, he‚Äôs not on my friend list
---
Yeah I don't wear the mask either. I do understand why you can't use outfits over the top, but with all the other stuff that doesn't make sense I don't think it'd hurt. I hate looking like everyone else while I'm wearing it!
---
There's a Bloodied Walking Cane, I think it was even Swing Speed, that I hold onto in the theory that some day, I'll do an old man build and it would be his signature weapon.
---
And a similar gold club, for whenever he decides to re-enact the pivotal scene in BioShock.
---
There is another reddit for this, I dont think we are supposed to mention it on here. Look at (m)(a)(r)(k)(e)(t)76, obviously not with the parentheses.
---
Wrong sub
---
Switch to Team Only for your private world. By default it will allow anyone on your friends list to join your private session unless you tell it not too.
---
Yea I did and I was watching and waiting for the pop up and was so disheartened when it didn‚Äôt come
---
Emotes will never be a good way to communicate and if they actually read player feedback they'd just see this and think "fuck yea they want us to add more crap to the atom shop". Then again if you actually ask for text chat that actually fixes this issue the mods would just remove the post for being a repeat, but this suggestion apparently isnt.
---
It's frustrating that this is still a problem at all.
---
While I don't know the PS4's interface it, on the front screen, when you choose Private World, there's an option that toggles between "All Friends" and "Team Only."  
---
If "All Friends" is on (which it is by default) then anyone on your Friend's List can join your world.  
---
That person was presumably on your list, so they were able to do that.
---
if dropped anyone can take it, and it is lost forever if you leave servers. if deployed it will return after a timer, or when you fast travel/disconnect
---
Gotta wait for patch 21 for that, you know the patch in 2021
---
Hey man, they don't allow trade posts on this sub, but there's another sub for that where you might have better luck.
---
I would link it for you, but unfortunately, they also will not allow that, for reasons beyond my comprehension. But if you want to search it, it rhymes with "farket76"
---
I cant think of a worse fruit
---
If you‚Äôre logged in when the daily challenges reset some challenges will be pre-completed and award no score. Fuck me, right?
---
thats nice, good for you, try a trading subreddit.
---
bruh i hate to be that guy but you could send that my way on xbox babycity3318, level 69 haven‚Äôt had any luck with legendary draws
---
Then i just wont do daily challenges. Oh yeah
---
Will do, cheers!
---
I suspect they might hotfix Adrenaline, but it'll probably be on Thursday or something.  Or the following Tuesday, if they decide to wrap more things into the hotfix.
---
The problem is the type is kinda vague. If we could set an agenda "Nuke Run" or "Control all Workshops" that would help.  But Bethesda doesn't think we can type.
---
I‚Äôll definitely start doing that, thank you!
---
Oh absolutely there should be more to do at end game I totally agree. My suggestion was since there isn‚Äôt and hasn‚Äôt been for a while there are other ways to do it. Waiting for beth to add endgame content could take a while so I enjoy finding ways other than actual content to make things interesting
---
Pretty nice, any atom shop stuff? Or is this all vanilla? Most of the fancy houses I see have atleast some stuff from the shop and I like to see creativity without it for us plebs without atoms.
---
If you are already level 50+ you aremaybe able to get the perk already, if you are not i can share it if on PC, dont level up this perk if - than 50 except if you need 2 more Intel
---
Do you have it set to allow friends to join?
---
I've seen this sort of mess before..... on Firestorm WoW private servers.....
---
I've made the comparison because the level of bugs, but back when their Legion server was still progressing people could randomly lose legendary gear pieces, and to get them back I had to be a piece of shit to the support heckling them every day as they lied to my face saying they couldnt do anything about it, till magically after long enough of my heckling they would tell me they are looking into it and another few days to a week later my friends would get their gear back.
---
Obviously cant do the same here but its astounding the similarities between this game and a god damn super buggy private WoW server service.
---
it doesn't always happen, but so far when it does happen is during reset. So to be safe, log off about 10 minutes till reset and then log back on about 5 or 10 minutes after.  
---
I have never seen the bug happen any other time besides during reset
---
&gt;Just now I was logged in when they reset, now 4/7 of the dailies are already complete, one of which is the "complete 5 challenges" challenge. Meh.
---
The exact same thing happened to me. I have 4/7 completed including the gold star for completing 5. Now I know.
---
Bloodied Shovel.
---
I mean, it works nicely but it's slow as hell. I keep it on a display rack on the wall of my cabin in the woods camp specifically for the Buried with Honor daily. I also use it to beat the mongrels that always spawn at the gravesite.
---
I've also gotten weightless walking cane. I keep it because it weighs 0.2lbs.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt bet your life...
---
yeah I logged in 5 minutes before they reset and 4 of them were completed for me, so I am SOL for today. There goes another 1000 I will never be able to get.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing, I switched over to an Int/XP build and holy shit does it make a difference.
---
I‚Äôm usually hovering around ~40 int which isn‚Äôt even too wild, and I‚Äôm able to complete the repeatable 5 times during one 10 min match of Rad Rumble. I‚Äôm at rank 25 right now, will likely hit 27 with today‚Äôs dailies.
---
Add in people being smart with Lunchboxes and I can totally fathom being in the 30s/40s
---
I GAMBA IT
---
just logout before reset, and log back on. It's just one time a day.
---
&amp; radicool (amazing for 1 perk point)
---
Some guy buildt his camp right were the Sq fight happens. All it did was prevent her from landing the turrets are pretty much useless
---
You seem to not have grasped the situation completely yet. Everyone wants that, Bethesda included. The problem is that their tool kits are not able to intervene  with the game and the items in a sufficient way to get rid of all the unwarranted stuff specifically. Of course they can delete items, but they have no way to tell, where those come from originally - whether those are earned or cheated. So whenever they do that it would be based on a rough estimation of the situation they want to adress. That raises a huge justification problem, cause they may guess right in most cases, but they have no evidence against players individually. And it would come down to how many potentially innocent players Bethesda would be willing to cut in the process of getting rid of godly equipment.
---
I wonder if this is only console specific.  I‚Äôm on PC and I had one autocomplete while I was in the loading screen, but the score also went up accordingly.
---
I think the time of reset has something to do with daylight savings time. I also live in the USA central time zone and the reset definitely was 10 am, but now it is at 11 am. The whole spring forward fall back time thing kind of makes sense.
---
its exactly what i am saying with the reloading, it  happened after
---
I have a question though, I usually leave my tent near that location, does that cause a problem for other players? I don't really understand the mechanics here so I'm not sure if I'm messing up everyone else's game when I do that.
---
Don‚Äôt drop it. Unlike 4, 76 lets you store it in your inventory. Weighs 10 lb
---
I would love task-based teams. Like "Let's Run This Silo" or "Let's Raid this Vault". If those kind of things existed, I would turn my voice chat back on and join those kind of things regularly.
---
It would also be an awesome way to help first-timers though some of those events!
---
Hmm, yeah there's definitely some atom shop stuff, but I'd say the vast majority is vanilla.  I think that glow in the dark map in the workshop was one, and the flooring + walls are mostly (if not all) atom shop I believe.  A lot of the furniture and decorations are vanilla though, definitely something anyone could build.
---
No. You can buy anytime.
---
Thank you üòä but I'm on ps4 but its good to know that perk is available I'm level 18 whats the best way to level up I heard üëÇ its quite rapid then slows down once ypu plato at a certain level
---
It's not in the game yet.
---
it's not out yet. It'll be released in august, i believe
---
The pool is fairly limited though.  I generally just get the most simple camp plans and lots of duplicates from workshops.
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more
---
I'm at 565 with 3 pieces of SS armor and underarmor on my heavy build.
---
No but I did come across the settler wanderer in her normal clothes just milling around like I could recruit her on the way to foundation - yet she is already at my camp in a custom outfit. Confused me.
---
Thanks :)
---
I had more fun that I thought building my camp (didn't personally do much building in FO4, just sim settlements) and visiting others, lots of cool stuff on display :)
---
Hope I see your place someday in game.
---
Jesus that‚Äôs so stupid. They advertised it with the new update :/
---
I shredded a level 80 legendary sheepsquanch with one yesterday as level 53.  So, nope.
---
Would really like a "no thanks" emote. I'm not into person to person trading and would really like a way to tell people when they approach me to trade. Now I just walk away; I'm sure most people must think I'm either a jerk or confused/incompetent. It's not that it bothers me what others think but would be nice to have a way to politely decline.
---
No they did not
---
placebo
---
It cloaks guns and backpacks as well as helmets that aren't attached so it just producing a field around the wearer that isn't inhibited by cloth would work.
---
That would be awesome to see. Get those darn mutans off your lawn with some style and a notable amount of savagery.
---
Pretty sure it was in the trailer but okay
---
Ghoul-Slaying Gamma Gun
---
If you know it's happening, and you stay logged in at that time, you are as much at fault as the developers.  Seriously, log out at 11:45, go for a walk, come back and log back in.  Simple solution.
---
You get can get a total of 1500 atoms by doing the battle pass. That‚Äôs it.
---
Everywhere... just vats around. Any AI creature works. Ghouls, bugs, mirelurks, etc
---
&gt;And guess what? I could relate to the characters in FO4. The storyline had me hooked, wanting more, staying up for 50, 60 hell even up to 80 hours at a time because I was so engrossed in the lore
---
Tbh I kind of like the whole concept of everybody being basically dead and piecing together their lives from records, although it doesn‚Äôt really feel as cohesive or engaging in practice. The rest I agree with like 99% unfortunately
---
It originally was, but they announced they‚Äôd be delaying it until at least patch 21.
---
I've noticed when doing Line in the Sand that sometimes, I simply stop getting XP.  I still see the damage numbers, but I get no credit for killing anything until I go elsewhere.
---
But what you describe sounds more like the damage rubberbanding issue, which happens on a lot of weapons now.  The faster firing the weapon, the worse it is.
---
You get Atoms as rewards from the legendary run.
---
the summer trailer had stuff from updates 20-22, and the latest into the vault post on the website has a roadmap of july-september content
---
That‚Äôs the thing is if you always choose to give up and not to do the tedious difficult challenges in most any game you‚Äôll never unlock top tier rewards so if you‚Äôre good with less content good for you but I‚Äôll keep putting in work for new content and rewards
---
Yes, bugged
---
being a smarty makes all the difference in the world
---
That is a trailer for the summer. Not for patch 20. Watch again.
---
You would think a screenshot of that on a ticket would be enough for them to act.. somehow.  I just remembered to log out, but haven't logged back in to look yet.  Sorry for your (and everyone else hit by that bugs) loss üòï.
---
Bloodied builds
---
Same! When they first showed it off, I was worried it'd be super limited, or temporary.  Who would've thought the main drive for me would've been collecting plans and building the "perfect home".
---
Likewise!
---
That‚Äôs pretty rich. Must be nice to have enough free time you can keep track of that every day.
---
Lotta things higher level/older players take for granted keep coming up and getting asked recently, especially in relation to these challenges. I thought I'd give a little tip for those people who may come looking for a quick way to do this. There are plenty places you could do it, but this is probably the easiest and most efficient.
---
Honestly, keeping a legendary shovel just for that quest does sound pretty useful even if it is a little extra. 
---
I just wish they would add shovel mods.
---
2k... level 100 reward gives 500 atoms also.
---
Nocturnal +limb damage Baton dropped by SBQ. If I weren't be so angry at that moment, I would've hang it in a wall.
---
If you'll be on in about 10 minutes I asked around my team and got you a ton of plans I can drop you then.
---
Thing is the assailant was not on my friends list
---
Like beating someone with a pack of bandages lmao.
---
It is funny how many of the people commenting on this are the very exploiters that expect Beth to reprogram SBQ around their exploitations. I wish Bethesda would stop accommodating to these dummies and just find a better way to get rid of the exploiters.
---
Thank you. I was starting to feel alone on this one. If you are a casual player, you won't get all the stuff. Because it would leave nothing to for the serious or obsessive player. Plus everyone doesn't need everything.
---
Basically they want to buy the atoms. With the previous dailies and weeklies, they obviously weren't making enough money (by Bethesda's standards).
---
Do you know if the person who bugged out accessed Atom Store or Legendary run before loading in? That could be the difference between who is affected and who isn't.
---
Low health builds are just overpowered especially when people use the exploit of speed demon mutation plus life giver perk granting you instant health regen...you can go afk in any battle and you‚Äôll survive
---
Yeah, just power out that 100,000+ EXP you need to match the 1000 SCORE you missed due to a glitch, which you could have normally earned in 30 minutes.
---
Perfect for being the neighborhood night watch at least.
---
Then maybe submit a ticket?
---
I honestly can't tell you anymore than that. If you're sure they weren't on your list then by all understanding they shouldn't've been able to do that, so clearly there's some other factor at play.
---
Yeah no.
---
Do you maybe have any idea what causes the bug?
---
Seasons award atoms..
---
Agree the only use with my explosive shotgun is with vats...
---
Normal shots just rubberbanding health big time
---
Ah. Okay I didn‚Äôt know that. Awesome.
---
I'll never understand people defending big corporations. Especially Bethesda who has been well documented lying to players.
---
Tons of games use Amazon's servers and none of them have this problem that I could find. If Destiny 2 or For Honor had these problems they would probably get different service providers.
---
Hell, Elder Scrolls: Blades uses AWS and they're made by the same publisher, but don't have this problem
---
https://80.lv/articles/more-than-90-of-the-worlds-largest-game-companies-use-aws?amp=1
---
what does this mean?
---
No idea. It happened with patch 20. Probably something to do with when they changed icon for purveyor.
---
so is it just to benefit from serums and armor pieces that have bonuses when you're at low health?
---
haha no problem!
---
it isnt as frustrating in adventure mode though
---
I dropped in morgantown airport - nuthin. Any place thats a sure thing?
---
Hopefully you don't mind me asking, but do you remember if you looked at Atom store or Legendary Run board before loading into the game?
---
I'm trying to figure out exactly what to avoid and this might be why some people who are online at refresh aren't affected.
---
You can pick up as many as you can find they just wanted an extra one my wife does it for me all the time.
---
You can still do it later.
---
This is the only reason really. My bloodied Gauss shotgun does 2718 damage and my new Gauss Minigun does 512. There's really nothing that comes close to it as far as effects go
---
Listen to the words that are coming out of my mouth... because I am getting fucking tired of saying them.
---
Bethesda's problem with banning dupers and hackers is that the game is not set up very well at all to handle tracking items on or between characters.  It's really really shit and they have to set up special scripts to claw through the player databases just looking for very specific suspicious things and even then they have little to no way to distinguish between an item entering someones inventory because they duped it or because they just picked it up after someone else duped it.  that's why their response in the past for most cases has been to just remove the items and leave the players alone.
---
That's not what is fucking happening here.  They don't have to dredge their way through character logs looking for obscure combinations of weapons/legendary effects/mods and they don't have to worry about hitting innocent players.  They look for the VERY specific SCORE items that absolutely no one should have unlocked yet and exist ONLY on the accounts of the people that exploited and unlocked them already.  And that's it.  They're done.
---
thats just what i read online though so take it with a grain of salt
---
He could have already picked it up out of the box, then asked you to do the same that way he could get two of them.
---
ooooooh alright
---
I've used one for 3 hours today and never once had a problem.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Either way, it wouldn't explain how OP was doing *more* damage and then *normal* damage after reload.
---
Literally New Vegas had that and that game's core loop wasn't about scrapping/crafting
---
So I would like to see a higher scrip limit per day but that would not solve my problem.  See I can't leave a legendary behind, I am in capable of it:)  So I know if the raised the scrip limit I would be in the same boat so maybe they should limit when you can turn in scrip.  IDK!
---
Yes, you are right. I was thinking about the new vegas (or was it 4? Dunno yet...) crafting system where you needed primers, cases, etc. 
---
Breaking down into common junk items would be an easier system ofc. I was just thinking about the early days after release, when beth stated that stash limit was implemented due to maintain server stability, as any single item would cause traffic / potential instability.
---
Cancel the auto renew.
---
Restart the membership on the 15th. 
---
Issue resolved.
---
If you just walk through the woods you‚Äôll find some. I don‚Äôt know about a ‚Äúsure thing‚Äù. But just walk around and you‚Äôll find some
---
What are magic weapons??
---
About the stims, I got around 600 too, I just cant bring myself to part with them.
---
Oh it was even weirder for me.  Logged in after the reset, I didn‚Äôt even. HAVE two challenges up.  Restarted game and I got them, completed...
---
So I‚Äôm at 1750 I believe it is lost SCORE....  wonderful they never put this on the test server to work this out.
---
Gonna need a source
---
I get that, but there doesn‚Äôt seem o be any rhyme or reason. 
---
Two months ago it happened to mean when I logged it at 6pm. That was seven hours later. 
---
If the challenge he‚Äôs done show autocompleted, it‚Äôs better to know that earlier rather than later so you can put a support ticket in faster.
---
I don't want to be that asshole, but this story seems a bit out there. I've deleted high lvl ones and felt bad after. Hell I've deleted two lvl 140s just because I hate the "Respec" works.
---
Could someone like brother or friends do it? I've had my wow accounts hacked and they keep 1 toon, high level one, then they change password and email. That
---
Or
---
You tried selling your account and backed out after you went thru most of deal. 
---
Sorry man but your story has too little info and sounds rather shady.
---
This should not be the player's problem to deal with
---
Its gotten so bad that my tesla rifle will actually break my damage until i restart the game.
---
A nice hut to house them in
---
I'm talking to him and he said no, he loaded straight into adventure with ten minutes before the dailies rolled over
---
Because: claim rewards, delete character, create new character, claim rewards and so on.
---
The bloodied legendary prefix (on weapons) increases your damage pretty substantially when at low health. Unyielding (armor prefix) gives you tons of stats while at low health. Rads are just a way to keep your health down that low to maintain these bonuses
---
I want the Fasnacht parade music on tuba!
---
#meleebuildsreallydomatterbrudda
---
Ah the memories. I remember when I first played this, designed the most broken melee/chem/defense ignore build known to man while abusing every mutation in the game. I could one-shot anyone in power armor, Scorchbeasts, elite mobs, etc. You name it, I probably punched it at least once.
---
Weapons and armor that specialize in giving you more stats and damage the lower your health. It requires a good amount of items and planning first so I don't recommend just jumping in to try it.
---
If you want to do a bloodied build make sure to research it and plan it out but otherwise if you're still just leveling up your first character then focus on a solid regular build for them first.
---
Except for the people that say they were offline for two HOURS before the reset ..
---
Mistakes of the developer are the developer's fault.
---
thought they didn't add those yet? it originally was not there.. then we bitched enough and they said they were gonna add em.
---
Salute was tricentennial edition only and was bugged so everyone got it
---
alright man, thank you, very useful information, i was about to ask
---
Because this is super abusable
---
Thanks for replying. Seems like it may just be due to being online. Needs fixing ASAP in my opinion.
---
Is that why I can one shot Death Claws?
---
I never had these issues with my GS.
---
Hi, not sure how this works do I just put these in my pictures folder and then I'll see them on my loading screen?
---
All of them are absolutely gorgeous thank you so much.
---
You're right of course. But it's the solution to the dev's ineptitude atm.
---
I run on Intel HD-4600 integrated graphics (2GB), that would probably explain a lot.
---
Yeah mainly! With these builds there are a lot of ways you can stack things like:
---
- emergency protcol power armor chest piece mod grants increased resistance so you don‚Äôt die at this low health
---
- adrenal reaction mutation increased damage at low health 
---
- nerd rage increased damaged at low health
---
- scaly skin mutation increases resistance as well
---
- legendary weapons also come with a perk called bloodied that grants increased damage when at low health
---
So when you combine all of this you can deal out loads of damage without worrying about dying especially when people use the life giver and speed demon exploit them you almost never die except to poison damage from things like mirelurks because we have no poison resistance.

build a floor, wall or roof in a camp or workshop x 10

Why they call them toons?

How? You can‚Äôt trade/drop lunch boxes. 1k caps and 50 scrip is super abusable, lemme tell ya

Yup, it‚Äôs annoying when I can‚Äôt find one. I start one and no one joins üòî I either server hop or join the event one...ugh

I added deep pockets to my Chest Piece.

Limbs didn't even have an option.
---
Have not checked since the last Patch.
---
I wasn't aware it wasn't supposed to be an option.
---
Kill 30 deathclaws
---
Take a picture of a player in a spacesuit fighting a mole rat in a nuke zone
---
Launch 30 nukes
---
Oh wait, that's the old challenges.
---
Where‚Äôs that gonna get you if you do that? You can‚Äôt sell/drop lunch boxes. 1k caps and 50 scrip is almost nothing. At least for existing characters, instead of making new ones to constantly claim, why would you claim it on a new character
---
Two thousand seven hundred and eighteen damage? Come again?
---
Indeed. Also idk where my Salute emote went. The thumbs up followed by the salute is by far the best Thank You you can muster. Now all I have is the thumbs up. Which is great but how am I suppose to show my respect. Follow it with a heart...? That‚Äôs way too much respect fam. Also sucks emotes are like 250 a pop. 
---
Really like the wheel though. You can get your point across like 95% of the time pretty easily and very quickly. More games should take a page out of Bethesda‚Äôs book on that part. And that part alone. Lol.
---
Wish I could find you online üòÇ
---
Rumour that it's when you've swapped to a new server.
---
I just want to see other guns being traded on trade subs. It always legacy for legacy or B2525 Fixer/HM for a legacy. So boring.
---
Yes sir. You can run a combat shotgun with no perks for damage and one shot almost everything. Two shot whatever survives the first hit. SBs take 4-5 hits after they land. It's a lot of fun and very economical :)
---
Technically you only need to kill 20 death claws and launch 20 nukes for the challenges to award score..... bless Bethesda's little heart.
---
Your last point is the what really should anger people.
---
What limitations?  This is their game, they made this system, they didn‚Äôt test it on the PTS, and it‚Äôs very similar to an auto completion bug that plagued a lot of people for over a year with regards to atoms, so I don‚Äôt call this a new bug.
---
It‚Äôs a lot like the critter respawn bug that started with Wastelanders.  It was ignored until it wrecked Fasnacht.  You can bet your ass it would still be here if it weren‚Äôt for the event.
---
The issue, however, is why have the tools not been developed to fix these problems?  It‚Äôs basic customer service.  Now perhaps I played WoW for too long, but old Blizzard has outstanding customer service, and tools to help their customers when either the game screwed over the customer, a hacked account did, or even an ‚Äúooops‚Äù.  Bethesda hasn‚Äôt even apparently started on tools to help customers that other companies did 2 DECADES ago.  The trade interface overhaul could end scamming in this game, completely.  
---
It‚Äôs so pathetic, and the only thing we can do as customers is to stop giving them money.
---
Calling it right now, it will not be as good as the mod.  I'm 100% certain on this and the only thing anyone can say that would convince me otherwise is the exact phrase "Bethesda have hired the modders to do it."
---
I was logged in during the reset yesterday and had no problem. But this morning I was logged in when the reset happened and now 4/7 challenges for the day are already done, including the "complete 5 challenges" one.
---
The team charisma bonus should allow sharing cards to be like the old system. My base charisma only allows level one but four more points opens a lot more options.
---
Great idea. I did grab a screenshot and created a ticket. I hope that it will help at least get the issue fixed.
---
Tbh I didn‚Äôt know you could until u/traps_arts_not_gay mentioned it haha.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 myself. 
---
Maybe u/traps_art_not_gay could clarify this question?
---
Laughing emote would be the nail in the coffin I need half the time.
---
Lol.
---
I drop by the train Station and there are usually some radscoprions.
---
Hear me out:   tato gun
---
Pipe, fuel, fabric, to craft, tato ammo.
---
Orange flesh inside a banana peel
---
Oh yes I could imagine...
---
It‚Äôs kinda crucial in NW compared.
---
Ooh nice, Danke sch√∂n. This is helpful.
---
DUM DUM DEH DO DEM DOO
---
lol samsquanch
---
it's not x 4 score poins
---
it's 100% extra xp
---
Only been saying it for nearly 2 years. Preaching to the choir
---
The communication options in the game are a joke lol
---
Good ideas. Those would be very effective tools of destruction.
---
Exactly. Couldn't have said it better myself
---
Your thinking of 4x event xp
---
Score doesnt get affected in any way
---
Well logged out just before the reset and everything is good so far. Waited about 11mins before logging back on. What the deal here is that why as a post player that we have to find our own way to fix this stuff and I just bought the Fallout 1st this has put me on the fence about my purchase and someone saying they are not going to give us back our lost points. I think Bethesda's better rethink this matter I can't believe they are so OBTUSE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.
---
This is the only reason I keep my tent up by the bunker, however much it may interfere with queen‚Äôs landing (I try to put it near some trees to leave open spaces clear). This way I quickly fast travel to my tent if I spawn in the nuke zone.
---
But it definitely sucks to have to resort to workarounds like this, especially when fast travel is also bugged.
---
Exactly, couldn't have said it better myself
---
It‚Äôs 4x Experience for the events, not score.
---
Make it like WOW did with snowballs so many years ago...random add to inventory. Go to open your inventory and WTF DID ALL THESE TATOS COME FROM????
---
Other way around sounds worse
---
It would still be a source of unlimited caps and scrip. It only takes like 3-4 minutes to get a character out of the vault. Also having access to unlimited lunchboxes could still be abused by 2 accounts. Just give each others main maxed lunchbox stacks and create a new character.
---
It shouldn't be that difficult to see how abusable this idea would be.
---
Hmm trapped in a broken suit.... seems like you're well on your way to becoming one of the ghost people from Dead Money or even a mole miner
---
So weird
---
&gt; Like in real life.
---
Not sure about your part of the world, but I can't just pick up rocks in my yard or scrap from my garage and head down to the local hardware store and sell them. Matter of fact, I can't go to *any* local store to sell *anything.* It's almost like they only want to take my money instead of giving me money.
---
so happy a thread was made for this, i got this yesterday and was like what, googled it and nothing was online about it lol good to know finally
---
Sometime people is smart and join your building team (I switch mine to event 20s prior finishing it and then change it back to building). 
---
Most of the time they are not.
---
Being able to build quest camps would be dope. Instead of griefing, more of a known challenge. They experimented with long puzzle dungeon creation in NukaWorld. Imagine being able to charge for entrance to camps as a wager or toll?
---
thank you man!
---
I'm not sure you're responding to me. I never said anything about wanting to look different, much less fashionable. I want the underarmor to be wearable under it specifically for the extra stats (the extra protection ain't bad either).
---
Yep.  Either make a custom ini file yourself, or use this mod from Nexus:
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/546
---
Because without unyielding gear,levelling up would take a whole week at high level(i mean over 550)
---
With unyielding and my xp run,it takes me about 1 hour.
---
I read this as ‚Äútattoos‚Äù at first and was strangely still onboard.
---
I would love that if that team could have increased size. Like 8 ppl so that when we take down the queen we all get stuff.
---
What does that actually specific like are there girl events and boy events or do you mean events that both girls and boys do?
---
It's just like any battle pass for a game. From the ones that I've experienced you get exp for it (SCORE in this case) just from playing. There are challenges to make it go faster but is perfectly doable just by playing the game. That's basically getting to max rank for a season by just doing the EXP repeatable for SCORE while the other challenges make it go faster. I wonder what level you would end up at if you got to max rank through just the repeatable with starting a fresh character.
---
Have they not made a tatoe gun yet? I think we should be able to craft ammo out of them and shoot them out of a high pressure tatoe gun.
---
70 days from last tuesday
---
I like to believe that‚Äôs just how West Virginia is, everyone knows at least one country or bluegrass song on any instruments
---
If Bethesda is the Jedi Council then I‚Äôll gladly be a Sith
---
At first I thought it has something to do with being online during reset, but it seems there's more to it after seeing people still getting the reset bug despite not being logged in.
---
What I think happen is, **there's bugged servers out there** that aren't correctly resetting the players daily challenges. And if you happen to logged in there while the daily reset OR happen to join that bugged servers even if you haven't been playing, that bugged server will incorrectly refresh your dailies. 
---
I say that because there's someone on my discord who can just play fine during the reset, and when I asked he said he's been playing in Private. 
---
But still it's just a guess, and no one really knows more than Bethesda.
---
Can't argue with that...
---
Fallout 1st gives you some every month
---
It's sad we have to do this. SO SAD.
---
Thank you for the info :)
---
Yet original poster is correct! Purveyor is broken! I keep requesting fixer but purveyor gives me pipe pistol!
---
I wish that we had a weapon idle in 1st person, like we already can see in 3rd person.
---
Pointing the barrel everywhere, at all times, is distracting.
---
It'd look good to have a frame if the 1st person weapon running animation used as a relaxed idle for most guns in 1st person.
---
What does it matter to you? FO is basically an online game. Let people play and mind your own.
---
Yes, people usually camp on top of the roofs of the tents, and this prevents the queen from landing
---
If you have a PS4 you can use Share Play to pass them control.
---
Unless they finally got around to patching it with the latest update, the flamer DOES NOT heal with its actual flame spurts as I stated. You have to gun bash things with it. Friendly fire is limited in what friendly targets can be healed. You only heals other players if they're in the same team as you and you only heal NPCs if they part of an event. It also works on tamed creatures (not the brahmin you get from placing down a fertilizer producer).
---
A shishkebab is way faster than spam bashing with a flamer.
---
You would need to be able convert the food item to a weapon through a recipe at a stove or bench because you can't have a single item that's simultaneously a weapon and an aid item.  Otherwise it's a problem from a programming standpoint and a practical standpoint since among other things the acts of eating a tato and equipping it as a grenade are the same button.
---
No problem, anytime!
---
This game is a shitty beta build. One of the best world designs in the gaming universe and THE WORST software build. To call this piece of steaming shit a beta build would be a  compliment.
---
And i am still waiting to talk to a human begin in any ticket i put up on their system. 5 tickets 5 automated mensagens basically saying: "Yeah... our product is shit and we know it. Too bad FOR YOU. Get fucked."
---
It is possible once you can buy spaces with atoms. I‚Äôve read each space was around 150 atoms? That could be wrong.
---
What else did we all do in the vault besides jam one song all day on repeat? I bet that party last night was a banger.
---
Thanks bro I appreciate üëå
---
I think you can, although I haven‚Äôt looked into it much :)
---
You‚Äôre right; I thought you were another user. 
---
I would welcome the stat boost too, but the trade off is acceptable to me, given the ability to be constantly cloaked, even while moving. We can get some boosts from the right perk cards though (Barbarian, Ironclad, etc.). Also, I could be wrong, but I think the CSA gives some environmental protection akin to the marine wetsuit. 
---
Sorry for the confusion.
---
Did you access the Atom Store or Legendary Run board before loading into the world?
---
I think this ‚Äúthanks random person in fo76‚Äù thing has gone way too far. We are now creating new threads to thank random ppl who sell ammo?
---
Dude, this stuff is not abusable what so ever. Let me clarify I meant it as it should be claimable on existing characters. 
---
Also who cares that there‚Äôs more caps and scrip to claim on the board, it would not be abusable. Stack all the lunches, youre god mode for an hour, wow so crazy, and then It‚Äôs gone and you have no more lunch boxes to use because you blazed through all your lunch boxes on the board.
---
It won‚Äôt work with any other tent other than the default/original one. So I‚Äôve been told. May be different now.
---
Good theory. Could this also be regional? Many people say they've never had it, and I've only experienced it once with the Atom challenges even though that bug was around for ages.
---
Sounds to me like this is a "I wasn't prepared and now I'm upset" post.
---
I spawn inside the nuke almost every time I join that event off the map.
---
I expect it at this point... so I PREPARE rather than despair...
---
I renamed my stealth suit so it is the first thing on my list for emergency equipping situations.
---
This isn't a Bethesda problem so much as poor planning for situations that have existed for a long time now.
---
I am finding if i use my two shot plamsa rifle or pump shotgun tse and i aim down sites it rubber bands but vats it doesnt in fact i can one shot high level scorched if they all hit and doesnt rubber band
---
Nope, I just logged into a private server and checked the dailies before anything.
---
Wait til you get over level 500
---
I‚Äôve never done that before! Is it sketchy? Can someone with bad intentions take over and take my goodies?
---
&gt;the Marine Tactical Helmet and the Chinese Stealth Helmet both basically  are best in slot due to the fact that they prevent waterborne disease  as well as airborne. 
---
How often are you encountering any of these issues?  The only places you have to actually worry about airborne diseases are I believe the ash heap and sundew groves, otherwise you could be forgiven for entirely forgetting they even exist.  And then the solution to waterborne disease is just not staying in water for too long, you need to seriously be wading in there for a while to even get the warning popup.
---
Ahhhh...gotcha.  that clears it up.  I appreciate the info.  Cheers M8 üòÄ‚úåüèº
---
I had an idea to create a website and sub dedicated to allowing and reviewing video evidence of people who do dumb shit like that. The end result would be a site that let you search by username and view the evidences submitted yourself. No threats could be posted but you could discuss things amongst yourselves. 
---
This would be outside fo76s control and would be a better and more forceful way to weed out the bad players. The main reason I‚Äôm not? I don‚Äôt have enough time or dedication to this game to give that high of a shit. It would be a fantastic system, but it‚Äôs not the added responsibility I feel like trying to throw on myself right now. Or ever.
---
I bought that with atom. They better not have taken it away.
---
The wasteland giveth.
---
I unlocked a skin on nw on one character but others can‚Äôt use it is that supposed to happen
---
This is a legacy glitch. Noob!
---
You found the Upside Down my friend.
---
When META is discovered all the scab sheep flock to it.
---
In this case bloodied builds.
---
It only happens to me if I'm in nuclear winter on reset
---
It's not. I was on during the reset and 4/7 were already done, including the "complete 5 challenges" one, I got no extra score. I had completed one last challenge from yesterday just before the reset happened.
---
I was on during the reset yesterday and had no issues.
---
Yu Yu Hakusho is the best anime ever!
---
Yup it happened to me and my friends too
---
That really would be neat. Like the Sea Shanties in Assassins Creed Black Flag. 
---
I do enjoy playing with people but...man that song gets old lmao
---
There is in xp glitch, where you can get 4000 xp for 1 scorched enemy and there is a glitch where you can spawn unlimited enemies. 
---
I'm sure you can put the rest together
---
Is the cheap way to do it and you'll likely regret it in the end.  A decent chunk of your cumulative SCORE is going to come from the repeatable experience challenge giving you a few extra bumps of 100 points each day while you're leveling up.
---
There doesn't seem to be a solid pattern to this. Hopefully Bethesda have a better idea what's causing it. ~90% of the people reporting it are online and of those that weren't it's 50/50 between loading up Atom Shop/Season board/NW first or just loading straight into Adventure.
---
Thanks for replying.
---
Just choose what character to claim it on in the main menu.
---
Any info from patch notes or Bethesda about it?
---
If you could reply at some point with if you actually earned the icon that would be much appreciated :)
---
Realistically you'll have to pay them atoms unless you grind. It's very likely you'll encounter the auto-completing challenge glitch more than once between now and the end of the season.
---
People have done the math and even when completing every daily and weekly challenge it's still not enough without having to grind to some extent.
---
.... can't tell if synth....
---
Both my characters have all my nuclear winter rewards
---
I agree. This community is great but we need a modpost where ppl can out these story's in the comments or something.
---
It's the other way around.
---
These are the kinds of questions we need to be asking. Good job
---
No but I put in a suport ticket and I suggest you do the same
---
"Can I play the piano anymore?"
---
"Well of course you can!"
---
"Well I couldn‚Äôt before!" *busts out flawless piano solo*
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been randomly getting score and I‚Äôll be AFK for Christ sake lmao
---
I can't remember, sorry
---
That's one of the easiest ones to do.
---
Yesterday I logged into NW, got on my mic and asked if anyone was working on the challenge and immediately had two of them asking for help as well.  We spawned in on the edge of the map and took turns getting burned alive and were done before the circle started moving.
---
It was supposed to be only for the tricentenial edition people and if you didnt get that edition then it was removed
---
ok just switched my build, i now have 15int, will try to make some drugs that boosts my xp and maybe i can grind too now.
---
After I use the Gamma Gun, I keep hearing the sound of the radiation/static, even after switching weapons, for a while afterwards.
---
Yes please. I‚Äôm sick of that disgusting green pipboy light.
---
it‚Äôs really weird to bill at the beginning of the month imo
---
What was the last thing you done before logging out? Played NW?
---
Same happened to me. If you are logged in when the score quests reset the old ones you have done before get marked as completed. Lost over 1000 score today.
---
I have a big ass tato farm so I'd be set
---
I don't get it, it is all cosmetic optional shit.
---
The worst it will do is prevent you from playing NW.
---
&gt;Dude, this stuff is not abusable what so ever. Let me clarify I meant it as it should be claimable on existing characters.
---
So, I guess fuck all those people that never created 4 alts in preperation to claim these rewards then?
---
Not necessarily, and hopefully not in order to give more time to get to 100.
---
Bethesda said "around 10 weeks" and "ends mid-september". Mid September (15th) is 11 weeks from the start, but.... 14th September is 76! days after the start.
---
P.S. not my theory, I saw it on another post here.
---
i can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre getting down voted this subs full of mindless bots
---
Wut? You are the one who said it is exhausting, I am fine with it.
---
Nope. Logged in, saw the dailys had been pushed back an hour. Logged out, then logged back in 15 minutes ago to do them. Found most 5 of the completed already
---
The Uranium event is basically 2 birds 1 stone in this case
---
Ok, thanks for your input.  Have a nice day!
---
Those people calculated with the double score weekend that is mentioned in the last Inside the Vault?
---
Its really annoying when you want your base to be placed down and you decide to check who took your spot and its a level 4 that barely has enough wood and metal to make floors walls and a roof
---
What's being said here is how I see it too, problems with: Unreliable Engine, Ambush Priority, Unbalanced, Broken Matchmaking, Mostly waiting, Hackers(PC), Mic Use, Maps.
---
You're not supposed to enter the shimmer!
---
Habit from Lon time mmo player
---
melee.. nades.. jump on the roof with an automatic
---
Definitely random, I was on yesterday at reset (Xbox) and no issues, today I lost three.
---
I had this bug happen to me for the first time today... I was on during nuclear winter yesterday and it didn‚Äôt happen so I thought I was good, was in adventure mode today when the day rolled over and it happened... Missed out on 1250 score points today, now I have to do the repeatable 14 times to make up for it.
---
not really a issue when u can a char and have the mask in about 1 hour.
---
Which salute? I have Tricentennial, Raider, Free States, Patriot, and there‚Äôs a Flyboy available. I think there were others too.
---
I play several hours every day but due to my play style and low INT etc I don't power level.  This is pushing me to play a different way or else I'll miss out.
---
It would be enough, because one of the daily challenges every day so far is "Level Up". And to Level up you have to hit the 10k experience challenge for 100 SCORE (once your past 100 at least). So it should be doable, but much much easier if you play 1hr/day as apposed to 10hrs in one day. Which just seems ridiculous.
---
I do over 3k damage with my bloodied SS +1 S deathclaw gauntlet
---
AAFFR tato
---
They included it in the latest Inside the Vault article:
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates
---
I live in Virginia. It's not the case here but you know what, it should be. Bluegrass is top.
---
If you focus yourself on taking the "minion"-mobs out during events, then yes, yes it is
---
But that‚Äôs not going to achieve anything lol. You‚Äôll have all those lunch box perks for an hour. Wow so powerful to have thirst reduced, food reduced, weight reduced, confetti come out when you hit someone etc lol. Those lunch boxes aren‚Äôt powerful.
---
Oh damn my bad
---
I need the tato gun to be thing on FO76.
---
Just wait until the Double SCORE event where I bet they won't fix this auto-complete bug and people will miss out on double points.
---
If you just pop into Moss Town every once and a while (after collecting enough and changing server as detailed above) then that does fairly well in keeping you stocked up and that is only one place to remember.
---
Yea don't feel bad. That's the whole point of workshops. Kill some more.
---
That it is. It's the first anime I completed. So it made sense to make a build based off it. I actually made a team build for the whole of Team Urameshi. Yusuke was the only one that felt like it could jive with my current character roster.
---
GAMER LOGIC
---
So I can just run onto the shooting range and take them out?
---
You get more points by playing a co-ed team and risk getting cooties.
---
Im about to get on now!
---
Bloodied players will be dieing left and right from the radiation alone!
---
I'm just hoping this doesn't affect the weekly challenges too
---
that is my understanding.. I just go on the roof with an automatic pipe rifle with a drum magazine..
---
Ive never actually tried melee but supposedly it works
---
I can.  It's a rude post.  People today want everything and suggesting that they can't have everything is rude and inconsiderate.  They don't understand what these types of clubs/subscription services do.  Having the desirable gear, makes people want to join the club.  Having unobtainable gear, shows tenure in that club.  It's the same with legacy weapons/gear from any other online/mp/know type of game..  People don't like being left out.  That's why I said I hope if they release the 1st stuff in a bundle, I hope it costs a ton.  After all, why should they get these items cheaper than someone who has paid an extra $100 just to get, "limited" items.
---
Nah I got it now myself thanks for the offer much appreciated
---
Thanks for the suggestions, time to go full axe murderer on plywood cutouts
---
I use the unstoppable monster deathcleaw too. its amazing.
---
It's not only you that get the buff, it's anyone nearby. The stacking lunchbox exp buff is incredibly powerful.
---
Cool, much appreciated üëç
---
Okay so I get why this sucks but this is just hilarious.
---
yea, i cant do a bloodied build lmao, and i have a +1 S secret service armor
---
I think I checked the challenge tab briefly and I definitely looked on the atom store.
---
This is popping up everywhere. If you're logged on when dailies reset it seems to (randomly) just mark challenges complete with no way to get them back. Best bet is to be logged out when they reset until they get it fixed. It's definitely across all platforms.
---
I feel like they really owe us something on this instead of the usual middle finger "sucks to be playing a glitchy game we produced sorry for your loss"
---
I lost 1,500 score today, I hadn't been to the Atom store but had been on the board about an hour before to claim one reward. I had been playing with a couple of friends for a few hours on the same server, two of us had a CTD a couple of hours earlier during Line in the    sand. I was the only one in the team who had challenges auto completed.
---
Doesn't work for me
---
By chance, does reviving someone in NW count for the Tadpole quest?
---
They cut the events giving SCORE.
---
Events do not give SCORE
---
Build 10 things at camp, eat 5 cooked meals, complete an event, kill 10 mole miners, level up, do 5 challenges.   The real ones btw
---
Enjoy getting less XP per action chump
---
Worked so hard for?  It's like the #4 slot, out of 100.
---
Somehow it doesn't even have rad resist on it, which is insane.  Basically a cosmetic, don't give a shit.
---
Lol, struck a nerve huh?
---
Ok thanks for that info but that‚Äôs not what I was asking. I‚Äôm just looking to understand which events give the XP bonuses.
---
Wrong sub, bud.
---
How do you get Bethesda to reply to this post?  No one seems to have the answer.
---
No. I‚Äôm not trapped. But I‚Äòll make sure to write an essey about game‚Äòs mechanics next time I make a post. Thank you ‚úåüèª
---
No you still get rads for sure jus much less than normal because its turned into HP
---
Tatoes don't go splat they go THUD, it's tater part of their dna.
---
You still get rads. Combine it with level 3 rad sponge on a team and you're incinvible since rad sponge heals 200 rads when it procs
---
This Post will prob get removed...Rule 10 btw  but you just want any GA?
---
3* Executioners is all i have
---
200 DR is more than enough against 99% of this game
---
So a good combo would be a ghoulish radsponge with weapons (i forgot the name of the stat) that deal more damage with less armor. So you constantly heal and do a ton of damage
---
Lies.  It's loaded with fancy cakes, dog food, and cram.
---
You could have someone send you screen shots of each of the modify screens after they've made what you wanted,  then send them to you. It would be a bit time consuming, but it would probably be the safest way.
---
Every time you do this you're losing out on a few hundred additional score from the repeatable challenge while you're leveling up.  If you're sure you're going to hit every single challenge every single day from now until  the end of the season you could manage to just barely squeak in before the end, but if you slip up the extra +10k score you're missing out on could mean the difference between hitting rank 100 or being several levels off and either having to pay up or spend time grinding anyway.
---
Oh!!! I only put it there so that I have a place to spawn and respawn when I get killed. I had no idea this causes problems!
---
My melee weapons do about the same w chems/adrenaline.
---
Quite possible
---
I just checked and I did get the icon. The challenge does not show up in my completed, but I made the last leg of the SH power armor on Saturday and got the reward. I got all the plans in the vault, but have been working on the armor since. I've made multiple sets worth of solar, not sure if I made a full set of thorn though I have made some pieces and I made a full set of SH and got the mask in the vault.

IMO headgear ought to remain cosmetic. The waterborne/airborne disease resistance is a moot point since those are such small, situational benefits rather than something you'd want on all the time. The Secret Service Helmet (and other overpriced bullion headgear) is an expensive cosmetic people buy for swag, which is pretty common in online games.
---
Im not a bloodied build.. but i keep rads close to half to take full advantage of Radicool. Been that way for 200+ levels now
---
1 perk point for +5 strength.
---
Yup. Worth it
---
This leads me to believe it‚Äôs just an unintentional bug, rather than intentionally removing it in patch 20, from adding the new challenges and hopefully support can help me resolve it. Thanks for the help!
---
Go to the atom shop and make sure it is equipped
---
I think I know that dude, he's chill.
---
You realize you're replying to your own thread right?
---
The other daily is by the "Kiddie Corner Cabins" in Toxic Valley.
---
 I sent a ticket about it, they replied: "it was a long time bug that we wanted to fix, it was originally meant to be given to people with tri-centennial edition". So, if you don't own it theres no way to get it again.
---
 Also, team up emote with three vault boys is also missing on me, you guys should also check it out.
---
I usually find 1-2 mutant hounds when I spawn at Bolton greens, they're north on the other side of the road
---
Thank you !!
---
They don't hire people that play video games.  They hire people that do work.  Or people that check the right diversity boxes.
---
If bugs were predictable and easily to replicate they'd be a hell of a lot easier to fix.  Being logged in isn't the only factor, but it's proven to be a common one.
---
Berserker's(less armor = more damage) works well if you play as a sneak character, but junkie's is just so much better when combined with ghoulish&amp;radsponge because you have armor, the same 50% damage buff you would get from berserker's and only lose a few special points from the addictions.
---
I run Hunter a event public teams on PS4
---
It's great for bare knuckle fighting ghouls.
---
"bas" hello my fellow Arab
---
Great idea! It would be a ton of screen shots though. Any advice on where to potentially find someone? Fo76marketplace maybe?
---
Yeah, but XP is already so crazy fast they'd have to nerf XP.  I already can gain 1-2 levels in certain events.  It'd be insane if I got every single kill.
---
But, the whole point is that power armor isn‚Äôt as good as regular armor. A literal human tank should be more powerful than a man in some wood armor.
---
Im actually going for a sneak class but im only level 22 rn. Any tips? I have the fixer that i fully modded and a supressed sniper rifle so i think im good on weapons. I also have sneak to lvl 2 in perks. Any other suggestions?
---
Ah! This is the toxic barrel dumping? I thought it was the one at the pioneer scout camp... I must have mixed them up in my recent trips. Was there an event that provided badges too?
---
You're a about 60% to min max on your build, lots of superfluous cards like gunsmith and no maxed adrenaline.
---
Sounds like that would be your best bet. I wouldn't be surprised if someone on here ends up offering their services. There's a lot of helpful players in this community.
---
ah that's lame...
---
Whoa whoa whoa.  They do say they will pass the information on. ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™
---
It ain't there. I want my 150 atom back.
---
And drop good legendaries
---
The trouble is if you switch teams your bonus resets so it's easier to sit in an event team in case a high xp event comes up. You risk losing a lot of xp/score otherwise.
---
Yo I'll get you more later, had to run to rad rumble. Feel free to join join the discord I'm a part of, about 50 people who are frequent players. Https://discord.gg/Hr9SnQ
---
oh yeah, that's true. it's not exactly a lot though
---
I‚Äôll wait and see. Already had someone downvote the post lol
---
Awesome, thanks! And will do!
---
So you believe that people buy Fo1st for the cosmetics? The selling point of it was and will always be the infinite scrap storage and tent placement. That's what people have been paying for monthly not the outfits you're trying to defend. Comparing this to wanting legacy weapons is as ridiculous as someone paying an extra $100 just to get limited cometic items.
---
yeah, i'm aware of that. maybe if i had the money, i'd subscribe, but not at the moment
---
Look in your documents folder, under my games/Fallout 76.  If you have a Fallout76Custom.ini, rename it temporarily.  Nuclear winter does this to me because of mods, and renaming the file fixes the problem.  I just put the name back to normal when I go back to adventure mode.
---
That's what I keep mine for üòÇüòÇ
---
Because a chatbox would just be an epeen fight.  I'm not saying I don't want it, but I'm thinking WoW Barren's chat all over again.
---
With those types of stakes what are you hoping to bet for if you win?
---
There is a public event in the forest called Campfire Tales that *can* reward badges.
---
I did 3 SBQ events yesterday and got non rewards after dumping nearly 4K .50 rounds in to them... really frustrating.
---
If your on pc drop me your ign, I'll swing by with some plans
---
You can still purchase that edition, or whatever it's referred to, isn't free but is available.
---
I'm so pissed just ranting to myself lol
---
All over the map and they show up as red diamonds on the compass.
---
Also wear different colour socks, say a prayer to the Spaghetti Monster, take batteries out of your controller 5 times and then s.c.o.r.e works.
---
The only drawback to a super sledge is that it is the loudest weapon in the game. Every enemy for miles around hears you swing it and comes running.  It sucks for a stealth build, but is great if you are a tank and want to just stand there and let all the nearby enemies come to you.
---
No really, just get all the sneak perks that boost your damage output and depending on whether or not you use v.a.t.s., you should invest in luck 'cause that REALLY increases your damage output. Here's a popular website with which you can create your build and see what it looks like: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
One more thin. If you don't decide to use berserker's, use the chinese stealth armor since it buffs stealth by a mile and also give huge amounts of resistance(140DR, 140ER, 1000RR).
---
With the way the menus work in this game, would you wanna scrap the 10k .38 rounds one at a time for lead and steel? 
---
I‚Äôm perfectly okay with the ammo converter, gives me a reason to keep the missiles mininukes grenades and whatnot, I‚Äôve already gotten thousands of 556 for my rifle from this thing, it‚Äôs a blessing honestly.
---
AH! Thank you. That's the main one I couldn't remember. 
---
Will google it.
---
Stalker's Meat Hook with Limb Damage and Reduced Weight.
---
Useless.
---
Mine isn't that I don't want to trade.  Half the time I see the trade emote, and space bar does nothing but jump.
---
We need a "Radroach ate my trading capability" emote.
---
im at level 36 no godmode lol.
---
building team, cranberry relish, sleep, lunchbox, brainfungus soup,  UNY armor ect
---
sadly we are forced to play NW with his kind of math, without playing NW you get only 197500 points and need to make 22500points threw repeadable xp quest, and that are 225 farming 10k xp (3-4 times a day)
---
i mention this because i cant play NW, its only working if i play the game in english ( thats what they told me, dont know if true) and i am not gonna change my language, besides the fact i hate NW/ battleroyale and dont wanna play it.
---
He knows too much call the Zetas , Secret Service and the Institute. Game over man Game-
---
An  event team only buffs xp you get from events like radioactive rumble or monsters mash not actual quests
---
The piercing mag gives only 9% armor penetration. The Perforating mag gives 20%.  For me the Perforating mag is the best choice.
---
Yeah I use mine for farming. Saves ammo and you don't need to go into every room in a building. I just walk in the front door, start swinging my Sledge in the air and every ghoul sprints to me
---
My dailies don't seem to get an XP buff, the xp looks as it was... anecdotal!
---
What games console are you using?
---
Maybe a steak n cheese from subway?
---
oh yea no, by the time i have everything i want, im gonna have over 500 damage resist, maybe 600, over 450 energy, and over prolly round 200 radiation, plus my mutations and legendary perks, im ultimately gonna be a god
---
I noticed the eat 5 cooked meals also at 3/5 :/
---
Haha, just blame it on bots. ü§£ If you come across a really nice legendary or two,  I'd use that as payment.
---
I‚Äôm on PC.
---
the events team buff only affects the in-game events (the ones on the map with a hexagon icon), not the seasonal challenges.
---
my understanding is the events team buff works better if you are doing events, but if you plan to just play the game and want an XP boost, like do daily quests and such, the building team INT buff is better cuz it boosts all XP gains. i could be wrong on the math there, however.
---
I did that not long ago I died and kept falling under the scene
---
you can read exactly what each team does when you hover over the team when someone has made one. 
---
the more people in the team and the longer they are together the better the buff. 4 people bonded in events gives 100% extra xp from completing an event. 
---
building bonus gives flat xp boost for everything else it seems. But not many people join building. More than they did before though
---
Your wallet
---
If it protected against waterborne disease I would pay 2000 gold for it
---
I guess people here will always have something to complain.
---
The problem is FO76 never told us that INT gives increased XP. So most causals probably have no idea.
---
Yea bro seriously amazing for my kids too
---
Same, got unlucky and lost 750 score today. I logged in about 6:30pm UK time, so 1:30pm ET I think, which I thought would be well after the daily reset. But it still happened.
---
possibly alts that they've given gear to. Also they might have the better build. And maybe mutations.
---
I got a 1\* Stalkers hatchet just now.  Why would anyone need 100% vats accuracy on a melee weapon?
---
This issue seems to be across PC/ Xbox and Playstation. Log a ticket with Bethesda Support and hope that they will award you the points. Potentially they are also going to give out 150 atoms at some point so you can catch up a level (after the 14th July).
---
People use trade subs and other places I presume. I've only ever got average drops and bought a couple of reasonable weapons from player vendors, pure luck really. I just make do with what I've got now.
---
It's not hard to do, you can one-shot anything with a bloodied auto handmade
---
It's amazing the amount of people who don't think about this, their mind goes straight to "im high level this is gonna take ages"
---
Same with the NW rank up, make a new one. Start at rank 0, one match will put you at rank 1 and count towards it.
---
i love this random simpsons reference so much
---
same here 
---
I already sent  a ticket to bethesda but they don't give shi t
---
I feel like if they allowed you to scrap ammo directly then trading ammo and mining/scavenging for components would become useless.
---
The best system would be to keep the converter, but make it work like a vendor and have us be able to bulk ammo. Each bulk item sells for specific points, points are redeemed for bulk ammo of choice. Exchange rates staying fairly low to keep all the other ammo systems consistent.
---
The amount of rubber banding and screen tear would be immersive for sure
---
Tato grenades should be craftable with one tato. No dam, no PvP tag.
---
Yeah, golf club is popular nowadays...
---
just make sure it's a potato..
---
As funny as this is, it may be a sign of some hardware issues. It's somewhat frequent in all bethesda games on pc, things don't load in fast enough or at all, and eventually you don't even get collision anymore. Eventually game just crashes. Afaik it doesn't really happen on consoles though, so it might mean something is getting screwed in your hardware
---
What are trade subs and how do I join them ?
---
We told them on the PTS from day one to add PvP public teams. Repeatedly. Nicely, too. I wouldn't hold my breath, is what I'm saying.
---
0.6% is for Foundation. It‚Äôs 1.2% for Crater. 
---
I imagine the reputation glitch is why the Crater number is twice as big.
---
No - I'm telling you that you're playing yourself.
---
Could even be a challenge for SCORE, hit 10 players with tatos
---
Im on Xbox, so that may be why, but i have never experienced rubber banding or screen tearing in this game.
---
Woops
---
So right now the legendary run has events in teams as a requirement.  If you prefer to solo play, being forced into a team of 3 random people to get the SCORE points is going to lead to this. They need solo "teams" :p
---
No allowed to give link here sorry, just another Reddit sub.
---
Dm ?
---
This sounds super risky
---
If you have a leader that is on the spot, you‚Äôll have a build team that hops over to event team just before an event completes, then back to builder.
---
Yes!!!!!
---
We don't need more reasons to not use power armor. Give me some power armor heelies
---
You would if you were moving quicker than sprint speed
---
The game engine that 76 runs on, cant handle that kind of movement speed
---
Its been tested by speeding the characters movement speed up and you move quicker than the world can render in
---
Only **Path to Enlightenment** at Landview Lighthouse grants +5% XP for 1 hour if you activate the Wise Mothman summoned at the end.
---
Have you ever heard of someone doing anything like this?
---
Hunter's shepherd's crook
---
Complete it without grinding? No. But anyway it‚Äôs 10 weeks long.
---
Yes that's very high.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/08BpAIM](https://imgur.com/a/08BpAIM)
---
These are mine for instance, my speed test was 126.21 down, 12.16 up.
---
Not sure what's going on with your connection to them... Do you run a VPN or anything like that?
---
lemon flesh inside an orange peel
---
This has nothing to do with NW.
---
Dungeons.. what dungeons you thinking of?
---
Again thanks, I did know that. Just interested in the public teams events.
---
That sounds good though
---
imagine peeling an orange and biting into it and it's a lemon
---
I have not. Sorry
---
See edit
---
never drop, only store.
---
I can one shot everything in the game except for sbq and squatches without a junkies or bloodied build. I'm doing quite fine, thanks.
---
As a level 400+ experience means very very little to me.
---
Good try though ;)
---
Thank you for clarifying üëçüèª
---
Any weapon that suits your build.  You can make any weapon strong.  It is all in your build.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9Udas3wACw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9Udas3wACw)
---
Thanks for your stats, no VPN a clean windows 10 install and ethernet, however it is my good internet that seems to be strange, maybe my ISP is doing some filtering? EE in the UK. Will keep looking into it.
---
May explain all the Server Not Responding goodness I keep getting.
---
Heelies were the shit!
---
How about biting into a strawberry and it‚Äôs olive...
---
They‚Äôre not in the game yet apparently. You can deep pocket the chest. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm sure they will add the arm and leg plans as separate plans to force a longer grind.
---
Revolting
---
As a level 700 I can tell you that you likely won't finish the season without the +15 INT  (+30% XP) that Unyielding provides
---
FO76 has yet to tell me anything about the actual game. But the loading screen has been leading me to believe that the 10mm pistol is the most trusted weapon in the wasteland so I'm having trust issues lol
---
No offense, but those are rookie numbers, and that is not even close to "the greatest weapon for a melee build". If you can get your hands on a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet or a bloodied power fist, that's a good start. One-punch everything!
---
Fear not for I shall farm them recipes and sell em all for 69
---
It sucks big time, but do we really  need 3 new posts on this with every reset now?
---
I think the encrypted one is different
---
Or just a good ol‚Äô text chat
---
I spent one month filling my F1 Scrapbox, felt it was a inventory management hell without it. Now I dont have to care about junk in my stash, and wont ever pay for F1 again. Not a tip, more like survivors guilt for paying twice for the game.
---
here i am at level 600+
---
rip for me
---
My favorite is when I try to spawn at the bunker but instead it spawns me inside of the zone and I get nuked.
---
You must be mistaken about him being on your friends list because there's no way for him to enter your private world without that being the case.
---
Can confirm this happens on PS4 with Speed Demon mutation.
---
Think about biting into a juicy peach and it‚Äôs freaking caper...
---
Atom yeeteth, and Atom yoinketh.
---
That's freaking hilarious. Being a non bloodied user has no effect on me completing challenges and participating in double score weekends. 
---
 I'll see you at the end.
---
What's the very first thing that you did after the reset already occured? 
---
Logged into Public server, Private server?
---
Logged in to public
---
what about... a TANK!! ahah it could be fun, there are some pre war models too around vault 76 I think
---
Raspberry but it tastes like durian inside
---
What I think happen is, **there's some bugged servers out there** that aren't correctly resetting the players daily challenges. And if you happen to logged in there while the daily reset OR happen to join that bugged servers even if you haven't been playing, that bugged server will incorrectly refresh your dailies. 
---
Are you using power armor?
---
It‚Äôs not just the weapons. It definitely depends on your build and play style.
---
There is a special place in hell for you sir.
---
This happened to me when I‚Äôm in my power armor once you get out of it you can see the screen
---
There is an issue where 3 previous events items are again unlockable in NW. Survivor, Halloween, Xmas. Only the survivor items are trackable in "challenges" though.
---
They could make it so that when you are on a bike and above a certain speed, the LOD of the world could be much lower, and certain models wouldn't be loaded in to save memory. Its not like you would notice it moving fast on a bike anyway.
---
It doesn't help enough is my problem.
---
No. It's not just about cosmetics.  Even though that's what YOU wanted.  It also let's members use the scrapbox, in its entirety, that you lose when you don't pay.
---
You are the one wanting the limited gear.  So, yes, it does compare to legacy weapons. You want something that you missed out on. And now you're complaining/whining to the internet that yuz can't haz. . .
---
And, yes. Some people probably did get 1st just for the cosmetics.  Or the monthly atoms. Or the tent. Or the unlimited scrapbox. Or the atoms. Or everything. Your opinion on what exactly was the selling point for the membership, is just that.  Your opinion.
---
If you wanted something specific from the 1st membership, you should have stayed a member.  Everything else from you is just excuses.  You wanted the ncr cosmetics that were shown in previews and was well known that it was a 1st members only item, and you didn't stay.  That's on you.  There is no reason to complain about it now.
---
"You snooze, you lose".
---
But, those of us that did stay, can show these items off!
---
It's in the water tab :)
---
Apparently no one at bgs used it while in power armor.
---
And it's extremely unbalanced and makes no sense. Why are giant .50 rounds cheaper and easier to produce than significantly smaller 5.56?
---
Presumably they could just make new copies.
---
That would be pretty cool, too. It could give us an actual purpose for missiles too.
---
Lost faith in this game at this point. Fallout 1st sub and staunch defender of this game to my friends.....but at this point I can't even defend it anymore and its a waste of a financial investment as it brings me no joy anymore...just frustration. For every 1 thing they "fix" or "introduce" 50 other things break to such an extent that you figure "Why even put forth the effort and try? Things will just not count or glitch" Now to try and find something else to occupy my time  :(
---
Just go on youtube and figure out how to god mode youll max out score this weekend
---
Shit yeah I am. I‚Äôll try it without power armor on, thank you!
---
What level for that suit?
---
When you‚Äôve taken too many mentats
---
Considering most of your level up rewards are 150 atom points each time . It adds up to a few levels you can pay to skip down the road.
---
Does leveling up take more xp as you get higher leveled?
---
Unfortunately, I don't have the Fallout76Custom.ini at all. Otherwise, it would be an easy fix.  What is super weird is the game was working fine last week before the update.
---
They added the SS Underarmour mods...never said they‚Äôd be adding deep pockets or Ultralite option to SS limbs.
---
labcoat116
---
I play every other week due to my work schedule, so you'll see me on sporadically.
---
If they do you will then make a post complaining about stash space
---
Breach and Clear (which I did) or Uranium Fever.
---
It's unrelated to the custom.ini file became corrupt some how.
---
I‚Äôll rephrase what I meant to say originally. My main character only needed a few more points in order to level up on the SCORE to reach the next level. 
---
So when I switched to a new character, leveled up, and then went back to my main, I had successfully ranked up to my next SCORE level. And I was able to claim my reward.
---
Its a bug lol
---
I have a spare plan, if you are on PS4 and have caps or good trade
---
It's because they go pretty fast if they're cheap, I sell my fusion cores at 40 caps each and they go almost instantly!
---
I don't really understand the different teams. Where can I find the explanation for each one.
---
Awfully optimistic of u
---
Yes. For example. If you‚Äôre a level 2 and you want to reach level 3. It‚Äôs going to take you (not accurate) about 500xp to reach next level. 
---
Meanwhile. When you‚Äôre level 100. And you want to reach level 101, it might be about 15,000xp.
---
It's the fault of bethesda, indeed. But clothing above the csa would break the immersion for sure.
---
Chameleon is breaking this immersion aswell, but what could we do? Bethesda screwed this up...
---
You can also bind the stealth suit to a number key to make it even easier.
---
On a side note, rad-x diluted UNsuppresses mutations if you use it after using regular rad-x. XP
---
I sell fusion cores and usually takes a day before someone buys them all.
---
And you think that beth would be capable of this... because?
---
Im not trying to be an arse, but they cant even roll out a patch without breaking something else.
---
Useful for the more rowdy cattle.
---
Watch out it took me forever for the 8 badges for the 120 carry weight and I did missions for days without getting a badge so I started doing the ones on the challenges menu to help it go faster. I think at least 4 of them are easy to do. I have done campfire tales everyday since wastelanders came out and haven‚Äôt received another badge since I got my high capacity mod
---
How are people placing the punji blueprints? Mine says floating no matter where I put it.
---
So if the leader changes the focus of the team (Builder to Events), the while team changes with them?
---
&gt;by only playing 2 hours a week. 
---
I don't think anyone expects to get to 100 playing 2 hours a week.
---
The main problem I have is that someone who plays 1 hour per day will have an easier time than someone playing 12 hours at the weekend, despite the weekend player putting more time in.
---
Rads diluted huh.... learn something new everyday. 
---
Gonna definitely try that :)
---
Berserkers is also awesome with the stealth suit btw, as long as its broken. No need to ever switch to a hazmat!
---
Play nuclear winter.
---
Pvp in adventure is unbalanced af, group pvp is disabled now and alot of douchebags are using hacked weapons and builds where they're invincible spamming nuka quantum and stealthboys.
---
I really should setup a shop just for my cores... Gotta stash full of em for my army of PA's, but then ended up running a stealth build, so I never use em
---
you're too rational for this forum. GET OUT!
---
Guess I have to build a PA 100% Toguro with Pain Train to PVP Yusuke!
---
For a rated M game there are definitely way to few middlefinger emotes.
---
Thank you would be appreciated too.
---
Typically 3-5 at Whitesprings.
---
If you are not high enough level for that, then yea, leader of the pack is good.
---
  if you set off collision course at morgantown airport, And a legendary SB buzzes you, take a few shots.  If you hit it, you may get a Low level  legendary scorched. (if you do, it‚Äôs usually in wave 4).  
---
Note if its a standard SB, And you hit it a few times, then one of the scorched in a random wave will likely be a L68.
---
Sometimes theres a legendary super mutant in the wood houses just below the pink and white building near top of the world.
---
They already have the dross toss stuff so it wouldn‚Äôt be too hard
---
Oh God
---
Realistically yeah, i know its not gonna happen. Im just saying that it would be possible if a competent team was working on it.
---
Me too
---
Im still new to sbq fights only lvl 70 but i got lucky and found a vampire gatling plasma and as long as im mowing her down i dont tske dmg so i dont need to hide from any of the mobs on the ground.
---
I had like 17 FC‚Äôs in my store for 50 caps some guy bought em all I just wanted them outta my stash lol
---
Sad how people took the time to downvote me when I was trying to be helpful. I was only relaying information the devs have shared in the past. This was my first day of trying to be active on Reddit. Sadly, it is my last.
---
I did about 30 of the insect parts quests (didn't find a bloatlfy gland in 4 hours nearly smashed controller in to my face in despair) and didn't get any badges and i've done like easily 50+ campfire tales and had 1 single badge.
---
Look at this crazy guy acting like a sweeping pose isn't the most game changing thing to be added to the game yet.
---
Some weapon classes max out at L45.
---
Plus the event was made to be done in the nuke zone. Fissure site prime has to be in the nuked zone to trigger the event so idk why people expect a respawn point at V9 which isn‚Äôt the intended event location.
---
!remindme 68 days
---
For ultracite pa, you can have the prototype paint
---
‚ÄúBaked‚Äù Tato does both blunt and burning damage
---
Another tip for the power fist: Get the carnivore mutation and equip the strange in numbers perk. Carnivore will double any melee damage boost you get from foods (mutant hound chops, mutant hound stew, glowing meat steak, mutton chops, mutton stew, bear ribs, bear roast, they ALL stack) and the strange in number perk will boost your talons/twisted muscle mutation AND and carnivore mutation stronger, increasing food boosts even more. Public teams makes it so much easier for the perk to work too
---
And I love the prototype paint which looks awesome with BOS logo
---
Healing salves and antibiotics... bean serverhopping for days now to get some salves, I always end up crafting my own.
---
Mr. Fuzzy tokens. For the love of god someone please sell me these stupid thing.
---
She is always broken for me lolüò• nothing good at allüò°
---
no, fuck that. if you dont want to use them, then dont. stop trying to fuck over everyone else.
---
it would do fuck all to "balance" the game. pretty clear you dont understand that.
---
It's much more safer than giving people your log in.
---
Not really as I play the game mostly in 1st-person perspective.
---
I sell plasma and fusion cores all the time, 1 cap per charge so 100 caps for a full one. Usually sells, plasma cores are cheaper though, bout 70 caps for a full one.
---
If you want the Stein you need to hit 100.
---
335 in (mostly) polished heavy metal and BoS underarmor.
---
Not the best for RR/ER, and still to squishy for some places in the bog/mire/divide.

If you want to share, share, don't beg for attention

What weapon do you use for 5.56? I'm using a handmade rifle. Recently, my ammo issue has gone away due to ultracite ammo/prime receivers. But before that. Regular ammo is unbelievably unbalanced as hell. I guess my solution is just to obtain prime receivers stat. Problem solved.
---
I pretty much was able to buy tons of 10mm and now, only a handful of people have it because of the converter. I put all my ammo back up for sale again. 
---
I sell tons of disease cures, too, but don't see a lot for sale.
---
Todd is on the other side watching us allüëÄ
---
Ah, okay. That makes more sense for that usage. I always forget about card sharing because I never can.
---
Sharing a level 1 Rad Sponge should be more than enough, at least in power armor. Just an fyi if you want to use more perks.
---
*how dare you* minimize running on top of a running horse.
---
Max is +4. You get +1 automatically and then as the other team members bond increases you get up to +4. Once that‚Äôs achieved, you‚Äôre maxed out. 
---
You can also be on a team of one and get the +1 immediately.
---
I am aware of a couple of discord communities. Let me know if you want the links
---
Oh yes I do, and I will!
---
With this game, yes
---
Could be a hop somewhere along the way is acting up. If you know the server IP you can run a trace rout.
---
Im in love with this idea.
---
I use a semi automatic handmade with the 5.56. I use a pipe revolver rifle and a lever action with the .45.
---
 A rarely use the handmade though since I have that pipe revolver rifle.
---
If you buy an item from another player with real money, you are just as big of a cheater. He cannot do what he does without you. This is a hilarious post, I've laughed way too much about it, I need a break lol.
---
What is your build? Go here and set it up, build matters a lot more than the guns for the most part.

Man, I‚Äôd love to do something like this but I‚Äôm on PS4, unfortunately. Even if it‚Äôs not effective against the SBQ, it could be useful in dealing with the swarm of enemies the spawn during the fight.
---
Woundnt be the worst idea, maybe if they could remove hacked weapons and then raise the level cap that would be awesome
---
I'm talking about the cpt Cosmo set, not the ammo converter.
---
Thank you for the response!
---
Two hours later....
---
Yea the first day I came back for wastelanders, some random low level just came up to me shot me multiple times and when I decided to fire back he pulls out a Gauss riffle and one-hits me. Luckily, I only had some basic junk on me. I know I was gone for a bit, but how can a level 15 one hit kill someone at level 60?
---
Bethesda: Fixes it
---
Ward now periodically attacks you and is invincible.
---
"Finally someone with the...."
---
Thank you for the in sight.
---
Unarmed isn't melee.
---
But here we are, even though initially they said we can't have infinite scrap box because of server limitations, few months later they put it behind paywalls, can't you see how they turned 180 on it? Are you OK with it?
---
Hardened automatic Tato reciver would be nice.
---
It definitely takes me more than an hour to complete the dailies.
---
For immersion purposes its bothersome that they ignore mobs. But at the same time I dont reaaalllyyy care, either way the only reason I go there is for dailies and getting me gold.
---
Modded underarmor. I'm running around in my raider underarmor (2nd level, "treaded" or so... +1agi, +1per, best i can craft). I craft those from time to time and stock my vendors just to help someone out maybe. Been looking for the higher tier plans for ages without luck. Pretty sure plenty of players can craft the highest tier but simply forgot about it by now.
---
I also wish there were more special outfits for sale. Again, thousands of players will know the plans but noone seems to sell.
---
Non PA people don't need another thing that PA people can't have. Why can't I have bags attached to my PA that counts as a backpack? Why do non PA people need a jetpack? How come I can't use a cooking spit while in PA? I'm not against new content but I am tired of them making it a slog to actually be a PA user, that being said, I highly doubt this is something they could do anyway. Even if they could, have you seen the roads? It would probably be faster to run with the amount of holes, debris, or broken sections that there is everywhere.
---
I think this is what happened with me: I went to the lucky mucker and activated the game, but was attacked by scorched and killed, and had to respawn at 76. I didn‚Äôt go back, assuming I could finish it later. It has been stuck at ‚Äútalk to zeke‚Äù for months since.
---
Ah yes the good ole days of New Vegas and Fallout 3
---
Or you know, they could fix their fucking game.  Its been a year and a half.  All we have gotten is more grind, and more bugs.  Sure i could pay for the rank I lost out on because I lost track of time, but I'm not going to.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôm pretty sure I have plenty of fusion cores I can sell you
---
I mean, technically it isn't, but functionally they're the same: run up to mob and go punchy-punchy/wacky-wacky.
---
You on xbox?
---
first time playing in a week, only server i‚Äôve played on.
---
A good veteran player can see when the SBQ is starting her landing protocols and stop firing for 5 seconds.
---
You have to admit, with the exception of the level up one, they can be done pretty quickly though.
---
Hence why this post is still up and I haven‚Äôt deleted it in embarrassment. I totally own this lol. Let this post give others some enjoyment this holiday weekend
---
You can say that about anything having to do with any video game ever. You don‚Äôt NEED to play fo76. You don‚Äôt NEED to have working fast travel. You don‚Äôt NEED to have any bug fixed. It‚Äôs a silly way of looking at it. And really, all you‚Äôre doing is beating down some straw men. No one has ever said that they NEEDED anything. It‚Äôs a game. We know we don‚Äôt need it.
---
You don't see posts because they get deleted, it breaks rule #1 (Nothing to do with fallout 76)
---
.....I‚Äôve collected a lot of shotgun shells
---
Just FYI, the high capacity backpack gives you -60 DR and -60 ER for max 120 carry weight. I use it but my DR is 500+ so it doesn‚Äôt matter for me
---
In a way this update has made me change my play style more than any other; No more lone wanderer and adrenaline perk.
---
I actually like the SBQ fights when someone does their first nuke and blasts all the fast travel points üòÅ
---
FYI game pass games don‚Äôt last forever, usually 6 months to a year before they rotate out
---
Well, why wouldn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs a beast in NW. I didnt realize ppl thought it operated by diff rules. Besides, if you think I‚Äôm leaving my bush to tag the SB, you‚Äôre crazy ;)
---
He usually can't, since the damage done in pvp is capped. Could be you were low life or something. But There are some Developer weapons which don't have a level requirement but deal damage like a max level weapon. Also, some weapons are hacked to deal additional ballistic and energy damage.
---
Im a merchant roleplay soo I got charisma and trade perks
---
nocturnal bash 250 handmade
---
r/fo76_pvp
---
True, but it will still be nice while it‚Äôs on there. Fallout 4 has been on there for a long time. Maybe it will last longer then 6 months.
---
Are there any reliable places for enemy spawns in NW or is it completely random?
---
That‚Äôs still a ridiculously low number hahga
---
r/market76
---
yes!
---
Most people did the math wrong sadly, doing 100 levels instead of 99 because you start at level 1 and the first level up is to level 2. You can skip a couple dailies as long as you play all the days of douple daily weekend
---
I got thru 5 levels day one, 4 levels day two and then it's been about 2 levels a day once the weeklies were done. I start today at level 15. I'm not super aggressive. What took the most amount of time was gaining an over seer level in 76, should have started a new character. 
---
How many levels will you make it thru on a weekend?
---
I don't even have a smart quip about that, that's just terrible.
---
you have no cool dude of course we want this to be added and if we get enough support Bethesda will add this with no atom shop stuff it would be easy to put new sheet music around the wasteland and if you pick it up you can play new music I don't think they would make it worth anything except trying to find it in game.
---
Shame for xp farmers that server hopping clears is more effective so the most dedicated grinders never see that full bond, lol.
---
Yes, she will literally fall right on top of you ready to loot. Same if she falls back in the fissure or bounces over the fence
---
No clue, although I think I‚Äôve seen a rad scorpion spawn by the river across the Morgantown airport on more than one occasion
---
thjs is the Fallout 76 sub, not the "anything Fallout" sub
---
What's the rare outfit?
---
This\^
---
Apologies. PC player here.
---
The only way I'd think it's acceptable is if they had some different skins for CSA. Literally everyone looks the same when they're wearing it, it's annoying.
---
I think we'll have to wait and see with this one, I wouldn't be surprised if they just forgot to change the text for the drop message and that would be seriously P2W
---
Just picked one up off the ground on ps4. The daily spawned for me today.
---
I mean, I get it, I just feel like there might not be many propel who know that's a thing. It took me a few days to realize that that's what those little blue lines meant, and how the bonus went up.
---
Whatever works for people, I just wanted to let people know.
---
Yup. I plan to use it as a secondary backpack in case I need to do some fast-traveling and am overburdened on my usual 60 carryweight backpack. :D
---
Good idea, I shall look into that, thanks again üëç
---
its just you.
---
Whatever you are smoking I want some!
---
New band
---
Cute. It has nothing to do with attention, I want to engage in actual conversation. I'd rather someone ask because it shows me they are interested in seeing the stats.
---
Another thing given to regular armor from power armor? No.
---
Rant? Grow up and type properly as i have done to you. The armor i speak of was used as an example of cynical marketing. The following items released included the original armor with a simple color change and at that moment i saw what the company was planning and realized that cometics were the only new content i was going to see for a long time. Don't flaunt your foolishness as pride, you're exactly the kind of person they were aiming at.
---
If you can save that unyielding piece. It will come in handy later.
---
It's actually radiation resistance and energy resistance. It doesn't affect damage resistance.
---
I'll upload a pic of both of them but yeah Gauss shotguns hit for the hardest damage in the game, especially in VATS
---
Yes for sure, greatly appreciate it!!
---
I just want a middle finger emote so I can flip every1 off
---
Jesus Fucking Christ I'm not explaining it a third time. Enjoy your ignorance.
---
So your saying most likely way to avoid is log into private server to get daily reset than play normally?
---
Yep, I gained several Overseer levels between unlocks at the end.
---
UF is a really good shout and I forgot all about it. That is of course another excellent way to do it so thanks!
---
What he said
---
A bloodied faster firerate handmade or fixer lol
---
Can you be any whinier?
---
Dope idea.
---
Funny how the people who say these sorts of things often spell "losing" as "loosing".  Might explain why they do not understand basic psychology.  Of course these things are not needed, but the whole system for this event is designed to make one feel like it is or else they miss out which ideally pressures people into reaching for pay to win.
---
Whats your gamer name on psn?
---
I sell DCs and they always sell right away. I am probably putting them up for too low a price.
---
I have no clue, what you are talking about, but it sounds like you are advocating for pay to win tendencies. So hell no.
---
I play daily as well, and am pretty much done with the daily challenges in an hour. The i just go back to how I played before, doing events and generally faffing about. I'm rank 15 as well.
---
If someone who hadn't started yet played 12 hours today they would gain 5 ish ranks from the dailys and weeklies, but after that would have to just grind xp to make up the difference. Levels 6-15 would be over 10,000 score required which would be over 1million xp.
---
You don't have to be a jerk because I'm not as intense as you.
---
Plus people might just advertise whatever they're selling in their vendor.
---
Probably.  
---
It's like built out of the same code as the scrap and repair kits so no one bothered to change the "drop" message, at least partially because they didn't expect people to try and drop what is not only a very limited supply item, but one as beneficial as the lunch box.
---
I‚Äôm having the same issue as well
---
You don't find the 308 rounds cause the MG 42 in this game is just slightly nerfed version of the real deal. Too bad the browning is utter letdown though, really doesn't do the 50cal justice.
---
I wish everyone would launch this way.
---
Please explain what your winning?
---
I got the same thing happen to me.
---
Yeah, join someone private server during the reset. Or if you can't, you can try joining the Public server, 30-60 minutes after the reset happens, hoping that the bugged server fixes themselves
---
I can't imagine the amount of backlash they'd get if they released lunchboxes to the atom shop when they removed atom rewards from daily challenges and the lunchboxes would give you 25% bonus xp.
---
That could be a misleading generic message. The faschnacht winter man power armor helmet said it would be craftable if you dropped it and I'm sure a bunch of people did.. but that was false...
---
i dont like bloodied builds all that much, maybe i will some day, but idk
---
I usually do about half the suggested value. I do anywhere from 20-30. I've sold them high, low, whatever. They're stupid easy to make, but when you've got  Lock Joint and Rad Sores and Swamp Itch, ain't nobody got time for that...
---
Tato Gun
---
That's all I'm sayin'
---
25 bonus xp?
---
You can get the deep pocketed torso but currently there is no option for deep pocketed limbs
---
Yeah it would probably end up with having important npcs disappear or be unable to talk to them because they're stuck in combat with an enemy stuck inside the ground or something like that.
---
Yes and your bond does not reset
---
PA fills the gap between regular armor and legendary armor quite nicely..
---
tanks damage great.. allows you to prance around in nuke zones.. can fall from any height.. if your STR is under 11 it raises your carry weight..
---
PA is perfect for the niche it fills..
---
And what are you winning by doing, in my eyes this game is a glorified single player. If you want to pay to get nothing then go ahead
---
yeah we dont NEED it.
---
 we also no NEED the game to work, or NEED it to be fun or NEED to be entertained.
---
this shit is a non argument.
---
Any of the events in ash heap give at LEAST 10.
---
Although if you walk around there you'll run into 10 before you know it
---
I had my first ever failed SBQ fight the other night. There was a large group of people, and everyone kept staggering her so she would land. For 30 minutes I sat and watched level 200-400 players shoot her while she was in the air. I've only been playing for about a month, and it yook 1 fight for me tk learn not to shoot at her until she is grounded. It is annoying and obnoxious. It almost made me wonder if they were trolling the even just to be assholes. How do players that are that high level not know how the fight works?
---
Go to the Ash Heap spots like Welch or Lewisberg/do events in Ash Heap
---
Tje orbital strike cannon
---
I'd does. I've lost 2000. All that fucking wood collected.
---
Yet Settlers and Raiders out on the outside all attack mobs outside. I can't even tell you how many times I've had to chase down the Raider Hunters or Former Raiders and had to kill all the enemies around for them to actually access the speech menu.
---
Of all the bugs, this is the only one that still never fails to amuse me.
---
It's so random and groovy xD
---
Yeah I did, then afterwards got the ring area where it should drop
---
Uranium Fever event is by far the easiest way to get the 10.
---
I got a ring area where it should be but it wasn't there. Is that what you mean or does it give a precise location when it drops?
---
I use a BSS. But I have also used BPA, ISS, and IPA.  Bloodied is better than Instigating IF you run bloodied. But Instigating is great. I would highly recommend finding a SS version. The faster swing seems to matter more in mob situations to keep you protected and the SS effect works to speed up normal power attack animations so it really buffs both.
---
Im already 100 idk what people are complaining about
---
The worst part is I'm 100% sure that in New Vegas you could scrap ammo types and use the parts to craft other kinds of firepower,  such as armour piercing bullets or more of a different kind. It was quick and entirely compact inside its own crafting window. Instead we got this annoying interface where you spend more time hitting "back" than anything else.
---
I forgot about the monkey stein!
---
For its price it should have the same stats with the P.A helmet ,i didnt buy it and ill never do unless they give it dr/er,howeveri know they wont do it because they will lose revenue from the atomic shop.
---
It was unfortunately just over an hour :/ Unsure what went wrong. Maybe becuase I fast traveled immediately after calling it in from the radio tower.
---
AS a musician i would love this. Maybe gives us some we can actually use to create something.  
---
I'm sad enough that the powered speakers are bugged (their pitch reset on log off)
---
Move your camp is the only way I believe.
---
Some people play for fun and take it chill , if you are gonna cry about it on reddit thats takes time of everyone.
---
Not to mention they can be stacked to gain up to 100% or twice the xp, it also pops up with the same message for when you try dropping vault Tec supply package, I hope it is just a misleading pop up.
---
If you can buy lunch boxes you would be buying 25% bonus xp which you can stack with inspirational and public teams for a 140% xp boost(for events, 40% otherwise), which if you do sbq is kind of op imo.
---
I want a legendary tato thrower.
---
Ive come to the conclusion that it is the mysterious stranger using his down time to learn the bass whilst waiting to save our ass
---
I've got mine just far enough away thats it is useless to stand on, but it gives me a free fast travel location that doesn't drop me in the blast zone.
---
Damn that's not what I wanted to hear lol
---
not lately it isnt.. teams DGAF about anyone who isnt on theirs.. the ones Ive done have been worse that when everyone was solo...
---
You can easily get 140% event xp just by being in a public event team with inspirational and popping a lunchbox
---
So, instead of forming intelligent requests for a better inventory system, we should just  "stop bitching" and drop things on the ground? We should play the game as you see it?
---
See, I classify managing stash space as a "necessary evil". It doesn't make sense over the course of time. It's a limit when looking at it with hard cap limit, sell limit, gold limit, etc... I literally get to the point where I can't do anything else, because I have no where to put anything. Does that sound like a good mechanic to you, or do you think it could stand to see some changes in the future?
---
Noob nukes
---
Any silo, have fun they are brutal.
---
And what are you winning by doing that lol a perk card?
---
I'm only level 30, can I do it?
---
Exactly why I go with melee! I mean melee is more fun in my opinion - just call me butcher Pete. But big guns are so useful. Everyone says they got rid of their final word but it takes down the robots quick and it takes down those bots that have the nuclear keycards in them pretty quickly too!
---
Only PA, no skin option on the SS for me.
---
I've been playing since release and just yesterday did I find my first tse weapon. I think the problem is that not everyone will get their high class legacy weapons.
---
Stalker 40% Swing speed rolling pin
---
prices are set by the players if you really want to get into the whole price thing nothing is at its true price but that's a whole other thing
---
Yes? Leveling up is a big part of the game my guy.  Plus when legendary perk cards come out and you need to scrap perk cards to get them and switch them out you're going to need to level up hundreds of levels.
---
Plot twist: They're secretly another you from the future using a different name and sold you all these plans to avoid months of future grinding.
---
This would be a solution to please everyone.
---
Responder Fireman Outfit
---
Oh, indeed! Thanks for correcting me.
---
That‚Äôs the million dollar question that nobody can seem to answer.  It‚Äôs mainly because the definition of pay to win is personal, and ‚Äúwin‚Äù is ill defined.  In some circles win is any advantage at all.
---
sheepsquatch counts
---
i would try to get one walking around watoga..
---
You are complaining about missing out on a cosmetic item that was for paying members only.  You chose not to pay for that membership when the desired cosmetic was released.
---
If you knew what the plan was for 1st, and you wanted a specific item that was being shown, you should have done your due diligence, and checked up on the game and what was being released for the subscription, every month.  It was listed on their website, so you didn't even have to load the game.  
---
You don't have any room to complain, rant, or whine about this situation.  You missed out.  That sucks.  You you did this to yourself. And now you have to be an adult about it and live with it. Not everyone shares your opinion.  You want membership items without being a member.  End of story.
---
Remains me during a GTAV party on my ps3 i received a private message : Your PSN account gonna be hack in 5hours.
---
I just laughed really hard because the guy send this from "unknown device" but that was an pc and he did a lot of spelling mistake in is message. I just continue to play and kill random player in my path.
---
Huh i'm happy now to playing on pc and don't have any message like this now... (I didn't expect for third tool/cheat but anyway).
---
lode baring is good
---
Scrap. Sometimes I don't have the time/desire to go looking for it. Wish more ppl sold it. I've only come across a few vendors who do.
---
Aye. It's always done that
---
Sugar grove
---
Another good suggestion, thank you :)
---
Right but your not winning anything in this single player game, plus why stress when if I wanted to I could glitch and get 5000% exp and finish score in a day and get a few hundred lvls in a couple hours...
---
If you are a general from enclave quest line then you can eneter the lift, the first rooms are Mr Handy/gutsie,  robobrain and protectron then the is a room on the right in corridor after the laser grid there will be one assaultron.
---
Just go to any ultracite ore spawn, there are several in cranberry bog around the small fissure west of prime.
---
Attempting to harvest them will cause them to spawn scorched, if you harvest them, fast travel away to unload the area, and return they should bug out and look harvestable without having respawned, allowing you to use the harvest option infinitely without removing the ore, allowing you to infinitely spawn scorched around you to kill to your heart's content.
---
This works better in nuke zones as you get from flux stabilizers, and with ore that has good line of sight denial so there are more spawn areas, and those areas are closer to you, there is a particular one in the bog that is very middle of nowhere but when spam harvested you can easily spawn 50+ scorched in a couple seconds. I love that spot, the only issue with it is if you don't loot everything and leave periodically you sheer number of corpses will drag your frame rate to the ground.
---
I got one with chaps in my vendor for 500 (i think that's what i set it at i can't remember right off hand)... I'm on PC
---
You won't be able to get into a silo unless you're an Enclave general, incase you didn't know üëç
---
it's not. the tickets to get them were duped and the price crashed. 
---
You can probably get them now for 1k or less
---
All wallpaper does the same and has done forever.
---
To throw at the people that insta kills legendaries before others can tag it. Like old school shaming.
---
Dock bar? Was this at foundation?
---
It definitely used to be a lot more rare, but these days it seems like everyone is selling both versions for way too many caps (just my opinion).  
---
I have gotten them from events in savage divide (definitely maybe from the jailbreak event) as well as the ticket claim robot at Pleasant valley. 
---
So you are seeing prices from players who value it's rarity but... like I said it seems like a common enough find these days. If you are on PC and want to roleplay as a cowpoke I'll hook you up for free, I have a few of each lol
---
The bond remains while in world. If you switch teams or drop then return, your bond should be the same. As long as you dont leave the world. So playing with an event team them switching to a hunting team and back again after the bond meter is full, means it will remain full after the switch.
---
Uranium Fever is my favourite event in the game. Spawns 3 guaranteed legendaries (when people are nice enough to not insta kill them), you'll pick up a tonne of weapons, black titanium and glowing meat/blood. When the events over, leave the mine and cook all that meat into glowing steaks, hobble over to whitesprings station, equip hard bargain and some mentats and sell all the weapons you've picked up and glowing steaks. Almost maxes out my caps for the day with that one event alone.
---
The quest for the excavator PA makes you fight an assaultron in the area you get it. (Garrahan place i think it's called)
---
People aren‚Äôt selling shotgun shells anymore since the ammo converter was added. I only use shotgun shells so now im running low
---
Oh right, I thought it just reset each time. Good to know, thanks.
---
AngryTurtle tested it,END doesnt work on any piece of armor/underarmor so its 4str 2 per.
---
I agree, plus you might get a bounty so, be careful. But yes, imma do it later
---
Yeah I know what you mean. Something is off with the game when the .45 pipe rifle is much easier to use than the more expensive, shiny looking 3 star bloodied handmade. 
---
From my experience the lever action is slow and terrible and unwieldy, and relatively underpowered compared to the hunting rifle. These pipe weapons are insanely overpowered compared to their nicer looking counterparts. Maybe I just need to put a prime receiver on the lever rifle. I don't know. 
---
Gauss rifle is pretty damn good though. When the game isn't lagging and the gun, despite being charged up, refuses to fire. And I have to charge the shit up again. 
---
Gah. This game. My issue is just that it's unsatisfying. Buying an expensive plan, obtaining a godtier item, and still feeling like my pipe rifle out performs them all.
---
1. Place all your walls and finish building 
---
2. Set all your wallpapers before decorating and wiring
---
3. Decorate and run wires
---
After you've changed your wallpaper once, you can change it again later without it removing everything from the walls.
---
The darn thing still gives rads though it only says the sink is clean unfortunately the water isn't.
---
I love delving into this argument as deep as possible
---
We don‚Äôt NEED to breathe, eat, sleep, shit. We don‚Äôt NEED to live. We WANT to live, eat, sleep, shit, breathe. We don‚Äôt NEED to be comfortable, we want to be comfortable. Desire necessitates need
---
I‚Äôm not for the idea but for truth sake, you can‚Äôt p2w here. It‚Äôs an in game item with game currency, not paid currency.
---
It also tells you that the alien blaster is a devastating weapon capable of completely disintegrating your enemies but that‚Äôs the biggest lie I‚Äôve ever been told in this game. It‚Äôs the worst weapon in the game.
---
Anything to help make life easier. +1
---
This is funny as hell and wtf  at the same time.
---
Wait is that a thing? That's a really good idea
---
There's a glitch where they've been giving the score at 3/5. You're probably being downvoted because this is a widely known, reported and acknowledged by the CMs issue and doesn't really need another post.
---
I‚Äôm just going to be prepared to be disappointed with the load out system which honestly is a waste of time, they really just need to rework the perk system and make certain perks that don‚Äôt actively effect combat i.e lock pick hacking and weight reduction or crafting perks into passives
---
Sometimes the problems are so obtuse it really is easier and less time consuming to store individual pieces from top down and then rebuild from the ground upwards. Try to leave a marker piece eg a single foundation so you can line things up again if it's a right squeeze.
---
The area we are in noe, if you can start the scout quests
---
I had this wierd thing this morning. I was on a team and my game froze. I restarted it [xb1] and instead of Play, the menu said Play On Team. And that was my only option, no private/nw option like normal. So I clicked it and it brought me back to the server with my team. I always played solo, so maybe that's a normal team thing I don't know about.
---

I hate to break it to you, but that's not a bugged survival tent. It's a hop up place it down repeatedly placed tent. I've seen a few do it. Always bugs the SBQ so that she never lands. Even those that stand on top of tents can do it. Annoying, but part of the game, so I sit quietly and just play.
---
That‚Äôs for the backpack right?
---
98 NAR Regional is just north of Whitespring (follow the road past the random encounter hotspot) and always has a Sentry Bot and some Mr. Gutsy. 
---
Watoga and Sugar Grove for Assaultrons, they also have some Mr. Gutsy deeper in the city. The Cranberry Bog has a few military sites for Mr. Gutsy but at level 30 it might be a bit dangerous.
---
Dyer Chemical in the Mire always has a tons of Mr. Gutsy and I always run into one Assaultron.
---
It took me less time to get 30k XP than it did to find 2 people that needed reviving in NW.
---
Sorry, I‚Äôm a little out of the loop. Do they plan on reimbursing us for the lost XP?
---
Shoot the Whitespring robots and they have no qualms about becoming hostile to you for a while. Beware they guard in packs though so running part way through a Silo may actually be easier.
---
Seems like a lot of wasted perk points based on not oneshotting most enemies. Also Lone Wanderer is kinda pointless now unless you must absolutely avoid public groups.

F glitch, Nuke the Wayward

According to your logic you do not need to play this game at all too!

Train station was a score
---
Nope, I changed from blank white to stars wallpaper and all my 20 pebbles poster got stored.
---
You didn‚Äôt lose anything. You got Your score when you did 3/5 of the sub challenges. When you finished up to 5/5 you didn‚Äôt get score because it already awarded
---
Ugh, if I ever hear another acoustic guitar in dropped-D again, it will be too soon.
---
From what I've herd you if you were last logged into nw when reset happens or are on at time of reset the glitch will happen so I avoid nw completely and always log off 15 mins before reset then wait till 1215 to re log haven't had one happen to me yet
---
All of life‚Äôs problems can be solved in this one simple diagram. Thank you kind sir, I have been enlightened
---
Try to snap another foundation to each, then you should be able to delete them.
---
I have an IE of every single rifle and pistol in the game.  I collect them for some strange reason.
---
The pipe revolver rifle is just a beast compared to them all.
---
For me personally its been like it always has. Been finding t60 (especialy around belching betty) around lvl 40-50 ish. Maybe just a string of bad luck?
---
An organic bloody sneak commando can not kill the queen in seconds. Quickly sure, but only magic guns and exploiters with 1000 psycho running thru their veins can drop the queen in seconds.
---
I've found empty station that let me press "craft". If I try it I get "server not responding" for a bit and I can't fast travel until I go to another workbench. 
---
Then after a few minutes I have another power armour chassis, with the parts that would have been on it. Pretty wierd bug, but definitely something up.
---
Read the reply. You may not be losing SCORE points (not XP). Because some of the weekly challenges are giving you the SCORE points when you reach 3 of 5 completed. Unless you were paying attention, you may have missed that. 
---
You don‚Äôt get the SCORE points ***again*** when you hit 5/5.
---
Since this is the most likely reason for your situation, there is nothing to ‚Äòreimburse‚Äô. 
---
As far as being out of the loop, that‚Äôs what the search feature is for. 
---
And as far as downvotes?  Complaining about them is a great way to get more of them. Stop whining about your fake internet points.
---
Wander around the Ash Heap as they appear in numbers in several places. Uranium fever used to be easy MM kils too when 4 players was considered a busy event. When a dozen players turn up its very crowded and your lucky to get shots at most of them.
---
Hmm alright . Looks like I need to rethink my build then . Still worthless at this game and managing my perk cards .
---
The lunchbox were intended to be a micro transaction item, but with all the hate the game got they cut them pre release. Now they implemented them as a seasonal reward.
---
Here's my theory, bc I saw someone's ally at a scorched event the other night and there were no camps nearby. 
---
I think (hope) maybe they're trying to implement companions like idk dogmeat (crossing my fingers) and somehow part of that got accidentally added to the new update? Idk how making or updating a video game even works so I could be so far off but that's what I'd like to think lmao
---
Yeah it's not part of any structure. I literally just put down 2 foundations in front of the throne at my car henge camp. Now I can't store or scrap either. Super frustrating. My camp is ruined
---
True  I guess cloth too
---
What a shitshow
---
I want this to be the new normal.
---
No, it should be cheaper. I'm sick of things that were previously Power Armor exclusive being given to normal armor. They keep pecking away at PA, reducing any reason to ever use it.
---
How is fallout 76 singleplayer?

Every rank goes up by 25 score not 100.
---
I did some grouping for the first time this weekend... Yesterday i got into a group doing Line in the Sand and it was the most fun I've had during the past two months. There were 10 or so of us and every one was a PA heavy gun build. I don't think i saw two identical weapons or pa skins between any of us so it made it a very visually epic battle. Tons of bullets/lasers flying and mowing down wave after wave of scorched!!!
---
Tried it. Now I have 2 more foundations I can't get rid of lol
---
First, 95 is the highest percentage you'll get in vats. It is 100% of the possible hit chance available.
---
Second, vats is bugged and don't work as it should for ages now.
---
What? Do you guys not have mics? -Bethesda Deva

I'm so non confrontational I usually just let ppl take my workshops. I accept that I will probably only have them for a couple minutes. I only take the munitions factory cuz I need ammo. I got one shotted there once though and didn't even fight back. I was just like "ok take it but first lemme grab my ammo" and they let me grab my ammo before I scurried off. Nice of them lmao
---
Is it not pay to win when you can have all the endgame material that gives you inherent buffs faster than everyone else?
---
Back when sbq fights were super laggy I used one and found it to be super effective with no noticeable cool down.
---
Are you sure? I seem to remember my score needing 100 less for the previous rank.
---
I fucking hate battle royalle, specially in fo76 where 80% of players are hiding in bushes. Forcing players to play due fomo is an awful game design.
---
You're not losing score, you were awarded it for doing 3/5 tasks, and you're getting downvoted because everyone is blindly coming on Reddit to rant and not searching - this question gets asked so many times a day it's tiresome to even scroll past it.
---
I get it‚Äôs a free battle pass type of deal but if it requires you to spend all of your time to complete it, that‚Äôs wrong imo. Battle passes I enjoy r the ones you can complete at a casual level, I will continue to play rdro bp but I will never again do a cod bp. If you want me to keep playing your game make it fun and enjoyable, so fuckin tired of chores, I got chores at home grinding games shouldn‚Äôt feel like a chore it‚Äôs supposed to be fun. Btw why u kidding Bethesda ass? They‚Äôre not gonna give anything free to u for trying to support their insane tactics to keep ppl playing
---
572 is low for melee tbh, especially if it only applies conditionally (full health target)
---
There scattered around the map, and they seem to get more dangerous and plentiful as time goes on.
---
They're also detectable by VATS, so you can try constantly scanning if you aren't running from people .
---
Freaking stunning!  It's amazing how much time people spend building cool stuff like this.
---

I know for a fact that upon completing two of the weeklys I did not receive any XP, not had I received any when I reached 3/5 completed.
---
Adrenal reaction, unyielding plus god mode, it's probably be possible!
---
I would keep it and trade it if your not a junkie build
---
I use it on my full health build and it works great, I was such a tank I would hardly ever die. During the encryptid event I would take all three pylons and still tank everything(I would also turn on born survivor specifically for this event and when I wasn‚Äôt wearing PA)
---

---
There‚Äôs probably an argument to be made about this opening up events for easy botting and an even more watered down market of items. This whole thing is keeping me from playing the builds I really like, which are the melee builds, because unless I get the event solo I just won‚Äôt get any do from it.
---
I do them as needed. If the daily seems easy, I will do it. If it's more annoying than it's worth, I just make it up with the repeatable. Most of the time I get it done because I am doing NW anyway for all the seasonal rewards that are bugged to drop. This way I can make up for everything I missed.
---
When building. You should always put the wallpaper first. Even if it‚Äôs not the one you want. Just pick any wallpaper. THEN decorate it. Because if you decorate and then put a wallpaper it will delete everything on it. 
---
So make sure you put the wallpaper first. Then decorate it. And after that you can switch out the wallpaper to any wallpaper you want, and the decorations won‚Äôt be deleted.
---
This is weird. Usually a message like you get is because it is either floating or something is attached to it.
---
Since I don't think that something is attached, I assumed the foundations are stated as floating. Since you can't delete the added one your foundations are likely for sure bugged. Replacing your camp seems the only solution this far, sadly.
---
You cant change from blank to wallpaper. You have to change a blank wall to a wallpaper before you add posters and conduits. After you change the blank wall to a wallpaper then you can decorate. After that when you change it again to a different wallpaper everything will stay
---
Add it up yourself. You've ranked up 17 times. The first time you ranked up it was 1000, now it's 1425. 17 X 25 = 425. It goes up 25 a rank.
---
Same with baseballs, and you could maybe hit them back.
---
Only if I had the option for this post /s
---
yea good point, but as a starting melee build, it aint bad
---
I just got it actually, and it IS sort of tedius..at least on PC, might be better on console. Are you on console?
---
Grafton steel has lots of mongrels, forgot which map it‚Äôs in though
---
I think a great system is sea of thieves use of text chat, yeah you can type out manually but it has TONS of call outs and different responses, even giving you different ones depending on what you are holding and what you are doing
---
I'm half way to 21. The only thing I've missed so far was the revive players in NW yesterday, but I got 8 or 10 of the xp repeatable instead so I think I'm good
---
You still don't get the point. They came out with that service way too late for someone capable of a self thought to find reasonable to pay for at the time. Unfortunately i didn't take into consideration that the reason companies get away with stunts like this, was also so defensive of their ignorance. This is just the cosmetic im talking about, not a refund of the game. No one is challenging you to a "who wasted the most money and time" contest, you can keep that trophy you made for yourself.
---
With the exploit you can get 8k+ exp a kill. The game is BROKEN. The glitch ruins it for anyone not trying to do it.
---
One of them is partially underground. Maybe that has something to do with it
---
Does it keep going up, even after lvl100?
---
Black water mine has plenty
---
With blank white I mean the white wallpaper, like there is a blank yellow and blank purple one. Just a basic coloured wallpaper. 
---
Should had spelled it better, my bad.
---
I know. It's amazing. Its like a lever action rifle without the shitty poor mag cap and the reload animation. it's much more wieldy to use. I don't like that the supposedly noob weapons at times triumps over the more expensive weapons. That's what angers me about this game. 
---
I like this game. But there's so much bullshit in it that I don't like.
---
If you're running with addictions as a Junkie's build currently then it can be a fun gun to mess around with. If you're not a Junkie's build already, then perhaps try to trade it for something more aligned with what you're doing.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Oh I see what youre saying. I haven't had any problems changing my wallpapers. I'm not sure what happened
---
There is definitely still PA spawning but you have to hit all the spots, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a guaranteed spawn every time or maybe people are just taking it. Even in my private server sometimes the normal places don‚Äôt have any ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I would try to add foundations in a straight line and try each time to remove the first, maybe the terrain is bugged and state objects as floating. Not much more to do tbh, except to replace the whole camp.
---
I have had part of structures become fixed in place
---
I try to add a bridging piece such as another foundation or metal pile and then go back and remove the offending piece. It's hit and miss, might work, or it might still require a server hop to 'reset' the pieces. At one point I resorted to a short move across the road and back which cost caps but solved the problem.
---
well first of all the whole SBQ event is just shitty imo.....then you have the hackers are killing her in 3 seconds whoever had the idea to launch a nuke to farm for mats for a extra 10/20 dmg ammo should of been fire personally i don't even use the prime ammo not worth it the ONLY reason you might see me at a SBQ fight is i need flux for upgrading PA other then that its POOP
---
Not true
---
Lol youre right I don't even play anymore.
---
That boss can occasionally roll as a Colonel Gutsy instead, just a warning.
---
yup, moddable too with the option of mini nukes with slower rate of fire. something like the automatron dlc in f4 but with vehicles

Okay... But the question still stands, without an answer. So while I may be wrong about the score, I merely asked a question, and get down voted for both the original question and the second one! Helpful! Not. I'll never understand this Reddit group.
---
I wish people would sell items for a reasonable price some dude wanted 5 per .50 cal ammo and he was selling a explosive.50 cal with suppressors for 22k

It's almost like it was sarcasm. Crazy!

Holy crap I didn't know they were THAT high, I was thinking 5-10%.
---
The Brotherhood missile sites around Watoga often have high level hostile robots of all varieties.
---
Yeah, that would be awesome.
---
If you want to make sure your camp stays safe and doesn't block the queen, try placing it a bit further up north towards the trainyard. Only a short walk and should stay safe even when somebody just dumps the nuke on the fissure and its surroundings
---
Hey my first award!!!!! Thank you !!

Okay. Then submit a ticket.

Considering I can knock off 10k xp in about 30 min is really not a concern if I miss 500 score from NW

Which means they are killing more creatures. Int is still better
---
Exact amount I don‚Äôt have. But yes the xo required to level up gets slightly higher each time.
---
 No one likes to be left out. No one likes to feel they have wasted time. No one likes to see people enjoying rewards that they missed out on despite putting in lots of effort.
---
Honestly, posts like this feel more disingenuous than well meaning, because not being able to hit the end and that being okay (of course it's okay) isn't the \*point\*. Of course people want to be able to 'finish'. The same way they want to finish a questline, get max rep, or hit level 50. This is one of the biggest gameplay additions to the game we've had, something to keep people engaged with the gameplay between story expansions, and... it caters to one or two playstyles that are for most people hard or impossible to sustain due to live happening. Arguing that "you don't need to get to the end lol" is reductive. Because why wasn't the system created so that more playstyles (Events reward 50/100 SCORE, for example, or a Bullion/Caps to SCORE system, any number of things) could progress evenly.
---
You can do most of your challenges and then grind xp like a madman (my method, Rank 22 so far) and/or log in every single day and hope you don't get sick or have to deal with something that will drag you away for a week or too, and heaven help you if you start a month in not realising how tight the margin for error will be, or else it's Atom town for you buddy! And you and everyone who makes this argument, while talking about people 'dedicating energy to being angry' and 'no big deal' and 'just have fun', quietly ignore the fact that *by design this is a predatory system* designed to make people spend money on Atoms when they hit later ranks and realise they'll have 'wasted their time' if they don't. 
---
I repeat. No one likes to be left out. No one likes to feel they have wasted time. No one likes to see people enjoying rewards that they missed out on despite putting in lots of effort. Bethesda's monetisation guys know this and it's the entire point of making ranks purchasable later on.
---
Some of the NW dailies you can finish without firing a single bullet at anybody. 
---
I usually finish my challenge and don't even finish the match.
---
I just need a Leg Day Bae
---
Yea but since armor piercing effects are multiplicative not additive they usually don't affect that much. Since you might have AA weapon or perks that give armor piercing already.
---
I thought the NW daily gave 250 same as non-NW dailies. That means 30k xp through the repeatable much of which you will earn whilst doing your normal queats/challenges/events anyway. No special effort involved, no panic needed.
---
21k to 30k according to the modus price tool
---
Glad to hear that! I play on PS4, but selling plans very cheap too. When i started playing and met such traders i was very surprised too, never met such a good community
---
Yes. Been spending way too much time in NW to get that sweet Glow in the Dark Skeleton Outfit.
---
Very nice! You have a good eye for composition. Kudos!
---
Have you tried reverse psychology and requestiong a pipe to get a fix?
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm so excited for always had problems in the past finding people to do events with this update has definitely helped. Glad your having a good time mowing down enemies!!
---
This one took more time thank thought it would (4 matches, though 2 of those were super short). Best bet is to find in the woods in my experience.
---
Lol Modus. Love it üëç
---
Yeah that‚Äôs exactly where I usually put it, near the tree line there. Unless it‚Äôs taken, in that case I drop it right in that little tree/bush area between the bunker and the shed with workbenches.
---
Imo the secret service armor cost to much and is way to much farming, just to get the whole set it takes 24 days......... that‚Äôs a little crazy for a random price of gear imo
---
I don‚Äôt have fallout first for personal reasons and I enjoy playing on public teams and helping newer players level up by launching nukes, I could say the same about you, if you‚Äôd like to farm hoards feel free to do it on a private server rather than making it a pain in the butt for everyone else
---
The actual argument is "why are people upset, I don't want to see negativity, don't be mean to papa Bethesda!" most of the time. Not saying that's the case all the time, or in OPs  case, but it does often seem to be the motivation. After all, telling people not to be dissatisfied is a pretty irrational thing to ask/expect in the first place.
---
Col down is estimated at 30 seconds. 
---
However as a full-time PA user iüòâ question this. Many factor come into play. But if u want a guaranteed way of not having to worry about stimming in most fights (encryptid aside) it's a great mod.

The final bundle has a few items to it. YouTuber Rifle  Gaming did a FULL breakdown of all the rewards a little while back. For the final rank we get a planetarium lamp, a  Jangles Beer Stein (like the fasnacht one) to sit on your beer stein display (so we'll be getting more of those as we go along), a framed game board of the race the cosmos game, and a dark matter captain cosmos jet pack ski. And PA skin.
---
So depending on how into display items and the whole Captain Cosmos theme you are...
---
I would take thru hiker the agility and put the 2 points into a different category.
---
You took your first step towards the dark side...
---
I don't think you understand your own point.  You're complaining about not having an "exclusive" item only for subscribers, while in turn, not being a subscriber.  
---
It's just like complaining about choosing not to buy a pre order for the exclusives, and then complaining about not getting the exclusives at a later date.

I've had no problems with score so far, I got to atom store and just play normally, but I do server hop quite frequently shopping and looking for livelier servers etc, I'm at No.17 I think on the ledge run.

Fallout 1st's workshop retention is something they have said they are working on, but as it stands it is not a feature that is in effect.
---
when you build in workshops a lot of the resources come from the workshops stash. If it's green it's not your junk being used. You probably lost 5 gears or something.

It‚Äôs a world we‚Äôd like to live in vs the world we have to live in.

Thanks! It's nice to finally feel like it's done.

Haven't heard a better way to describe this game lol

Really great video. I enjoyed that.

Very convenient how the solution to this will be to buy Atom in just over a week right?

---
Tato gun!
---
I mean, if it will annoy you, we can try?
---
What is this and how do you start it?
---
You can join a public team and fast travel to your teammates for free. You could try that. or look for people who have a similar level on the map and invite them to a team. And then make the team into a public team so you get some kind of benefit.
---
I stopped selling plans a long time ago. I had so many that it actually took up weight in storage. I mean good plans to. A lot of them sold but like it would take people too much time to stop by my place you know.

Workshops are awfull since release, 1st doesn't change much.
---
For acid, try to farm crickets on top of tangra town, each server gives about 50 acid. Almost all resources are available from mobs and are easy farmable with serverhopping.
---
It is. I don't think they intended the bug or are leaving it in on purpose. But the unintended effect is yeah. Some people may buy more atoms to get what they might miss.
---
They do care when affects their profit. They are always quick to address anything that dupes Atom Shop items or gives atoms unearned... As this exploit would potentially keep people from spending 150 Atoms to level up, they will likely patch it quickly.
---
Are you really that deluded that you believe that only bloodied builds will be able to finish the season? Lol

---
I bet in just over a week they will point you to purchase the missed out on ranks for only 150 Atom.
---
What annoys me is this problem existed before SCORE.  However it was seemingly ignored, and all so conveniently they offer the skip levels for Atom.  
---
Create a problem, and sell the solution. - Bethesda.

Was going for passive collection while watching some Netflix (yaay, COVID quarantine! ugh).  But I appreciate the advice.

I've never seen anyone selling either.

Waste of budget
---
There is a foundation underground attached to the one above?
---
There is a way tho, but it requires some lil exploit.
---
You can place a stair to lead halfway underground, when placing a rug with a instrument before to the lower stairs you can move the whole stair, place it so the instrument is underground and klick on the instrument. This will port you down, exit the instrument and delete the foundation.
---
This will be tricky If you never done it, might search on YouTube for " underground camp instrument" or something.

I personally think we should get atleast 150 score points per event, it's only fair. 
---
I wish you, and everyone all the best!
---
You do realize that they started releasing previous limited cosmetics from the atom shop, what's the harm in doing so for people actually paying for a service.
---
Someone dropped one for me and I didn‚Äôt realize they were a rare outfit so I just dropped it for a lower level player lol
---
https://youtu.be/cARyv637EeA
---
Imagine not looking at the hundreds of other posts saying this
---
Are you a bloodied player?
---
So let me get this right, you lost power in a thunder storm and are mad at the game? I really don't see how that's on Bethesda at all. Why don't you complain about your power company not being able to keep the lights on.
---
6k I paid for the suit it took me weeks to eventually find it. But tokens will not be cheap my man they‚Äôll be going for 100 caps each.
---
Just got rank 23
---
I think they should make Beer/glass bottles a weapon. They could be melee with low durability, or they could be thrown weapons that are a little like Molotovs, except instead of fire they leave broken glass that makes enemies that stand on it bleed. They could also let you put different stuff in it like diseased/parasitic water or acid, stuff like that. It would make bottles actually worth picking up, and not just a source of glass shards.
---
Yup you should quit
---
In its current state it is useless to most ammo consumers I would agree. If you use the trading forums you could easily acquire large amounts of ammo with little effort.
---
I‚Äôm just stoked more people are doing project paradise and radiation rumble, those are the best events imo and people hardly did them until the public teams addition. Also I‚Äôm really loving that sweet xp boost
---
if it worked like a merchant in a way (with no reset on the current bank) i'm sure it would be more effective. the Currency total is always  Your total + their total = 2K, so you empty it out to get your 2K Ammo Credits, then you buy 1K of credit's value in ammo, the remaining chunk remains in the machine and does not reset.  buy/sell rates can remain the same, but the UI is the biggest complaint of the thing.
---
What I find most ingenious about this bug.  It existed before SCORE was released, NW players often moaned about it. 
---
They KNEW this bug existed, but left it in.  If they did not intend this bug to remain why not offer a solution to those affected? 
---
The answer is simple, in just over a week you can buy the next rank for Atom, many but not all will purchase Atom to level up and get the cosmetics.  Does not need to be over 40% of affected players before they're making a significant amount of money.
---
They have seemingly and I admit allegedly created a system, saw the bug, and engineered a profitable solution to bypass the bug.
---
I was joining public teams for events and stuff but they were just running around killing ghouls and vendor hopping the whole time. Every time I joined a new one, everyone would eventually leave the team =( I don‚Äôt like playing alone, wish public teams was working better for me..
---
I wouldn't care too much for the season if it wasn't for the fact that my 1200 atom black bird paint set doesn't work on the t65 and the end of the season is the only place where I can get a t65 skin currently.
---
The conversion rate of this machine is garbage and not worth our time. I found someone giving away 10k rounds of 5mm for free in their vendor so I took it to either convert or sell. I did the math and converting 10k 5mm into .45 rounds would give me a whopping 522 rounds. That's insulting and I can not believe someone not only got paid to design this but I'm sure multiple people were actually paid real money to approve of this. 
---
I used to hate people who use exploits and glitches to get what they want in this game but now I say fuck it, Bethesda does not value our time. I don't feel bad at all about glitching my way to Ally with both factions. At least now I can get 200 rounds of 5.56 in less than an hour with the machine from raiders. Using it for .45 is pointless as it makes like 10 rounds every 30 minutes.
---
You must just be lucky. I've never seen a single suit for sale. Loads of fixer plans, croc backpacks and stuff like that but no suit.
---
Thanks I try this
---
liberty prime bundle did not come with an emote, it was just to power armor paints
---
Lever Actions are great rifles with a good balance of powers, magazines size, fire rate and reload. A Junkies legendary however is really only boosted for Junkies, if your not one then you'll be limited to using it as a basic FF which a useful improvement on the baseline rifle but easy beaten.
---
For me, it's because I hoard every piece of crafting material and fusion core I can get my hands on.   In the early game, before you start ranking up certain perks, you can tear through a lot of material just maintaining you equipment.   However, once you start raking up durability perks, you use less materials and materials start piling up.
---
Do I need 500 screw or 90+ fusion cores?  No. 
---
But, you start getting a little extra of something 'Just in Case' and well.....
---
Burning mine, or just do uranium fever
---
At a certain point, if you planned your build properly, levels are pretty pointless. Only if you need to respec do they matter after about 55-60. 
---
And until the Legendary Perks come out, that‚Äôs a moot point. 
---
Gaining levels isn‚Äôt ‚Äòwinning‚Äô.
---
then tell me why and bring an argument.
---
/r/iamverysmart material
---
oh ok
---
because at first it sounded like you put it next to the trees directly north of the bunker which could interfere with the queen
---
Like I said, if it's my nuke I'll put it where I want but if it's someone else's nuke I'll stage it well away from the fight.
---
The bundle is only the power armour paints.
---
We're trying to book it, but the bot in the soldier mask keeps says he doesn't think we're a "good fit". Apparently he doesn't think a band that only plays Country Roads in a range of interpretative jazz styling "has enough appeal for the masses". Such a mainstream poser. üò©
---
A couple of weeks ago I got a Nocturnal reflecting blocking rolling pin. It is the worst, but now hangs on the wall in my kitchen.
---
Weeks of server hopping was awful but yeah i was lucky. It‚Äôs normally the high level players around 200+ that will most likely sell it. Save your caps for it, you‚Äôll come across one eventually.
---
Monster Bash will spawn quite a few legendary ghouls and almost nobody does that event.
---
dont compare my favorite lift day to NW challenges. im angy now
---
Just build the extractors and the generators. Do retake missions when it pop. Collect acid and repair whatever maybe broken. Play the game as you wish between retakes. Not sure why you are making you life more difficult than neccessary.
---
I started near the periphery, picked up some weapons, then kept running around in nature with occasional vats targeting. Eventually killed a bloatfly, a scorched, and a ghoul I think then went on to play.
---
Yesterday I was lucky with the Rez challenge. Someone in my team was afk at the ring edge and so she kept dying and I kept reviving her. So lucky!
---
I have not played NW.
---
Yes. Even with selecting ‚Äúback‚Äù to skip running through the whole menu each time it was rather time consuming. 45 minutes to get 2K rounds of ammo. Since I have resources stockpiled I can craft that amount in a matter of a few minutes.
---
I had that one too, I was confused for a second
---
I *just* got the Skeleton outfit yesterday, I was so fucking happy!
---
if bethesda fixes NW so u can play it without changing your language , then more people would play it, besides people that dont like NW and dont even mention it to start a game.
---
Woke up to three vids from 3 dif youtubers this morning about god mode xp glitch hitting 100 in bout 5 mins. So there‚Äôs that.  Made me lose all motivation to log on
---
At this point pretty much have it all besides the last christmas item.
---
first question you need to answer, what weapons do you like the most? Heavy, Rifles, Auto Rifles, Pistols, Auto Pistols, Shotguns, Etc.?
---
Sutton has some. But you just have to play the matches and you will find them.
---
I only play it for the score now. I have absolutely no desire to play NW otherwise.
---
i didnt mention this, everything can be cancled, so if people really want to get to 100 they need to do it/ people that miss double xp weekends too.
---
Line in the sand is a nightmare with this glitch. The scorched don‚Äôt take any damage more than half the time.
---
Hear me out, tato launcher.
---
I'm only rank 15.
---
I have been getting the same thing
---
That's the dumbest thing. The cycle for me used to be to clip a wing with a shotgun, let her land and then lay into her. Bonus if you have someone with a cryolator that can freeze her on the ground.
---
For some reason, I found it difficult to get rid of my *** Quad Single Shot Revolver. Reloading that was so ridiculous, that it just was a "gift" that kept giving. Finally scripped it to free weight in stash. Still missing the comedy value of that reloading animation that went on and on and on and on...
---
Only the event.
---
And if you do all the dailies and weeklies, it's said that the free atoms you get along the way could pay for the last 9 or 10 ranks on the board. We'll be just fine without NW. If not, oh well I miss out on one or PA skins that I'll never use.
---
not all people have high int / consumables to gain as much xp as u do. for some people its a grind.
---
Only one argument needed, but I'll give you two.
---
Firstly, All the people that stated it wasn't mathematically possible didn't take the 10k xp repeatable or the double S.C.O.R.E. events into account.
---
Second argument, which is just a theory, is that the season might not be 10 weeks long. Bethesda said "around 10 weeks" and "through mid september". 15th Sept is 11 weeks, but more likely 14th Sept is 76 days.
---
Honestly at this point I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôve been using the same build for so long
---
I've wanted that since I played Lisa the painful
---
Appreciate it, thanks!
---
Has the stings and things quest triggered? Also what‚Äôs showing as required for the tadpole quest.
---
Your bandwidth isn‚Äôt really relevant to your ping. Not only that, you‚Äôre testing against two different servers so the measurements aren‚Äôt related. The path from your ISP to the Bethesda servers can be congested or unoptimized (more hops than needed) which is reflected in your ping. If you care to diagnose this further, trace route is your friend but 300ms is very high.
---
it is not expensive. People have duped the tickets so many times it is not worth anything anymore.
---
If you rad x take a diluted one right after. It'll cancel out the full power one and you'll have you're mutations back.
---
really hard to help out until you pick a weapon type. or you can just stick to what you got

Closing up on Rank 19. Been non-eventing today and haven't even finished dailies but I'll squeeze in an hour later and should hopefully be at 20 by snooze time.
---
Wrong!!! I need the sheepsquatch plushie üêë
---
Imo run a build that's fun, I run a junkies heavy PA build the game is still challenging in some aspects. Whereas a bloodied build, pros: nothing is a challenge, cons : nothing is a challenge
---
Yup!
---
Maybe I‚Äôll go with a heavy build since Action Hero is pretty good
---
It‚Äôs been duped to hell and back.
---
Best option is ask on the market pages for offers or buy it from a player vendor (8-10k usually)
---
Yesterday someone was nice enough to just drop the plan for free.
---
no i think one of the CMs said they plan to add them in the future
---
Not great, Anti armour is a tiny % on energy weapons and 1 agility is negligible.
---
The best pirchfork in the game, I'd at least be a little proud of it.
---
Make sure your game is updated.
---
This will most likely lead to a dupe
---
It's still there, I had one drop two days ago.
---
Yea, that‚Äôs why I want a new build. My TSE Rifle is getting boring because the two-shot reduces accuracy and the explosive shots destroys weapon condition
---
Oh OK, I'm not very techy, I'll just live with it, there's nothing I can do about it anyway. 
---
Given the state of the world, I'm literally counting my blessings to be alive and able to indulge in frivolous home entertainment.
---
Thanks, peace and stay safe üëç
---
Got mine last Friday, so they are still there. Hang in there!
---
just for people that dont know it, not all people play as much as others so they know how much they really need to do to get to 100
---
unless you want to Sacrifice the arguably best perk for big guns (Stabilized) you are gonna need to Spec in to a big guns PA build
---
I began playing start of January this year, after getting it for Christmas.
---
I've ssen maybe four emotes I've never seen in the Atomshop,
---
Chicken wire?
---
i went to buy one for an alt yesterday and some nice person gave me one for free as well.
---
Please explain how he is duping... Step by step.. For research purposes

400 score points through rank 20.. Haven't missed a challenge yet and occasionally take an hour or two on my xp farming route

---
It never activated the stings and things quest when I spoke to him, and for the tadpole it still says to control pests at dolly sods, clean up KCC, and earn scout world badges.
---
Because I was passively collecting while watching a movie in a small always-on-top window.  That let the turrets do the bulk of the work.  If they kept up the pewpew for too long I cold always step into the fight.  
---
But do go on, please.  It's so illuminating.
---
&gt;How do players that are that high level not know how the fight works?
---
not everyone is a good gamer, some are just people who only plays fallout and never really delve on the game mechanic. Its not only SBQ, even encryptid sometimes has 0 people activating pylons or the one who done it dies in matters of seconds, lul. The Project Paradise was too, people tried it without knowing how to do it and just gunning those radstags without depositing the venisons. And both encryptid and PP has a big glaring font guiding players...
---
I‚Äôve got it, and I‚Äôve sold it once for like 15k the second that dropped. I‚Äôm not overly bothered but it really is a nice little bonus to get it and gives a little extra to the event as well as a bit of recompense for the constant 1800 caps for the card.
---
It‚Äôs just annoying me that apparently it‚Äôs never dropping at all anymore, and even in those last 20 odd runs I‚Äôve only got the impostor outfit once even, otherwise the drops have been the mascot outfit, fedoras, or the assaultron head plan.  
---
I just wanna know if it‚Äôs dropping for anyone
---
Quad single shot revolver? I'm not sure which weapon that is as I don't typically use pistols. Though a ridiculously long reload animation that is much longer than it was meant to be does sound funny.
---
18 is on track
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs nice to have a tactical helmet with a flashlight and all, but yeah, 1650 gold bullion is just too much, the helmet doesn‚Äôt even protect you!
---
MooseScience^¬ÆÔ∏è
---
Well what type of weapon is your favourite? Just go on from that
---
It should do damage to players while they are in pacifistüòèüî™
---
Cool thanks for letting me know. Least I can rule out it being bugged etc and know it‚Äôs just my endless calamitous luck at play! 
---
All the best.
---
Thanks a lot for letting me know. I‚Äôd rather be desperately unlucky than think I‚Äôm after something that can‚Äôt ever happen. 
---
Cheers!
---
Bethesda will not replace SCORE or unlock challenges. The game is unstable but still quite fun when it works.
---
Is this a huge issue. I keep seeing auto completed but don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever happened to me. Do you guys just get on and they been completed without you getting any score?
---
Honestly, we need people to throw tatoes at us. We're low on caps and it supplements our diet of things we dig out of scorch beast poop.
---
I got mine when a level 300+ dropped one for me. I was about 120 at the time
---
The TSE and Unstoppable Monster have been my most used weapons but I‚Äôve been thinking of heavy weapons for SBQ and other end game events
---
They've been paying out early for me, are you sure this didn't happen?
---
Understandably so! No worries.
---
Heavy weapons are really fun to use imo. Highly recommend
---
Yep I had gain a level, complete an event, and gold star all showing completed a minute after the reset. Gained a level a bit later for real and still no points. I was liking this new addition then I saw the math that I'd need about 10 extra 10k exp point completions in addition to every single score award (NW ones are a PITA for me).  Ok fine I'd still try for that. Now stack this missing 1k plus whatever else come up in the meantime and there's another 10 or more rounds I'll need. I don't see this happening. I play too much already. I play for fun not as a 2nd job. That's why I quit playing some MMO's I loved. It was too much like a 2nd job. I guess I could spend real money on it and I've seriously considering buying fallout first but I'm just enabling Todd's excuse that we can't expand stashes anymore because of server stability.
---
Kids, grow up and stop bragging about pointless videogame levels.
---
It‚Äôs complicated. But it‚Äôs my life.
---
Happens to me too. :-/
---
I started playing the start of January this years, I got the game at Christmas.
---
I've seen about four emotes never in the Atomshop and would like the chance  to buy them. A friend has this 'No' one that  shows a stop sign and your character waves a hand in front of them...he said it was a free gift one week.
---
I'm still kick myself for not getting the Grognak emote when it was separate from the bundle the week it came out.
---
So really, just offer the rarer emotes occasionally. I bought the Flyboy one because I knew I'd regret missing it too. Wasn't too fussed about the bundle, even though the outfit did look good.
---
As much fun as PA is I like having flexibility in my builds so a Min-Max build isn‚Äôt the best fit for me
---
üòÇ A lot of players do, for 200 + caps each. On Xbox anyways
---
Weird usually the queen doesnt land for me and my buddies and we just vats crit her head and she dies real fast
---
pretty safe bet lmao

Woah we got a bad ass Bethesda stan here guys. Better disperse.

---
I usually ru. The arnoured backpack day to day and switch to the high capacity when I get over weight
---
not exactly doable for a bloodied heavy build lol
---
They look fun, they‚Äôre everywhere in the endgame events
---
This happened with me yesterday.
---
I found a solution:
---
Snap a stair to one of your foundation that you want to delete. Add a single floor tile to the stair. Snap a second stair from the floor tile that connects to the foundation. Delete the first stair. Delete the floor tile. Delete the second stair. Now you can delete the fonduations.

Excellent thank you. Seems many people are getting them and I‚Äôm just being desperately unlucky after my previous good luck with it.

Thanks for letting me know.
---
yes, i would play NW also only because of score, but if u cant play NW because your game language is not english u cant log in NW and play it.
---
Google godmode fallout 76
---
That's not so bad really. Every one I've had has been 'complete events in a team' and people are often running teams. So to clear that daily I just hop on someone's team during a mission, then leave afterwards if we're not going to keep hopping between events.
---
Made me laugh a bit to, although I do understand the frustration with losing lots of items in the game. Happens to the best of us.

Got a laugh from him being mad he lost a dozen acid....

Hang in there man and good luck.

Yeah I think fallout 4 is gone now because it doesn‚Äôt work for me anymore

25th duplicate post today when does this end
---
I had one not register but a short while later I mysteriously gained a chunk of score and a rank...i assume it was delayed somehow which would back up what several other people have reported. But does this happen to all, or is there a million unclaimed points floating on data caches around the world?
---
Is it possible you completed both quests shortly before starting the Tadpole quest? Maybe they‚Äôre on cooldown?
---
What types of weapons do you prefer. That's the first question.
---
If anyone still needs this I do too and I‚Äôm on XBOX as ‚Äúnivag1213‚Äù Message me!

It worked! Thank you soooo much dude

I'm pretty sure I'm not understanding this correctly but you gotta do the challenges. 
---
Go to the menu to see the tadpole challenges.
---
I'll add you if you want to join in with the public teams.
---
People buy out my antibiotics every time within the hour. Madness I tell you.
---
You guys are trying to act high and mighty, but you're missing the principle. I feel like you guys read similar threads on FREE TO PLAY GAMES and just copied what you saw there. Regurgitating it. This game is paid for, albeit cheaper now, AND it comes with a monthly subscription component. Additionally, this system didn't just get added on top of the already existing game we had. This system REPLACED one of the systems we already used. So now we make less atoms, pay 15 bucks a month, and we paid for the game originally. Now I get less rewards I actually want, and I can't get all of the new stuff they are offering. THAT is the problem. Stop trying to gloss it over as people being dumb.
---
Probably a bug and you just didn't get it.  It do be like that.
---
Yeah. The damage some of them can put out is insane
---
Instigating 33 vats hit chance lever action stacked with gun fu and adrenaline (when it worked).
---
If you go to the random spawn points for trying to get the halloween witch costume, one of the possible spawns is a tank surrounded by robots protecting it. There is always one assaultron among them.
---
 thats what i said ? it is possible if u do the repeatable quest 3,5 times a day, for the people that dont play nw and dont vet the NW challenge score everyday. and there are no double score events ? tell me what that is or means because u are the first guy that mentioned it. and as long as we dont know the exact date it ends you cant say they gonna make it 100% 11 weeks long, so people might want to be on the safe side and do the quest a few times a day.
---
I got a bloodied board.
---
You also don't NEED to beat the mainstorry or play the game in the first place.
---
But where is the purpose of a system where even hardcore nolifer is scared they won't make it even if they play several hours a day? Just miss out a few days and RIP. Systems like score should only force you to play half the time, about 50% which would be 45days out of the 90 the season is active.
---
Telling not NEED to play content we should play since they were implemented is just stupid.
---
If you can only play a few hours a week, you were missing out on atoms from challenges just as much as you're missing out on rewards from the score system
---
All the weekly challenges that had a X/5 requirement gave you the S.C.O.R.E. when you completed 3/5. It was a bug that worked in our favor. You did get the SCORE, it was just earlier then expected.
---
It's ok its fallouts version of fortnite
---
You can still save levels for the legendary perks.  Also more xp means faster score progression.
---
Excellent specific, clear and detailed post. It‚Äôs not useful to me personally, but I believe it will and could be to a lot of people and all makes absolute sense and outlines good ways to maximise your potential, whilst also taking a less than surreptitious swipe at the overlords. 
---
It ticks all the boxes!
---
have we been playing the same game?  watching the same company run it and their reputation into the ground?
---
i'd be all for this, IF it landed in the game as either a straight atom shop purpose or just a free new goody spread out in the wasteland.
---
going off their current track record and business practices, they would most likely add it as yet another thing hidden behind a daily repetitious grind or locked away in the utter scam the new season system is.
---
if the game was in a state where i wasn't missing 2500 score, where i lose daily quests because the latest build can't remain stable for more that 20 mins at a time, or where they lock legitimately cool content behind an absurd daily grind or a massive glob of atoms, i would trust them to not rake us over the coals for a few new songs.
---
to give you a good example, they KNEW the scrap boxes, lunchboxes, and fireworks would not sell well in the atom shop.  so what did they do?  put us in a position where we HAVE to waste either atoms or our time and get force fed them.
---
ya'll want music sheets?  cool.  me, i want a fully functioning game and a reasonable economy in it.  when bethesda gets their shit straight and starts treating us like players rather than bipedal wallets and slaves, then we can talk about them adding more stuff in without them screwing it up.
---
I do events teams to knock out the dailies as usually one of them needs it and its good for the extra XP and level gaining. 
---
Also I don't have a mic and things like building &amp; RP probably need that.
---
Honestly I just want a team to do Riding Shotgun with for a bit and maybe run drop a nuke.
---
i dont take atoms into this, people might want to buy others things with it and not for the rewards itself..
---
welp I have 5 characters already so I‚Äôm not gonna delete my mule with 1466 pounds of weight to just get a level up
---
The difference is all the atoms I earned didn't go anywhere. If you don't complete the season, the rewards go bye bye. Also, the devs themselves said they expected this to only take most people an hour or two a day.
---
You dont understand logic, full stop.
---
Yes. To get items that also don‚Äôt help you ‚Äòwin‚Äô.
---
Absolutely and when the next season launches this problem will still remain.
---
If you have 5 characters. No point in deleting one of them. In your case just try to get a level up on one of them.
---
I found one! Thanks!
---
Cant craft wood armor. You need to find wood armor than mod it
---
Ahh i didn't know that.. I've gotten an assaultron both of the characters i did it with
---
I ran it three times yesterday and got an extra outfit but no plans.
---
I didn‚Äôt have the caps to keep crafting the card as well.
---
I‚Äôve seen people post that they finally got it to drop, but I think it‚Äôs super low still. Damn RNG
---
You trying to apply it to wood armor, correct?
---
WHAT?
---
I bought the game, have never paid for atoms and will continue to get every new expansion like the upcoming BOS one for free. I can get all of the fluff rewards like a Jangles backpack for free too if I put in the effort. I never bought and have never felt like I need 1st. People who pay for atoms to buy stuff from the shop keep this game 100% free for people like me. I don't need them giving me copious amounts of free atoms so I can get every single thing in the shop that even remotely interests me without paying extra. Whiny, entitled pieces of shit like you need to just quit.
---
DR past 350 has pretty severe diminishing returns
---
No! I don't want weak wood armor, ugh wtf.
---
That's what it's for.

But they...did. Once you lost out on those atoms, they were forever gone and you had to wait until future refreshes. You were forever behind on potential atom gain the instant you skipped a day or even a single challenge. If anything, this system is better because you can grind the repeatable challenge to make up for lost score, while nothing you did would bring back missed atoms
---
There's plenty of things to complain about with seasons but whatever you're trying to argue is not one of them
---
Oh that's sucks. I did not know that.   Is there a way to switch it to English so you can play and claim your score?
---
I know it's not ideal but probly worth it for the score.
---
I do most of that at 25-30 max intelligence. 
---
That is quite doable for all builds.  Without food or Chems my base is 25 in power armor and special of 14
---
Hi! Sorry for the late reply. You have to resave the images to .png format and place them into the photos folder in my documents/my games/fallout76/photos
---
Nice, a reward I can't use.
---
&gt;Sounds to me like this is a "I wasn't prepared and now I'm upset" post.
---
Sounds to me like this is a "I'm better than you even though I'm a clueless idiot" post.
---
It will spawn you in the nuke zone even if you fast travel to things well outside the nuke zone, but won't let you fast travel to nuke zone.  It's very clearly a bug.  The forest near prime is a good example, it will spawn you so far East of it that even if it is far from the nuke zone, it will still stick you well inside the nuke zone.
---
I keep the game playable for you. I'm a piece of shit. A genius response!
---
It's worth checking the challenge. The ones like placing your camp or using 3 stimpacks can readily be completed in a minute or two. I don't have anyone to team with, so I just ignore the ones that require someone else's help.
---
Yeah I should‚Äôve expected it after getting it to drop twice in a row, but it got me thinking after trying over 20 (nearly 30 times) and not seeing it again. 
---
I don‚Äôt mind the cap cost for the event, it‚Äôs the stims that took a hit üòÅ I usually have like 100 but I ran out from tanking the pylons so much without realising.
---
You do both. Thanks for keeping it free but stop feeling entitled when it comes to fluff rewards and we'll be golden.
---
Potential atoms vs actual loot are two different things. I could store the atoms I earned for whatever I want. I can't store the 5 different variants of grass on my armor
---
Keep grinding. The ghillie paints for the other armors are still ahead.
---
How the fuck do you figure that?
---
Look at all these haters. Good for you man! I hope you play the game in a way that you get enjoyment from it. Don‚Äôt worry about what others have, the games enjoyment is between you and yourself.
---
At next seasons level I‚Äôd guess
---
It's ugly anyway
---
Building within your camp goes where you go. You can build in workshops but that stuff disappears when you leave the server.
---
But the building team is not to actually build, it's to just get more xp while questing en killing mobs lol.
---
I agree that the names are confusing though.
---
So I just played 3 matches and found a creature in each match. Not sure if I was lucky or not but I did mostly concentrate on the outskirts of the map all by my lonesome.
---
You can vats target them to make it easier to find them.
---
Ehh. I put the leather version on one of mules. It'll work for now.
---
I don't expect it to do mucg on the queen, but on everything else the 20% mag is noticable with my tasnk killer perk. just wish I had preforating so I get my 20 round clip.
---
Sam site, interesting. I might just try server hopping the Sam site to grind out the plans. Ty for the info
---
Tatoes cause godmode and duping. You equip bloody mess, the person your hitting equips mysterious savior. Bloody mess and mysterious savior proc. The person being hit splits in two, procs godmode, duped character can be traded with. An event horizon is created.
---
Time to go destroy my camp and rebuild after seeing this masterpiece
---
Thanks. Hopefully it makes the journey easier for some players who can't log in every day, as it allows you you make up for a missed daily challenge almost as far as actually doing the challenge. I'm sat at Rank 22 and I barely played yesterday.
---
There you go, there's something close to a valid complaint. The loss of choice and autonomy is a problem
---
Your camp will always stay on the spot where you place it, also all items you place.
---
If someone else have his camp on the same location when you join a server, you get a on screen message where you can say either you want to stay without camp or search another server. If you stay on the server where your camp cannot be placed, it will be there the next time you join a server which has the spot available. 
---
There is a large area where others can't build when you deploy your camp, so if you want to merge two camps into one larger it wont be possible.
---
Anyone have a picture of the SS helmet?
---
Your camp remains in the same spot on the map when you log on. If someone else camp is there you will be given the option to change servers. If you move your camp your structures and items are stored. There's alot of little tricks to learn to make better camps but it's not hard and tons of videos on YouTube
---
Yeah, exactly.
---
It's almost like that's what I said originally but you have no reading comprehension.
---
Same, level 194 (I think).
---
If I'm doing my own thing I start a building group, and someone can join if they want. If I join an event group, I'm jumping to every public event. Some have become more fun since they are busy. Others seem to just be chaotic.
---
Whenever you log back in. Everything is there like normal apart from dropped items in camps. That stays in servers. If someone else has there camp at your spot already. You'll be given a choice to find a new game or to stay in the game without a base. I hope that answers any concerns and feel free to ask about any other questions you may have!
---
Fine job
---
it just sets up the base where it was on the other server?   
---
if there is another player's base, your base wont be there and there will be a message telling you to choose, change server or put your base elsewhere.   
---
and different elevation is the basterd that will force you to make another blueprint for base. Yes, you can't just put your saved building from flat terrain on elevated one.
---
That‚Äôs the highlight of the event.
---
The stimpack sink that just suck the life out of you literally.
---
One of the funnest events honestly, but that damn robots head mount is brutal.
---
Lol Todd just wanted a laugh after creating some more bugs.
---
Yeah I'm at 21. I went fairly hardcore at first but since I did the weeklies first day I've jsut been doing dailies and that's it for the last few days. 
---
I get a lot of level ups by just doing events and farming in similar ways you describe, and it soon adds up just killing stuff. It'll be insane how much you can get done on the 2x weekend if you do even one or two of the things you point out for XP SCORE. 
---
I never used to be bothered about food buffs etc, it was a running joke about my corn soup conglomerate in my friend group, but I've been digging those int and xp food buffs lately man, they really do make a difference.
---
i predicted this over 2 weeks ago, said that if things didn't change we'd only see 2 kinds of parties permanently because exp bonus is no joke.
---

---
People are a piece of shit cause they call out a company on an exploitive practice? And just cause you don‚Äôt need to reach 100 does not make it not exploitive for them to use FOMA to create frustration so people pay for the game.  
---
What ever happened to wanting companies to make games fun in order to get our money? Now we are POS‚Äôs for wanting the company to give us something good in return for our money rather than try to use psychology tricks to get us to pay to make the game fun.
---
I like a little of everything, every weapon has its role after all
---
It gives a precise location when it‚Äòs dropped. It did give me one a while back when it was in final approach, but that no longer applies.
---
Significantly less though. Can barely afford shit with that...
---
i'm sure you weren't buying from me but i've been listing all plans &amp; recipes as 10 caps for a few weeks now! as i see it, known plans aren't useful to me and i'd love if they made someone else happy so :)
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be upset if we got a tatoe launcher.
---
It is absurdly easy to level up in the 200s.  The hardest part of the old atom challenges was not leveling before you got whatever stupid costume was required on for the day.
---
Now you get a ton more XP.  Straight 25% XP food bonus not counting INT food, 15% group bonus, 12% group INT bonus, 24% group bonus from mutation/stranger in numbers.  You can get a level in 10 minutes from some events now.  Even just doing a legendary farm run you can level up in 20 minutes.
---
Price?
---
Should have been a new weapon
---
It might be some time before that happens
---
All right so realistically how much score would you say is possible per hour? Assuming that nobody else is doing this. 
---
Nice clean plan btw.
---
I‚Äôm going to guess most people who argue but you don‚Äôt need to reach level 100 are pretty young and naive. You are spot on though.
---
I only play 3 minutes every second Wednesday.  If I don't get every item ever made for this game, even though I'll never use any of them, I'll sue!
---
Ah it probably just hadn't actually dropped yet then. Thanks!
---
Have you thought about going with a more dedicated build at all? At level 115 you should have enough points to re-spec yourself easily enough.
---
Couple of options come to mind:
---
- Commando / Rifleman / Bow build (primarily perception and agility)
---
- Heavy weapons / Melee / Shotgun build (primarily strength and agility)
---
By swapping out a few perk cards you can switch roles without needing to change SPECIAL distributions once they're set. Crossing Heavy weapons with Rifles, or Rifles with Melee often doesn't work too well as the desired perks are scattered across too many SPECIAL stacks.
---
If you've not used a build planner before then [Nukes and Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) has a nice one to get you going. Here's a [Generic Commando build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f345db&amp;d=sg2pg2ph2pi2pp2p02s01eh2c72ic4l71lt2lu2lv2a30a00a12a70an2a51ar0ao0&amp;m=05142c9fa&amp;n=Commando%20Example) as an example.
---
From a non-Bloodied perspective there are lots of options. Junkies, Furious and Anti-Armor are popular. Personally I've grown fond of Berserker's and run two of them (Commando and Heavy toons).
---
Depends on the context. Some people do pvp in survival mode so good for pvp means good for that. 
---
There's also nuclear winter. Good for that might be like a patch or update to a weapon.
---
So long as the math provided to far is consistent if a person were to play and do every weekly and daily minus Nuclear winter, they wouldn't need a single 100 repeatable (impossible to ignore however, if doing everything) 
---
Since score goes up 25 points per level, with level 1 being 1000 and level 100 being 3500 (assuming every level gets the 25 score increase per), this allows me to assume an average of 2250 score per day to max out (225000 for all 100 levels).  ( yes earlier levels are faster, and later levels are slower)
---
Since (currently) you can get 6x 250 and 1x 500 per daily, this means 1750 daily out of the 2250, leaving 400 score left over.  Now this doesn't include weeklies, which are 6x 1000, and 1x 1500.  This is an additional 7500 per week, and averages to 1071 extra per day if you do all your weeklies.
---
This puts the total up to 2821 per day, if a person does every daily and weekly.  Since nuclear winter is only 250 per day, and we need 2250 per day, can can get up to 2821 per day on average WITHOUT the repeatable 100, this would leave us with 2571 per day WITHOUT nuclear winter, which is still more then the needed 2250.
---
TO CLARIFY This is only if the information show so far stays the same.  That the increase per level is 25 higher then previous and that the amount of SCORE obtainable as daily and weekly is always the same amount.  If we end up getting less score per day/week as time goes on, or if the SCORE goes up in the second and third tier on the map (25 to 50, or 100, or 200 etc), then this won't be accurate and we would need more farming to level up.  This is also going off of 70 days per season (10 weeks).
---
Fusion cores take up 3lbs per core so it's understandable why nobody sells them. Funnily enough I saw a vendor yesterday with 4301 fusion cores at 71 energy. *Wonder where he got those ha-ha.....*
---
300-500? I have periods (a single West Tek run is about 150 and a single solo Line in the Sand is at least 100) where the bar seems to be popping every ten minutes, but the sad reality is that sometimes there will be no decent Events on the map, and you'll have cleared out everywhere you can think of to clear with respawns nowhere in sight. It's usually time for a server jump at that point.
---
Naaa you sounds like a snowflake... i don't want you to melt. Good evening  bud.
---
You said you need to do it to reach rank 100, not just to make up for the NW daily. 
---
&gt;Over the coming months, we‚Äôre planning to release additional patches for Fallout 76, kick off limited-time events, including bonus S.C.O.R.E. weekends
---
RIP raider outpost... 
---
https://i.imgur.com/KdHaUQJ.jpg
---
We should be able to name the teams? Then we‚Äôd be able to say what we wanna do likefor example with the events &gt; ‚ÄòSB Queen‚Äô or ‚Äòradiation rumble‚Äô or for the roleplaying teams (which i haven‚Äôt seen ANYONE use yet) ‚Äòraid a settlement‚Äô or ‚Äòfaction war‚Äô idk but it makes it more unique and encourages actual communication rather than the heart emote lol
---
Bruh moment of the moment.
---
yea its possible to swit h the language but i hate the game in english and then i either have to play all seasons in english or switch it everytime i play NW and that sucks.
---
Just so happens... https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/edit#
---
Right. But you get 40+ cosmetics and other rewards as well directly that you don‚Äôt need to use atoms to buy
---
Thanks for mentioning Double XP. Just added an extra note about lunch boxes.
---
Ah okay. How long did it take between the glowing skeleton and the fur lined coat approximately?
---
Use them to lure out enemies while sneaking
---
I'm at level 14 because I'm an adult with real world obligations. What I wouldn't give to be a kid with 10+ hours a day to play video games...
---
I got power armor bro. In all the right places.
---
Thank you. I just have to be obsessed and not miss a day!
---
whats survival mode?
---
Sure, they'll patch it eventually, but nobody's gonna get banned for using this glitch to get the grind over with.
---
If you're someone who complains about less free daily atoms and in the same post whines about "can't get all of the new stuff they are offering" then yes, you're an ungodly entitled person who I feel absolutely no sympathy for. You're not supposed to have everything for free.
---
First thing I'd check is your internet connection to your PS4, you can do a speed test from the settings menu. 
---
Then I would look at rebuild the database, which is like defragging the HDD. 
---
Other than that, make sure it's got good ventilation.
---
the same argument can be said with having good gear or unlocking new weapons from the settlers/raiders.
---
we dont NEED to do them, but its sure as hell not fun being barred out because of something you cannot control like time or RNG.
---
hell the same can be said about playing fallout 76, you dont NEEEEED to play fallout 76 to pass time we could just lay down and die to speed up life, but we dont do that do we? but at least get get to choose if we play or not, the same cant be said for RNG or time gated content, you cant choose time or dice rolls, doesnt mean we should just not do it at all.
---
my point being is we could just walk away and let the game die because we dont need to do anything but we choose to spend what limited time we have on it because we find the game fun, now if a mechanic changes that fun into a chore its no longer fun is it?
---
thats what the score grind is. a chore. just like RNG legendary grinding.
---
That should supposedly be very OP, I hear!
---
my int is 3 without uny armor, you gain not much, need a lot time to make 30k xp.
---
Thanks for this, now that you‚Äôve mentioned it I will try the firewall because I do have a problem with another game where it doesn‚Äôt let me load past the first screen! My laptop technically shouldn‚Äôt be able to play fallout 4 but I do with no problems and good graphics! Thanks for the advice!
---
Thanks. Im trying to get a good grasp on how "grindy" it is. Everyone says it's not grindy but realistically its gonna take hours to get a ton of score outside of dailys/weeklys which is what I was afraid of.
---
Cool, I get 4-5 T-51b or T-60 skins, both of which I don't even use. I'm just trying to get the one ultracite skin and the Garrahan power armor skin. If only Bethesda didn't remove our atom income and gave us a choice on what to get?
---
Just got to 18 tonight, I feel like that's on track.
---
I do my daily ones in about 1 hour. I'm 50 with 4 kids at home.
---
hurrrrr bootlickurrrr heehee
---
As someone who plays with low Endurance I'd love a helmet that prevents waterborne disease üòÇ I waste way too many disease cures
---
Survival mode is the base fallout 76 with other players. Where the story is etc.
---
I sell fusion cores when I have them. I stopped bothering with 308 cause no one buys it and I don‚Äôt feel like having something sit in my stash box until the rare unicorn that actually buys it comes along. Until the ammo converter I did drop any 308 ammo at my camp for people to take for free but sorry, it‚Äôs worth something to me now.
---
Not worth the time and effort.  I will just use the ammo maker I have now. Super easy-to-use.
---
That's not possible...
---
Someone dropping a nuke on your camp =/= griefing
---
you speak of "entitlement" but your argument screams "my opinion is superior so shut up"
---
talk about entitled.
---
if anything this post im responding to sounds like someone holding a grudge against those who can afford nice things
---
I've literally done every single challenge so far and I am only 19, even the NW ones... I also have been playing insane hours with insane xp. I've not had any challenges auto complete to my knowledge, and you have but are still a higher score than me. Super confusing
---
Ammo maker produces is a lot better then Ammo converter haha. On videos I've watched, it takes about 10-20 minutes to make 200+ 5.56 and that it's very recommended then Ammo converter.
---
I dont know what to say other than its a feature in the game. Your camp should never be permanent.
---
'Tank Killer' has a stagger effect too. So it's not just heavy gunners causing this.
---
The difference with Tank Killer is that it's *required* for commando builds. They can't just take it off, because it also offers armor penetration, which they need.
---
Is this bad though?!
---
Which one, that I'm 50, or have 4 kids or that I do the daily ones in an hour?
---
Yeah, even with this method, it's not fast longterm. Thus the whole burnout joke that isn't really a joke. The little bar might move often with this method, but it's still millions upon millions of xp.
---
Two shot is horrible on it, if you fire it you‚Äôd think your gun is cross eyed.
---
Not a drawback, literally the best feature.  [https://youtu.be/fdRjYD-A2i8](https://youtu.be/fdRjYD-A2i8)
---
That's 4seconds of pewpew
---
Sorry you‚Äôll get stuff you don‚Äôt want? What about the backpacks? Wallpapers? Weapon skins? Do you despise it all? Lol
---
I mean there are tons of legendary effects on weapons that are currently bugged and deal way more DPS than intended. You don't need to use any perks at all and you can one shot basically any mob with a few exceptions maybe. Kind of an odd flex
---
Sounds like a lot of fun
---
You‚Äôll be lost without that scrap box
---
I swear lmao.
---
I scrapped mine.  It was a waste of camp budget and I don't wish to annoy visitors to my camp with drudgery.
---
Very bad. It takes a couple of seconds to use that much ammo.
---
The conversion rates are pretty bad. You gat back between an 8th to a 10th of what you put into it.
---
Why
---
dude, youre too nice to be existing, you out a smile on my face tho, and i thank you
---
You are canceling FO1st because you got nuked on a public server? Odd reasoning.
---
i mean in the title i say it, people that dont play NW, but ok u right for the double score events, but u also dont know if its this season, they stated in the next months, and as we all know they often cancle things and do it even later then what they said so thats not a 100% thing here even if it comes really in the next months.
---
The fact that you're 50 after the first week at only 1 hour a day. I play 80-120 minute sessions almost every day (sometimes every other day) and I'm only 14.
---
I‚Äôve been hearing people getting the Halloween stuff. They received the outfits too.
---
Sorry for responding so late but I updated my graphics drivers, I will try upgrading my motherboard drivers as well, I have not done that in a very long time
---
Then they should just charge for it. Most games would be balanced better for fun play rather than exploit money out of people if companies were more straightforward and charged to play the game. Or even just charged for the cosmetics rather than pretend they are ‚Äúfree‚Äù. You are missing the point it is an exploitive practice that preys on the same mindset that gambling does. They are trying to find that whale that can‚Äôt help himself and throws money at the game and exploit his addictive habits. So not only does it encourage bad game design, it plays on addictive personalities. And you‚Äôre defending it and calling people POS‚Äôs who are calling it out. Yeah there is a POS here but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs who you think it is.
---
Yeah , me too. I only just got there though. I'm about 200 into rank 18
---
I'm nothing yet only level 29 just planning for the future
---
Yikes. Ty friend its going in he garbage.
---
No, that's adventure mode.
---
oh, thought the was called adventure
---
A lot of people price their garbage at "wtf are you smoking" levels all the time. Camp has 60 guns and you think maybe you'll finally find that gun you've been looking for. NOPE. Bunch of garbage ranging from 2k-10k and they're the same decent rolls you saw at the last 4 camps you visited that were less than half the price. Nobody wants your ghoul slayers missile launcher folks...
---
be prepared to rip your hair out when walls refuse to place for no reason
---
Might have to do with the brotherhood of steel coking back
---
I also once heard that pvp servers were once a thing, that true
---
I'm age 50...... I'm rank 18.
---
Was wondering this as well. It definitely didn‚Äôt come from the liberty prime bundle but it is just gone for me too.
---
Not to mention the ui is disgusting.
---
I am always ready to hit that rad x diluted and run north.
---
if only we had some sort of technology to place words into a form of visual thing so we could read conversations rather than having to use emote gestures but would be input physically using a sort of mouse peripheral that has the whole language alphabet on it so we can communicate using a visual style rather than audio for those of us who cannot hear very well or at all.
---
but im sure that kind of convenience and utility hasn't been invented yet.
---
give text chat please :(
---
You need to realize there is more than one way to skin a cat, and great your build works for you but it might not for someone else, even someone doing bloodied like you.  To insist people move perk numbers around to add more to charisma is crazy.
---
I gave up on PS4 and bought the game on Steam.
---
I prefer the backpacks on the atom shop because they fit my style more, and the same goes for the wallpapers. The weapon skins are literally all the weapons I don't use. I don't despise it all, it's just that none of it is for me. I'd be completely fine if I still had some sort of income, but now I can only get stuff I don't want for the next 9-10 weeks unless I pay real world money. I hope the next season is better, but if you're enjoying it keep enjoying it. I'm not telling you not to enjoy it.
---
Congrats fellow dweller!
---
Good point. They're not exactly true to their word 100%. They did state public events would grant SCORE, but went back on that claiming it was an error in the FAQ's. 
---
Hopefully the repeatable XP challenge will switch out to a repeatable complete x number of public events.
---
Do you play NW?
---
Are you on PC? It has to do with auto generated Bethesda.net usernames on steam I believe
---
Do you know how or what for? All I can find on Google is last year's info
---
Well, since the travel time from the caster is horrible the only viable playstyle is in vats. Tho it's a heavy weapon which doesn't fit much into a vats build.
---
Wait, what? How did I misread that?
---
It is, that dude has no clue WTF he is talking about.
---
That applies for Steam players who are not using a Beth.net account. It can be changed by making a Beth.net account and linking it in-game.
---
Yea that‚Äôs not griefing.
---
No problem. The CSA has both environmental and waterborne disease protection on its own, even though it doesn't say it. The helmet on the other hand doesn't, at least in my water testing. Perhaps it's a bug, they mixed up the two.
---
It's okay. We all make mistakes.
---
New event , a colossal problem involves nuking monongah mine. And if your camp is in vicinity of a nuke there. Yknow your camp would be destroyed
---
So you know this and would still go unprepared?
---
Fast travel points put you in the same area &amp; don't roam across the map. You should know and check before travelling.
---
If you know your going to have the possibility of ending up inside a nuke and you don't know how to survive radiation, that is still a problem with planning on your part and not the game.
---
If you know you might respawn inside a nuke during the fight, learn how to use your quick inventory wheel for Radaway. Dress for the occasion. 
---
Or just spend time complaining about losing...
---
Not really a flex, I was trying to convey that i can fly through mobs for xp like nothing.  I don't need a bloody build for that. 
---
Instigating isn't bugged.
---
They are using the gg ez mode
---
\---looses-lunch---
---
Even worse that i do't like olives, at all
---
I don't even mind that you get very little back for what you put in.
---
I just wanna be able to do it in bulk, and frankly in unlimited amounts.
---
The game gives you fair warning, change servers before it hits. You only have yourself to blame for this
---
I was looking for a guide on how best to farm berry mentats just a couple days ago. Thanks for posting. :)
---
It's not official, with last week's patch 20 they accidentally enabled it again.
---
I don‚Äòt think that was griefing. A player maybe was only wanting to farm Flux or stabilizing ingredients.
---
Where‚Äòs your camp located?
---
I think to build a tank, moving away from a buttload of damage but focusing on max health and healing is important.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1c45c7&amp;d=s92sf2ss2sg2se2c72i44a72aa2a42am2pe0lu2l71ej4lt1ee2el2&amp;m=c9fe8gh3
---
A build like this I find tends to be effective as a tank, as you can combo with vanguard or and auto stim armor to take less damage, and cannibal against humanoids is effective if combo‚Äôd with carnivore for good healing.
---
Ahh, that makes sense...I was frustrated because I created a Bethesda account, logged into game, picked awesome player name, but then when in game I was assigned the account name...I may try to change it as you pointed out...thanks
---
ooo - when is the next double xp weekend?
---
24days is not along time to get endgame gear. There should of been a third Rep grind for these Schems.. you gamers are over privileged and have forgotten or never had true MMO roots. (24 days really? ü§®)
---
Welch!!
---
Psh says you.  My water wheel finally spins again!
---
Always. Tbh when I first played F4 I thought the game was glitched lmaooo 
---
I just got it for PC so mods here I come
---
Can‚Äòt wait for it! Do you know any exact date of release?
---
It is possible though, the meta in this game is literally cheating. Everyone is stacking bobbleheads now. It‚Äôs a damn shame
---
You just think everything should be available to everyone, no matter what and no matter how little effort is required. God forbid something completely useless like a monkey backpack be hard to get.
---
Anyone having issues with the 10000 Xp weekly challenge? I had something like 500 xp to go and had to log out. When I logged back in later, it showed I only had 233 Xp. That is some bullshit there.
---
I don't play it normally, but because it now gives score i have done enough to finish dailies there. Except today and yesterday. Decided to grind xp on adventure instead for the 2x250 as it seems the dailies would have taken me longer with the rng elements on them.
---
August 4th with patch 21
---
I have a BE90 Plasma Gat, probably the most OP legacy possible, and a BE90 Flamer and I've retired both of them because the Fixer is simply better, should it be removed too? I get you with hacked weapons and magic weapons, nothing currently obtainable in the game is better than hacked weapons and magic weapons is a straight-up bug, but legacy weapons are not that rare and hard to obtain, plus they are indeed outclassed by a couple of weapons that can be currently obtained in the game; ie. the Fixer, some Handmades, the Bear Fist, the Gauss Minigun (which I agree does not outclass the Plasma Gat, but does almost all others), the Gauss Shotgun, etc.
---
Maybe the next season will better suit your style. 
---
I never said I was enjoying it. Just trying to look at it objectively. I don‚Äôt like the idea of seasons, personally. But objectively I will end up with more stuff at the end of the day than I would have bought from the atomic shop. Also the lunchboxes really put a fun spin on the xp grind, especially with public teams.
---
Yeah that does suck. I'm sorry you have to deal with that.
---
 Seems like a relatively easy fix but Bethesda is after all..Bethesda.
---
Shit, you right im on the wrong game subreddit.
---
probably a BoS season next
---
If you or a friend has first, you can have an easier time on I private and world. Depending on your system, I might be able to help you as I have a power armor hoarding problem
---
Not everyone wants to play gg ez mode, man
---
There were a pvp adventure mode server for a limited time, called survival. There was open pvp without the answer fire to initiate.
---
Pvp was a thing in the first year of fallout 76, but nowadays it's dead as it could be. Some folks still collect viable pvp gear if Bethesda care about non nw pvp again, which will never happen if you ask me.
---
Yeah. Saw a guy use bobbleheads to get insane XP on YouTube, not doing that, first off, I don't have the bobbleheads, and second, it's exploiting, and I like playing too much to get banned.
---
I have a og ps4... n very rarely have any issues.
---
I just had a friend jump off a cliff.
---
It also tells you that your vault suit might not offer the best protection.
---
...I'm level 97, and I ditched my vault suit in Flatwoods at level 5.
---
For cheap weapons, try the bone club or hammer since they only cost bones to repair
---
I'm playing NW again now, I'll update this tomorrow if I get anything else
---
Okay, it just seemed like you were patronizing me for "despising it." I'd just rather have a little bit of what I want then have a lot of stuff I don't really want and I don't like the fact that Bethesda locked us into a paywall for that.
---
When it started there were 70 spaces left on the board suggesting that was the 70 days (7x10).
---
Watoga south
---
I love my cliff camp near the mine, time for a change  üò¢
---
Instigating is indeed one of the bugged ones. Only if you use a shotgun or a fast firing (mainly heavy) weapon though
---
Not accusing you, just informing the op that it‚Äôs possible sorry for any confusion
---
Blackwater mine
---
Oh boy, can they give BOS a rest or at least get creative with it? It's just going to be a bunch of black/grey skins with a BOS symbol on it.
---
need to i say i calculated with 220.000, but i will calculate it just now with 223.000 just to have a gap. 
---
so score with weeklys is 7500
---
score with dailys without NW is 12250(per week)
---
thats 19750 points, * 10 (weeks) are 197.500 points
---
223.000-197.500= 25500 points u need to get with the repeatable 
---
25500/100= 255 times completed
---
255/70(days)= ~3,64... times a day
---
I'm having the same issue
---
it's even a TMBG song SORRY I'M THICK
---
I would assume they rather stick to their superhero franchise they already have.
---
Or make a board game we can find ingame to a seasonal one.
---
It has 100% better accuracy, meaning it‚Äôs twice as likely to hit
---
What platform
---
I'm not sure what you mean.. there are 100 spaces on the board, one for each rank.
---
PS4
---
18/19 one of them. Though I haven't done today's but I'll do them when I wake up in the morning or as long as I do them before 4pm BST.
---
Maybe the Grognak comic on the board is a clue.
---
Haha. Then what am I complaining about lol. Bethesda is doling out advance points.  So in fact it‚Äôs easier to get score?   Thanks for the info.  Much appreciated
---
Is it the same problem I had? If I‚Äôm not mistaken, it looks like the 5/5 weeklies have SCORE awarded after the third is completed, not when all five are, if that makes sense.
---
1. When server hopping, if you already looted one area for a certain resource, there will be a time which is like one day. It‚Äôs weird, sometimes, it works. Go on YouTube and watch angry turtles video about loot respawning. From what I remember, if you loot 200 items somewhere else, then go back to the place you want to re loot, it will spawn again. 
---
2. They wanted to help  you out by buying your vendor and dropping your stuff to sell again. Basically a kind gesture that high level players do sometimes. 
---
3. When I first started, I didn‚Äôt know what was what. The way I learned to value weapons was just by playing the game. As you play more and more, you will start to see a pattern for weapons in terms of price. Mainly, I would look for bloodied, junkies weapons as a start. After that, just see what everyone thinks. Or, go on fed76 to value your weapons if it looks rare to you. You will get a ballpark estimate on the weapon value which is usually accurate. 
---
4. You can‚Äôt really tell if a character is a newbie or a mule. Usually, if you see low levels at the wayward, they are doing their beginning quests meaning that they are probably new to the game. Mules are just below level 10 mostly.
---
5.Becket is weird. He does lots of funny things. Just enjoy those moments until they are patched.
---
Excuse my spelling btw, not in the mood to go over my answer.
---
I think because I just do enough to get the dailies done, and only go up 1 level, which is hard, as I'm level 276, it'll be a struggle later on, if they keep asking for one of the dailies to be "go up a level"
---
I sell 308 for a cap a piece, but lmg players gobble them all up
---
Radscorpions at the trainstation
---
I know.
---
Where do you see Grognak? I'm away and can't check.
---
'Roleplay' team doesn't really serve a practical purpose either. It gives a CHA bonus, but charisma is basically useless. (Perk sharing goes off your *base* CHA, so boosting it is pointless)
---
You're changing the subject again.  You were specifically talking about wanting limited edition items locked behind a service that you don't pay for.  
---
I'm not saying that they won't ever release the subscription items again.  But, you have to realize that they aren't going to do it while they are still making money from said service.  And, IF they do release these subscription only items for just anybody, they will lose subscribers, a.k.a. money.  And they'll make up for it by charging you way more for it.  
---
Give it time.  When they sucked up all the money from 1st, and it starts to dwindle, THEN look for these items.  By that time, it won't be worth it to them.
---
3 times in the past few days! üòÅ it's been months since the last time I got it (well before wastelanders released) I just counted. I seriously have 71 white wolf fedoras from doing the event so much üòÖ
---
16th I believe, they usually start early for an actual weekend and that'd be the Thursday, but according to the roadmap it's that weekend regardless.
---
[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj8wac/psa_here_are_the_nw_christmas_and_halloween/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) what you should recieve
---
can i have your broken fixer?
---
It's the Chinese communist spies.
---
First, the outfits are rare, very rare.
---
And yes, once you collect one you need to collect 180 (iirc it was only 120) different items to make the spawn visible again for you.
---
thanks!
---
Mole Miner claw?
---
Raiders vendor at whitespring has a chance of having them (where I bought mine).
---
Top left, above the board.
---
I read that as misspelled tattoos and I was really confused how you would throw a tattoo. Then my brain caught up.
---
I uninstalled already, maybe next year when I install again.
---
Yes, plus removing legacy weapons just drives the Fixer further into OP territory. The Fixer is the most OP weapon in the game right now and not even legacies can compare. Bethesda has removed duped versions of legacies in the past and specifically left each player with one version, so that proves to me they have no intention of removing them.
---
I totally agree with you: what is necessary is content that actually uses the high-tier equipment in the game, be it legacies or the higher tier weapons that can currently be obtained, from Fixers to Bear Fists to Gauss Shotguns.
---
I was hoping for xbox
---
And the sad part is nobody will be banned for doing it. Yuck.
---
It's as if because this is a digital product it is not really real, and thus doesn't really matter.
---
Glad to hear, sounds like you're taking my share of them of late. 
---
Haha 71 is a bit excessive though I guess I'd have about 40 now if I wasn't scarpping them in disgust alongside the mascot outfit stuff :D
---
Oh yeah, I forgot about the Roleplay public team. I don't think I've ever seen it used.
---
Sorry, forgot to mention my platform..
---
I always just use a fat man with the mirv
---
Todd loves you
---
I put that outfit and the Deathclaw mask on my ally. They look great together!
---
Not a problem
---
Ah he's on xbox one what a shame. Would love that fixer
---
Try to use the expand option while hovering over the wave
---
I have to do mine in the evening, I've very little time otherwise. I'm a "first" subscriber, and I've saved my atoms for the end of the run. So hopefully, if I'm short, I'll be able to buy my way to 100.
---
Have fun
---
Mr Vegas is the best for me but she is definetely great, I can't find her name anywhere
---
Its a berserkers exsplosive
---
I am a full health rifleman.  Only rifles.
---
The amount of people openly posting it on YouTube and still playing is ridiculous.
---
I have now passed 100 hours of looking. Still not found a yellow, forest or red. I only have a yellow because some absolute legend gave it to me as a tip.
---
This is a pretty viable question indeed, did you try to notice the current amount on the weekly tab, play a nw match and compare the value?
---
I'm currently at work, so I sadly can't test it myself.
---
where were you when the nuke warning came up?
---
Way better than shooting the ground!
---
I‚Äôm so FUCKING sorry.
---
Especially if you got vampire two-shot, and put a quad barrel on it. I want Graham to sell this cause I can just hear him saying "I'm gonna mash you, ha ha ha!"
---
At some point I began collecting them so that I can fill up 4 vendors full of them overpriced just enough to keep people from buying them üòÑ
---
Thursday and friday
---
I currently am testing it to find out, but if it is the case the tally of these last 100 matches going into needing 14000 overseer xp may have just gone to waste challenge wise.
---
I know the F76 servers are bad but 6 times? Sure you don't have a bad wifi connection or anything like that? I get 6 disconnect in a span of 3 months max.
---
I wasn't serious. but. See you soon!
---
Like Calvin Ball
---
That's understandable, if I had the same connection issues I'd drop this game too.
---
For a kitchsy themes: A Grognak-themed season where the game board looks like an old-school fantasy board game, with rewards like wizard robes, cobblestone pattern wallpaper, etc.
---
For a less silly theme: A Pioneer Scouts themed season with outdoorsy or rustic themed rewards, and possibly some Tadpole and Possum badges on the reward table.
---
So far I've lost 2 days of dailies.
---
4 times. My wifi is fine wired, 90mbps on download 140 on upload. It only discinnected inside the silo never before in the past 2 months
---
I just got a holiday tree
---
Wtf really? Why are you even playing this game if you only have 3 minutes of play time?
---
I really like this. I don't like the low health high rad builds so this looks awesome
---
Its gonna cost 5 grand minimum
---
No change noticed by me, using a ve90 .50 and all heavy perks on a full uny ss armor and fireproof t3.
---
I am aware the expand option exists, I have lots of emotes that i use. 
---
Just found out they took it off and it was a glitch that some of us even had it in the first place.
---
I got it for a Faschnat mask so its not a big loss
---
Spawn with someone at the edge of fire and put your back in the fire til it downs you. Me and my girl finished it in less than 5 minutes.
---
Is that a banana in the tailpipe?
---
So why do you have an issue with PvP in this game? They can only affect your gameplay if you agree to PvP. How is it such a hard concept that if you don't want to PvP you don't have to, and there's nothing a PvPer can do about it. Can you really not handle someone wasting their bullets or something? 
---
Sorry, but being verbally abused, threatened, or harassed is far worse than your video game avatar getting killed through legitimate game mechanics you opened yourself up to. There's just as many PvE players that do this, and in my personal experience I've seen more of this behavior from PvErs. If you really can't see how someone messaging a person or going online to make a post wishing someone die and be tortured IRL because they picked up their junk bag then this discussion is going to go nowhere.
---
Wow.... Well I only get gamecrashes when playing Nuclear Winter, it's still very rare tho.
---
I'm only running Fireproof 2 so I'm used to it. No noticeable change on my end, but I hope it stacks with the dense chest mod.
---
This is only for this week's weekly challenges. There is still a bug that is not allowing people to get their dailies so still be careful.
---
Humanoid Vomit Cannon
---
Commie theme. From the board game which name I cant recall.
---
Gatling tatoer
---
Yeah, I have a bloodied Deathclaw gauntlet, and can do 1000s of damage, gotten over 20k on a swipe, but who cares? I had an executioners faster swing speed super sledge for levels 50-110 and I loved that thing! And only did like 300 damage with it but in PA and that hammer I solo‚Äôd the nuke silo my first try at level 60. Nobody else can have fun for you. So enjoy that hammer lol!
---
Cool i wont be on till at least 18:30/19:00 though. I‚Äôll throw in a 3* fully modded combat shotgun with explosive damage for free as well. I‚Äôll add your psn tomorrow morning.
---
It's this "cowboy" six shooter, that has a really nice bang-sound when shooting. But reloading is done one bullet at a time and since v.a.t.s. seems to have this "Be a pacifist! With our system every shot is a warning shot!" ideology, you end up running back- and sidewards, muttering sh*t sh*t sh*t and hoping your ass don't get stuck on a tipped over newsstand a lot.;)
---
As a casual player making it a point to log in daily (successfully so far!) I have seen the game say I completed a mission upon login.  Now I have read its only at reset and can be simply visual.
---
The thing is Im casual, I'm not obsessing.  I could spend the next 10 weeks grinding only to learn at the end I got screwed.  Lame
---
Yes im aware. But I‚Äôm a man in a mission lol. My plan is to get every cosmetic in the game. 
---
But thanks! Helped out a lot
---
I hope I'm doing the math wrong as I'm still getting 40k exp per day in leveling
---
Im Still coming up with 12250 per week in daily (1750x7) and 7500 in weeklies
---
10 weeks (70 days)
---
19750 per week, 197500 for 10x weeks
---
197500 divided by 70 days is 2821
---
225k total score needed for rank 100
---
225k for 100 levels divided by 70 days = 3214 per day
---
This leaves 393 score needed per day, right under 4 times.
---
I mis calculated above by counting only 6 daily at 1750, instead of all 7 at 2000.  Had to google an image ü§ó
---
Yeah, I had my camp there a few days ago then I realised it'd get nuked loads so I'm set up in the mire
---
Damn. I see I have a long grind ahead of me. 
---
But mission acknowledged!
---
Dailies are quests, not events. If you're completing dailies on an Events team, you're getting no benefit.
---
Yes there is not an actual level cap to the game. After level 50 you no longer get SPECIAL points, but you can either pick a new perk card or swap the SPECIAL points you have around.
---
I use it to dump mini nukes missiles and 40m Grenades and nothing else really.
---
The FO76 server they‚Äôre probably pinging is the default one in the US. Can you manually set your server?
---
&gt;I mean, technically it isn't
---
I'm sorry... what?
---
The whole origin of the term melee comes from hand-to-hand combat.  The game consistently treats "melee" as a catch-all phrase for 2h, 1h, and Unarmed.
---
I've also done every challenge and grinded my ass off
---
You could get really lucky
---
Do not worry the fix is coming in just over a week when you can purchase the next rank for only 150 Atom.  
---
Please do not read too much into how this bug was known before seasons where on the players radar, or how Bethesda was told of this issue by NW players for literally months beforehand.
---
I've been running Site Bravo for practice so I'll move down to Alpha or Charlie.
---
So, a lemon?
---
Play another game.
---
Its for the bloodied affect
---
Yep, July 16th to 20th. There is a small roadmap of the season here; [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates)
---
Man , I hate leg day . Also anything to do with NW
---
reconnect while being dead using unyielding ;)
---
you dont have to.. unyielding bonus has always been there.. its not new
---
Good god as a vats shotgunner I've never seen vats be described so horrifically accurate.
---
Not even durian?
---
Some high level told me. To skip it since it was bugged and so i did. Anyway i like to buy the ss underamor and shielded mod.
---
Yes, let everyone with these problems play another game. Good idea to kill a game.
---
Why are you here if you hate the game so much?
---
Instigating melee weapons can be decent daily drivers.  One of the first decent Legendaries I ever found was an Instigating Combat Knife with the same effects, and at the time, that was sufficient to cut down a lot of non-boss enemies with a flurry of stabs.  The 40% PA damage is no slouch if you approach your enemies while running with it
---
Yeah but they keep adding something you can benefit from said bonus.
---
I have a feeling they are coming to the atom shop. These are more useful than the repair or scrap kits, you can get free ones from the seasons, and they benefit those around you. This is a prime target for an atom shop utility item. They backed off the whole cosmetic only train last year.
---
It doesn't bother me so much. ESO has xp scrolls for sale so same basic principle. I just know the hate train will come rolling in once they add them to the shop.
---
Very good idea
---
And what happens if it takes more then 10 minutes then it‚Äôs a waste of ammo and scrap for people who use ultracite ammo
---
But ... if you look closely on the picture the ears on the model are glitching thru :p
---
I've been playing since beta and still haven't found a red asylum uniform
---
I‚Äôm apparently a magnet for suppressors, +33% vats hit chance, 90% reduced weight, tire irons.
---
Hey idk if it‚Äôs still possible but there was a glitch where you could get your raider rep all the way up during the duly retirement plan. Check YouTube
---
For some reason all the previous holiday challenges are active again meaning you can grind for them. I find it good because I recently had to switch to PC and start fresh because my Xbox died so I can earn them again. I've been missing my cosmetics I wish my purchases were linked to my beth.net account
---
Have you ever seen a Bloodied Dragon? 2718 is rookie numbers next to that thing.
---
I‚Äôm glad someone else agrees with me
---
No I heard that‚Äôs a hard one to get....
---
I pray you find it soon buddy!
---
Didn't get how unyelding armor is connected to legendary run. You guys have not known the int does bonus to XP or what?
---
But you had some auto complete and you're positive you got no score?
---
Strangler heart got nerfed with the wastelander update, I would rather get the t65 if I haven't had the strangler already. If your up for maximum damage you still want the strangler heart pa tho.
---
The secret service armor has the best merged defense stats, but no set bonus. You can add a jetpack and stabilizer for both arms, so scoped aiming is literally steady as it could be. Beware, there are no deep pockeded mods for the secret service armor.
---
The thing about fallout 76,it just works
---
Thanks. I will check it out.
---
someone just bought 30 from me for 6 a piece, I usually put them at 11 but i need to clear out some shelves
---
There ways to buff intelligence high enough to make the 10k XP easy to grind.
---
Firstly, use the Egg Head mutation with class freak to minimize debuffs
---
Then, Herd Mentality with strange in numbers
---
Finally, max bonded building team.
---
Unyielding armor increases it further, though I don't use it.
---
I have base intelligence 12 (something easily achieved with unyielding). Combine that with 8 int from Egg Head and strange in numbers, 3 int with herd mentality and strange and 4 int from max building team that is 27 intelligence.
---
You grind the bog for a couple of minutes with that high intelligence (and this is the low end of the spectrum for good intelligence), you can easily hit 10k XP.
---
I'm not saying to not do NW, though if it is a revive challenge fuck that. I'm just saying that there are better options.
---
It kind of reminds me of the weird, lopsided way that the ammo maker generates ammo.
---
It spits out 5.56 like no tomorrow, but if I ever want a run of Fusion Cells to feed my hungry Tesla Rifle, I'll be fortunate to have 14 of them after a half-hour.
---
I am all about my .50 cal and flamer. I carry those for Scorched with a Gatling Plasma. Depends what ammo or mood I am in.
---
btw is it true that if you subscribe to fallout 1st bethesda cannot ban you as you are giving todd howard a paycheck every month??
---
I dot see what difference it makes unless you absolutely HAVE to min/max to the nth degree.. in which case.. you were already running bloodied anyway
---
Internet speed has nothing to do with ping, its mostly about how close to the server you are.
---
Yea if you only do dailies/weeklies and not NW ones, you will not reach rank 100. You need to grind 30k xp each day on top of those dailies/weeklies from day 1 to reach it (counting double xp and double score weekends). You can play around with this calculator to see where you are and what you need to do to get to rank 100.
---

It's the only rare outfit I need and I'm not going to trade everything for it
---
Every time I see one I'm running like  thereIgothereIgothereIgothereIgothereI... Oh nevermind he dead
---
Oh wow, that's amazing. You'd have a hard time believing it wasn't something in-game if you stumbled across it.
---
What system are you on, would love to check it out?
---
So long is it doesn't stop me from using the mod they can screw it up as much as they want....
---
Bullion.
---
Well my bloodied fixer does 332 dmg and the fire rate is 98 so why I would change to full healt build?
---
Just hit rank 19 missed 3? NW challenges I think but making it up with earn xp and getting set up to earn a ton when double xp weekend gets going
---
Just wait a week or so, you can buy the next rank for only 150 Atom per rank.  Pay no attention to how this bug has existed long before seasons where a thing.  And how conveniently this players into the monetisation of seasons.
---
I'll be more then happy to skip leg day
---
For the wood challenge go to Helvetia, directly ahead of the fast travel spawn is a shed with tons of wood.  Throw on woodchucker and you‚Äôre good to go.
---
Honestly, at this point: the same amount they do the moment they do anything.
---
The community generally screeches with every patch, so it's kind of pointless either way.
---
I just don't think they'd actually see much profit in it, and the PR would be a pain.
---
In the long run, hopefully it'll remain a limited asset like it is, or something we can build under special conditions... actually, having typed that, that seems less likely too, as allowing us to build it in some way puts it in the same realm as the Pails and Gift Boxes, which opens itself up to potential exploit and duping, and thereby another stupid PR headache.
---
Maybe they'll just wind up as a rare drop at the end of limited events like Meat Week or something.
---
Lol ok
---
I'm not telling everyone to ditch Fallout 76, I'm suggesting that it may just be better to play another game instead of constantly thinking about cooldowns on Fallout 76. Who said I hate the game?
---
I mean, objectively, for the purpose of accruing SCORE, it *does* matter.  The rate at which you level gets slower the higher it gets, up to a certain point, which makes it more time-consuming to complete the "Level Up" daily.  Unyielding is a very effective way to counter that.
---
Did you give them a dense torso? Bad things are gonna happen otherwise lol.
---
This is idiocy.
---
Should be in the clear then man, at least to the extent of my knowledge
---
Thank you. I'll check it out.
---
If I want to progress in the battle pass, which I enjoy, Bethesda forces me to do so unless I don't want to have daily missions, making it harder for myself because of their incompetence
---
That's not even what I'm talking about. I'm talking about arguing over who is a higher level.
---
If you are on PS4 and are still searching for pieces I can craft every tradable power armor. I just might need some materials though.
---
At least you can get your ammo. I can‚Äôt even get mine from the thing.
---
Yeah obviously. And I can't respec to other builds since every xp I get as a full health build would have been doubled if i was running low health build. Feels like I'm losing out
---
well for now just ask someone here to tell you what they are
---
So far I got the Halloween pistol skin the bats skins and the wrapped presents skin plus the tree. So hard to get a bunch of do but I‚Äôm hoping to get it all befor they get it fixed
---
XPs didn't matter hack shiet but now it does so that's the problem
---
well thats your problem then.. you need to figure out how to cure FOMO...
---
Wouldn't change much, half of the content will get dropped anyway like last year roadmap or any other announced updates. Hell even the patchnotes are fake, they say they fixed bugs which are totally the same like before.
---
Thanks but Xbox bro.
---
Take it up with Bethesda, what do you want me to say?
---
Got it, I was thinking of getting more glowing meat anyways, since I always run low on food. Thank you!
---
It‚Äôs a good idea you shouldn‚Äôt have to load in to see your challenges
---
I was thinking of getting strange in numbers, especially since we‚Äôve got public teams. Thank you!
---
I don't want you to say anything when you say something that stupid. It was unnecessary
---
I don‚Äôt give them gear, but I do give them the best underarmor I can craft at that point with the materials I have in storage. Few points of strength will help their feeble backs.  
---
If Bethesda allowed us to give backpacks away I deff would. I honestly wish new players/characters had a way to just skip that. Or make it account wide so you only need to do it once.
---
A whole 41 seconds you say? how quaint.
---
This is unbelievably true
---
Well, shoot. Didn‚Äôt know that.
---
Prepare rather than than despair is what I always say.
---
Oh no there's a solution, God. I may want my score back but I can't be arsed doing that
---
Wait you can still put a Jetpack on the arms of T-65? I thought they‚Äôd patched it
---
No, 41.2 seconds.
---
I would say none for the arms and the mod that decreases sprint cost or falling damage. There are no pocketed or ultralight mods for SS Armor. I went with none for arms and sleek for legs for faster sneak movement.
---
What if I don't want you to talk because I think what you're saying is stupid and unnecessary?
---
Which at this point for a lot of people is almost redundant. I‚Äôve got all the gear I need from the bullion. And the amount of bullion you get is pretty low, comparatively speaking. 
---
This boils down to your definition of ‚Äòwinning‚Äô. It sounds like it‚Äôs ‚Äòbe better equipped and higher level than the other players‚Äô. 
---
And yet, we‚Äôve seen players take on and compete pretty much all of the game‚Äôs content successfully, without ‚Äòmin-maxing‚Äô their setup and load out. 
---
What, exactly, is your definition of ‚Äòwinning‚Äô?
---
The business still existed in Fallout 3 and New Vegas.
---
Yes it is! I do all my adventure dailies and then head on to NW and complete those. Before going to bed I like to double check that I did them all and I have to log back in to an adventure server just to check it. Kind of annoying.
---
I screamed laughing. This has to be the best I‚Äôve seen so far.
---
I seem to recall the Seasons system as being advertised as an overhaul to Challenges to [make them more rewarding through normal gameplay](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/fPSas0ftnlgD0FcZNnMoL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-introducing-the-2020-roadmap-and-76-seasons). Threads like these seem to suggest to me that this has not turned out to be the case...
---
You‚Äôre Welcome like I said I don‚Äôt know if they finally patched it or not but it‚Äôs way easier to get raider rep then they slow grind it took me for settlers but now I have both and I tell you the guass shotgun is amazing
---
shoot them in the leg its pretty easy
---
GZ man. It‚Äôs always nice getting something you can use
---
nerfing bloodied would be the absolute funniest thing bethesda could do and i would love to see it happen
---
Yep. It‚Äôs probably very easy to add into the game too.
---
Take this scorchbeast (tosses tato)
---
Power armor is top game. You can look up the new power armors on wiki and decide from there. I've been trying a bloody build with secret service armor and it still doesn't hold up to my power armor.
---
Sure... but you only fire it once every... what... 5 seconds?
---
The Gauss Shotgun has multiple shots all lined up and ready to go.
---
The use case for the Dragon is an odd one.  For the vast majority of enemies, a Dragon is completely overkill.  And yet, for the ones where it isn't, your inability to get multiple shots off in a timely fashion becomes a real problem.
---
I noticed  this as well. Bloody build that runs level 3 fireproof noticing the SB attacks effecting me now.
---
Same here, I've come off for the night but I'm hoping to grind out some more tomorrow
---
No, you can add a jetpack to the secret service armor and the stabilized mods for arms. Jetpack only for the chest piece.
---
No it was with adrenaline, it was uploaded 2 days before patch 20. Quick Solo kills on the queen is nothing new. 
---
If this was a public server with it scaling to each person and wss still done in 41.2 seconds it would probably be spoken about a lot more.
---
I just watched it. Looks easy enough. I just have to wait until that Daily rolls around again.
---
Cheers, mate!
---
Yup that's exactly what I'm doing. By making Bethesda come up with long overdue balance patches.
---
Atom and SCORE are treated differently  https://imgur.com/OFiJIBF
---
Good luck and have fun
---
Reported.
---
Yes. There's a formula. Iirc it is or is close to (160 x level) + 200. For me, a level 340, that's about 55,000 XP to level up. While not difficult, it is time consuming and unless I specifically task myself with leveling up as efficiently as possible it takes 2-3 days to level up. So it's a lot easier for these tasks to just switch over to a new character who can level up in 20-30 minutes instead of 5-6 hours.
---
Personal opinion.
---
You‚Äôre a rifleman build already so stick with that, and throw in stealth for great damage.
---
Take points out of strength and put them into perception and agaility.
---
Take points out of intelligence down to 5 and either use 5 for gunsmith or 2 gunsmith and 3 need rage if you‚Äôre a bloody build.
---
Take points out of charisma (down to 4, then use lone wanderer) and put them into the above two stats as well.
---
Max out rifleman damage cards.
---
Max out tank killer (I think you have but I‚Äôm on mobile so I can‚Äôt check).
---
If VATS appeals to you pump points into luck and max out grin reapers spring and four leaf clover.  Otherwise take luck perks like serendipity to help keep you alive and the perk that helps rifles cripple limbs on enemies).
---
Take 3 points in sneak and also get escape artist....If you decide to go for a bloody unyielding build (I can highly recommend this as a stealth sniper as you do great damage but are as resilient as butter is to a hot knife...so it‚Äôs not god mode).
---
My bloody stealth sniper/commando characters have base SPECIAL stats of 1, 15, 1, 4, 5, 15, 15 BUT you don‚Äôt need to go to that extreme to have a great character that can hold his or her own during boss fights.
---
THE OTHER OPTION, based off your special stats is to go a power armour heavy weapons build
---
Yea, I hope they add it in the future. It sounds so easy to add too.
---
If you're using explosive arrows it's the explosive bobblehead if you're using plasma arrows it's the energy bobblehead.
---
And all theese calculations dont add any repeatable exp challenges no double score weekend or double exp weekend.
---
The double exp weekend is where I expect I will climb dramatically. Right now on a full biuld team and everyone pops a lunch box and eats cranberry cobbler that's 113 % more exp, this does not include the 2% from each piont of intelligents (mine is 15 with gear which brings total to 143% exp bonus) now double that for 2x exp weekend.  For me this will be 286% more exp for everything that earns exp
---
One whole strength!?!? No way!
---
Lmao blind fanboys can't handle any other opinion but their own, and makes bullshit assumptions from the start. Report me then, I did nothing against the rules bub.
---
Oh dang, I hate that I wasn‚Äôt able to to mod it on my T-65 arm before they patched it. However I did put it on my Strangler Heart right before they did so still a win
---
I'd say don't try the build until you have the perks Nerd Rage, Dodgy, and serendipity all the way filled
---
So, I was blessed with a Bloodied Gauss Shotgun this morning and I'm finding that I'm at 2,019 with max Shotgunner perks, Adrenal Reaction, and Nerd Rage.  How would you say you are accomplishing an additional \~700?
---
This is 100% done so you spend money on atoms.
---
It's at that point you realise that attempting to communicate with something that has yet to reach sentience is a pointless waste of your time.
---
Blind fanboy...
---
I am complaining about the game. Blind fanboys don't do that. Blind fanboys tell other people to shut up about problems about the game
---
yestersay i had 2 dailies that were missing and after hoping servers a few times they appeared and been abble to do them
---
Yes but this can easily be added to characters. Both score and atom wise as they are just literal  numbers to our characters. Just take a photo and send it in, I one got atom from over a week ago cause I forgot to send a ticket in. Bethesda Support are really nice and good at fixing user issues.
---
How do you unlock the skeleton outfit exactly?
---
i'm guessing you're talking about the tricentennial emote since the liberty prime bundle doesn't come with an emote?
---
anyway when on you're emote wheel there should be a key to change emotes that are grouped, then just select whatever one you wish to use (although selecting can be a bit finicky at times) another example is taunt/pvp emotes
---
The major and I do mean major drawbacks of a low health build is the player gets killed a lot and very quickly. The only way to avoid that is to make your attacks from up high and while you're hidden.
---
How would I do that? There is no option for?
---
The glitch people talk about is still real - I finally broke down and did it myself - first time taking advantage of something like this.  I was feeling guilty about doing it until I realized how many times I had to repeat it to get full rep.  It was mind numbing.  If I had tried to do it through normal play, I'd be dead by old age first....
---
Hhhm well if your planning to go tanky bloody with unyielding armour perks like dodgy,evasive,life giver,barbarian,radicool and mutation perks may interest you.
---
Fear of missing out is a hell of a drug apparently.
---
Just do the what you feel like will be fun, not what you think is the best way to get maximum rewards.
---
Any reward isn‚Äôt god tier and you don‚Äôt NEED it.
---
Too many people here are falling prey to the FoMO that Bethesda has built into the game.
---
I'm in central south London UK and have no idea where any of the Fallout 76 servers are located, I wonder if there is a map somewhere?
---
Can people stop doing this please.
---
Ah, see you misunderstand, it's all working as intended. By 'more rewarding' we mean for Bethesda, in that burnt out and frustrated players will buy Atoms to make up remaining ranks (feeling committed due to time already invested), and that being able to earn less 'free' Atoms mean players can no longer save up for that one bundle a month that interests them and will instead have to be purchased. Very rewarding indeed. Especially when all these Game Pass players arrive mid-Season with no hope of catching up through gameplay.
---
Ohhhh, the players? Uh something something double xp weekend.
---
Sorry buddy, I'm not reading what you say because you're opinions are "stupid and unnecessary" therefore you just shouldn't voice any of your opinions.
---
When does the daily‚Äôs reset?
---
Cause he was missing out on lots of bonus damages and with those bonuses and buffs intact, people can litally one mag her and 41 seconds is nothing new
---
I killed a queen within 2seconds, right after she spawned.
---
Once a enemy spawn, there is a short delay before they get their resistance and legendary effects. Critting her with a huge amount of damage right when she spawn, she die instantly. You wont get legendary loot tho.
---
The same goes with the imposter sheepsquatch, burst it when it spawn and the event is done asap. No pylons or anything else is needed.
---
Power armor isn't powerful in PvP.
---
Hmmm? Manually set, as in a VPN?
---
First time?
---
Because that's slow as shit
---
https://youtu.be/iT1-KlANgCk
---
I guess you missed the joke.
---
When you build a CAMP. It can be in a lot of different places around the map. You can‚Äôt really build on locations that already have holdings and structures. It mostly has to be wide open areas. You can only one one CAMP at a time. When you log out, and decide to play again. The game will throw you in a random server. And your CAMP along with all your decorations and stuff you built, will be right there and then. 
---
SOMETIMES you‚Äôll join a server, and the game will tell you that your CAMP can‚Äôt be placed. Don‚Äôt panic. That just means somebody is already in that server, and they have their house built in the same area yours is. And since they were there before you, they got first dibs. So you have two options. Try to find a new server if you really want your CAMP to spawn. Or just choose to stay in that server if you don‚Äôt care if your CAMP spawns or not. Don‚Äôt worry. Whenever you join another server your CAMP will be there. 
---
You can also move your CAMP to other locations. You will need to pay caps. You ‚Äúcould‚Äù place down your already built CAMP. But it doesn‚Äôt always work. Sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt let you. Forcing you to rebuild stuff from scratch.
---
If you use prime barrel and prime ammo you will get 108 per craft and don't forget to use super duper rank 3. It will cost 1 crimson flux per 108 rounds.
---
18:00gmt1. 1700 British time.
---
No not yet I‚Äôm still waiting for when they make it 0 stash cost to put things in display.Todd still hasn‚Äôt blessed me with that yet :(
---
you make good points but it's not gonna happen in a day yeah the game wasn't that great but it's not the worst and yeah bethesda does get greedy and thanks to presents caps are worth nothing but I believe change will come not now or a week from now but maybe a year the game might be what the players want and most cool stuff is locked beging grinding systems or atom shop bundles I understand I just want some good stuff once in awhile cause your ideal change for their company and how they fix a game is alot harder and make take more time than adding such a easy little concept of sheet music to make camps feel unique with different sounds all I'm saying is somethings take longer than other ideas.
---
This was not griefing. Nukes are part of the game and they give you a 3 minute warning. If you missed that by being AFK or just assumed you were safe, that‚Äôs on you. That‚Äôs plenty of protection built into the game.
---
Idk i don‚Äôt do a lot of nuking. Flux are a pain to get for me tbh.
---
A great way to make almost any enemy easy prey is to use a shotgun while you have the tormentor perk (wait...that might be the rifle one) equipped that allows your shotguns to easily cripple limbs.
---
Cripple their logs with a shot or two then cripple their heads (otherwise they will still face laser you) and they are helpless.  They will crawl to you and self destruct...which, if you have fireproof level 1 and a dense chest piece will not harm you.
---
Also, another place there are plenty of assaultrons is Arktos Pharma, where the event to protest the friendly enemies happens.
---
Well its kinda hard to have fun when 50% stuff is broken but i really really trying to!
---
Because it's not actually that impressive.
---
It's possible (then wasn't, and now is again) for maxed-out melee users to kill her in two shots.  Frankly, watching someone exhaust magazine after magazine isn't that amazing.
---
Ya got me there
---
Well whoop dee do
---
I love this. They do something similar in AC4. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I couldn't fast travel earlier to go complete something. Like at all. I couldn't go to the nearest landmark to it either. Tried about ten times then game off.
---
Debatable as it‚Äôs possible with secret service armour to beat all power armours physical resistance will full unyielding ss
---
I have sent them a ticket with photo, but they're so far clear that they won't refund missing SCORE points (That may change in the future). I get you're optimistic and I think people should sent tickets regardless, but Atoms are treated differently, it doesn't work the same way at the moment with regards to getting your points back.
---
just make a new character, run down to the wayward and you'll get the level up lickety-split, much faster than leveling at high levels
---
Just use some canned meat stew and berry mentats
---
Thank you :)
---
Because nobody cares?
---
Does rank pass through all characters? That'd be so easy! Thanks for the tip.
---
Was that legit tho? Nothing was shown but a 9 second clip of someone shooting there gun it could've been small guns bobbleheads or psycho stacking.
---
What about a tato launcher that uses tato as ammo for massive damage. Gotta use up your ammo before it spoils though.
---
Kinda off topic but I'm hoping someone here might be able to explain something that happened during a Queen fight; we'd gotten her down to half health post-mutation when she finally landed after 10 minutes, and suddenly there was a massive explosion centered on her and she died instantly. No event completion prompt, no rewards screen, but I was still able to loot her. Never seen anyone deal that much damage to a Queen since the Explosive bobblehead exploit. Anyone know what the hell that was?
---
Buttressed
---
How did you get the camera to move like that?  Photomode?
---
They already said they gonna overhaul this inhuman machine
---
100% legit
---
are they in the blueprints or stored tab?
---
I wish they would add deep pocketed or lead lined mods. Ill probably go for the one that helps with ap
---
Trap camps also want this feature
---
You sick bastard...
---
Blueprinted?
---
If you‚Äôre on PC there are hacked in weapons such as mini guns that fire mininukes so it may have been a hacker
---
Did you read them? Usually when someone posts this question it's because they never learned them.
---
These are worth something? I just held onto them not knowing what to do with them.
---
Numerous people on the subreddit have tried getting score, with Bethesda support telling every single one of them that they won't add missing score to accounts.
---
I use demolition expert and bloody mess too along with all of those. But I moved two points away from endurance and it went down to 2489 which is still good but I was shocked it was such a hit
---
4 things remained in stored tab
---
You sure those 4 things aren't the blueprints of your camp?
---
Thanks I‚Äôll try that!
---
I'll consider fun after I get to that rank 100. Which I won't unfortunatel
---
PS4, so definitely not hacked weapons haha
---
But, l like olives..
---
Im betting that power armour displays will come with the BOS release
---
I'll take your word, very impressive!
---
We all have weapons we love. I have tons of godrolls, but the only one which won't go for sale is my instigating faster swing +1 strength multipurpose axe. 
---
It looks real, kills without overkilling and can't be modded... Perfect.
---
Congrats.
---
Ok cool so 12pm Eastern time US.
---
And it's boring. I think a good amount of people are finally getting tired of the vats fixers and handmades... It's literally point and click gameplay without the pointing
---
Strange, not sure I‚Äôve never had it happen on xbox
---
Let's just add a theatre while we're at it
---
yes youre righ ! Thanks !!!!
---
yes thanks you !
---
Saw this one dude drop a SBQ in under 4 seconds using a sniper rifle. Literately two shots. Probably using legacy weapons and hacks but it was way too fast.
---
The stored tab can keep blueprints of your camp if you move it
---
A lotttt of Nuclear Winter, it‚Äôs a certain number of Overseer XP and you have to go through the other rewards first. This wiki lists all the NW rewards you can get, the seasonal rewards are listed at the bottom:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank
---
My advice for NW if you don‚Äôt like PVP is get really good at hiding in bushes. You get XP for just surviving and you get more XP if you can make it into the final 10.
---
Man I hope you're right! They would make more off of the atom shop if we nutjobs could display some of our armor. :D
---
Travel mats - absolutely fine, we'll they are in a world without trap camps.
---
yeah the season is account wide so its fairly easy (way easier than it was with the atoms where you had to level up while achieving 3 criteria)
---
My flesh inside of a raider wait ummm never mind I thought we were talking about something else
---
3,000. Got three of the weeklies without even realizing it while at the junkyard before I heard about the glitch. 
---
Since Bethesda won't fix it, here's a tip. Get a big group together and open the lunchboxes to stack the "very well rested" bonuses. I got 40,000 exp (4 repeatable SCORE challenge deals) over the course of one of those events at Fort Defiance. I'm saving up lunchboxes and mats for boosting Int and exp for the double exp weekend and will be getting over 1K per super mutant killed. Looking at the 3k I lost as 300 super mutants is a little more tolerable.
---
Brilliant. Thank you. 1 less thing to worry over.
---
Why the hell are people downvoting correct info.  People have been saying this for almost a week now...
---
Also I am not including adrenal reaction damage
---
i see thanks !!!
---
All i ever wanted was an indoor potting shed at my camp
---
And we got farmable tiles with wastelanders, so fingers crossed
---
It was my main for a while. The cane is one of the strongest 1H weapons.
---
I live in that spot too!
---
Cool! Thanks for all the info!
---
Submit a ticket. Some of the weeklies are actually awarding at 3/5
---
Subchallenges so when you get 5/5 they don‚Äôt award additional score.
---
I hate to break it to you, but that's not griefing. As other responses have said, dropping nukes are a mechanic of the game, and they do give you a three minute warning. You have two options at this point: Let your camp be destroyed then rebuild and farm flux, or switch to a different server. 
---
There's also a few reasons a person might have nuked your camp. If you didn't have vendors on, they wouldn't have seen it on the map and were just trying to find a spot to farm flux. Did you join in any events and were you hording the legendary kills? Were you being toxic? Or did you have really bad prices for items in your vendor?
---
Either way, canceling your sub is going to hurt you more than BGS if you continue to play.
---
That's what we *were* talking about.
---
Really? Wow
---
You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm willing to be they could edit the points if they wanted but then they‚Äôd be buried in tickets adjusting SCORE. Saying they can‚Äôt do it gives them an out.
---
This and the players standing on a fence can cause this issue too. If she doesn't have space to land she won't land. Failed a few SBQ fights because of this issue.
---
Lol. So many bugs
---
PO-TA-TOES. Boil em‚Äô Mash em‚Äô Stick em‚Äô in a stew.
---
Thank you for this. Saved me so much time.
---
Yep, you have to grind out the rep with the dailies
---
I am 12 or 13. Which is where I wanted to be: the leather armor mod for my sniper.
---
if you‚Äôre on xbox the queen dropped me a nocturnal pipe revolver today maybe it‚Äôs meant for you...
---
Why Not Make a Veggie Version of the Junk Jet? 
---
"What Killed you?"
---
"Corn..."
---
do quests for both sides until you have to choose a side. You will know. Choose settlers so you get the sweet AF stealth suit. do the raid. keep the gold. keep earning rep for both sides. 
---
Simples
---
Literally pointless.
---
Yes.  Been around a long time now.  I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs pretty far down on the to-do list...right before ‚Äúfast travel doesn‚Äôt always work.‚Äù
---
I‚Äôve seen this once or twice recently. Never bothered to check it out more though. Lvl 200 something and figured I‚Äôve unlocked any mods that I‚Äôd use.
---
Yeah good luck! I‚Äôve grown to like NW so I hope that others do too. I also hope that they break the Vault Tec University rewards in the next update haha.
---
So I can finish the main missions and build the reputation afterwards and still get both rewards?
---
Ah yeah. New feature. Punishment for not playing regularly. After a week the pink fades and you're back to normal again. Happy wastelanding! üòÇü§£ü§™
---
Yeah, but I interjected and added something new.
---
I wish for this too but trap bases ruin it. Also people don't use their noggin and fast travel to their base a couple times to see where the spawn point is before starting to build. Makes it much more convenient for people to just build for the spawn point.
---
tomacco
---
Thank you! That would be cool!
---
One last question, is there any way to track how far along you are to unlocking enough XP to get the skeleton costume?
---
I was a victim of doing the challenges only to not be given the score. Like it checks it off like it‚Äôs done but there is no prompt, no awarded score, just sadness and wasted time.
---
Ok, Thank you!
---
I feel like removing punji boards from the game entirely as I think that only level 10s and trap camps use and maybe make like a 30 second grace period from traps entirely giving you enough time to escape or fast travel away. But yea there really is no reason not to have them if they do nerf traps as stated before. It would fix many issues and make vendor hopping so much more easy
---
Thanks. Hopefully I'm not greeted with more features like this  üòÇ
---
Okay, I forgot to mention Bloody Mess.
---
I could see how Demolition Expert could do it, though.  It never seemed like that much damage, but when you're getting into the thousands, it probably does start to add up.
---
It‚Äôs almost like earning stuff is how people have fun.
---
indeed. it's a long grind. but some of the things you can buy are wizard
---
There's always two radscorpions by the train yard
---
I‚Äôm vindicated!
---
I'd like the ghillie mod for my Secret Service Armour. It's way up the rank.
---
What a pervert
---
Look... It is expensive until you have 29804 caps and are scared someone will buy 15000 round of ammo from your machine.
---
I bought it last week. 4800 caps. It doesn't look western, it looks childish. Both versions (yellow and red).
---
Use it on plans: I spend a good amount on getting mods for PA
---
Then everyone would wait until there only a minute or two on the clock. Get a hit in on the legendary creature. And reap all the rewards for doing basically nothing.
---
I would be totally OK with that.
---
Thank you for opening my eyes, I never realized fighting the SBQ could be so easy! This is all I'll post about from here on out. You've finally made me put the milk down for good
---
Maybe not a timer but a progress bar to let you know how close they are to finishing technically we have a timer with how long the event has been active for
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhdFe3evXpk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhdFe3evXpk)
---
you can share with me :), joking aside start planing mutation/weapons to use they are kinda expensive but not so much
---
Smiley and Modus like the smell of your caps. Maybe u need some bullion or some serum recipes.
---
Hell yeah we were
---
Not complaining about the game? Blasphemy
---
mostly, yeah. I hooked up a controller to get smooth movement + camera pans, and sometimes would just walk + look around when moving through doorways.
---
I‚Äôve been building a bar in a power line tower and I‚Äôve already cursed enough at the camp system for not letting me place something even tho it‚Äôs green
---
Are we seeing the start of a mangy moose herd?
---
Ruining things for others by being selfish pricks...in this game???  NOOOOO! Maybe work in a mechanic or conditional trigger that stops the ability to place a mat if it is within so many feet of a trap...idk.
---
None of my weeklys are giving me rewards. Compete bullshit, but I've come to expect Bethesda to fuck up everything they do at this point.
---
No one was arguing over who has a higher level.  They are saying they are Lv. 700 not to flex, but because a Lv. 700 levels slower than a Lv. 400 does.  The amount of XP required to level doesn't stop growing until Lv. 1,000.
---
which underarmor?
---
you can usually buy the first two (must have 1st to unlock option to buy 2nd) then you have to earn the 3rd and 4th from quests usually. 
---
Or you can ask some nice person to mod your underamour for a fee
---
Just clearing this up for myself, I‚Äôm currently on Cheating Death and Trade Secrets, so should I just do the Foundation‚Äôs Trade Secrets and continue down their missions, and then just grind dailies for the raiders?
---
The way I got the shielded mod and the best way I know is to happen to build a cool camp that impresses someone into giving you free stuff, and they happen to give it to you
---
I just join whichever team shares the most cards, since none of the "event" teams actually do events anyway.
---
You people act like Bethesda is gonna suspend your account if you arent building while on the building team.
---
I usually travel around to player vendors in order to find some good weapons and armor deals when I reach the cap. If I don't find anything I buy some cheap scrippable weapons and armor.
---
That's not true. I logged into today, and it auto completed 3 of mine. It was not anywhere near the reset l, I had no played nuclear winter before. The game crashed on startup, and whe. I reblogged 3 were completed.
---
we are kinda both right, i was calculating with 223000 and u with 225000 so ~ 4 times a day, but i also stated at least 3,5 per day, so yeah:D
---
^^this^^
---
Literally walk two feet in the Ash Heap.
---
Unfortunately, no. When the Survivors rewards were live you could, but since this is a bug, you can‚Äôt. 
---
My best bet would be to reference the wiki chart if you want to keep track of how much XP you get. The Halloween results are listed with the cumulative XP needed, not the XP needed between each reward, so really the only way would just be to tally on a spreadsheet how close you‚Äôre getting to 14000. Personally, I just tried to play as much as I could and it was a good night if I could unlock the next reward.
---
That's a better way to say it üôèsorry my vocabulary is very limited üòÖ
---
Yea I have the plan to make the Marine armor wetsuit, it prevents water borne diseases according to its description.
---
I just wanted the sink
---
I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôre being downvoted. That‚Äôs pretty normal timing for casual play
---
A slider pop up allowing to do it in bulk seems the simplest solution. If you doing 20k each of multiple ammo it might still take time but only the first time.
---
That's the welcome back effect!
---
Kidding aside I've had that happen to me on load in a handful of times. Usually it goes away after a minute or when fast traveling
---
Need a "get off the bunker/fence and stop shooting the SBQ with One Gun Army you literal donkey" emote
---
you have 2 quests for foundation left i think. But you get the next quest and it's choosing sides. Don't choose a side until you are at the same point with raiders.
---
Sorry i made a mistake in my info. You get the stealth suit from the the next quest so if you want side with raiders. neither side really cares who you side with.
---
The revolution has begun
---
As long as you don't bite my sister, I'm fine with it.
---
Yes agree
---
I got extremely lucky today and noticed that every time I hopped servers the Foundation quest would trigger.  I did it 4 times and it did every time so decided to keep going.   The best part is each time I wouldn't even have to do the quest it just defaulted to Ward rewarding me for finding the component.   Within an hour I managed to reach being an ally of foundation and now have over 500 treasury notes.   I even got the xbox award for reaching the level.  It would have taken me about a month to do what I did in an hour!
---
so why don't you move the points from endurance?
---
I want to avoid re-specing since I only have two level ups to work with and at level 115 it‚Äôs a slog to level up. With a second character I‚Äôm definitely going to do a focused build, but I‚Äôd like my main to be flexible
---
I hear you man!
---
Same for me when I get the more outfits as well‚Äô
---
We‚Äôre gentle giants
---
They're soccer balls. You're supposed to kick them, not pick them up.
---
You don't NEED to shitpost.
---
Literally half the time is spent wrestling with walls and stuff. And then you realise something in the structures below is fucking you over. Building in FO76 requires so much forward planning and backtracking, but it's very rewarding when you finally get your shit together.
---
Soccer is a commie sport!
---
Also notice you can‚Äôt take brooms,  clearly the reason things are such a damn mess everywhere.
---
Another example of these guys proving they don't know anything about UX design.
---
Then I guess SH it is. I'm a bloodied heavy gunner/melee build. The quicker I deal damage, the better.
---
Yeah I'm not worried. I'll hit level 100
---
aw come on .. lol
---
I gotta say DPS wise you win...but it highlights the diff between playstyles
---
My unarmed weapons with martial artist and 40%swing speed/power attacks
---
We deal very similar damage.
---
with chems...my furious DCG deals 3500 dmg
---
Mr alien man ship thing that you have to catch up started at position 30 and has 70 spaces before he reaches the end.  He moves at one space per day.
---
You bet. Not my first rodeo.
---
Does there need to be? Theres a lot you can see but cant pick up.
---
plug your build into [nukes&amp;dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) so we can see what youre working with
---
Mine auto complete and I am never logged in at reset...
---
Just play to have fun. You are your only competition. If you're in it for the status you're doing it wrong.  
---
Read this forum for tips, ticks, current issues and workarounds, etc. Once you progress find a build you like and work towards it.
---
Ya that must be it. I don‚Äôt know why I thought it was from the Liberty prime bundle; I just came back into the game then and saw the salute after getting the bundle, and thus assumed their connection. 
---
Ya it‚Äôs disappeared for me after this last update though.
---
I think the new update screwed it up.
---
As a melee, sh is the go-to.
---
Ok! Thanks for the confirmation!
---
Okay, makes sense. Appreciate the detailed response, thanks again!!!
---
I've seen players who frequent the Nuclear Winter playmode complain about both weekly and daily challenges being reset for them both to the community and in tickets to Bethesda.
---
I refuse to believe this was not know internally, and the lack of response from them only backs up my assertion that they intended for this to happen, feign ignorance of the bug, players fall behind, and then they can sell a solution.  
---
I'd give them the benefit of the doubt, but that has been done many times beforehand.  Right the way back to the pre-order canvas bag.  The Nuke bottle saga... the inventory hack where they could not restore, then did.  I could go on.
---
You don't need to side with the settlers to get the stealth suit, just progress their quest up to when you need to commit to a side. If you do the raid with the raiders you get a unique weapon you can't get by siding with foundation.
---
SPOILER!
---
Right? I remember being so worried about how much rep I would gain/lose based on how I distribute the gold.
---
If I had known it was going to be such a slog regardless of who/what I chose, i wouldn't have been so stressed.
---
Yep, because depending on what challenges there are I might need to hop on my low level character or my high level character.
---
Someone finally got pissed off enough to lop off his head huh..? Cant tell you how many times I've wanted to do it myself. üòÇ
---
GT: XxPrizmxX. If anyone would be willing to walk me through updates online.
---
Damn, thanks! I'm on PC, Bethesda ID is same as here if you'd like to come see it sometime!
---
I've been in a couple of building teams so far.
---
You know you can just create a new character and level up,it takes less time
---
It's the most raider thing to do. Take what you want.
---
Across all characters. I have a new character forvthe daily level up
---
Accross all characters in your account.
---
Tenderizer is a good one IMO. I have a Charisma of 4, which is pretty standard, I think. So, Inspirational and Tenderizer work for me.
---
Power plant always has a billion AI
---
FYI having tank killer perks on, I.E. the stagger effect from it can cause the queen to stop landing if it procs while she's landing. It staggers her and breaks her current actions, in this case stops her landing.
---
I want to be able to TRACK the challenges like quests, not have them populate in the map frame
---
universal.
---
That's why it's easier to maker another character to level up.
---
I gained two levels from one event at level 5
---
Bro this picture is from the direct perspective of my camp location
---
Well I do want to unlock all of the rewards if possible, but I play other games so I was curious if they come naturally or not.
---
...chirp...
---
Sweet, thanks
---
Awesome
---
I want to kick one back to my camp
---
You could always start again. Things have changed.
---
Well good, at least it‚Äôs not just me :) It‚Äôs strange because it was working how it used to for a while, but then all in a sudden it seemed to change.
---
You know I'm happy beth has decided to kill off pvp it just drags the game down. Now I can have a workshop without getting a tesla rifle in my face.
---
Which is why I was so pissed off about yesterdays challenge.
---
I'm not thrilled with today's either...only because the disconnects are getting ridiculous. One match I kept losing connection so it would freeze me up...three times before it finally disconnected me. And this time it disconnects me after a minute of being in game. I'm going to wait till later to try again but Bethesda needs to fix this DC issue.
---
No problem! Have fun! You‚Äôll get the Christmas rewards too while you‚Äôre out there haha.
---
Also impossible to make trades if you don't have those
---
Oh yeah, it makes the level up 3 times a lot easier
---
Ah, fair point then. Thanks.
---
Thats the problem with games like 76, there is no winning. Just endgame. After you complete the main story the only things there are to *do* are becoming better equipped, so in 76s case when you get everything that's "winning", I guess.
---
doesn't even have flames...
---
They already have pumpkin grenades,  so why not tatoes.
---
The problems seems to have went away after files verification :D Thanks for the tip anyways. 8 Files were corrupted
---
This reminded me of how fun it was to throw eggs at enemies in RE4.  It did zero damage but the did stop moving for a second which was always funny
---
If you need fluxes or any other materials to build a new one I'll be playing tomorrow around 11AM GMT in Xbox. My name in the game is delarro
---
Shielded Secret Service is awesome...
---
15/15/15 - 4 STR 4 END 2 PER
---
Most challenges are very easy to do even for a fresh character. You can reach quite a high rank if you do all the dailies and weeklies.
---
&gt; *Thats the problem with games like 76, there is no winning.*
---
Exactly. Therefore there is no ‚Äòpay to win‚Äô.
---
It sounds easy to add but they‚Äôd find a way for it to break the whole game. You‚Äôd press it and it‚Äôd take you to the developer room or something.
---
It was a fun PVP weapon back in the old days but now it‚Äôs pretty much useless. I have a BE one that‚Äôs been sitting in my stash forever because of the reasons you mentioned above. It also breaks after 8-9 shots.
---
You can add the skinned jet pack to the new power armor pieces, but it doesn't allow you to fly.
---
can I cross this name off my list or what
---
Very good idea. I was wishing that there would be a thing like this the other day.
---
I dont do the NW challenges, having mods prevents me from even opening up NW (despite them being no effect on the mode)  
---
And I CBA to disable them, to just into NW, place a camp 3 times then turn off the game and put them back on again
---
This is great!  
---
I started playing again a few days ago, and I've seen so many amazing camps. Yours is definitely one of the better ones!
---
"coking"
---
Lol, "\*snooort\* AD FUCKING VICTORIAM MOTHERFUCKERS!!"
---
Tbh, you're better off using wood unyielding armor instead of SS armor.
---
Blocker 3 will carry you to victory.
---
Yea, level 100+ and it‚Äôs a grind
---
Or just make a new character, join a building group, do every daily/weekly and play as normal? This is what I'm doing...I mean the xp score is lower and slower, but playing normally you should be fine.
---
You won‚Äôt get everything naturally unless you are an absolute xp beast
---
I recommend completing the Wastelanders questline asap(started at the overseers home in Sutton) and work on getting gold bullion asap
---
Whoops, you make a good point there. Hopefully they are smart enough to be shooting it at long range haha
---
I have a decent level 21...she can level up pretty fast now with Public events. I even took her to the Queen and she didn‚Äôt die.
---
If you need .45 ammo, 10 mm ammo, missiles, arrows or shotgun shells, look in the blue suitcase at commonly-visited train stations. I deposit my unwanted ammo there on the regular.
---
Small guns should cover them
---
Or ya know...text chat because it's literally been done as a PC mod...so why the fuck hasn't Bethesda gotten off their lazy asses and made an official one? It should have been in the game DAY ONE.
---
Can you post your perk cards and build? I'm interested but going from heavy guns to this is confusing. I'd love to see your version.
---
Unfortunately you can't please everyone.
---
If you have have it easy to achieve someone does it i  the first week and then complains there's nothing to do for 10 weeks.
---
If you have it hard to achieve, someone says "WTF I'm not doing XXXX just to get......"
---
If you have it easy, but needs to log in every day then people complain its a grind they dont want to play every day.
---
If you make it so you dont need to log in every day, the people that DO play every day complain "whats the point, theres no reward for playing lots if you can just do it by playing on the weekend"
---

---
Ok. I'm down
---
Same here. It's been driving me crazy as I have been trying to replicate it like sleeping for a long time or after I've eaten a lot of food, etc.
---
If you are on Xbox I'll make one for you (not secret service)
---
All good man lol
---
* Fusion cores
---
* Stimpacks
---
* Flux
---
* Chems
---
I made a new character just for SCORE. I'm using her to get all the easy challenges done, then I pop onto my high level to do the harder things/claim the rewards and my NW character to do the NW stuff.
---
Chemist backpack mod helps a bit.
---
*Doing the upside lowdown*
---
where i should post that ?
---
What an asshole
---
Wdym the vault suit allows you to walk into a nuked zone unharmed...
---
On a trading sub. It's against the sub rules to trade here.
---
U gotta go back to main menu then log back in
---
Random creatures used to be able to wander into the area at Crater and Foundation. I‚Äôve been killed once by yao guai at crater and twice while using benches at Foundation. They said they fixed it. I still don‚Äôt believe them.
---
Sylvie and Sons Logging Camp in the Savage Divide has several dozen wood piles that you can harvest individually. You can get about 400 wood without the Woodchucker perk, far more than the wood piles in Helvetia.
---
Plans at a decent price :/
---
I still have to press Q though.....
---
The best part is that this bug was a known issue.  I help manage a few communities and I have observed posts about auto completing challenges on the main server for a good while now.  Mainly from Nuclear Winter players.  
---
I therefore find it hard to believe they was/are not :
---
1. Damn well aware of this bug
---
2. Did not design the 150 Atom skip system as a profitable solution to the bug
---
3. Are staying silent till the time period is up at which point they will point to the Atom skip while claiming to be working on a solution.
---
Depending on the players reactions will depend if it is fixed for the next season.
---
Not. The. Point.
---
That's normal, it's just a headache if you don't expect it.  
---
Now you know!
---
Hello fellow Pittsburgher. Sheetz gang rise up.
---
50 caps?  That's really cheap! I'll be making out like a bandit at those prices.
---
Yeah, it puts me in a very conflicted position. On the one hand, I am a committed skinflint who has no desire to buy Atoms since nothing in the Atomic Shop is truly worth the price. As such, I find myself compelled to grind out these challenges, spending 1-2 hours per level. But if each level only costs $1.50, that means I'm basically working for $0.75 an hour (a tenth of the Federal minimum wage) doing things that, while not really work (since it's a friggen videogame), end up still feeling like commitments, rather than just playing the game like I want. 
---
And what's worse is, if I want to make any real progress, I basically have to do every challenge, since the whole thing is on a giant timer. Before, I could skip the dumb "Level up while wearing a clown suit and fellating a megasloth in a nuke zone" challenges because, well, I'll just earn Atoms slower doing the more reasonable challenges. While there was still a slight time crunch due to Atom Shop items being limited time only, I could always just wait until they come around again. But now, while they at least simplified some of the challenges (like the above level up ones), you basically HAVE to do them. That or consume the Spice of min/maxing insanity so that the XP must flow. Either way, I'm no longer just playing the game for fun.
---
So if I'm not willing to spend money on goofy cosmetics, and I'm already burnt out of the grind, I guess my only option is to do the sane and rational thing and just ignore the whole Score system and move on with my life. But that's where the sickness of Fear of Missing Out really shines. Because even if I did just start playing like normal again, there would always be that voice in the back of my mind going "But hey, you could just do this challenge real quick." or "Hey, you're close to leveling up. Forego sleep and keep getting XP!" or even "Hey, why not log in real quick instead of enjoying your evening? There could be some easy challenges today that you don't want to miss!" meaning that I just start to resent the entire game such that I don't want to play it at all. And when that happens, nobody wins, since it just means players end up opting out completely. Now for me, the famous skinflint, it's no loss for them, but I can't help but feel like I'm the only one. It's insidious.
---
I honestly wish they just went with the Expansion Pack monetization model of ESO, rather than what we have here. At least then the devs would be more incentivized to develop good content regularly, rather than keep people hooked on a line. I mean, Wastelanders was a fine expansion, but so much of it was hampered by the daily grind and unnecessary roadblocks added in to keep people playing. And the real irony is that there really isn't any reason to make people play every day. The ATOM shop is only updated weekly, so as long as people are playing once or twice a week, they're still being incentivized to buy stuff from there. I feel like this just encourages burn out. It's maddening.
---
Yea I‚Äôm constantly around the 30k cap limit so I‚Äôm just trying to clear stash space lol
---
As underarmor is kinda good, max upgraded it gives boost to 4 special stats, and most important int, good for leveling
---
Thanks you i didn‚Äôt no that :)
---
No. I‚Äôve never had this issue... you sure you are trying to build the correct plan that you read? Sometimes the plans have names that are misleading. 
---
Vault tec bed is a perfect example. I think you actually want simple modern bed.
---
Like what? Maybe a stealth bonus since it comes from the secret service.
---
Thank you, easy fix and worked. Though I tried it once before and the problem persisted so I thought it was something worse. I went to desktop and launched once more time and now it seem to work!
---
I was excited for the new seasons.  Probably one of the only ones that didn‚Äôt mind the lower atoms but higher cosmetics.  But the amount of time vs money is still atrociously high.  I was hoping playing daily and weekly while actively doing challenges would unlock everything.  Certainly not casual play, but missing 1 or 2 days would be ok.  But if someone misses just 1 day they have to do the repeatable 22 times to make up for it.... 220k exp. (and that‚Äôs only if they still did every weekly).
---
I hope the give us more time, many people are saying some of the score isn‚Äôt counting.  If we had 100 days, we wouldn‚Äôt even need the repeatable score if we did daily‚Äôs/weeklies.
---
I actually kind of like the concept of the converter, but not the execution in game. I mean it cleared out all my arrows, bolts, syringer, and .38 into a more useful round(5mm) but the cap is pitifully under what it should be ammopoint wise.
---
Xbox seems to be the worst about teams. I‚Äôve literally logged into multiple full servers without a single team even formed...like what!?
---
We need to ability to join high lvl player servers only so that maybe we can be placed with players who want to play the game at a high level.
---
I believe it's the game
---
Got any suggestions on how to fix it?
---
Yogi Bear go boom
---
Mack012166. I‚Äôll be on in about an hour and I sell all of them for 175 caps each.
---
Did you sell that thing yet?
---
that is a great idea
---
Such a flex.
---
I thank you for sharing your opinion.
---
Personally I think all the armors should have some sort of set bonus, even if it relatively minor. The better armors should definitely have better bonuses though.
---
Let me guess, you watched an angry turtle video üôÑ
---
Monkeys Paw: It makes the auto complete challenges bug so bad that it advances you to season level 100 without being able to get the rewards.
---
SCORE Challenge is account wide?
---
Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
---
yes, a lot
---
That is actually a good idea, it was annoying to figure out what I have to do whether it's on NW or Survival.
---
Bloodied is the only way to go!
---
No, I don't think it should have targeting hud.  As a power armor user, I am sick of them continually giving power armor advantages  to regular armor with none of the penalties. 
---
Using VATs and using jetpack depletes fusion core in power armor.    Doing the same thing in SS armor depletes nothing.
---
You can avoid it by not skipping any dialogue.
---
Do the scout quests. You can buy the plan from the vending machine.
---
We sould have a app like fallout 4
---
The challenge can be done on any character.  
---
However the rewards, when it‚Äôs time to claim them. It‚Äôs best to go to your main.
---
I did a spreadsheet on junk items used to craft .308 ammo in relation to the junk items that were used to produce the ammo you scraped for conversion.  
---
I used the base numbers, so no ammo smith or super duper.
---
Junk items used to produce 2028 rounds of .308 = 4225 junk items \[lead, steel, gunpowder, etc}
---
You scrapped 10128 rounds of ammo to get 2028 in return. By cartridge count you lost just under 80%. That's bullshit.. LOL .. but hey .308 is expensive to craft right?
---
Not so much, using the junk items to craft the 10128 rounds of assorted ammo you converted consumed 11,125 junk items.  The loss suffered was lower but still at just over 62%.  Really Bethesda?  We should only experience a 5 percent loss .. MAX.. Ammo is very recyclable.
---
When you redesign this ammo crapper, make it good.  We looted this ammo don't steal it, it cost you nothing.  Maybe steal a little more if we can just scrap the 15,000 rounds I got of 5mm in 4 steps but in one day, at a cost of 10% of the cost of crafting it. 
---
Crikey Bethesda, don't be so evil.
---
How many caps for the plan?
---
I assume those guys never go to other shops
---
Op Bloodied Tato build when?
---
It saves time for pa users or people they use Gatling lasers.
---
nope never really gotten around to it
---
Try these in Fallout76Custom.ini .. make a backup of your existing one and just try this then edit away!
---

---
Haha yeah, having that warning sign worded like that w as wasn't very helpful. At least have it to where it says "Warning, choosing this side will result in the other faction reputation reduced" somewhat like that.
---
Same as being naked.
---
The effort/reward ratio for some ammo types isnt worth the effort and stash space but for others it certainly is. I hang onto anything that converts to 60-70 points. The explosive and energy ammos and the stupid amounts of 5mm i seem to collect for some reason. Also arrows/bolts etc all have a decent point payout for amounts put in. They all go in and come out as .50 rounds to help feed my current favourite pastime of SBQ.  I dont stockpile, I just drop in whatever I have collected and dont want at the end of a session. Takes a few minutes.
---
Its not a useless contraption. It just needs a complete overhaul of the UI.
---
It would have enraged people who spent Tadpole badges if everyone got one for free now!
---
Yeah endurance needs some love. Every alt I make I think "yeah I'll make this a 12 end tank" and then just end up putting 4ish points in when I realise there's no perks worth using past fireproof, radicool and a few others. All the rest are just casual food and drink perks. And with food and drink debuffs being removed soon this will make over half the tree useless.
---
Seemed really chill, definitely a wholesome moment for me, especially when I saw what they were wearing!
---
Yeah I am sick of them continually giving power armor advantages to normal armor with NONE of the penalties. Jet pack use in power armor puts a dent in your fusion core charge - even if you have all three levels of power user. 
---
SS jet pack doesn't even require a power source, apparently.
---
Thanks future me!
---
Im still working on power armor plans. Its going to take awhile. So far i have the torso and both arms. No mods yet.
---
I got lucky and this dude was selling CAMP plans for 10-50 caps a piece. Which is what I usually price my duplicates.
---
Probably mothman since it‚Äôll be close to halloween
---
Why is that?
---
Ps4 right?
---
I think the armour penetration really increased damage
---
Sounds like cactus fruit
---
Yes. Ps4.
---
Or like a 15% chance to ignore damage from any attack
---
Well I am interested, haha.  Been seeing em on a few players and thought it looked really good.  Wanna check out my weapons?  I can share a list with you.
---
Theres a ghillie OUTFIT in NW...you sure they're using the armor and not the outfit?
---
I mean, I heard somewhere that someone got the armor to work.
---
It should. I don‚Äôt see why not.
---
Actually a lot of times i get this message my camp spot isn‚Äôt even taken by someone else. 
---
I often want to see what other players did at ‚Äúmy‚Äù place. But usually it‚Äôs not even occupied. 
---
This has happened for me since launch tho
---
Unyielding = way more exp per kill.
---
Just report them
---
As its supposed to be an enclosed suit of futuristic armour powered by a mini fusion reactor, capable of withstanding automatic rifle fire and weighing roughly a ton....
---
Not being instantly infected by a sodding mole rat would be a great idea.
---
Also should have the ability to stomp the little bastards back into the ground where they came from.
---
Same goes for stingwings. Except you should be able to pull their wings off first, then stomp them.
---
Random reward for completing Daily: Someone to Talk To, Event: The Messenger, Event: Uranium Fever, Event: Distinguished Guests, Event: One Violent Night, Event: Guided Meditation. Also low chance for receiving it during Daily: Mistaken Identity, Novice of Mysteries, Hunter/Hunted PVP, or any of the Powering Up quests.
---
May be received as a reward for completing Patrol Duty.

---
Get the final word from Beckett
---
isn‚Äôt there a track option?
---
Ok ty man
---
Yeah I feel like it can be longer but I like it the way it is.
---
If they made it longer would I disagree... Yes
---
Would I still grind to get it... Also yes
---
The armor looks like a lot of work went into it and I don't feel right not grinding to get it.
---
It's not that simple. I used to violate ToS all the time, then claim I was Role Playing as a person who violates ToS and always got off.
---
Yeah but using the aa prefix when I could have something else is lame but what can you do
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs what he means by populate the map frame, it just plops the challenge under the challenges box on the top right of the map
---
There needs to be pros and cons to each set so there isn't a definitive best power armor, T65 already has the best stats, a bonus would make wearing any other set pointless
---
Me and a friend was talking about how it would be good just to be able to throw junk at each other
---
That is a very very specific request. They had a flag pole flag. Beggars cants be choosers 
---
Also there‚Äôs already a clean flag for the wall 
---
This is a weak post
---
Just make an alternative
---
This happened to me when I started playing NW like a couple weeks ago for the challenges, I thought it was a feature
---
It‚Äôs a bug that they are active yea. Just got my snowflake metal armor skin!
---
Wrong game.
---
About 100 points into Level 20
---
I think I'm doing well (hopefully)
---
What do you use now?
---
I wouldnt mind a charging station for microfusion cells. Like get a drained MF cell when you shoot it and recharge it at the camp.
---
Craft secret service armor
---
20
---
Give some purpose to the roleplayer public groups
---
How am I so far behind!?! I‚Äôm having trouble getting a level a day!
---
Eventhough, the question remains. Is it worth the effort to be on a terminal for 45 minutes where you can get the same results plus more by wandering around, taking the factory, and even using the Ammo Making Machine. Until then. Bungie is going to make Ammo Converter a lot better then it is. It's funny because Bungie doesnt listens to any complaints or try to fix them, them listening to us on Ammo converter is something big. Haha

---
Most of the train station vendor bots should have the plans. Also the Whitespring vendor bots.
---
How!?! I only missed 1 day of dailies!
---
Example of issue:  [https://imgur.com/a/mm9w5hz](https://imgur.com/a/mm9w5hz)
---
I have a couple vanguard with ap mostly sturdy armor. I mix and match that with some unyielding and bolstering although only two are heavy armor I use regularly.
---
27
---
If your on Xbox, just drop by and ill give more than that for free. I dont use them and no one seems to buy them.
---
You can buy it from the Vendor bots at most Trains Stations
---
I missed like 2.5 days of dailies so I'm only rank 14. So don't feel bad haha
---
Ive done a lot of 10k repeatables
---
Should have kept track really
---
How are you at 14 after missing so much? I‚Äôm at 15 and I missed one day
---
Nothing even comes close to bloodied.  Junkie's is 2nd best, but you're talking like less than half the damage.  You can get by with just about any weapon, but a single star bloodied weapon is going to be better than any other weapon.
---

---
Hey while they‚Äôre at it, can they put our xp progress on the character select screen next to our level?
---
How?
---
Brilliant!
---
Well this one is already an alt in progress, but also that‚Äôs not quite what I was meaning - I‚Äôm not necessarily trying to cram two builds together as much as just wondering if there‚Äôs many situations where I‚Äôd need to go full-health, and if that sort of build would be feasible for those situations
---
That would also be nice!
---
I finished all the weeklies and have gotten the repeatable XP a good amount of times, running an events team and doing back to back queen fights
---
Falling through the floor doesn‚Äôt make you die, it flips and drops you back on the ground. I frequently jump into the upside down void to get interesting photos. People build camps down there all the time, it‚Äôs fun hunting for a way into their underground camp.
---
Oh, that's neat.
---
I thought so. Are there any situations where I‚Äôd need to go high-health?
---
I'm at 17 as well. I think that's right around we're "supposed" to be. Dont sweat it too much, you'll be gaining score points through getting experience, and there is supposed to be double experience and double score point weekends coming up. Unless they factored that in to the schedule, then quite a few people are fucked.
---
Just go out and kill stuff
---
Keep your team goal as building for the INT boost, and just before an event completes, swap it to the event xp boost
---
don't stress. It's cosmetic stuff. You don't have to do it.
---
Hmmm not a bad idea. Is that one of the best sets?
---
That's an apt comparison, in that the people who also whine about and skip leg day are weak-willed people who want everything handed to them without putting in the effort and work required.
---
You want to maximise your S.C.O.R.E gains every day? Then nut up and do the NW challenges and stop complaining. Just like you have to nut up and bust out those hard squats in the gym.
---
19. Will almost surely hit Level 20 tonight.
---
They accidentally reimplemented the holiday and Halloween rewards.
---
Ward like's giveing head lol
---
I usually see FCs go for 100 caps each.
---
I'm a cheap bastard so I don't buy them at 100 caps, but 50, now thats a bargain.
---
Everyone comes to complain no one comes to figure things out.
---
Have run three different heavy builds (Bloodied, Junkie's and Berserker's), and the only time I put on PA is when fighting the SBQ or running around in a nuke zone. Haven't really struggled with any of them outside of PA, but do notice an increase in damage when Stabilized is active in PA.
---
I don't really like the clunkiness of the PA, but greatly enjoy the heavy weapons :-)
---
How much do you have man?
---
I shop player vendors, upgrading a piece at a time as I find them. My endgame is crafting secret service armor until I get what I want.
---
It has the most DR/ER/RR out of any armors. Just keep  crafting until you get some good perks.
---
Just hit 22. Could be better but honestly I‚Äôm only playing an hour or two right now after dailies refresh and then heading off. 
---
There‚Äôs a great post someone made like an hour ago  about earning XP using food buffs and where to grind the repeatable best.
---
Ah ok, ticket will be submitted tonight. Hopefully its the 3/5 and my points balance is correct.
---
I will say I like this challenge, brings players together :)
---
And thank you for the info. 
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
S
---
How‚Äôd that berserkers build go for ya
---
It‚Äôs entirely because there is nothing else to do.
---
I barely have time to do my dailies every day. How am I supposed to get that far!?!
---
Alright. Thanks for the help. I‚Äôll get right to it. :)
---
Exactly what I did. 5 mins done.
---
Yea there‚Äôs mad pop in just walking lol
---
An instigating melee that reflects damage when blocking.
---
Me and everybody I asked can‚Äôt so I think nobody can
---
Jeesh.... Down voted for being a good guy. Yet again, this community makes no sense!
---
I'm 400 score into rank 20 atm
---
You can have a display name now, check out your Beth account settings
---
I love the super but I hate it‚Äôs sound when you‚Äôre just carrying it. I legit thought my sound was broke lol
---
Rank 20! Grinded to make up for the 1.5k I lost from autocompletion
---
To each their own. I want to get to 100 because for me it is fun. I learn .ore about the game through grinding which makes my normal play more meaningful. Hit 100 don't hit 100 do an RP squad just do what you want.
---
Ive done every daily, weekly and a few 10k, 7-8 times I think? Not really keeping track but I think I get them atleast twice a day, Im rank 18 I think
---
Im pretty sure youre doing alright tbh, just try to get as many dailies as possible in the future and use Build teams and event teams (while in events, duh lol) and you should get the 10k challenges passively
---
I really don‚Äôt see the need for bloodied unless it‚Äôs also just way more ammo efficient which I guess it is lol
---
I find percentage based perks are easier to manage, so if you‚Äôre inexperienced in the area I‚Äôd recommend adding serindipity in exchange for something like 1 rank of lone wanderer in case you run out of stims
---
So, it‚Äôs okay if I‚Äôm really just doing dailies and weeklies?
---
Well I did see a raider tent in the air one SBQ fight right after wastelanders so...
---
no, a big round orange lemon
---
Create a new character. Run to Flatwoods, do the first couple responders quests and you'll level up in 20 minutes.
---
My bloodied stealth comando is never above 30% health, usually 10-20%.  If I‚Äôm going to be in a nuke zone I will use the Stealth Suit or fall back on Excavator for carry weight.  With the Excavator I just need a small stack of Radaway, pop one every five minutes or so, they‚Äôre at the 12 o‚Äôclock position on my favorites wheel.
---
I missed the first day but every day since then I've grinded a few hours each evening just killing muties and ghouls.
---
Don‚Äôt just stay heavy guns, I have similar scores gains as this poster with a Carnivore Heavy Gunner set up
---
Oh no, I mean a score level.
---
Sadly if you‚Äôre struggling to find time to even do the dailies then maybe grinding right to 100 isn‚Äôt for you perhaps? It‚Äôs not really aimed at everyone but there‚Äôs nothing stopping you playing as you can and getting as far as you can in the event regardless. 
---
There is at least one x2 weekend coming up on the 16th which is a great opportunity to catch up for a few days, as well as the opportunity to use atoms to unlock levels too soon (150 a level) regardless of what you think is that it‚Äôs there. 
---
You‚Äôre doing fine and if you aren‚Äôt getting chance to do dailies it stands to reason most people on here who do and play extra and grind the repeatables will be further than you right? 
---
I dunno man just play when you can and see what happens. You‚Äôre by no means screwed or anything yet but if you are struggling to fit dailies in then you are gonna fall behind at some point really. It‚Äôs just if you can make it up or what happens I guess.
---
Increase your intelligence as much as possible using your armor (unyielding and the plus intelligence stat if possible). Shielded undershirt and jeans give you +3 intelligence. Farm cranberry relish and stay well rested for bonus xp. Also get the egg head mutation and herd mentality. Join the building public team to get even more intelligence with each bonded team member you have and finally if you can, run inspirational and strange in numbers. There‚Äôs no reason you shouldn‚Äôt be on a team anymore since public teams arrived. I do this and get 1,214 xp from the Whitespring sentry bots. One Whitespring run will give you 100 SCORE for the repeatable weekly or at least get you close
---
Load the challenge data when you select a character.
---
So, X01 isn't good? How do its base stats stack against T65?
---
I wish the 67 guys and gals who actually play NW would stop trying to make NW happen.
---
Well, it‚Äôs hard, but I always do the dailies now (missed 1 day). The point is, while I fit in the weeklies, it‚Äôs hard to do anything else.
---
Here's the pisser with dailies...the Level Up one is a cocksucker if you're high level so unless you GRINDDDDDDDDD you miss it AND the daily for completing 5 dailies...
---
That‚Äôs odd
---
I know this is frustrating to have happen but you being at rank 20 of 100 in less than one week of a ten week season is not behind at all..no offense but you‚Äôre well on your way to completing the season early.
---
I'd say the faster fire rate is useless because typically people use the cryolator on high hp enemies so they don't run away and its more for a higher dps (cryolator damage is crap). The quad is also useless because it already has a high capacity mag
---
ohhh ok ok thank you for clarifying
---
You are at the right spot, as of today without excessive grinding you should be at 16 or 17. So you aren't really far bahind
---
Oh okay, good to know. I‚Äôll probably go PA over Stealth Suit cause I suck at stealth
---
Mmmmm that boot tastes good master Howard
---
uppdate, 5 more skins obtained lol, well im just happy that nuclear winter is worth playing again cuz this bug
---
It's ok my dude. Don't judge yourself off other people's progress. Just do the dailies and weeklies you'll be fine. There's going to be a double XP week followed by a double daily score week so you'll be able to rank up pretty high if not all the way to 100 without grinding the repeatable XP goal. Save the atoms you earn to unlock the last few levels if you're still struggling
---
Mix with Nuka-cola Quantum and Abraxo. Watch mushroom cloud.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs understandable. Like I say it‚Äôs not for everyone and it‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs the only real content so far in this patch as daily login grinds are just terrible for most people really. 
---
Doing the dailies should be minimum aim if you wanna keep progressing to a decent level, I can do mine in about twenty minutes so it‚Äôs not that time consuming it‚Äôs just having to log in if you don‚Äôt usually ya know.
---
If you need lots of plans and junk, you can use the workshop glitch with home Defense to break objects to reset their inventory. Level 3 locks help make the loot rarer. I did it to get in excess of 200 ballistic fibre
---
What type of armor do you have?
---
Stacking tents doesnt really matter as long as you can do big damage. You are closer to head shots and the adds dont touch you. So im going to keep being that guy sorry.
---
Is there a translator for whatever the code is people are using to describe weapons? I've been playing since the beta and for about the past 3 weeks I've seen people talking about things like AA25FFR1A and BE2525EIEIO guns. Somebody help me understand these codes please.
---
I think after one more daily, I‚Äôll be at 16.
---
I have the 2nd tier of wet suit
---
Yea I'm going to need proof of that......
---
The mag is only 25 rounds
---
Can you get fluxes?
---
Is that like a fallout 76 version of vaccinated?
---
The quest marker is bugged, both my wife and I had the same issue. Was now problem once we found the three clues and continued the story.
---
I‚Äôm around score level 16. I‚Äôm thinking that I‚Äôll keep up with dailies and weeklies and get far. Maybe close to 100. Then I‚Äôll use the atoms I get from the pass, and maybe buy some, to finish it up.
---
Bruh I thought it was 60. Guess I was wrong sorry
---
Create new char, grab perk cards in vault 76 - easy level up. delete char. next day create new one and repeat.
---
IIRC, you get the toilet plan from taking (or defending) one of the workshops.  I want to say Gorge Junkyard, but I could be wrong.
---
If you are talking about the player terminal, it was (and might still be) a freebie in the atom shop some time ago.
---
  If you are looking to add a jetpack, you probably need to find a good supply/source for fusion cores.
---
That said, I may have at least the toilet plan on my char.  
---
Have you run a nuke zone at whitesprings?  you can get a decent amount of cobalt there.  Fissure prime and toxic valley are good for violet.
---
I‚Äôll be on sometime later tonight.  PSN aj ninetyeight in game aj-98
---
You think the dailies and weeklies, with some atoms at the end, will be enough?
---
Yes, BIS Cryolator for SBQ...maybe even the new Wendigo colossus boss when he's out (Though I don't know if he's gonna be affected or if he can still spawn stuff while frozen)
---
Point of a Cryolator for bosses isn't damage, it's to get them frozen asap. Quad and FFR is the best at doing that.
---
Do you mean Bethesda?
---
If you want flux you might be able to get them but I haven‚Äôt tested that yet. You can try to farm Scorched Earth by server hopping. It always drops a 2* combat armor that you can scrip as well as a few random pieces of flux
---
Chinese stealth armor with a small backpack
---
You can use the workshop glitch with home defence to grind for it
---
it does when others rely on the queen landing to deal good damage
---
The fallout maker. I dont pay attention to logos XD
---
It's across characters?
---
If they nerf bloodied or buff other legendarys
---
I'm on right now. Pretty sure I've got a toilet and a bathtub in my vendor for 25 or 50 caps. 
---
I'm right next to Ohio river adventure
---
Same here - on xbone and not even close to server reset.
---
It‚Äôs certainly one of the ones I pretty much always do. I‚Äôm sitting on a load of weapons right now to sell
---
I missed two days and I'm at 17... It's the 10k xp repeatable that's bringing people up. Join a team and just grind events and kill lots of mutants. Buff your Intelligence as much as possible and eat canned meat stew
---
Sounds like a plan. The 16th weekend will have a huge impact if you can get on for it and do it. Stock up on those XP buffs, use intelligence foods, get in teams and just do the  dailies whilst grinding killing enemies in a building team. The SCORE will fly up.
---
Instead stuff tato into car, wait for condition to deplete until it explodes.
---
Unfortunately END is broken and you don't get any extra hp or other buffs, but if you're a melee character the +4 str is nice.
---
Stuff into SBQ's ear for crit damage
---
I just want the chicken coop. My goal is rank 78 I think.
---
I‚Äôll add you later for sure yeah, I want to use the jet pack for building I want to not feel like a noob at level 64 so like getting a few things would help 
---
I meant the power connected terminal the personal terminal is too clunky to use for a deco
---
It should've just shipped as a vendor/container style menu, like I'm not even mad at the exchange rates, just the god awful interface
---
They need a pvp team mode
---
Gotcha ok
---
You mean Attack of the Killer Tatos is real?
---
Let them focus on fixing the game first.
---
It's random where but they spawn after the circle sops moving. I got all three done hiding in bushes at the edge of the fire
---
There's a big difference between simply preventing airborne/waterborne disease and having enemies highlighted. Implementing this would pretty much make every head cosmetic useless as the targeting HUD far, far outweighs customization. If Bethesda were to add a Targeting HUD to the SS helmet, they should also change the helmet itself to act like under armor so people can still wear what they want over top without sacrificing such a major bonus.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can help you out with leveling and getting plans
---
The record holders killed her in 7 seconds using bloodied sneak melee.
---
I‚Äôm down, should I add you?
---
Hah, I was wondering this. Thanks for posting, I didn't know about the tool. Since about a half-week before patch 20, I have been having horrible lag on almost every attempt to do anything in the game. Everything from opening a container (viewing its objects) to performing a task to shooting an enemy had at least a 1 second lag. This morning, which was Sunday morning in my neck of the woods (about 8-10 hours ago), I finally lucked out and had a responsive server, but literally every connection for a minimum of twice a day for a bunch of days has been a disaster.
---
I just ran the tool from the OP and here's my results, from western Canada. My ISP is one of the major providers and has been good in the past.

Nah PS4 ty tho. I think I'm doing alright I went from 17 to 29 in one evening
---
Most people are just angry becouse they can't be lazy causal couch potatoes, and actually have to work for the cool things instead of it being handed to them.
---
They are acting like spoiled rich kids who have had their 10,000 dollar allowance taken away, they are flipping out.
---
Well, consider yourself one lucky guy.üëç
---
Go for it.
---
it's challenges for whole account. doesn't matter what char you use to complete them. same thing with NW overseer rank daily. it is easy to just create new char play one NW game and rank up.
---
Jet pack *and* VATS take chunks out of cores. The Jet pack at least is explainable, the VATS is a purely gameplay mechanic nerf to power armor.
---
I have the same issue sometimes. Oddly my X lags more than my S.
---
The benefit to the stealth suit is the radiation protection, equal to a hazmat suit.  Not a bad idea to get in a stealth or hazmat suit prior to power armor in a rad zone.....in case you accidentally step out of it!!
---
Armor (pocketed, deep pocketed, WR), backpack, calibrated shocks on you PA, radstag or ribeye steak.... excavator or other type of PA....all can affect carry weight, anywhere from 5 to over 300#.
---
For example, all my regular armor is deep pocketed with weight reduction, plus I have a high capacity backpack and several WR perks.
---
As a result, I gain 300# every time I get into PA.
---
Had about 300 last I looked. Likely around that now.
---
A very lazy but damn effective build; [https://imgur.com/a/kNU3iDj](https://imgur.com/a/kNU3iDj)
---
I'm sure there are a million ways I could make it more efficient or make quality of life improvements, and I probably will, but it works. Marsupial is of course a -4 INT but I'm willing to take that hit for the convenience.
---
I just care about the glow in the dark space wallpaper. After that I'm pretty much done. The cosmetic in this season event stink to be quite honest.
---
Agreed but at the same time I‚Äôd rather them spend time on other things
---
&gt;I've been trying a bloody build with secret service armor and it still doesn't hold up to my power armor.
---
Something is wrong with your build of that's the case.
---
15 or 16 I think.  I've been playing but not specifically grinding.
---
Chewing on going herbivore to maximize XP buffs but not quite sold yet.
---
I really do enjoy NW but I wish the challenges would be something simple like play 2 NW matches
---
Super Duper Antibiotics from Disease Cures, makes a big difference.
---
God damn it I have to move my airship :( but I guess I‚Äôll need to fly it away
---
I get that. But nothing is changing in my gear. I'm using the Chinese stealth armor so no mods. And a simple backpack with a ribeye diet. So the change should me everytime the effect wears off. But I does it like every 5-10 min
---
I been crashing like crazy on pc as well
---
As a melee build with a Inst 40SS 1STR
---
it aint bugged here...5K damage on first hit, 2400 on subsequents
---
bloodieds are for min maxers
---
Personally i go Junkies Heavy weapons for SBQ/Project Paradise  but for everything else my Unarmed build doesnt need a bloodied weapon
---
Curious..where are you at?
---
Im an unarmed but run quests...im at level 22 in the Leg. Run
---
Is there any way to compare weapon stats side by side like in Diablo?
---
This was a problem for me as well.  I just slowly searched the building until I found the things i needed.  It was frustrating, but didn‚Äôt take to long.
---
Shoulda tried to lure some nasties to kill em
---
Console has potato cpu
---
I‚Äôve never seen one but I‚Äôm sure the thought of a good 3 star took this trader‚Äôs life üòÇ
---
Maybe you have to side with raiders?
---
Drop a nuke at her location.
---
Platform if Xbox I have a spare one
---
That and id like to be able to have then shown outside of the map to. Like a quest thingy.
---
That's what I am right now. It has good gains but ammo cost ooofff
---
Yeah I found mine in Harper's ferry for 2800 I think.
---
So it would be very straightforward to make the ammo converter like a store. It would list all the possible ammo you could buy with ammo points on the right hand side and all the possible ammo you can sell on your left. Ammo points would be another currency like legendary scrip.
---
Yea, give the dupers something else to work on... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I was in that battle myself lol
---
Hell yeah, pull those wings off then stomp on them, LoL!!!  Feeling ya
---
My mole miner gauntlet hits in the mid teens regularly ... 6k with basically no consumables.
---
As someone who uses CAMP building as a way to have some longevity in the game, i really want those CAMP items.
---
Pay to win still applies in games like this.  I think in this case it just applies to pvp.  You cant win the game but you can win pvp.
---
Gawd damn.
---
You can buy one for 2 tadpole badges.
---
That's a funny looking desk????!?!??
---
The heavy weapon that costs almost no AP to use. Because im calling bullshit on that one.
---
Well said.
---
This just happened to me too. 3 daily challenges already ticked but no SCORE awarded. I logged a ticket bu the Bethesda support site says: "Please be aware that Bethesda Customer Support is not able to adjust points."
---
I now know what my next FO4 play through is gonna be like. Thank you!
---
I think the way this season is setup is insane, especially with the plethora of battle pass examples out there already to show how to do it properly. I was moving apartments and getting amenities set up the 30th-3rd and now seeing how it works I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to finish it even with the quarantine I‚Äôd still have to do this every single day and probably still not make it. 
---
Outside of at least 4 other battle passes I was able to grind out in a day-week, some are much longer sure but even call of duty which seems to have an extreme length on it can be done quicker than this. And with continual challenges and things if you want to keep grinding in a day, here you are limited in what actually upgrades the pass which is wild. Additionally I get that is free but also as a fallout first subscriber getting no levels or benefits to the pass is also pretty upsetting. Sure I could spend atoms from fallout first, but I already have to either waste those on non discounted bundles for items of which I already have half of but still have to pay full atoms to complete the sets. 
---
Additionally the challenges themselves are not super fun or accommodating as someone who‚Äôs loves the building but is at capacity building things that are totally unneeded or just to be scrapped is terrible. Picking up more scrap an items to delete isn‚Äôt fun either, ‚Äúbuild 15 connectors in camp‚Äù? Seriously? It feels like the best way to do any of these is to make a new character and then claim rewards on your main if that even works
---
Its weird that you couldnt kill her bc i come across legendary raiders (not blood eagle ones) that i can kill and they drop legendaries.
---
Roll a furious explosive 50 cal.....
---
Yeah ... I mean you are running a risk, and u definitely die more than when running full health, but the DPS and other benefits to me are well worth it.
---
Note that 4 people can each activate a lunchbox and they will stack for a +100% XP buff.
---
All those other games do everything server side.
---
Fallout 76 does a lot of things client side.
---
Rubberbanding health is a consequence of the time lag it takes for your client to talk to the server, and then back again.
---
Your client is recording higher damage numbers faster than the server is, and then it's getting updated numbers back from the server that are lower than what your client thinks.
---
i think people read your comment.
---
Logging in. Send me a friend request.
---
First I‚Äôm hearing of it personally, but that‚Äôs cool.
---
Go to the market they are all super cheap except the junkies ones
---
I don't see the point,only way to do challenges is to be ingame so idk,that's my opinion on that
---
Can I find your camp server hoping?
---
Everyone has already explained that every time you log in, your CAMP will be where you put it, just the way you put it, but if someone else already has a CAMP or tent in that spot, then you will have to choose whether to have the game try another server or just load the game without your CAMP (it will still be there the next time, as long as you don't move it).  
---
Every time I log in, whether on private or public servers (I have FO 1st), my CAMP is right where I put it, just how I put it.  Even switching back and forth between private and public servers, there is absolutely no difference in how my CAMP looks.  Someone already mentioned the large area per CAMP, so there is no way to interlock your CAMPs together.  However, if you happen to set up near a road, then the two of you could be right across the road from each other, to visit each other whenever you want.  If you decide to set up near a stream, then one of you could have your CAMP overlap the stream, set up some water purifiers in there, and you could share those resources.  Maybe the one on the other side of the stream, but not overlapping the stream, could set up a vegetable garden that you could both share for food resources.  There are plenty of great possibilities that could work for both of you "sharing" your CAMPs in the game, even if you can't interlock the two together.  :) 
---
Because I am a solo player, I do not know how it works, but I have read things on Reddit about players coming to other players' CAMPs to build things in that CAMP for them.  If the two of you wanted to share the same CAMP, then one of you could just build a CAMP and both of you use it.  Everything I can think of would work, EXCEPT for the other person's Stash Box.  The one who did not build the CAMP would just have to build their own Stash Box in the CAMP, because there is no way for the two of you to use the same Stash Box.  If the other person building their own Stash Box in the CAMP does not work (I am not sure if one player can build their own Stash Box in another player's CAMP, or not), then that player could just set up a CAMP "site" nearby, just put down one floor square, and put their Stash Box there.  It would just involve some running back and forth to CAMP, if they need to grab something or drop something in their Stash Box.  However, the one who did not build the CAMP would NOT be able to fast travel to it for free, so I would still recommend they set up a CAMP "site" nearby, for free fast travel reasons, even if they just put down one floor piece.
---
indeed, congratulations on 1k Upvotes, that's massive.
---
Sorry mate but I got back and I dont have them. Must've sold.  Best of luck finding them though.
---
I know it‚Äôs kind of unrelated, but we also shouldn‚Äôt have to go all the way back to the main menu to switch server. Just put me straight into the loading screen without needing to exit, please.
---
Ran into one at the same excat location the other day.
---
Ah shoot, I read so fast I didn‚Äôt realize you said melee as well. Yeah, melee can deal some serious damage.
---
James and the giant Oof
---
I've been joining Builder teams on xbox.  Last one was funny as a 3* contactor care was shared by one player.  There was another that shared expert shotgun. It seems that if you're lucky to get a team of 4, you'll just have accept cards that do not really help.
---
&gt; If you don‚Äôt get the monkey backpack, that bites, but it isn‚Äôt a big deal. 
---
\*sigh\* if only that were true. No Jangles backpack would mean i've failed as a man!
---
Is that spot near a Wendigi spawn. ( I'm unsure if it is but could be a reason)
---
Oh i get it. I like the up close and personal aspect thats why i run half rads...im not bloodied but these melee weapons havent let me down against anyone in the game.
---
Yea i cant one hit the SBQ...but all i need is one or two hits for loot and no ammo wasted
---
I would an enclave season or a vampire type season (think old school dracula)
---
RE4 says hi.
---
Hahah yea probablyüòÇ
---
Same for me a few hours ago. This seems rigged.
---
lol really? That‚Äôs funny. At one point I just put my controller down because it was 2am and I didn‚Äôt have the brainpower to shoot it midair
---
I want them to feel it too. Lol.
---
But that's the point of upgrading, isn't it?  Something that takes a solid month to grind shouldn't just be a pseudo-sidegrade.  I realize that the stats are much better, but they honestly should be and there should also be some sort of set bonus.  If they wanted to keep the different PA's relevant at max level/end game play, they could give each set their own unique set bonus.  Or even give 2, 4 and 5 set bonus so that players could mix and match if they so desired.
---
That would be so awesome to have an assaultron at your camp to protect it, I have all these defenses and shit still walks in my front door lol
---
Finally someone with the guts to help
---
I would like an app to track all my challenges dailies, script and caps. It would be pretty neat if I could see each characters inventory as well.
---
Would be nice to give ADS a boost to be more on par with a VATs crit build
---
No. Always craft the lowest level possible when you're just gonna scrap them for mods.
---
Absolutely. I'd like them on my HUD with my quests.
---
556 and 5mm are about the only ammo worth it in the ammo machine. Even 45 takes forever
---
21 playing 2hr/day
---
Got this too.
---
Maybe it was added in the update. The grenades are trash tho
---
I was thinking some sort of death by tato explosion on a molecular level, but that would be funny too.
---
So im similar to you...but i dont run bloodied at all
---
Def doable
---
Weirdly enough, the Legendary Run menu runs faster than every menu in the game for me. It's super fast and responsive no matter where I mouse to (On PC)
---
The floater grenades started showing up after patch 20, so, new and probably a bug.
---
How to terrify the players in one sentence:
---
Throwing a tato now dupes every legendary item on the server and vendors have been disabled as a result
---
They weigh a lot too. I accumulated a few and ended up yeeting them all in the air for funsies
---
No.
---
Right into 16, I‚Äòm not grinding on that, I always do the dailies while doing my normal stuff
---
Just hit 31 I wish they kept track a how many times I did the 10k quest cuz damn I know it was a lot not doing the NW quest so wanted to be sure I‚Äôm close or over 100 by the end
---
I've seen Grahm as a legendary a few times.
---
I'm currently rank 18, trying to find ways to get lots of XP fast to get it higher but coming woefully short. I cannot commit enough time to the game (plus I genuinely can't find much else to do being so late game)
---
What‚Äôs in the boooox?!
---
Fair enough. But why not build that character to maximise XP gain and kill in one/two shots if you can? It's not like this is the only season coming. Having a character that is an efficient killer and grinder, who enemies rarely to never even see, is going to be useful for the foreseeable future.
---
Believe it or not, most of this is 'setup', and playing normally on this character is perfectly possible and even preferable now that fast XP gain is rewarded.
---
Interstellar
---
Thanks man! So generous. If theres anything you need in game, just me know I might have it
---
Delayed until at least patch 21 (August ish)
---
Oof. Thanks for that.
---
Any suggestions for which unders people might want? Which outfits too?
---
Preach br√∂ther
---
I actually love them if you have all explosive perks.equupped
---
Wait what?
---
WOW. Such an amazing job, and what a great way to capture it. Love getting to see it throughout the different light and then at night as well, getting all the different views. It's such a great job you've done keeping the aesthetics true to the game, while adding your own touch, with lots of eye catching touches and good use of colors, accessories in a really unique way. I would REALLY love a long full walkthrough, would you consider doing an actual talking walk through and discuss each area, talking about the entire process, how you chose the items, your thoughts about what you wanted to create, ect? I personally would enjoy this a lot. If you do, please let me know!
---
Ooo glad i came across this. Ill move to minecraft and wait then
---
I lucked out at the Purveyor and got this gun: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fancy_pump_action_shotgun
---
It has been such a game changer for regular questing and events. I have to switch to another weapon at events when a legendary appears because this gun will take them out so quickly. 
---
Now I tear through 62 feral ghouls with one shot. I have a levered rifle for long distance but that shotgun has made me love to play and not be afraid of higher level mobs. Bonus that the ammo is easy to get.
---
How about a way to play without other people seeing when you're on? Like how the appearing offline thing is supposed to work? 
---
You know, so I can play again without blocking like 30 people.
---
My friend has a TSE Dragon...i had a 3* Instigating one.
---
We did a classic duel
---
he missed his shot...i didnt
---
So...instigating wins if you dont miss...
---
but yea in terms of outright damage on one shot a TSE dragon...ooof
---
but ive seen TSE Auto Laser Rifles do insane damage
---
Or just fix guns to work like guns rather than short range blunderbusses.  The stupid damage drop off is as bad or worse than her stupid flat 70% damage reduction.
---
Gauss mini needs its own ammo type like a core or drums instead of loose 2mm
---
It depends on what you're doing when you play as well. I spend a lot of time prepping silos, so that's basically downtime for the xp grind.
---
EXACTLY I THOUGHT THIS BEFORE!
---
Eh...I don't have anything fancy.  T-60 PA and a fairly standard heavy weapons loadout.  No junkie/bloodied build.
---
it should be available on an app
---
I like where you're coming from here, it's like how they were originally intended to be in 76.
---
Right now we really only have 3 choices: Excavator, Strangler, or T-65. Everything else is already wholly inferior(even tho it's just marginal differences). Set bonuses for every set would be great and promote PA collecting again.
---
Faschnat fireworks!
---
Can't find the post that did the math but yes. You'll even be able to skip several of the NW dailies if you don't feel like doing them all. You won't even have to spend the atoms if you don't want to
---
Im a sniper/shotgun build literally everything else i have but all the weight reducing shit which would be helpful is in str aside from a smlelect few
---
So, its Bethesda's fault then
---
It is an odd situation to be sure.
---
It's such a shame. I feel like if I picked a bunch of random high schoolers, they would have a better design.
---
Pretty sure extractors etc will still produce resources but if you lose the workshop I'm pretty sure the resource extractors will switch ownership once the workshop switches owner.
---
Yeah I may have to acquire some before the next one.
---
pipe Tato cannon, uses tatos as ammo
---
Some of the rewards look pretty decent for this event (plushie, rug, heads on a rack etc).
---
That was jokes
---
Oh im all over. Dailies, Horde events, Enclaves, all the big Pub Events. Once i see downtime its nuke runs. Drop 3 in an hour get mine along with dailies. I just played for 3hrs an got 3 BP levels. Might hop on later an go for 1-2 more
---
end the night at 25 would be sweet
---
it always helps if your team is aware too.
---
Sonny had a ghoul officer helping him behind the counter one day.  Weird that it wasn't trying to shoot me or anything, guess he was trained.  Couldn't take the beeping though.  Sorry Sonny.
---
Yeah I'm looking forward to it :) it'll be really nice just to have a new boss too
---
They have a PTS for this kind of shenanigans though, so why would they push bugs live to public servers?
---
Maybe it's time to lay off the Mentats and take off the tinfoil hat?
---
Level 20 now.
---
Y√´z. But sadly I think bethesda is too lazy to make an app:/
---
Currently 28, 
---
Repeatable XP S.C.O.R.E
---
I put in about 3-5 hours per day.
---
on ps4 the run an atomic shop menus don't lag much.  it takes three or four reboots of the game until they load though.
---
Well, u/bit-by-a-moose might disagree.
---
August 4th I think is the date for the next patch.
---
Have yiu tried using alt characters? Using level 1 to do this once a day is easy.
---
Same here. I start the building team and nobody joins. Sometimes someone will then leave like 2 minutes later. I‚Äôve even seen a legendary team full.
---
Hey! Don‚Äôt let one bad apple spoil the bunch. Not all moose are bad moose.
---
Yeah, our group tried it at Line in the Sand and we flipped out when it worked. We weren't able to test with Lunchboxes from 5 players, and we're saving the them for double XP. NON-bloodied I was getting nearly 200 XP per scorched. Tag everything with a Tesla and I got at least 20K XP just from Line in the Sand (I didn't track exactly how much XP it was).
---
I'm about to hit bullion cap and I have nothing to buy because I've bought anything useful already and I don't see any point in buying the T-65.  I might even buy the pointless SS helmet just to not hit cap.
---
Many of the weekly challenges award the SCORE early rather than on completion. So at the 3/5 point usually
---
You got it after the third robot destroyed .
---
They are steam players. Unless they conect the accounts they nicks will be stuck like that for others.
---
Yes, she refuses to give me anything but utter trash.
---
And PvP is 100% optional. So it‚Äôs manufactured competition.
---
That‚Äôs no different than having a manufactured competition around speed running single player video games. 
---
Congratulations, you ‚Äòwin‚Äô at a small part of the game. 
---
What did you win, by the way, when you won that PvP?  *Oh... about 40 caps and maybe some scrap.*
---
Gee.  You ‚Äòpaid‚Äô to ‚Äòwin‚Äô that?  Neat story, bro.
---
That's how you blackpowder pistol.
---
Wait, really? I heard you‚Äôd still need like 5000 xp
---
Jetpack skins cannot be put on legacy jetpack equipment.
---
Shotgun is pretty good.
---
I thought the same, I‚Äôm level 208. I‚Äôve played for 2-3 hours tops every night and leveled up easily. I feel like something changed because it‚Äôs been surprisingly easy. I have been more focused on increasing intelligence with food and getting any XP bonuses so maybe that‚Äôs helped
---
That sounds like using the godmode glitch to stack XP buffs, honestly.
---
If you open 6 lunch boxes will XP stack to over 100%?
---
that'll be 130 euros a year please (fallout 1st)
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad, I went to sell some the other night and did the same thing. Almost made a post here saying the same exact thing. Not quite sure what I was thinking.
---
Decided to compare this to the actual state lines, and you're a bit off. 
---
* Pennsylvania, and more specifically Pittsburgh is almost straight perfect north of Morgantown. Like the Pioneer Scout Camp would basically be on the Penn line, and it would cut all the way over to at least Grafton.
---
* Maryland state line is a straight line with Penn. that then curves back north east. The rivers are different in FO, so I'm having a hard time figuring out where that line would go. The only thing I could say is that it'd start around the Pumpkin house, drop down to Atlas, then cut back over and up. And when I say ip, I mean like north of the Capital Wasteland. Some of FO3 may have been in West Virginia...
---
* Virginia state line would start just outside of Foundation. The Monorail Elevator is probably the state line as that would make sense with the cliffside. That line would then have to about where yours is with Maryland.
---
* The Ohio and Kentucky part though I'll give you as close enough. Though comparing the distance, I'd almost say the Ohio line would cut through probably along the river that Dutche's place is on. Looking at it now, I'd put money down that Vault 76 would actually be in Ohio. 
---
All in all though, the locations and landscape don't line up hardly at all. And the distance between them, even with scale, is not anywhere close to the distance with IRL places. Appreciate the food for thought though.
---
I haven't tried shotgun. 10mm is good too. I know this because someone switched mine from 556 to 10mm and it took me a bit to realize it.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be suprised if bethseda made it a buyable optionXD
---
That‚Äôs probably what happened. Thanks
---
I had the same problem yesterday with the vault tec bed. Read it but can‚Äôt build it
---
it's broken
---
sometimes it doesn't charge. Sometimes it does.
---
Lets see if channels who are dedicated Fallout 76 content talk about it to get Bethesda's attention, Innov did one of my posts once.
---
They're too heavy, I just drop them on the ground.  It's weirdly good for arrows though.
---
why tho, i rather like the barter item for item trades tbh
---
Contact customer support, keep pushing and complaining, they locked my tickets and insisted that they won't provide any missing score... But if enough of us complain something might happen... ;(
---
here I am plonking down three log cabins, a water wheel, a water purifier, a few turrets on th back of trucks, and a farm.
---
Meanwhile people are out there building the actual Death Star
---
best  
---
heavy  
---
weapon  
---
GATLING GUN!  
---
by far  
---
only heavy you need lol
---
not mega heavy, decent balance between fire rate and accuracy, and wicked damage for the capacity.
---
i run one without a single anything in heavy weapons.  i do have high strength and endurance, but still, works like a treat.  managed to snag a faster fire rate explosive one from a vendor for cheap.  chews through the big beefy monsters i'd rather cheese than kill legitimately with my pistols.
---
had a lower level executioner as well that worked great as well.
---
I also hope they increase the base amount you can place and add mannequin to the game for rare outfits.
---
As somebody who was born in the region where this event came from in Germany, this feels really strange.
---
Nice. Is this on PC or Console?
---
This is related but different to that bug, as this effects people who don't even play Nuclear Winter!
---
My take, as a non power armour user:
---
- t-65 should be able to have up to three legendary stars.
---
- strangler same
---
-prototype 2 stars 
---
- t-60 and ultracite 1 Star
---
- rest no stars.
---
Just my thoughts.
---
Yes, but that takes up way to many perk points that I normally use for Stabilized and Power User
---
Why haven‚Äôt you been scripping it the whole time? There‚Äôs no need to wait. Due to daily limits it‚Äôs better do do it now. Though the max you can save up to 1k.
---
Buy legendary modules on your main tbh
---
Blackwater mine, completed in less than 3 minutes
---
They also locked my tickets too... So no chance of ever reaching a human!
---
Fair enough
---
&gt; So if I'm not willing to spend money on goofy cosmetics, and I'm already burnt out of the grind, I guess my only option is to do the sane and rational thing and just ignore the whole Score system and move on with my life. But that's where the sickness of Fear of Missing Out really shines. Because even if I did just start playing like normal again, there would always be that voice in the back of my mind going "But hey, you could just do this challenge real quick." or "Hey, you're close to leveling up. Forego sleep and keep getting XP!" or even "Hey, why not log in real quick instead of enjoying your evening?
---
This is sadly what motivates me some nights to hop on 76 with friends instead of chilling and playing a single player game from my backlog. When 3 days of daily challenges and the weekly were all marked as completed last week before the patch, I lost motivation to play and instead finally played Dead Space.
---
&gt; I honestly wish they just went with the Expansion Pack monetization model of ESO, rather than what we have here. At least then the devs would be more incentivized to develop good content regularly, rather than keep people hooked on a line. I mean, Wastelanders was a fine expansion, but so much of it was hampered by the daily grind and unnecessary roadblocks added in to keep people playing.
---
This is what Zenimax has been experimenting with since Fallout Shelter; ways to makes their company worth more and to keep their big investor happy.
---
Yes actually, has happened to me multiple times, and it's a guaranteed glitch to happen if you respawn with more weight than your maximum limit.
---
I‚Äôve been there when he‚Äôs been in just his underwear too. 
---
I assume you‚Äôd just left and he had trouble with his buttons, that dirty wasteland horndog.
---
They seem to be locking all tickets about this issue, repeatedly saying they won't do anything about it!
---
Wasn't able to test with 5 the one time we found out they stack, as we're saving the rest for double XP.
---
Either bloodied or unyielding or both
---
The thing that makes them meh for me is the fact each time I've joined a public team no one is trying to do anything and instead it feels like wasted effort. That's been my experience at least. It just gets frustrating since I have limited time to even attempt to get score and instead pepple are just sat at their camps or sat somewhere on the map not moving.
---
Same here. The ammo converter idea is good but implementation sucks
---
The level up one is easy to do when starting a new character.  I haven't done the revamped quests (Responders, Mistress of Mysteries, etc) when Wastelanders launched.  So it is just a matter of gain a level and quit playing that character for the day.
---
Check out the market 76 sub. You can usually find someone selling flux there
---
