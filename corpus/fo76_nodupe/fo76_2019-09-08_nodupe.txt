Your friend unlocked it through the atom shop and you didn't.
---
---
---
I‚Äôll give you 10k caps for it on Xbox?
---
Unlock in atomic shop?
---
I get plenty of interactions on PS4. Just gotta plug in the mic. Id say 1/3 turns their mics on, the other 2/3 will atleast answer with emotes.
---
I looked in my atom shop it wasn‚Äôt even there
---
The next season will include the red viper skins for all armor just like the ghillie did
---
Then find a way to scan those tools?
---
I moved my camp today for the first time in over a year and Gramps just stands silently by the door.  No more fart jokes on endless repeat.  I didn‚Äôt realize how annoying it was.
---
Thats where I had to unlock it.
---
they cant becouse there log system isnt as complex as other companies all im saying is i dont want hackers selling untradable items becouse no one can buy them legit
---
Well that comes back to the sort of lazy story telling that you get in Bethesda titles. Not just with Fallout but even Elder Scrolls their stories have just gotten to the point that you kind of forget 99% of it.  
---

---
The funny thing is an Enclave faction would probably be super popular for some people BUT ultimately it would just show the main issue Bethesda has with the IP and that's doing new things with it. Their world of Fallout is very small and is built around the same stuff again and again.  
---
Honestly at this stage, I am expecting when Fallout 5 is eventually released... I will probably not exactly be rushing to play it unless they do anything special with it.
---
I would take this before one wasteland if I had a McChoice.
---
And was could set it off at camps giving us defence built bases that we could build and test.
---
Someone disliked your comment... What a loser. Hope he dislikes mine.
---
Dang I don‚Äôt know why mine didn‚Äôt show up that sucks
---
All 3.
---
I saw one for the first time a few days ago. A guy with an explosive .50cal MG with (I think) a laser rifle beam splitter stuck on the end of the barrel that split every shot into like 8 bullets.
---
Still managed to fail the event though lol.
---
My wife has a knack for this.  She manages to get 1 or 2 every night we play the game.  I think she's somehow bribing the RNGesus.
---
It showed as only being available for two days so you may have missed it. It was on the last tab on the bottom row. May still be there. I haven‚Äôt looked today.
---
I agree and will be the same way
---
I had someone message me just to tell me they thought my camp is disgusting
---
Nah .50 and 5mm tend to be much better and don't run into the issue as much, for whatever reason. Gatling lasers/plasmas are really bad offenders. People are saying handmades and fixers too
---
Well, to be completely honest:  
---
vault steel is mostly underwhelming (everyone goes for the "better" secret service stuff)  
---
and modules help with armor, and then really only shotgun/heavy (as anyone would play pistols seriously :P) weapons.  
---
The average drop chance of a "random purveyor" is therefore "normally" better for:  
---
Rifle users (Fixer/Handmades)  
---
Melee users (Tenderizer/Bear Arms/Powerfist/Super Sledge/Grognak Axe)  
---
Wierd people (Bow and Arrow)  
---
Supporters (Flamers and the like)  
---
Proof: None really, but coming from that "maybe pistols are good" build to a rifle build to a part time non-powerarmor heavy build (minigun/308/plasma caster with a good gauss shotgun roll) shows that you can get about half of the current builds OUTSIDE of module crafting.  
---
Also, module crafting makes getting a good weapon so much easier. I would actually understand if you could module craft a tenderizer or fixer with it, but that would break the game/the trading of the holy B/E/25|J/25/25 Fixers.
---
500 hours in 60 days??? Holy crap. That‚Äôs over 8 hours a day, every day.
---
They would of if they could just that means they would have the right to scan you pc making it harder to keep secure passwords and info as they commonly store stuff on whats on your pc if they were allowed too
---
They actually know if you are using said tools or not. It's just that they are not doing anything about it. You underestimate Bethesda. They know
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not there oh well maybe next time üòÇ
---
Something smells fishy....
---
Thanks friend. Damn annoyed I missed it.
---
I think something along the area of that one mission you can do for the raiders.  You get ten waves of harder and more zombie and you have to stay in the arena are.  You die you get thrown out of the areana.  Could be interesting
---
I‚Äôd say so, but I‚Äôd hold off on purchasing it for a week or two. There‚Äôs some weirdness going on with people subscribing lately and not getting their atoms, or the subscriptions just not actually doing what they‚Äôre supposed to do.
---
really becouse someone on the inside said they cant detect certing things one of the biggest rmters takes items from ban account
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre missing out on much honestly.
---
Yeah but it'd be cool if everyone on a server got into a fire fight. Ya know?
---
You missed it, it left the shop already
---
I very much like this idea. Like a lot
---
üëçüëçüëç
---
Probably a bugged horde event.  The boss was probably stuck under terrain or inside a wall.  It happens sometimes when you‚Äôre at a location when the event starts but you haven‚Äôt actually joined.  If you tried to fast travel to it, you‚Äôd probably wind up inside AMS mining or some other random interior.
---
I wonder how long they‚Äôll be able to sustain seasons? Are they like a thing we‚Äôre gonna get forever. Also yes moar meat week things would be good.
---
Yea I will get right on that lol. It happens so little on console  recording would be next to impossible unless more people started doing it.
---
I think you and I have different perspective. They know if you are doing some something not legit. They know what you are doing. It's just that they don't give a fuk
---
Most level 400 and higher have been around for a while and will help you out and if they are doing something they will stop and let you get shots in once they notice you. I always feel bad because Low-Level Players run away when I come up like I am going to kill them and take everything. I guess what I am saying is just have fun and if you run into an asshole make sure you have passivist on, and Block them they can't take everything, just blow it off and server hop if you have too. Most of us will welcome you as long as you are not an asshole? lol
---
The limited time window is really dumb, especially if it's going to be this short.
---
Probably not, free circuits though. Plus I'd like to see a personal protectron army at my camp haha
---
I can fit however many. We just do fists fights right now. Naked, fists only, and no heals for a fair fight. Winners get around 10k. Losers get a little something too.
---
we have found if you spend a certain amount a month like buy fallout first monthly and the lowest atoms package they give you a pass for shady stuff,
---
and ive got screen shots of the support tool and its not as good as you think
---
I'm running like hell humming the Indiana Jones theme song!
---
EDIT: And as to the why, because that little trench run out of there is the coolest bit of cinema in the game.
---
Omg why would rmters take something from other's accounts when they can just spawn and dupe items
---
fireproof
---
I‚Äôve got a Vamp +250 dmg resistance while reloading +10dmg while aiming Fixer on xbox
---
[deleted]
---
Damn, you beat me
---
I would imagine there will be some enclave themed season at some point. I mean datamines from a year or so ago shown what looks like X0-2 power armor and that has never been added into the atomic shop so at some point the enclave must play a bigger role and with the brotherhood returning it makes sense to include them.
---
Yes.
---
Tent and unlimited stash. Plus the atoms you get every month almost cover the cost of the sub.
---
Fireproof is the only one however a dense chest piece mod will also reduce explosive damage.
---
They can call it ‚Äúthriller‚Äù
---
Unlimited junk stash I should say.
---
upvote.
---
Rmters cant spawn stuff without a very spacific thing that there is a $1000 bounty on, the current dupe got patched but a new one is on the way with 22
---
They might release that next year
---
But neither of you can read :-)
---
Thanks but I'm on PlayStation.
---
Well considering we both I wanted to comment before actually reading it, I‚Äôm gonna comment something else. I can‚Äôt remember off the top of my head if there are any perks that add energy resistant
---
Dense chest
---
The revolver comes out as a 1 Star legendary - at least it did for me. Berserkers fancy single action revolver.
---
Yeah I totally agree. I spent 2k a month on atoms and Todd sent me his autograph and said he would add an NPC named after me come patch
---
No shit, after I posted this last comment, I read that he had fireproof maxed
---
Orrr... more weapons
---
Ima be real if we had to purchase those kinda mods with GB I wouldn‚Äôt be mad, better than an item like the cattle prop
---
Ok, just sitting on a mule, I was going to offer it to you for 50 caps considering the horrendous roll. lol GL man
---
Sorry, I'm on PC.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs kind of why I disliked wastelanders and the addition of npc‚Äôs. This was going to happen.
---
Honestly, a separate event with this idea, but it happens inside Fort Defiance. A Spencer Mansion (Resident Evil) kinda feel to it.
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt know if I will understand it, I‚Äôm kinda just playing the game for what it is if you get me, I‚Äôm using sturdy armour, need to learn what‚Äôs the best armour to get and don‚Äôt really know how the gold works yet as I‚Äôve not tried to buy anything
---
I noticed the rolls lol. Thanks.
---
If a dupe goes public, that means RMTers have moved on to a new method and just leaked it on purpose. You think dupes aint happening right now just because Bethesda patched the last one?
---
It‚Äôs not great, in my opinion.  Definitely not worthy of being a legendary perk.  The damage is pretty weak and the radius is small.  I guess it might be comparable to a frag or baseball grenade, if that.  It barely dents a lvl 75 mutant.
---
If you‚Äôre fighting dozens of squishy enemies all packed together like sardines, I guess it could be ok.  Versus Daily Ops enemies and Earle‚Äôs wendigo spawns, it‚Äôs basically useless.
---
It also seems to negatively affect stealth, which put me off immediately.
---
Whether it‚Äôs boosted by demo expert and grenadier perks, I don‚Äôt know.  I thought Follow Through, fire resistance and extra stat points were much more worthwhile for my six slots.
---
Moderately really rare. Don‚Äôt scrap it.
---
Yeah they‚Äôre crap. Only reason I have it is because it‚Äôs vamps. I don‚Äôt think I fired one shot with it
---
Yes sir all day
---
I leveled it up to max on the pts, before the rebalancing it was utter trash, but it seems to now instantly kill even level 100 super mutants.  It does reduce your stealth, so if you‚Äôre a sneaky build it‚Äôs not very good.  It starts off at 10% for 1 perk coin and only goes up to 30% at max level, so if you get it it should probably be the last one you max out.
---
That would be cool but I could only imagine the public meltdown and the click bait videos and the absolute "outrage"
---
Or bundles for the other factions, children of atom, Enclave, Order of Mysteries, and pioneer scouts.
---
16 hour in a day and you got kids........damn as a father I know I couldn't get away with that.......lol
---
both are disappointing, but missile launcher is better IMO
---
If you play daily, or a lot, and have cash to spare, it‚Äôs worth it.  The tent and the stash box sold me on it.  Now that you can‚Äôt really earn daily atoms 1st has that.  I rarely use the private server but it‚Äôs nice to have. 
---
If you‚Äôre short on cash or only play occasionally I‚Äôd pass on it.  You can live without it.  It‚Äôs all convenience.
---
Sounds good but kinda doubt they'll do that..
---
It‚Äôs because of the new damage calculations
---
Single raising them full time on my own!
---
They both really suck. They break quick they dont really do the damage the stats screen displays.
---
If anyone has any redeeming qualities for them other then they are fun I'd be happy to hear it.
---
* Get rid of all your prewar food except bubble gum. East what you kill and make sure to dump your spoiled food. 
---
* get rid of all your drinks. Maybe keep a few purified water, but keep an eye open for a nuke zone, put on a hazmat suit and collect flux. Drink that and sell all your water. Flux weighs less. 
---
* Keep maybe 40 stimpaks in your stash, and a few disease cure and addictol. Sell all the rest of your chems in your stash
---
* got lots of duplicate plans? Dump em in a suitcase in a railway station. Same with missiles and mini nukes and plasma cores
---
* make sure all the junk in your stash is scrapped down. 
---
* Take every weapon and piece of armor in your stash and scrap it. If it‚Äôs legendary scrip it.u
---
When I first started playing I sold a quality vamps lever in my vendor for 500 caps lol. I didn't have a clue about trading and prices.
---
i knew the dupe 3 months before it went public its just i dont have the tools or want to do it as i like playing the game and would rather see it patched
---
[removed]
---
You can only have 1 down at a time.
---
As a skin its pretty lackluster.
---
Story time
---
(All in an xbox party together) 
---
When my friend left the vault for the first time I was already over level 100 as I'd convinced him to get the game. I had a friend join me on the rocks above the vault door with power armour and  an explosive mini gun and a .50cal while crouched so our names didn't appear. 
---
Having spent the last 15 mins telling him about pvp and how "randoms hunt down low levels for sport" obviously a lie but he didn't knkw that
---
He leaves the vault and starts to walk around saying how it looks better than he expected and we open fire spraying a full magazine each at him.  He starts running around in circles jumping and trying to get back into the vault freaking out the whole time shouting "I'm getting shot holy shit I'm getting shot" 
---
Me and my friend that were shooting him are just about dying of laughter at this point and he realises what's happening. Honestly the funniest thing I've done
---
Yeah so RMTers have absolutely no reason to hack other's accounts to pick up some random items cause they can just make one. Nice story btw
---
Congrats I got 3 to go myself.
---
Congrats.  I just have to get those last three that no one wants anyway.  So close.....
---
So the question, now what will you do?? LoL
---
Im not sure how true this is but I've heard fireproof doesn't actually help with your own explosive damage. Either way, dense chest and jumping with marsupial when you shoot tends to do the trick
---
Outrage doesn‚Äôt bother me one bit. I enjoy the things I enjoy and do my best to not listen to little melt downs people have.
---
And always use serendipity and dodgy with bloody
---
the fact if if a bethesda employee asked me how everythings done i could tell them and they would tell you its true
---
I murder them both
---
Yes, the new damage calcs make the card values nonsense, but Bethesda don't have the sense to realise that.
---
They need to rethink the card description/perk values.... :-)
---
I replaced Santatron with BoS for an hour or so, listened to his hardline drivel, and put Santatron back in place.  Worst collectron so far.  If the bot is any indicator for the BoS folks coming to town, I‚Äôm not going to be making any new friends.
---
Are we getting atom challenges next week?
---
The 5% ranks of weapon damage cards and bloodied mess went down a peg, now only worth using if you have all the other better stuff and have slots open. They used to be important because they were pre-multiplier but now they only do exactly what they say they do (5% added to weapon base damage), so a few other cards now out-power them. Usually not cards in the same Special though, so you end up having to respec a bit unless you can pick up Specials via legendary perks to add the "now better" cards to your build.
---
As for what cards are better... well a lot of subjective opinion there but I can say for sure everyone should be adding max rank Tenderizer and Suppressor to their deck because they're now must have cards.
---
Yea, itll be here eventually. My main focus with the post is 2 make sure, they put the MODUS monitor, rather than the Protectron voice.
---
Definitely, you get the survival tent, unlimited scrap box, private server &amp; 1650 atoms  every month on the anniversary of your subscription.
---
Would be lost if i didn't have the scrap box you can even put your stable flux in there.
---
That‚Äôs awesome
---
A shooter where reload doesn't work? Sounds like Bethesda to me.
---
"It just "works"."
---
more of a "if they don't there's a huge feels bad for some pre-planned event" and nobody wants that, especially marketing. The next time an event would happen like this if "players need to do X things" comes around, players will remember this and realized they won't make the goal, so they won't even bother, thus dead events from the start. I don't think us losing this event would make anyone rally for the next one any harder.
---
But, who knows.
---
I'm kind of with the person above that mentioned they need to let it fail for a "see, that's what happens..." effect.
---
How would you know? It's not like they have the ability to change much themselves. They can acknowledge our complaints but to actually fix it is on the developers.
---
D: you madman
---
Oh shit. Damn I'm stupid. Yeah you're right.
---
Supplies over lives
---
Garbage vs trash. I prefer trash because making an ‚Äúsh‚Äù noise is fun.
---
I ain't believing a single word of that bullshit unless you bring an actual Bethesda employee with you and make him talk. Even with that, I would still have my doubts cause I don't think most Beth employees are sound with their mind
---
Oh yeah. That'd go down real well with the trashy blue leather jacket and bottles of Nuka Dark Rum...
---
Not really a good guy if you‚Äôre mass murdering peaceful fun-loving raiders, you monster.
---
Im doing numbers like this too, people act like we aren‚Äôt in a global pandemic- I practically moved to Appalachia
---
Do they have an appropriate animation for a coffin bed, or would our characters just lay down like a regular bed and just clip through the sides?
---
My current character is a full health build i think...
---
A bunch of +strength armor, but my outfit is : field scribe outfit + firebreather helm + prisoners collar.
---
Barbarian and slugger out the wazoo for perks.
---
I do pretty good damage with my hammer but my big schtick is tanking. I hit a boss like 3 times with my furious/SS supersledge and i have aggro. From there its just about not dying lol. I like to think pulling aggro gives the bloodied min-maxers a chance to actually get a few hits in.
---
Yeah that‚Äôd be awesome. We are probably going to get a ‚Äúfortifying whitespring‚Äù event which will reward it next year. I think this may also lead to the new pvp stuff we get next year with wars between BOS and Enclave
---
Peaceful? Fun loving? Have you ever actually met a raider?
---
I'm still at that stubborn, refusing-to-make-the-same-conversion stage. I have more than enough spare perk points, it really is just waiting till I get bored of the stealth vats one shot kills, even though I die as soon as I'm discovered.
---
Ok question as a new Gatling laser user...I have the perk card so i get 1000 round...are you saying that at the nonperked card users you are getting more then 250 rounds per core. I was understanding it as 1 core is good for 250 rounds with no perks?
---
I'm looking forward to my week long break from 76. Gonna be nice.
---
Part of the problem is some of the damage bonuses are based on the weapons base damage before the receiver is added.
---
People have already looked into it. The info you likely are after is in the official Bethesda forums.
---
It doesn't help that they launched both the damage nerf and One Wasteland together on the PTS so it can be hard to tease out which change exactly is affecting a given situation.
---
My character wears the atom shop vampire costume and lives in a gothic Victorian styled home in the cultist graveyard so... yes.
---
beth support arnt actually beth employees there a support centre contracted out to work for Bethesda aswell and other game companys
---
That was a glorius time.
---
Update 21 changed that. An attack on a team member is no longer an attack on the team and vise versa. Each person has to initiate PvP individually.
---
I wish. I'd love to have Modus wondering around camp and commenting about how he's pleased that we've set up "Little outposts to safe guard Appalachia".
---
Haha! Same though I‚Äôll log in for a bit to spend scrip
---
Crunch berries. Damn!
---
Have you actually met a settler?  They‚Äôre the worst.
---
DPS is king. Until Bethesda does something to balance that out (the upcoming damage nerfs won't change a thing in this regard), auto firing weapons is the only way to go for end game content. 
---
For ranged weapons. Different story with melee.

I did it about a month ago, I really miss the efficiency from controlling each shot, but the speed it puts out the damage is to nice to pass up. (Transferred from semi auto handmade)
---
I‚Äôd like them to have the atom dailies in between. That still only allows 350 atoms to be earned over the week. It would just be a good gesture
---
Don't mention Bethesda employee then. It's a contract worker that know of nothing
---
Are we getting them back?
---
I adjusted to limited scrap pretty easily in the beginning, but the scrapbox just allows you to grab extra junk and dump everything without another layer of micromanagement.  If you do a lot of endgame, stable flux gets extremely heavy, so the box is basically a must.  When I got a gauss minigun, it was nice to have 200+ crimson flux already on hand.
---
I use my tent mostly as a free fast travel point to whatever is important at the time and leave it there.  Rusty Pick, the observatory, outside of Crater when I was grinding rep, whatever.  You can move it at will, but I typically don‚Äôt.
---
The private world is absolutely fantastic for farming anything or enjoying a quiet wasteland.  No competing over legendary kills, solo SBQ that lands regularly, sucker-free Uranium Fever, grab all the loot everywhere, Westek is never cleared out, etc.  I play privately about 80% of the time.
---
I wish the scrapbox was free for everyone.  That‚Äôs the only thing that feels like an unfair advantage.  I‚Äôve never worried about supplies for crafting ammo since subscribing.
---
I don't blame you. Some players can be complete dicks. Hell, I'm a level 215 &amp; seeing other players 100+ near me or my camp, I start to get paranoid. I always try to ignore PvP &amp; I try to be friendly around them, use emotes &amp; stuff. Fortunately, I've ran into friendly players. Maybe try saying hi to them, they might be nice! Anyways, happy travels, Vault Dweller.
---
I spent the first 50 levels avoiding other players. I still play solo 95% of the time but I will occasionally team up or help a new player level up if they ask. On my first character I don't think I did any community events until I was level 100 or so because I still had no idea what I was doing and my build sucked. Now I'll bring my lvl 15 junkie commando to queen fights and I'm sure it going to puss some people off when he pays earl a visit
---
Depends on how much that money means to you and whether you're ok with giving your money to a company that clearly doesn't care about producing quality work.
---
No one call tell you whether it's worth it for you or not. Just something you need to figure out.
---
However, for what it's worth, on average, the scrapbox frees up between 400-600 stash.
---
Old school players respect the community. We try to make things better because we remember what it was like when we started out. If you run into a player that is an asshole and is over level 300 they are most likely one of the New Toxic Game Pass Players that used all the Double XP Weekends to level up really fast so they can dominate low levels. Because it makes them feel important.
---
They have heard them.  They said we will let them know we hate it too.  Then nothing happened.  I'm sure they are tired of being tagged on the same stupid bugs.  Obviously the first thousand times bethesda was unable or unwilling to fix it.
---
Maybe you‚Äôve been busy, but I find it extremely fitting that you haven‚Äôt replied to anyone‚Äôs comments. Makes your story and personality much more believable. 
---
But for my two cents, don‚Äôt be afraid to ‚Äúmake events harder‚Äù. At level 300+, I welcome an increase in difficulty. You can join my events anytime
---
You...you seriously think Bethesda will let it fail???üåùüòÇ
---
So much this mate. A lot better that the BOS insult bot 2.0
---
Theme wise yeah, i kill off the wondering raiders. But the raiders have the best shit though for the amount of effort you have to put in. And a far more fun and engaging story when you side with them. Ots obvious what side the dev team leans twords, look at all the raider packs and stuff before waste landers. They put way more effort into make the crater and the crew there than they did with the settlers. I felt something for those characters. They had a story, the settlers had like one interesting thing, The Motherlode and we end up breaking her that sucked.
---
Here were some of my suggestions from last year - Witches cauldron for cooking or chem making, Pumpkin lights like the cage lights in the pts, tombstones with or without a dirt mound, coffins and some cheesy animatronics.
---
Oh how much I want this, I got the helmet from ACP and it was the only I used since I got it, at some point it disappeared from my inventory a few days ago and I don‚Äôt know if I sold it, scrapped it, or it just glitches out but if it were the first two it was by complete accident and me not paying attention.
---
Responder corpses. ~licks lips~
---
It sure would bother Bethesda tho
---
Have we heard one way or the other on that?
---
Dude, you don't need to avoid any events except maybe A Colossal Problem (when someone nukes Monangah Mine). There's room for everyone in every other event. It's cool if you don't drop the SBQ on your own, most high levels can't either (and shouldn't, if they can). It's cool, we were all low levels at one point or another. You'll probably run into a dick player eventually, but as long as you aren't stealing from C.A.M.P.s, workshops, or running around without Pacifist mode on, you're fine.
---
Believe me, I've been the guy chasing someone down to give them Stims and Rad-Away more than once. Let me love you!
---
I play the true neutral, I'll help both, then I'll kill both. I probably won't do that with the Brotherhood but for now, free shit and rep
---
We call that "a buffet".
---
I agree that vc only sucks, especially as a person who is often nonverbal
---
Do you have more than one ally and have one of the allys objects down instead? Raider Punk has a table with a ham radio, Beckett ahs a bar, Wanderer has the guitar and chair, Granpa has a rocking chair, Astronaut chick has the console etc. Make sure you dont have one of those placed because that will stop you putting down another
---
It‚Äôs be amazing to actually be able to afford the bullets to use the light machine gun.
---
Had a level 11 in a power armor chassis today try smacking me with a sickle since I was dressed like a Raider and was walking along the road. Pulled out my recently acquire Fatmen launcher and he booked it.
---
I mean they probably won‚Äôt ever fix this.  You still can‚Äôt get exploration credit for Abandon Bog Town and Beckly for the challenges. Just atom points sit to ng on the table.
---
They teased that they'd be doing more with it in the future
---
I wish there was a way to scrap weapons into the scrapbox.
---
Nope. Hopefully they return though
---
Yes, outside of vats is where I noticed it.  I was unloading full-auto at Earle and it reloaded with 8 or 12 rounds still showing in the magazine.
---
Nocturnal rolling pins you mean.
---
I‚Äôve got close to 1800hrs and never bothered to find out where this plan is.
---
Thanks! I didn‚Äôt realize you could make such low leveled ones.
---
Someone probably opened a Lunchbox near you, it adds silly effects like that too. You can check it in your pip boy character status
---
We aren‚Äôt peasants, these PC pricks are Brother! Master Race my ass, we don‚Äôt deal with hackers left right and centre!
---
They mentioned something about having ‚Äúselect‚Äù items available after but to me that sounds like not everything. Not positive
---
It happens when you use one of the Legendary Run lunchboxes.
---
It‚Äôs one of the many random special effects you can possibly get when activating a lunchbox
---
Dayum.
---
Awesome
---
If you check the controls at the bottom of the legendary run page there should be an option to buy another rank, 150 atoms per rank iirc
---
Nice to know I mean the missile laucher with the quad barrel is great for croud control but for other than that idk
---
You can always buy the tiers you don‚Äôt finish as long as you do it before the run ends tomorrow
---
When is this going to be fixed? I ran into this issue on my new character.
---
Yeah, I really wanted the chicken coop but I fell a bit short because I started grinding late. I bought the last like 5 levels to get it.
---
Lmao, I've never even used those, it must have been another player indeed, it is kinda funny tho
---
I‚Äôm probably going to get it for a month just for the atoms, outfit, and emote
---
Sure is, under END you can find Refractor which grants 10 ER for each rank up to 40 ER.
---
Magic weapons are usually trash tier legendaries like Stalkers, which shows that the base power of the weapon isn't important to the amount it does during the bugged magic damage. A massive damage nerf won't make magic weapons weaker by any noticeable amount, except for magic shotguns that now seem to need two shots instead of one.
---
Right now even though it's possible to stack buffs to make bloodied melee able to do this, it's incredibly rare because of the difficulty involved in preparing and using all the needed buffs at once and keep yourself alive and stealthed.
---
Bloodied ranged builds straight up can't do that kind of rapid takedown of earle or even the queen. They can't stack buffs to hit nearly as hard as melee can, which is required to pass through the 400DR earle has. A full team of bloodied commando players could defeat earle in a few minutes but not seconds. After the PTS changes it will be more like 10 minutes minimum for even the best bloodied teams.
---
If you're willing to let that go for caps, I'm willing.  Level 126 and I'm still using a non-legendary Fixer.
---
I thought the game would be just as bad as Red Dead and boy was I wrong. I wont touch Red Dead with a 1,000 ft pole. Everyone has been super helpful in fo76 in my experience.
---
It does bc I tested my explosive Minigun aimed at my feet with and without the perk and it made a huge difference. This only works for ballistic damage so any explosive lasers or gauss will kill you.
---
Xbox?
---
Legendary rippers are legacy
---
If they‚Äôre exploding into confetti it‚Äôs a lunchbox effect likely from another player you were at an even with not long before
---
I am!
---
I kill all killable NPCs bar none.
---
Ohh so that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt see em. Do u know why they aren‚Äôt around anymore?
---
Do it for one month, claim all of the unique cosmetics and the atoms, then spend that month getting as much scrap as you physically can. If you end your subscription you will still keep the cosmetics and can take anything you put in the scrap box out, just can't put more in
---
i would love this type of content IMO
---
Perception
---
If you'll be doing more glitched weapons, do you have any of the old oddities? Stuff like assaultron heads that don't irradiate, etc? Or are you only looking for things that are functionally unique
---
I honestly don't know why they took them out but i still need to get one
---
Just check out the arm mods, you‚Äôll see what‚Äôs up
---
Well glad to know it actually does work. I never really have a problem with my own explosive damage with serendipity and jumping so i dont really know
---
GnarKole is my GT, Shoot me a message so I can join you. I got to figure out which mule it‚Äôs on
---
I hope we can design the group's symbol. Planning on making Appalachia's version of the Gunners on the Xbox. Each member will receive a copy of the Treasure Hunter's Uniform, a green or American flag bandana, and Wrap-Around goggles.
---
I'm hoping before we'd see such a system that we get the Ranger Tower prefab found in the files for the atom shop, along with the instanced interiors. My hope is we can expand interiors while inside them. Want to make what looks like an Ammo Depot entrance similar to one of those bunkers. Have a little tunnel system with the workshop, barracks, shop, cafeteria, and recreational hall. Also the latrines of course.
---
Ye same lol
---
I hated the movie right at that moment cause..... Reasons
---
I mean you could buy my 3* Assassin's Wood Left Leg, but I don't think you'd actually *want* it.
---
Just get over it.
---
So long as they put out more Nuka Cola stuff, I'm game!
---
There's a helmet now?  I didn't think there was one?
---
I was like you, before the PTS.
---
I didn't look back, honestly.  Because there is a certain charm in *drilling* into enemies with a sustained barrage of damage, and hearing the critical shots going off left and right.
---
You might think you are saving ammo.  That's what I thought too.  But even before PTS made one-shots less practical, how often were enemies *really* one shot?  We'd be foiled by the server failing to register damage.  Or VATS doing something weird.  You put all of your eggs in one basket, only for it to be rejected for some arbitrary reason.  Not so with Commando.
---
Collect all the plans. Finish up tadpole and possum badges.
---
What system are you on?
---
True, I might need to swap it out for Lifegiver on my tank
---
Nothing feels much different. I never ran a bloodied min-maxing build so most of my gear feels unchanged. However, you have more of an incentive to use some QoL or utility perks since you don't have those stacking bonuses anymore. You still have a notable increase in damage for each individual perk. That change is just static now, as opposed to being multiplicative with all your other buffs
---
To be honest, that ammo was what I expected from the Brotherhood Collectron, since the raider one already gives ballistic ammo.
---
Yes, PER my mistake
---
not a 100% spawn location.
---
Increasing fire rate on hunting rifle breaks in 3rd person pov
---
I know me too! Feels very fitting and something that‚Äôs missing
---
Wouldn't it just talk like MODUS but in a Protectron voice like the Assaultrons and Gutsys from the Bots on Parade events?
---
Hate to break it to you but I‚Äôm pretty sure things like that and the ammo converter will be available for bullion in the next update
---
I jumped on my alt and went to my cards... i‚Äôm gonna have to put a couple points in that
---
We completed it hours ago
---
Don't mind the 280 with a gatling gun. He is just making sure nothing bad happens to the newbies
---
My handmade does this same shit and it‚Äôs gotten me killed multiple times. I literally have never gotten through a full mag without it reloading on its own
---
oh nice a todo list. maybe i'll finally get my life in order.
---
I believe the CAMP items which have a function like the ammo converter and the chicken coup will be available for bullion in the next patch for those who didn‚Äôt get them
---
I‚Äôm assuming all the cosmetics will eventually rotate into the atomic shop sooner or later too for the people who have the money and not the time
---
Exactly, like yes mr. level 30 if you would like to peruse my collection of level 45-50 2* legendaries that are both too weak to actually have any use in endgame activities and just don‚Äôt make sense sometimes, you may, but you wont want any and theyre probably going to cost you more than youd like.
---
Omg, made this switch last week. I'll never look back, it's awesome.
---
Well atleast the Settlers aren't murderous, thieving, psychopaths. Plus the raider stuff looks dirty and gross, which is also a downside. Like no Meg, I will not wear that trashcan with barbed wire welded to it, how could you possibly think that's a practical outfit??
---
I've got both the B/FFR 50 cal and same minigun equipped on my main. I mostly use the 50 cal though. It's fast to respond and uses way less ammo depending on the target. Love the minigun but I just can't seem to enjoy it as much because of the slow spin up.
---
Been having a lot of problems with my Gatling plasma constantly reloading cores.
---
I've seen it waste cores that were half full and instantly empty and reloading.  I've seen freshly loaded partially full cores instantly get swapped out a second time immediately after it was just loaded into the weapon.
---
It's really annoying.  I went from making 90 cores last weeks to 50 cores used in a week with half of them getting wasted due to game bugs.
---
HOLY FUCK! I‚Äôm going to lose 70% of my damage! This is total fucking bullshit!
---
Easily the first card I will choose!  So excited for this update!
---
the worst part is that they already did they just wont give him to us.
---
If Bethesda cared enough to either fix the bug or provide reperations to us suffering the bug? Then perhaps we wouldn't be complaining so loudly!
---
The only weapon that should be allowed if this becomes an event is the Chainsaw. That is all.
---
Plus the people cages are off putting
---
 When that happens with duplicate anything in my inventory i just log out and back in which fixes it.
---
I hope this doesn't cement your feelings, but I play a high level character with decent equipment, and feel similarly to you, but about low level characters. I'm wary of melting enemies or autopiloting an event, and depriving them of basically any interaction or enjoyment. I feel like it wouldn't be fun for them if a high level just rolled up, then rolled everything over without at least giving them a chance to land some hits. I've never thought negatively about a low level character's presence or found them troublesome in any way, I just don't want to "ruin" the game for them lol.  
---
If someone is trying to help you and you don't mind receiving it, I think you can rest assured that it isn't bothering them and they just enjoy it.
---
Xb1
---
Partially mad i waited so long, partially mad there‚Äôs such a difference.
---
That‚Äôs fine, I tried NW but ended up finding someone to help. Even let me keep the caps!
---
Honestly with what I noticed and how most builds are defenses don‚Äôt matter with PvP unless it‚Äôs radiation damage. If someone catches sight of you you‚Äôre dead regardless so do what you like. Most things seem to come down to perks and chems and mutations for advantages.
---
I know the chicken coop will be. I figured I'd rather just spend a few atoms and save the bullion for something better down the road.
---
Be safe out there man
---
Depending on if you run pa or just use it in sbq or acp event
---
You are a legend!
---
Ppl will even tell you to go for the excavator power armor...
---
I played with the X-01 and the "Emergency Protocol" mod for a really really long period of time. The reality is as long as you have this mod on your power armor...you are really hard to kill if you pay attention to your health.
---
So I can only have one a ally object at a time
---
Definitely alcohol/mentats, and any addiction that doesnt de-buff strength. I do Formula P, Daddy-O, &amp; Daydripper on top for a Junkies Heavy build
---
What I really wanna know is why so many players with bloodied builds are such dicks. Riddle me that.
---
LOL, now will just tell my boss that. Haha
---
I made a vendor, and filled it with 5.56 and all my useless mods
---
I tried a commando build for a while.  It was a lot of fun... until I ran out of ammo and had to spend half an hour per session scrounging for steel or vendor hopping for a few handfuls of .45 and 5.56. With rifleman, my  ammo machine is enough by itself.  Too bad, really. Automatic weapons really are more satisfying.
---
Fair enough 
---
Chances are there‚Äôs gonna be a shit tonne more when the full brotherhood dlc is out so at least you‚Äôll be prepared
---
It depends on your build and your priorities as to which additions you go with. No one can tell you what to go with. Just look at the addictions debuff list and go off that.
---
In terms of perks though, tenderiser isn't bad if you have space capacity. blocker is a crucial one. I'd say a must-pick. Glow sights isn't bad as the default perception ones. Bear arms if you care about weapon weight. Batteries maybe to counter FC weight.
---
Here's the trick to the horse events where you have to search, it will only be at the place that enemy type spawns. Some examples:
---
Super mutant horde event in the savage divide? Always at West Tek or Nation Satellite Array.
---
Ghoul Horde in Toxic Valley? Always at the prison.
---
Ha!  I was discussing this with another guy on a different thread yesterday.  I notice it a lot with Blood Eagles.  You hear the pulse and red stream of a gatling laser only to find a hunting rifle and .308 ammo on the corpse.  Huh?
---
the way i decide if im going to pay for the month is if there is a bundle im interested in buying from the atomic shop.  since you get 1500 atoms with it and it's the same amount you'd pay for that many atoms anyway i just pay for the month and use those atoms.  the other stuff like unlimited scrap box and the survival tent are bonuses definitely worth it imo.  plus private servers.  spend a day in a private server claiming a bunch of workshops at different times so the defense missions dont overlap and all those resources to farm without other players getting mad about you hogging workshops or trying to take them.  then you can put all the stuff you farmed into the unlimited scrap box.  it's literally afk farming!  I try to do that at least once a week because nothing is worse than building some big elaborate camp only to run out of mats halfway through
---
They're pretty close. It's more a matter of which one you have the good mods for, whether or not you're in rad zones a lot and if maintenance costs matter to you or not.
---
All other things being equal, Ultracite for general combat, X-01 for nuke zones.
---
I mean it‚Äôs probably already been said but junkie/bloody are quite strong
---
Working on my T65 now. Just need one more arm.
---
Yup. Can't have one out or stored, actually need to scrap one to make another.
---
Uh?
---
For full health, that seems pretty reasonable.  The only thing you can really do is pick up Adrenal Reaction and drop a little health for extra damage.
---
T-65 is the best PA but AngryyTurtle thoroughly tested all the sets and the damage differences were within 10%...it comes down to personal preference. I rock excavator for the extra carry weight and ore mining.
---
Fallout first yo. It just works.
---
I‚Äôm level 170 something. I‚Äôm the helpful sort. I don‚Äôt take it too seriously and like to help out anyone. I also have anxiety and am a big introvert. It‚Äôs hard I feel ya
---
Happened to me
---
I want those cardboard halloween decorations from fo4.
---
LOL! Nah. 
---
No way Bethesda is going to give you the means to skip good chunks of the following seasons. 
---
Also as it is you get 150 per 10 ranks or so so no way are they going to 10x your atom returns per rank.
---
When fixing the ammo converter one of the devs specifically stated to make sure you grab it so you dont miss out. This makes me think it will NOT auto collect anything for you
---
I run xo1 in the sbq and acp events and ultracite any other time. But then again I dont normal run pa
---
I totally kill raiders every time I find them and I look forward to doing the same to the new Raiders that are on their way to Appalachia
---
Fix the damn game üòµ
---
Totally agree
---
This would let me play the game a lot more, as it stands I can‚Äôt play the game by myself or the way Bethesda intended, only way I can play the game is through crews or Roleplay, I‚Äôm just bored and done with the constant grind of hours for barely anything. I would love this kinda update
---
I haven't stayed to loot and been trapped yet. Do you still get the rewards for completing the event if you stay?
---
So that's why I found that suitcase full of missiles and purified water at the train station in white springs ....
---
They meant, are you full time PA only for the two boss events. I don‚Äôt know where it was going, but that was the question.
---
Nah, need my boom stick as well.
---
thank you I was so confused I know I can finish all my Ally quests now thank you
---
so much
---
I think they didnt give me my atom for last month...
---
Yup. General dumping ground for unwanted plans, ammo. Sometimes other goodies. Hell, during events that drop a ton of legendaries people drop them there too.
---
I run pa all the time
---
I want the cardboard halloween decorations you see in the Sanctuary houses from fo4.
---
the atom store update every week will let you know what's available for a limited time and on what day that week.
---
I have a stealth build. When I‚Äôm on my own I do fine. Then someone comes in guns blazing. And kill everything before I get a chance.
---
Ah well I hope you find the information you are looking for
---
I‚Äôll give my two cents though, I switched to X-01 simply because I could get calibrated shocks for it. X-01 isn‚Äôt that far off in DR where I think I‚Äôm suffering.
---
Same PS4
---
I can't think of too much that isn't particularly obvious. Any perks that increase production yield, super duper and green thumb, empath mutation, all revive perks, quack surgeon, dry nurse, anti-epidemic, injector, E.M.T, team medic. Also reccomend friendly fire, tenderizer, and/or philanthropist, since getting all of those is hard without being made if glass as a result. I don't think I need to say it but avoid healing hands or rad sponge, since bloodied builds are gonna be your biggest patient. Try to share a perk like tank killer, very helpful, or another perk that negates armor. Since power armor doesn't seem to be a part of your build ironclad will be helpful, and lifegiver, any perks or mutations that make you use less medical items means you have more to spare at any given time, sun kissed to remove rads, healing factor or photosynthetic for hp. Serendipity is always good no matter the build. That's most of what you need to be the ultimate team player, plus any charisma perk you want that gives you a buff.
---
All the time! Welcome to Glitchthesda
---
Me too im about to hit 800 hours too and just recently got 1st this month im filling up my scrap box to hold me over for the next forever . Unless there's something crazy next month I won't re subscribe. I never really needed to hold much scrap anyway unarmed build and I very rarely change my camp so it wasn't much for me not to have 1st.
---
The fact that we need to beg for such basic social features though is so crappy, factions just seem like a natural way to go. Even if it's just a clan list, chat and activating PVP.
---
Hi there, really sorry you're having this issue! The same thing happened to a good friend of mine, and after a couple of support tickets he couldn't get Bethesda to reset the quest.
---
In the end, he ended up having to join a private server (as if you're the first to do the quest on a server, it works for some reason) and that fixed the quest.
---
Good luck - hope it's fixed soon!
---
I would like to plant literally everything as a herbivore, but also because I love having my own garden in-game!
---
Poor snowflake. The emblems on clothes is a fantastic idea.
---
Same, but have ultra in backpack it Only costs 10 cw  and if an event pops up quick change and off Your go.
---
I strongly dislike the settler faction so, I kill every settler I come across. I even gave the Raiders a share of the gold from Vault 79 and spent the settlers share.
---
It seems to take into account player locations, but could easily be misplaced from sheer luck. Seems 9/10 times, I‚Äôve managed to get the legendary to spawn in the upper tunnel at Bravo by staying just outside the lower portion of the room, no line of sight to spawn location.
---
Traitor!
---
&gt; **Missile laucher vs Fatman** 
---
No
---
I just did the same but haven‚Äôt modded yet so still waiting to use it!
---
Cool story.
---
I don‚Äôt have the one the bees are supposed to give you. Just missing that one
---
I don't play with headphones on.
---
And, because Fo76 has shit coding on their sound system, if you attempt to change the sound output it will just output nothing until you restart the program with the new settings.
---
Since I can't choose a server and wont be back in the same one, the only people I can talk to reliably are on my friends list.
---
Ah, thank you! Since the quest is already technically completed for me, I don't think I'll be able to do that in this case, but its excellent to know that later on if I run into any other bugs!
---
In the mean time rename them to something like ZzBEHM for something like a Bloodied Explosive Handmade. That way it's always at the bottom and easy to discern it from scrip stuff.
---
I like the atom shop and support it but fuck this made me actually laugh üòÇ
---
Got the shielded underarmor? It gives a lot of extra special points.
---
Or: save it for lunchboxes after Sept 15
---
Spooky
---
I can confirm that the private server will help. The same thing happened to me on PS4. I haven't been able to complete the quest (I'm nearing level 100) so I requested a service ticket as well then replied to the service ticket email requesting a reset. 
---
I saw tips here that said to try a private server. Yesterday I tried this and the quest completed.
---
I was in the same predicament and got the spinning fertilizer thing. I‚Äôve never used it, but I like to watch it spin.
---
As I've been warning people this whole time but no they all called me crazy.
---
True, there is still a mountain size amount of bugs and glitches in this game. I am not going to hold my breath until they get all of them done because I know from being a programmer a while back it is the old programmers logic, (Sung to 99 bottles of beer) 99 errors in the code, 99 errors in. Take one down and fix it around, Now you have 125 errors in the code. 
---
We can armchair quarterback the developers with what they should do, however I will say that I wouldn't mind waiting on the next content after Fractured Steel until they get a majority of the bugs fixed. They will do what they want and it is up to use to either hold out hope or give up and move on letting the game fail further into the depths.
---
We go over this so much the advice should just be a pinned post or a popup dialog window when you start the game.
---
Always remove all junk before going shopping.
---
Always enter &amp; shop in sneak mode. They can still see you but it's less obvious.
---
If you're suspicious of camps that have multiple storeys or have overhanging a cliff, always enter in PA.
---
Avoid purchasing junk items from any vendor machines that aren't placed directly on solid ground or where you can't stand on solid ground.
---
If you want to be a little 4D with your thinking, if there are other objects other than the floor to stand on when shopping do so. Standing on vending machines if you can can be particularly good as it can be real annoying to have to refill the vending machine each time they try to trap you by removing them.
---
Once you have enough experience with them, trap camps aren't hard to spot or navigate.
---
hmmm... i can see that my bloodied SMG is doing better than the bloodied ultracite, well youre right i can make it work, thanks!
---
yeah you can make it as a rifle, i just had someone make the stock for me.
---
tru
---
It is amazing how one quest can break in so many different ways... I'll keep my fingers crossed for you!
---
Once you hit 50 or so, the levels will come fast and often. I hope you're not going to be ascared of yourself when that happens. It's like being an adult - when you get there, you realize nobody else knows much more than you did when you weren't an adult yet yourself.
---
Change servers when you get the first disease as there's some sort of disease cool down on a server when you obtain one
---
Idk. I wish it had the actual MODUS voice.
---
Skryim had coffin animation's i believe
---
I wanna see something golden, or references to other franchises as tattoos. Hell, maybe have a Marie Antoinette hairstyle where there's a god dang boat in the player character's hair!
---
yeah i agree kinda meh... LOL but i kinda invested in my bloodied ultracite laser... dunno if i made the right move lol
---
That's basically what mischief night is plus you get to kill all the robots with no repercussions
---
U and me both 2 be honest.
---
Shielded Underarmor!? Now how did I miss THAT?
---
October 19th and same lol
---
Your limited to 50 named items - so you cant name scrip and sell items very easily
---
Appreciate the tips!
---
Just wanna be able to plant cranberries and snaptails man :[ , hell even sootflower would be nice
---
Hmm maybe its worth a shot popping over to a private server just to see what happens. My quest has been complete for a long time, but for some reason the ghoul blood collection option lingers and its causing me a lot of weirdness with other quests where I'm asked to use that key for other actions.
---
Just take some off of the top. Spend like 100 or so just to push it off a bit. Worse thing is to miss a day (if that matters to you).
---
Upvoted because I want to believe there is a workaround when I know there probably isn't one and I'm stuck with switching to my Bloodied Gauss Mini that has almost no ammo.....
---
Yeah you know this is pretty dead on. I just give the little guys nonperishables, 10mm and a pat on the back for the most part.
---
I could be wrong, but I think you have to find them in the world, not buy them... 
---
that said, I have a fair number of extras both on my char adn in my vendor of you want to test.
---
aj-98 in game, aj ninetyeight PSN,  likely will not be on until tomorrow after 5-6p
---
I only use 45 in a lever action and I fully agree with this
---
I run a vsmpires one for my bloodied melee and it does great atm. I've been asking angry Turtle in his live streams to test it.
---
It‚Äôs amazing. 4 strength 4 endurance 2 perception
---
yeah i had someone to craft it for me, but youre right you have to scrap to get the mods of the weapons. its just that i dont have the plans to keep crafting one lol, kinda hassle XD
---
A set of Excavator and X-01 w/ Jetpack is a good start, easy enough to buy all of the mod recipes for those two where as you have to get Ultracite plans from SBQ or player vendors to finish your build.
---
Maybe the gauss shotgun? I hear it‚Äôs pretty amazing even if you aren‚Äôt specced for it?
---
I think you only need 3 pieces to get it to proc. That‚Äôs what captainoob uses. I have a Junkie build, but it‚Äôs way easier to use revenant on a B build.
---
And even without mics, both X-Box and PS4 support text chat through its firmware!
---
Would like to further that by saying I deeply want open and closed standing/leaning and sitting coffins as camp decorations. \^o  \^
---
Rifleman is fun in general gameplay but I always felt useless boring boss fights plinking away. I‚Äôll still swap back when I get bored.
---
If you have nothing you want (and you're really sure about this) just don't bother. The things you're getting won't give you any value and there's less compulsion for you to go out of your way to grind out more.
---
Worst comes to worse, get all the camp items. If you ever care for building up a camp, at least it gives you options for certain looks/utility.
---
Just unlock the guns, no mods. That allows them to drop from legendary enemies.
---
The only reason I‚Äôd ever get a modus is to take pot shots at him. Ad Victoriam!
---
Is your last used a Gatling Plasma? That‚Äôs the only time I see this bug.
---
Luckily the perk cards are 1:1 swappable for the most part so going back and forth is easy.
---
Anything that classy...I wish.
---
You have to find them in-game.
---
Came across one in white springs that was fun and had a puzzle to get through. I didnt die at the and actually somehow got through the spikeboards and the dude got pissed so they turned on some tesla thing that did nothing to my health so i messed with their traps setting em off so they had to reset. They ended up downing themselves in front of me after i escaped.
---
I laughed my ass off , felt kinda bad laughing so hard but karma and kinda serves em right. 
---
Pro tip, if u cant teleport but can move around and their base happens to be underground, find an edge and jump into what looks like oblivion and you pop back up top on the ground outside.
---
yeah i agree, plasma cartridges are kinda scarce in this game. the fact that i keep spending 1000 caps to keep on buying plasma cartridges on player vendors is a hassle. but yeah i would like a enclave collectron would be cool, even if it collects just 10-15 plasma cartridges im good with that... PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN BETHESDA! XD
---
This drives me batshit every time I forget for three seconds and slap something too close....its maddening!
---
You know that didn't even occur to me that bloody would be way better for this.
---
I've seen a good few of his vids but just the showcases didn't know he ran this kinda thing. Maybe ill change 3 pieces of my stealth commando and drop a few unyieldings . Decisions decisions. I'll deffo check out what he's running too thanks .
---
Fallout 2 already did that.
---
Escape on your first run for the experience, every time after that stay and loot the bodies, no bodies left, lay down and comfort the dying Earl, someone has to be there for him as he passes from this life to the next.
---
Yes, you can apply it to the Excavator PA. I‚Äôve purchased all of the atomic shop raider skins and they all apply to the Excavator. ü§ô
---
Nope, I‚Äôm trying to go between a fixer and a handmade
---
I saw a FO76 bed of nails on a yt video.
---
My friend picked a lock on a safe at one of the workshops.  It didn't show that it was claimed on either of our maps, so that would normally be fine.  But it instantly gave him a bounty.  As soon as I saw that happened, I broke off the team, turned off pacifist mode and did the kill myself so that he wouldn't be pestered by someone trying to take the bounty and I allowed him to reclaim his junk.  It was just odd because the workshop still didn't show claimed on either of our maps.
---
Man I've never seen more than 50 caps in that box, the rest is usually a tiny amount of Ore or stimpacks.
---
Same, and Line in the Sand.
---
It's cool when all the other people start popping them too.
---

T-65 Arm, T-65 Jetpack mod, and the T-65 Camo Paint in the Atom Store and make a Jetpack Arm before it gets patched out. That'll be 2000 bullion and 800 Atoms, and will allow you to use another torso mod at the cost of a super crappy arm mod.
---
Unless you're a heavy gunner then it'll be a drop in the ocean of what you used.
---
I've only had it happen when I'm logged on when they reset, which doesn't usually happen because that's at 10am for me
---
Once I'm off wurk I'll be throwing in my 10k.
---
Look at his last Queen kills. He kills himself w an explosive gun, gets the stim from the armor, then switches back to unyielding.
---
I want to see what happens when it‚Äôs the only two guns I have in my inventory but I have a stupid syringer that‚Äôs stuck as a mission item for some reason
---
I really prefer Rifleman but since Bethesda seems to want to force everyone into using the same crap I will be forced to switch to Commando after this update.  Using a scope with an automatic  is going to make me want to puke, have no clue what weapon I should be looking for that has less sway.  Fixer sure as hell isn't going to work.
---
Once his eyes close and he has passed.
---
[I've run 40+ times and none of those damn plans dropped for me... Had to buy them off other players]
---
This is Appalachia not london hahahah
---
The easiest way i know of storing a ton of scrap is probably the fallout first scrap box, but second up is just bulk the raw materials
---
Is Tenderizer really that great?  I've never used it personally because I never had the points to spare but I thought it was good because it was multiplicative?  If everything is additive now is 7% for three points that great compared to the others?
---
You do, you loose out on nothing but the cinematic escape sequence.
---
I‚Äôve only had that bug switching between my add guns (fixer or handmade) and a Gat Plasma I use on the Queen.
---
The well is neat if you are a builder
---
I wanna plant my own fungus caps and cranberries
---
I had thought you got nothing if the mine collapsed on you.  I'm definitely trying this next time
---
If you're weapons are primed this happens unless you carry a few rounds of regular ammo or a non ultracite plasma core or fusion core.
---
I also found a large amount of grenades and plans when lower level and at a station. This explains why.  
---
Also for ditching legendaries, heaviest first until you get to 40 scrip still available for the day. Then make a call about if you want to scrip multiple 1 and 2 star items for weight (Maybe missing potential scrip count) or another 3 star one.
---
I'll check that rn thanks.
---
It‚Äôs really funny for me too at that time. Sometimes if I refresh the challenge page they are new, sometimes they arnt, sometimes I watch as they reset one by one.
---
ü§®ü§®ü§®
---
Wait there‚Äôs no more legendary Rippers? Damn if there was I would have loved to find a Furious Ripper so much.
---
Text chat breaking immersion? Sure, because all the bugs are what really gets me into a game.
---
Ok so i know this isnt super related, but op i have a question, im returning after a long time off and idk how to get gold? I completed the main storyline but im still only stuck with 500 gold.
---
I feel like they‚Äôre immune to outrage by now.
---
Sounds like a random encounter. Been playing since beta and just found a pipe sticking out of the ground I've never seen in a place I've been many times. When I got near it prompted my to smell the fumes. When I did my vision got blurry and I was staggering for a while. Wouldn't let me sniff it again
---
I'd love those. I'm trying to have a spooky themed camp but I just don't have enough decorations for it. I also started playing later so I don't have all the earlier mothman stuff, or the pumpkins
---
You probably have a ton of scrap and chems that can be dumped on train station vendors though.
---
Ps i now carry random junk like tp or nothing if im camp hoping. If i want to buy a junk item like flux i always make sure i can move freely and safely or that there's a stash/scrap box close by thats safe to get to. Also buy one at a time. Most of those asshats can't wait so worst case u only loose 1 item.
---
I don't get pissed anymore the puzzles can be fun and usually they get annoyed when u don't have any good loot on you. Then screeny the name or save a vid and report em. You can always upload the vids to youtube or whatever your fancy.
---
Nope, this game doesn't need a clan feature. This would kill public groups, every clanape will just stick to heir clan and ignore random players. Giving boni and rewards for clan activities would add presure to lone wolfs like me, simple because we would otherwise miss some rewards. 
---
I hated the cland rewards in Destiny and the Guild Boni in WoW Cataclysm even more.
---
A Text Chat or message system like Dark Souls would be nice.
---
I hear you. If you invested in pistol perks just start to change them over to the rifle damage perks..other than that a solid bloodied rifle or junkie if you find it can be a game changer
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll actually be playing this weekend as all my toons are gonna be loaded down with 20 legendaries!
---
It's good to hear about some payback!
---
The alternative is to have someone there to revive you. One of our discord members just did the Queen in two hits by having someone revive him before the event. He hit the Queen for 91k w unarmed melee.
---
Ha I was running around opening the lunch boxes on people today
---
I hope they get better.i been buying these up when I find them..so far I have a junkies bloodied and a instigating one
---
yeah would be cool, like if you join up enclave, BoS NPCs will be hostile towards you and a pvp zone/event/mode for BoS vs. Enclave players. damn... i would really like to see that happen lol. would be rewarded with faction themed items too.
---
I think both factions should just put up outpost regardless of who wins and we could get new reputation rewards like with the raiders and settlers
---
Yeah furious limb strength
---
Ran into one the other day and frankly it broke the server hopping vending machines to wast some caps monotony a bit and it is meant to be the wasteland after and not all puppy dogs and rainbows. I lost a hundred caps worth of junk but it was worth it because the camp was a work of art and I appreciated how much effort they had put in.
---
That would be cool maybe hellfire armor prototype
---
Does anyone know what time for europe they remove season 1
---
Lmao.."we're in the endgame now"
---
Because this is how capitalism work
---
You keep everything, there's literally no penalty.
---
Well, at least your day is freed up to play other games perhaps more deserving of your attention.
---
I heared that he can also collect Radium Rifles, can anyone confirm this?
---
Wow I heard of that happening to alot of people sadly
---
Pipe is life.
---
Thunder Mountain blows up and that starts the horde. You have until the horde makes it to Beckely to wipe them out. The event could last a set amount of time (unless you lose), let's say an hour of real time. No camps, but you can claim workshops. Fast travel is allowed, but at double or triple the cost.
---
Horde mode.
---
LOOT.
---
And as an aside, it is horseshit that we can't eat Wendigos.
---
Well shit. I had no idea. The first time I did it I escaped with 1 second left. Like indiana Jones. Kind of a rush
---
My mate looks like Spock in that thing.
---
It depends what they say to me.  If they're cool...they live.  If they give me any guff or play the tough guy/gal card, they go down.
---
Some days it‚Äôs still pretty good, did a run last night and managed to find 3 3star and 1 2star in about 15 mins
---
This is only useful if you plan on using those weapons at some point, otherwise you're just diluting your legendary drop pool with items that cannot be sold or traded.
---
I've found a tri barrel minigun with furious is amazing with bosses, and the tri barrel makes ammo managing easier with more controllable bursts
---
I think trap camps have a place in fo76, but there's a fine line.
---
Deleting the floor out from under someone? Not very lore friendly. Popping a punji board of death stack? Bethesda already decided that's a no no by making it legacy.
---
But flamethrower and other traps that rely on pressure plates or buttons? Thats the game running as intended. Here's why.
---
There is actually a trap camp run by NPCs that is part of an unmarked quest in the game. 
---
This leads me to believe the allure of false hospitality is something Bethesda intended to place in their game. It's a tradeoff - should you consider the convenience of an unknown camp? Or travel somewhere you know is safe?
---
Their support people are incompetent.
---
I love the idea of a hardcore PVE to balance out the PVP-centric gamemode.
---
Happened to me with the hunting rifle.  If I switched to a different gun using the d-pad and back, it would not select the hunting rifle.  Sometimes server hopping fixed it, but it always came back eventually.  Not sure why that gun, but it was the only one I had trouble with.
---
Also the perk card that makes ground base traps not work, trip wires, mines, pungie boards are all nullified while crouched with this card. I think its called light footed.
---
Yes to this! The best group is the responders and the only good Raider is a dead raider! /s
---
U Can always buy some lunchboxes when 22 hits next week.
---
It's the "Someone to Talk To" daily vox syringer from the sounds of it.  Once you shoot the 3 animals and collect the vox data, you can return it to the crate.  It's a pain in the ass.  I avoid that daily now.
---
maybe other stuffs than that, u can already get that in nuclear winter, like for camps and such -\_-
---
Bethesda
---
As they didn‚Äôt bother to include any punishment I kill literally randomly. There‚Äôs also no incentive so idk why I do it
---
Yea they both are massive disappointments. I had a fat man once that took 3 nukes to kill a super mutant. Wasn‚Äôt even a high level. Usually when I find one I burn off any ammo I have than scrap the gun. Wasted potential for both
---
Bingo, when I‚Äôm feeling really adventurous I‚Äôll throw on archer perks and play Robin Hood too. Perception builds are pretty versatile.
---
Thanks for the heads up I‚Äôll do that now
---
I rename all the items I want to scrip as scrip, and I put skins on all my legendaries I want to keep (except the fixer, I just renamed it so it stands out) and then I generally just scrap all the non legendary weapons
---
I'm at level 218 and I've only gotten 1, and I come across around 5 machines each time I play.  More special to me than my first nuke launch, first SBQ kill, and first Earle kill combined.  It's that rare.
---
That‚Äôs fixed it! You‚Äôre awesome thanks
---
I completely understand where you're coming from. I am a newbie still (I've just went over level 100) but I don't know the intricacies of this game like old school players. I also tend to avoid high level events, but there are lots of good players out there (both high level and low level). If you're on PS4, hit me up. Always glad to make new Fallout friends.
---
Ammo that sells: .45 .50 5mm 5.56 Fusion Cell. That‚Äôs pretty much it. However I buy gamma rounds at any price.
---
Naw I'd rather have a deathclaw event with lots of super beefy deathclaw...alll 3* legendary ofcorse
---
Just some observations on the subject... 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I usually shoot the legendary with a low powered weapon then get out of the way until the rest of them all kill it (for uranium fever, or smaller level mob events). That one usually has friendly people in it MOST of the time to where everyone can tag it. I've had to take it down once or twice before others could shoot it though because it was aggro directly on me and I wasn't about to move from my spot LOL. It's pretty n00b friendly.
---
For other events like radiation rumble, there's so many mobs spawning that I just shoot everything until it's dead, especially since if you let something run loose, it will kill the objective. I almost never see any courtesy calls for legendary in that one, It's every man for themselves, but it seems everyone knows this, and nobody is salty over a legendary kill. Just kill it all ASAP!
---
Stuff like Line in the Sand, I bust out the explosive 10mm and just tag stuff without killing any of it. I still get the kill/exp/loot for it and so does anyone else who hit it. Mass XP for all! People are usually pretty friendly here too. My only complaint is those using weapons turning stuff into ash/goo that covers up the meat piles after so the rest of us can't pick up our loot... or those that keep tossing in grenades so all the loot goes all over the place and outside the easy access area so we have to go searching for it all. 
---
SBQ/ACP, just kill things dead, regardless of legendary. These are end game boss events anyway, your main leg drops comes from the bosses, not all the secondary mobs. Its rare everyone doesn't get a chance to tag the bosses.
---
What kind of bug?
---
What ammo you trying to sell?  I always sell my 308, 5mm, shotgun shells and flamer fuel. Also 5.56 and 50 cal goes quickly
---
You can be a rifleman and rock. You won't be able to break damage limits, which is the commando style.
---
Base damage of one-handed melee still pales in comparison to fist weapons, but I believe since fire damage isn't bugged like energy damage it does deal much better damage.
---
You will only ever it in a high level players way if you keep pestering them to trade with you, aside from that there really isn't much else you can do to bother them. Just play the game and embrace the warmth of high level players, next thing you know you are just showed with gifts that tend to be very useful.
---
The ammo converter is under resources I think assuming you unlocked and claimed it via the Legendary Run board. That finishes today/soon so do it now if you havent already.
---
Player vendors is the only way to sell it otherwise.
---
Unlocking this uhh... thing... actually has a couple of unlisted benefits. Firstly, you learn how to craft the fertilizer bombs at a crafting bench, so you technically don't even need to wait for the generator to generate you one (and it only generates one at a time anyway). And they're pretty cheap to craft.  
---
Also, the grenades themselves can be sold in your vendor, and they come under "Weapons". So you can use these to inflate your weapons counter on your vendor popup, and lure more people to come shop.
---
Actually it makes sense. If you eat a Wendigo don‚Äôt you become a Wendigo?
---
Event call outs on it are great. You wind up playing with a bunch of other Chat Mod players, because you jump to their servers to help with events. Really awesome when coupled with people with private server to double up on events like Fasnatch.
---
Pipe gives blissful benefits
---
...that's not what I'm talking about, you dunce.
---
If someone taps MY workshop, then anyone in the workshop zone REGARDLESS of who tapped it is RED to me.
---
I play a merchant. Her goal is to reach cap max at least once per day, purchase items at camps until she is around 9K then achieve cap max again, all in the space of 3-6 hours of gametime. Cap max is a daily occurance even if she goes broke. Why people sell stuff? For different reasons of course. But my merchant simply wants tons of nice things, TSE weapons, yes she shops a lot so she does find them, and tons of stable, materials, and rare items. Some of you reading this have probably been at her camp across the tracks of the WS train station. Yes she sells serums, makes them too. 
---
But her prices are fair. I want to clarify some things I've read here. Yes, all ammo should be sold for no more than 1 cap, unless it's Ultracite or 40mm, then 2 caps. If you have a problem with weight of ammo? Don't sell it and insult us. We can make it a lot cheaper.
---
 Yes you can sell ammo for more and get away with it, but my point is if you want to become a merchant you are breaking one major rule - turn the merchandise quickly. Those who complain about high prices shouldn't complain. Believe me that high priced items sits on that shelf for weeks. You are witnessing a noob merchant testing his knowledge of the game of merchandising. And high prices are a total fail. They aren't what I do because I don't want the cap max. Instead I want the cap max every day! As an income, not a one-time Eureka moment of ripping somebody off.
---
 This means selling all my items around 300 - 800 caps average. You may think that's high but I don't sell the usual stuff. You will see things at my camp rarely sold. It requires research to locate these items, which vendors, and the vendor may not always spawn the item in his list either so several visits are required before you see it sold. Electric Chairs, Televisions, Unstoppable posters, Cookoo Clocks, are an example of rarely spawned vendor items.
---
 Then there are plans just lying around waiting for you to come get them and spawn every 24 hours, like the Shielded Forest Operative upgrade. And since making one shielded outfit requires 4 stable, 18 Ultracite, and other expensive mats you must price them high for your efforts. These outfits go for 1,500 each, and that is almost breaking even considering the materials needed to create it. It's almost a service to the community at 1500, but guess what? They fly like hotcakes. So what do you think the plan that you find for free should be sold for? Yes, that's right. Like the plans for other cheaper outfits the plans to make a Halloween Skull mask will be very valuable. Much more valuable than the masks that you sell for 100 caps. 
---
 Now for serum prices. I stopped and wondered how much people would pay just for the stable used to make serums and found that Violet Stable (the most popular type) easily sells at 300 caps per stable. The others fly off the shelf at 250 caps. Now, that made me wonder why I even make serums! 
---
 But you see serums for sale around 300 -500, and yes, I tried that, but again, they collect dust. Meanwhile the stable cannot be kept on the shelf for one day at the prices I just listed. TURN THE MECHANDISE. It's not the caliber of the gun, it's the rate of fire!
---
 How can they afford to buy the stable at that price and make serums? I don't really know the answer but isn't stable also used for Ultracite ammo? Hello? LOL. Whatare the most common guns that use Ultracite? 5mm, 50 cal, right? Both need violet stable. These heavy gunners do a ton of work to feed their guns. Believe me they would rather buy it! Serum SCHMEERUM! It's the ammo market you should be paying attention to if you have stable. 
---
 Ever see Nuclear Keycards for sale? No? Because people buy them at crazy prices and they dont sit very long on the shelf. Too much work to get these things. Well, a merchant will find them with a trick. If you are Fallout 1st this is easier, but you need a world that your multiple characters can enter. A Keycard escort mission is begun, and the drop is shot down. Now all you have to do is visit that world with all of your characters in 5 minutes before it blows and each of your characters can collect one keycard. Then they all transfer their keycards to your merchant character!
---
 There are many tricks I'd love to get into. But don't complain about high prices. THose merchants are learning the game.
---
 Come see my camp. "Its\_Alive"
---
Good response
---
Check the flair.  Life goals.
---
I'm trying it for a month and am already addicted to the scrap box.
---
I'm trying to fill it in a month's time to see if I can take a month break from it.
---
Though that 12mo is still cheaper than paying for it monthly every other month ...and you get twice the atoms for a 12 mo.
---
Just kinda hard to shell out when I paid full price for this at launch... but I guess I want them to keep developing it and adding more content, so ... here's my dues.
---
Don't they still plan on removing the necessity of food and water in the future? It makes this just a little less useful
---
Its kinda handy at times. For one it means you can reduce how many crops you need to actually plant and thus save significant camp budget. Its also handy for when you need to make some kind of food item or booze and are just a little short of some crop. Instant growth and saves time.
---
I dont use mine often ut its been handy the few times I have needed it. I just dont collect the grenades until i do need them
---
100% not true.
---
Enter a silo and follow the quest that starts when you do.
---
Ohhh?
---
I've only done a couple since launch, but kept every...single...one. Yes, I have a ton.
---
Hopefully it's faster to use them at once than the claim tickets?
---
Couldnt agree more. 2mm and Plasma Cartridges def need a collectron.
---
You can go into the pipboy and cancel the quest too and get rid of the syringer
---
If I had to live near water to grow cranberries and tar berries, I‚Äôd do it in a second.
---
As it is right now, I only grow gourds to make cranberry relish.  LOL
---
Bloodied build.
---
What are you trying to sell? There‚Äôs a lot of ammo that no one wants.
---
There are some pretty sweet perks by the look of it. The lock pick hacking legendary card looks really great.
---
I commented on a post identical to this a while back, bulking does NOT make everything lighter, just lead and aluminum, the weight you see disappearing when you bulk everything is your plastic being used for bulk, you‚Äôre basically throwing your plastic away and saying ‚Äúlook at how much lighter I am!‚Äù
---
The reason bulking exists in 76 is almost entirely for the purposes of selling unwanted scrap. We need a bot in this sub to repeat this information every time someone says the word bulk. 
---
Here is a thread about it unless those values have changed recently.

I 2nd the workshops. Take 1-2 every time you log in for a session or switch servers. Consider your 25caps a cheap price for a random plan gamble... plus whatever else you get for taking the workshop.
---
Also, check the suitcases around the various train stations, often people (myself included) dump TONS of plans in them to clean out our inventories. I've gotten 100's of plans this way over time. Treat it like give-a-penny-take-a-penny. Take what you want, leave a few dupes behind.

Vampire's low health is great, essentially invincible, decent damage.

In a post apocalyptic scenario, it's a dog eat dog world. If you think for one second the settlers would come out on top, you're out of your mind. But hey, you'll have your nice clean armor and crap when your time comes right?
---
I've had 150 rounds in my gatling plasma and it stops shooting and reloads itself, this really needs to be fixed.
---
EZ PZ.  Do Crater and Foundation Dailies, and public events to get Treasury Notes.  Turn treasury notes into Gold Press Machines at Crater and Foundation.
---
Also, weekly you can buy 300 gold from Smiley at the Wayward for 6000 caps. 
---
https://www.vg247.com/2020/04/20/fallout-76-wastelanders-how-to-farm-gold-bullion-treasury-notes/
---
I thought that too at first but even so, the only locks I want to pick in Fo76 are door locks, since the rewards generally aren't awesome.
---
I can see how it could help to speed through silo.
---
Not looking for false hospitality. I'm aware that this is a "survival" game. I'd rather give my caps (some of which require time on my end to earn) to players that advertise vending without the need for paranoia about their camp planning motives.
---
Im also very low in caps so i cant buy gold :/
---
That's pretty cool. I want to try it.
---
Hey, question, can enemies shoot through the fence?
---
Haven't seen any instakills, though it can be done in a few seconds with bugged weapons and/or armor.
---
Perhaps with a good melee build and a bloodied PA weapon + a ton of foodstacks you can insta her. My non-pa meathook back in the day could PA for like 70% while not even maxing all buffs.
---
I'm actually a full health build but with all the wendigos spawning it just keeps me at full health. I assume you mean a bloodied build when you say low health? Honestly I haven't really wanted to do a bloodied build but I got a sick bloodied lever gun the other day and I have a sweet vampire explosive handmade. You may have just steered me towards my first alt character, so thank you very much.
---
Good luck.hope they can fix you up.
---
O wow thats crazy id love to know what he's stacking.
---
the things are items in some since, meaning they have physics, but i haven't seen anything "random" happen. Is there any quest that involve cowboys or crows?
---
Red rocket workshop always has half a dozen.
---
Yeah definitely don't craft them it's a waste of materials. Take over a workshop at a power plant and hook up a generator to power up the fusion core generator although pvp sometimes occurs at these places so be wary. Also fusion generators around the world will have them too considering someone else hasn't taken it. Check behind counters, tables etc. I'll be logging on soon so I could show you where some places spawn. I'll add you soon as i get on.
---
Dude. Highest level is 50. Anything above that is just more options for that player. Most os us are new. Well sept that if 3098 dude. That was nuts.
---
I believe Bethesda has stated that it is coming before end of year not sure about patch 22 thou...
---
My father hated my gaming, I did show him this game because we are from WV though, he did think it was pretty cool.
---
He passed away a few days ago and we just had the funeral today. I don't wish for condolences, I just wish to say, enjoy every moment you have like this because time is fleeting. Keep enjoying doing things like this, I think it is really awesome, and I hope you get many years of fun doing together what you love.

Yeah, I don't think that's happening but good luck if it works out.

Definitely report back and let people one way or the other. I'm sure a bunch of people would like to know whether or not it's possible.
---
So do carry a few regular rounds on you, if both weapons are primed? This swap happens to me a lot too.

The current season will end on 12:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, September 8. This reply was made at 10:09 p.m. ET on Monday, September 7. Lots of time zones in Europe, but you'll figure it out. It's the same time tat the Atomic Shop changes.
---
The military types attacked MODUS and he responded by setting off an explosion in a bio-weapons lab, filling the entire base with a deadly agent, killing everyone inside including his boss, Eckhart, then President of the United States, despite the fact that Eckhart hadn't actually done anything to him (mind you, MODUS is about the only person/place/thing he hadn't done something to).
---
It's unclear if this was a malfunction brought on by the massive damage to his systems, the first action of a free willed AI acting to defend itself or worse, an AI that fully bought into the Enclave's agenda and decided that everyone onsite had become liabilities...
---
Given that his repairs are at something like 53%, none of the above are especially comforting...
---
It‚Äôs a legit queen drop
---
I got the better of one of these camps.spawned in 1st vendor alot of stable flux I didnt buy any died at the 2nd vendor.came back bought all the flux fast traveled out stashed the 100+ stable fluxes then came back.the camp owner gave me a thumbs up so he wasnt upset by the looks of it.
---
Did you put the atomic skin on your CAMP?
---
If it was ever mentioned that it was coming with Patch 22, I think that's long since become outdated.
---
I would be VERY surprised if instanced interiors aren't tested on the PTS first before going live. So many things could go wrong it'd be an absolute nightmare to fix in live. Even more so than the shit we already have to deal with in live.
---
I was lucky to have never experienced the bug.  I also never played nuclear winter before and there seems to be a correlation there.
---
Somebody could be sharing Rad-Sponge, Or you might have Sun Kissed equipped / shared to you by another player
---
Just gun bash to cancel the animation until Beth patches it
---
Some trap camps are fun. Some are straight up griefing.  I went to one outside of Whitespring Station and this guy's hook was stable flux for 100 caps. You buy the flux for caps, they kill you, and they get your caps and the flux. Ya, fuck that dude.
---
Same here but I only used the 1st cards of commando and still seem to be taking shit out with 3 rounds or less.same time as my riflemen if not faster

MODUS is a damaged and potentially insane AI though...it's not entirely certain that it has the free will to attack them until and unless they attack his facility.  Of course they almost certainly WILL do that if they discover his existence so yeah, I can see him bombing them back to the stone age as soon as he can.
---
There is a slight chance that he will see them as legitimate US military personnel though and that might (or might not, he's killed soldiers before) affect his judgement.
---
Yeah tbh I‚Äôm high someone is sharing level 2 sun kissed currently in my public team, thank youüòÇ
---
Cool
---
Can't get anything as strong as What Rads? or Taking One For the Team with five points worth of normal perk cards. And unless you're running a full hybrid build you probably won't need all six legendary SPECIAL perks. I only plan on taking three myself.
---
Sounds like a blood eagle camp
---
I think that if it were to work, it would definitely need to be a separate mode where, as you said, people have to find more weapons after starting out with basic ones. Otherwise, people would just be able to trivialize it.
---
I had to laugh and roll my eyes at the same time at that... LOL
---
It is a rare drop from events in the forest region.
---
Several of the youtubers i watch have a baaaaaaaad habit of blurring what they're talking about.  So yeah.  Prolly not 22 then but they just didn't clarify.
---
While I agree Fallout 5 is inevitable, given that they have to finish Starfield, Elder Scrolls 6, maybe something else like a Starfield or ES6 New Vegas style spinoff/second game or a new property entirely before even starting Fallout 5...I'd expect to see Starfield in 2021, ES6 in 2024 and Fallout 5 in 2028 at the earliest.  I'd say 2029 or 2030 are more likely.
---
Plus, that means they won't be in the upcoming console generation but the one after that, which may delay it further :(
---
They won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt let you do that. Gotta start from scratch, but welcome to the masterrace
---
the ones like the pumpkin and cat that are on the walls and windows?
---
Thank you.
---
Ran my 1st 1 today also. I also run Vanguards/Vampires setup with a .50cal. Was a fun run for sure.
---
It hasn't been in the game since release as far as I know.
---
I was only able to play it in BETA.
---
*The FBI* would like to know your location
---
Whaaa?... how have i not have heard of this? I know what in trying when I get off work
---
15-30 whatever, it‚Äôs kinda hard to check the timer with all the action. bottom line is it sucked for everyone - I went through close to 800 rounds. This particular event was a frustrating waste of time.
---
I saw this too for the very first time but it allowed me to still check it and complete them for score.
---
Yep, I never play NW and then log off, all ways log in to adventure again before signing off for the day. And never play NW with an hour left the 24h period.
---
a low health build  is only a bloodied build if using bloodied weapon.  If you have low health because you want to benefit from adrenal reaction mutation , nerd rage and serendipity cards and unyiedling armor  but you dont use Bloodied weapons you are not really a bloodied build .    But i am aware that most low health build are also bloodied builds
---
Ah yes, taking one for the team. That is definitely a contender for the potential 40% buff, though that depends how much practical dps it offers after the damage rebalance. It is also useless for the many bloody stealth commandos.
---
What rads only gives rad resist right? I think there needs to be more rad zone events for that to be truly needed, since often people fight SBQ just outside nuke radius, and earle is rad free.
---
Yea I gotta say this is way better then the SBQ!
---
Ah makes sense. I think my friend got it to work once, but it was most likely in beta now that I think of it.
---
Yes any primed weapons I carry I have some regular rounds also
---
Yeah, their actions don't exactly scream "qualified"...
---
I apologize I really am a novice when it comes to builds.
---
Games have come a long way since Space Invaders :)
---
Yeah im hoping they can just unlock stuff for me i know its a tall order but heres hoping im lucky
---
Hope it works for you! It sounds really fun I only hope they didn‚Äôt remove it from the game :/
---
Indeed, though he appears to be a somewhat free willed AI with his own agenda at this point.  MODUS had a colleague named ZAX who was doing roughly the same job at the Raven Rock base in Pennsylvania and eventually took command of the surviving Enclave forces in 2277 as "President" John Henry Eden.
---
So there's no telling what MODUS' future may hold.
---
hahaha you're bang on there :]
---
Ok thank you
---
Vamp gat lazer is my favorite heavy, suxs though patch 22 giving energy weaps the shaft.
---
&gt;What rads only gives rad resist right? 
---
It also removes X rads/second (6 at max) so build depending it is either strong as hell or the worst perk
---
I personally haven't had an issue when running a SBQ either. Funny you say that though. The servwr I was one today that I ran my 1st ACP 2 people threw nukes at thw same time. 1 was a SBQ and 1 was a ACP. I went to the SBQ 1 and FT in just as they finished. Went to the ACP and Earle was about half health. I threw a few rounds on Earle, then helped keep the Windigos clear and healing peeps.
---
I would so love if this was possible. I played the first year on XBox, switched to PC, and have no plans to go back. Ever! Seriously, even if I do buy a next gen console, I'm going back to Playstation (PS5). I only got the Xbox, so that I could play this with my son; he started playing during the beta, and was basically done by launch.
---
Unfortunately, even though there has been some talk about crossplay, the consensus seems to be, that it ain't gonna happen. Moreover, the consensus also agrees that any crossplay, would likely be limited to between consoles.
---
That‚Äôs clever.  The beds are a bit inconsistent sometimes.  The four poster is a small bed when it should be huge.  
---
Another thing ‚Äî how come there are at least two baby mobiles you can buy but not a single crib?   That‚Äôs kinda strange
---
no need to apologize : ) - i just thought i wanted to supply some info . It is an easy assumption to make as most use "bloodied" and "low health" as being the same which in most cases they probably are
---
I got mine last week from fly swatter in the ash heap.
---
God, I wish. I‚Äôm not sure if *all* plants need to be (IE Fever Blossom, Gut Shrooms, and Kalideopores), but I‚Äôd love to have more options. No reason to not have it.
---
Gauss shotty?
---
Literally just did it today myself. Wish I had done it earlier.
---
Vamp is amazing. I use a vamp explosive fixer on my commando guy and his just the tankest thing alive!!
---
Yeah i wish we could oppose BOS and have an Enclave/BOS faction was a la Horde/Alliance
---
Do the patrol duty event at the prison, it will give you a weapon plan each time.  Including sought after ones like lever gun and handmade.  Other than that, just keep doing events, killing legendaries and leveling up.  You‚Äôll have max caps before you know it, and you will be able to buy what you want!  
---
Also check the market sub, lots of people are swimming in plans.
---
I think that event made it to like patch 4 or 5 before being removed, I did it a bunch of times and I wasn't in the beta.
---
I switched from rifleman to heavy weapons. 50 cal just shreds.
---
Ya im just trying to get my season pass that i grinded all season for ported to pc for that sweet black power armor
---
I did this a while back, but I kept all my single shot rifles as they‚Äôre all REALLY good, but only for when I‚Äôm bored and want a challenge or feel like doing a little ‚Äúroll playing‚Äù. It‚Äôs hard to let go of a B25/33 gauss rifle, BE lever action and B2525 50 cal sniper rifle. But for events and grinding levels for battle pass stuff, commando wins.
---
The stealth invisibility can be a mutation, the stealth suit or chameleon armor. If they‚Äôre invisible when moving, it‚Äôs the suit. Lots of weapons can do high damage. If you don‚Äôt have it, invest in Covert Ops. It gives a damage multiplier when hidden or in caution. I have a furious vats handmade for regular use and can down a max gutsy in two or three shots. Stealth commando/rifleman is devastating.
---
I don‚Äôt know what Legendary Run is...seen something about it in notifications as I start the game, but it goes by so fast...what is it? I‚Äôm at level 27 btw
---
Same here.  355-ish and I love nothing more than to drop awesome legendaries at low level players feet.  
---
It‚Äôs so rare that I am trusted off the bat with the beckon emoji but eventually when I can get people to come over I always make it worth their while
---
I can‚Äôt count how many times people didn‚Äôt trust me and took off.  I always feel bad when that happens like i was only trying to help and sorry I scare you off :/
---
I was confused by the lunchbox effects the first time too. I though it was something special with a legendary cultist blade I was carrying.
---
Ohhh okay. Mannn I wish I got to try it!
---
A modified PDQ-88b securitron from New Vegas would suit MODUS just fine. With Enclave resources it's not far of a stretch to think MODUS would have access to the plans.
---
They could make some pretty sweet co-op missions where you play as Responders, Brotherhood, etc  fighting the scorched and ghouls in scenarios before everyone left. Like prequel missions with loadouts and characters you can choose.
---
Thanks I will keep an eye out for that event. I think ive only ever seen it once or twice.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mad...I‚Äôm just disappointed.‚Äù
---
My 80-round Quad Combat Rifle reloads at 5, 9, 14, or 27 rounds remaining.
---
The bug affects most all high-capacity weapons, it seems.
---
YouTube it, lots of good tutorials out there.
---
I want either a Fire Breather Collectron (which'd presumably find healing items and chems) or an Auto-Miner Collectron (which'd presumably find ores).
---
Also if you dont mind me asking. Would it be better for me to save my legendary scrips for later or should i just use them on a 3 star weapon now?
---
.38, 10mm, energy ammo and .44 mainly but some assorted other stuff plus missiles and mini nukes. Sucks that it‚Äôs sitting in my stash taking up weight
---
Well, technically the Enclave would be the remnants of the legitimate government of the United States...if you cared about such details at this point.
---
And unfortunately,  [Abigayle Singh](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Abigayle_Singh) indicated that she was the last survivor of the Free States.  While we aren't certain she's dead, the odds are that she died in late 2096 or early 2097 when the Raider's attempt to hold the Scorched Detection System hostage failed when the Scorched overran them and the survivors ran for their lives (don't knock it, at least some of them are still alive six years later).
---
Given that it was the Raider's foolishness that prevented the SDS from being activated in time to do any good, dooming the Free States survivors and every other living human in West Virginia, I think any Free State member that did somehow survive wouldn't be in a hurry to cozy up with them.
---
Where do you buy them.. At players vending machines or bots?
---
Yep. Similar to the one I ran into. And I agree (fucks and all).
---
Always happens to me, I see my plasma core reload and when it reloads I get around 9-25 bullets to use instead of the 250 it's supposed to give me
---
Junkies Vampires Assassins anti armor
---
No idea, they said it was supposed to hit with one wasteland (coming patch) in the interview. It has not been on any of the PTS patch notes, i have also not seen anyone link to anything where beth confirmed are working on rolling it out.
---
Later. Not worth it until you hit 50
---
I will equip this the next time I play. Thanks.
---
I‚Äôd wait a few days for the 1/2 off purveyor sale, but go ahead and use them is my advice, scrip is easy to come by and you may get some gear that can really help you as you progress.  You can sell your low level legendaries in your vending machine to earn extra caps as well.
---
 Missiles and nukes rarely sell, for me it‚Äôs not worth the stash space so I drop them as soon as I get them. You should find ammo converter at most camps. As you said, it‚Äôs tedious and you have to have A LOT of 38 or 44 to make it worth while.
---
You can actually trigger the event to start by going to the prison, just server hop till it starts :)
---
I really miss this event, I wish they v would add it back in! Ppl have no idea what I'm talking  about if I mention it. Not sure why they removed it.
---
I‚Äôll say this, yeah it‚Äôs like comparing two different flavors of shit, but I do like to have a little fun when I get weird legendary roll for either one. For instance I got a Bloodied faster fire +perception fatman, and because of the quality perks attached to it I can‚Äôt get rid of it, so I take my spare mininukes to uranium fever because firing a fatman in tight quarters will raise some eyebrows and it‚Äôs pretty funny. Along side that I also have an anti armor faster reload Crit damage missile launcher. Same thing, excess missiles come to uranium fever with me. Talk about pull the trigger and run like hell. Otherwise, yeah no they suck in any other situation.
---
Come to my camp tonight I‚Äôll craft you whatever you want that I have!
---
Later the sale is coming!!
---
I care about the QOL of my camp mostly. My camp has proven to be nearly indestructible from attackers, my defenses take out most attackers, I almost never get the notification that my camp couldn't be placed, I have all the necessary crafting stations and the rad removal shower. I'm next to water. My recent addition was all the plants necessary to craft Chally's Feed. The only time I have visitors is people on my team who see my map marker. I used to have vending machines but I've heard too many stories recently about exploits.
---
The Flatwoods Monster has been spawning right next to my camp a lot recently. I just run over and take him out quickly.
---
Beyond all of that, I'm not interested in rebuilding or redecorating my camp anytime soon.
---
misunderstood this comment. sorry. read as you were having issues when running the SBQ event. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Players. For sure. If you have .45 for a cap each I‚Äôll buy you out. Same with 5mm. And your 27 odd gamma rounds I‚Äôll buy those for 50 per cause caps I got.
---
In past fallout games, your pip-Light also changed with the HUD color, if I remember. My best guess when I realized it wasn't there, was they didn't have time to test all the random light interactions.
---
I applied for Bethesda support. I was told I was ‚Äúoverqualified‚Äù because I might actually fix more problems in one day than their entire team has in 6 months. The fact that I actually play the game doesn‚Äôt help.
---
Given that the Order is based on comic books and old style radio serials, it is 100% certain that at least some of them, somehow, survived.  Especially the ones that we have actually seen dead...because that how comic books and radio serials work :)
---
The Whitesprings is still uninhabitable because the giant robot army there believes it is closed for renovations.  If that could finally be sorted out, it would make a perfect location for local civilization.  It likely has sufficient quarters to house the entire human population of Appalachia at this point.  It is, by modern standards, safe, secure, clean, well supplied and has its own build in army of robot servants and defenders.
---
The bunker underneath it is a little more problematic.  MODUS seems reasonable enough but I'm not sure he's up for having neighbors and he most certainly isn't going to be entertaining many guests ;)
---
I missed it, too. Shame, that was the only reward I was really looking forward to.
---
*62.5%
---
It‚Äôs still the absolute worst prefix in the game.
---
It gives enough rad resist and rad healing, that you need no other anti-radiation measures except for nuke zones and radiation rumble. The rad healing also happens even while you're being irradiated, so at max rank you subtract 6 from the number on your Geiger counter and that's the real amount of rads you're taking per second. (which means anything that deals less than 6 radiation damage after resistance deals basically none)
---
It's incredible for tanks, especially ones using Solar Armor like myself.
---
Yeah, I had 1st for a month without it ever working. They ran through the basic solutions then just stopped responding for two weeks. Then when I messaged them again it was "Wait until the patch.", which of course fixed nothing.
---
Depending on the context I have seen it used for:
---
1. Nuclear winter "levels" (mostly pre- season pass, we don't see many NW posts)
---
2. Your current position on the legendary run board (season pass)
---
You must because 1st time I didn't make it out and got rewards.  Every other time I check the chest and make it out.
---
It did, i think fallout 4 had a full RGB scale too, am honestly surprised such a simple feature isn't in the game
---
enable pacifist and just play....before long you will be lvl 50, then 75, and so on and anxiety will fade.
---
That is exactly why I absolutely love gaming with my kids... mind you I'm in my 40s. Their buddies think it's the coolest thing ever that their mom games with them... my husband also games with us.. we literally make our own family teams up when playing on many occasions. We have 6 kids, 4 boys &amp; 2 girls. The girls aren't into it as much as the boys but all 4 boys play 76 with us.
---
As nice as it'll be to have more chances at Tenderizer plans, if we get a second Meat Week this soon, with how over-saturated the market is with the rewards, it'll make it worthless to have grinded at all. I'd rather see us fail this one goal. Call me greedy, but I don't like things being devalued into the dirt. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If someone like you were running support, I'm sure there'd be a lot fewer unhappy campers on reddit \^\^; I wonder if there are any higher-tier employees that can be reached when support fails us? Likely not, but its a nice thought.
---
Iirc there was some major bug with it so they disabled it,  but that was such a long time ago I could easily be wrong
---
What I mean is you get a vampire weapon, namely a heavy gun, I use a 50 cal, but stay at 20% health.  You get the nerd rage perk and the adrenal reaction mutation, along with strange in numbers to make the mutation better, and do way more damage at 20% than at 100.  You don't do as much as bloodied.  But I was fighting acp a few weeks ago, standing under the falling embers being attacked by earl and not taking any damage.  Just kept pounding his face hole.
---
Agreed! We get some awesome comments when people realize I'm the gaming mom and 4 of our 6 play 76... plus my husband as well!
---
what exactly would you count as atomic &amp; or what part of camp or camp item? as I do have a few walls painted in schemes.
---
I'd recommend adding at least 3* Gunsmith since you have a ffr, and invest in Weapon Artisan for when you do repairs, so you get a 200% weapon and slower condition deterioration, and similarly, Fix It Good for your PA. 
---
I'd also consider Batteries Included and Power User so you get 999 shots per fusion core.
---
For a bit more damage, Tenderizer 1* is also good, maxing it only gets you 1% extra damage per Charisma invested so it's not always recommended to max it.
---
Lastly, Chem Fiend is fun. Psychobuff is the best drug. I wish they had the sounds you make in F4 when you take drugs.
---
My husband, our 4 boys and myself all play 76 together on PS4 as well!! Our boys friends thinks its the coolest thing ever that not only does dad play but so does mom!
---
To piggyback off this idea: Pop into Encryptid whenever you see it. Level 25 might be a little low for Lying Lowe questline (probably should start around level 30-35), but doing that will get you a free assaultron recall card, to start the event. The fixer plan drops from this, and even non-legendary fixers are pretty good. Project Paradise has a chance to drop Bear arms, and Free Range has several melee weapon plans that can drop.
---
Sure. Send me your gamer tag. I think I really just need an auto weapon my shotgun and sniper are already about as good as can be for my level I think
---
WestRider85 
---
I‚Äôll be on around 10pm
---
Jump on the characters and fast travel around and hand items out to players.
---
Holy fuck I almost spit out my soup üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ said port to the fucking microwave üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I‚Äôm dead üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Actually there is the responders helmet, white fire helmet and the fire breathers helmet üòä i may have them named wrong but I know there is 3
---
Yes I love the solar it‚Äôs my favorite
---
This was very entertaining. I have no idea what you guys just said. But still entertaining.
---
Rank with context 1 is short for Overseer Rank
---
There is also rank in the context of perk cards themselves.
---
My boys say the same about gaming with mom üòä I absolutely love seeing more parent/child teams!! I've ran across a few dad/child teams but haven't found another mom/child team!
---
Was wondering if it was actually doing that on my gatling plasma but I'd never really caught it, just thought it was reloading too soon. Caught it a few days back when we were in an Earl fight. Irritations abound.
---
Unfortunately, no. I was in the server, saw the nuke launch, so I left, waited for the blast, then logged back in. This is a brand new bug. As I said, been playing for a long time, I am very aware of when the nuke lands, this is different.
---
Yikes!! That doesn't give me much hope tbh, but thats alright..its a kick in the pants to get a new character started. I hope FO76 is treating you a bit better now.
---
on the flip side, i‚Äôm high level (350+) and when i do an event like SBQ or Earle with lower level players i feel like i‚Äôm letting everyone down. i‚Äôm a full health tank, i don‚Äôt do bloodied damage or have magic weapons i‚Äôm just a shlub with a normal 3* weapon and maxed perks and whatever meager buffs i can slap together, just like you.
---
It certainly SHOULDN'T, but it can.
---
Yes. The actual fire fighter one. The responders is not üòä
---
Nope, understand why you would think that though.
---
Tyler County fair grounds is loaded with them
---
Yes I smelled it too
---
Seriously!? Another mom!? Finally! My oldest son and I have played since Beta.. slowly we've gotten my other 3 boys and husband on 76.. our 2 girls haven't gotten into it yet but I haven't given up hope!
---
Hm. Might actually make wearing a regular ss armour set viable in a nuke zone with it. Right now with an (almost) complete ss set I take 17 rads per second in nuke zone. If a few points in what rads can get it close to 0 it would be fantastic, even for bloodied builds.
---
Yeah me too, I have gotten at least eight, probably more. From a bunch of different machines, too.
---
I think 30-50 might be optimistic.  That group is traveling, apparently on foot, a distance of approximately 2600 miles (based on their known starting and ending point and a few points along the route) and they are doing it in "just over three months" so something like 100 to 105 days.
---
That means they are averaging more than 25 miles a day.  While carrying supplies, scouting the route since no one blazed a trail for them.  They can't possibly carry enough food, water, ammunition and other supplies so each day has to include time for scavenging and they have to be extremely careful because they have no backup.
---
And we know the crossed the Rocky Mountains...which they had to actually go north to do given their starting point, as well as cross the Mississippi River without a clue as to which bridges might still exist.
---
Even assuming they are in power armor and have some sort of pack animals/robots to assist them, covering 25+ miles a day, every day, for over three months through hostile country with no maps, no supply depots, no communications, etc. is on the absolute edge of ridiculous.
---
Increasing their numbers by 10 to 20 times while doing it, taking valuable time, increasing the supply burden, making stealth more or less impossible, pushes it over the edge.
---
I just mean that they won‚Äôt roll up and be like ‚ÄòHowdy we are The Enclave and you are worthless‚Äô the would use subterfuge and act all good. That‚Äôs a fair point about the raiders but I mean that was more of of a David Thorpe kinda thing and not meg. Anyway I just feel like they could have got more out of these factions made in 76(I know Enclave is OG but we never get to see em much) instead of shoehorning the BOS in.
---
It says I still need to kill bloatflies...apparently they‚Äôre super rare or something
---
Not nuked offline, you have to load in, but yeah. I recently built at the coal dump on the train tracks SE of the mine. It has a huge building around which I wrapped my camp. I don't mind logging out to save my camp, it's the longing in to a zone and then watching everything explode around youüòÇüò≠üòÇ
---
Wear a Santa outfit when you do it.
---
&gt;  I think I‚Äôd hate to live in these things because they are just too much of a pain to navigate all the time. 
---
Much like any other dungeon or area, once you've been there twice, everything pretty much clicks. I think I could still sketch out most of my bases in fallout 4, and I certainly wouldn't have trouble finding the things I need in them. Same for my camp (though its in a tiny/cramped plot right now, and not that big)
---
I don‚Äôt think it really matters, I think Bethesda is making up numbers so we can get the stuff and they just wanna see us acting like idiots donating things, that‚Äôs what I think
---
Definitely doesn't happen every time.
---
Yes. I can't even find a fo4 with them included.
---
We will always meet it, the updates are programmed into the game and they aren‚Äôt going to deny the players who give their resources.
---
They should have made it competitive, enclave vs bos for resources, bos likely wins but then you commit the community to another task to get enclave
---
Happy birthday! Not sure where you can find these, but there are a lot of talented artists and fabricators on Etsy
---
Yeah
---
They had a bundle for the last halloween I have them in my camp so theyll be back
---
Lol beginners
---
Nope, I always logout. No, happens ....
---
Fireproof should but it doesn‚Äôt work on most of the legacy energy weapons
---
Super broken. I would have done more damage to Earle throwing my damn controller at him... and it would have felt better.
---
Yay!  I peed in your pool!  I'm sorry.  The water was warm.
---
Now my mom need to get to your level of coolness üòé
---
I think I know the spot. My gut tells me its in southern savage divide, but I can't remember where.
---
So Grim Reaper, Crit Savvy, etc are much more viable?
---
Hasn't been confirmed but we'll be fine. 
---
Bethesda would be dumb to not allow it to succeed, especially given the precedence with concrete we were guaranteed to fail before Bethesda stepped in.
---
It‚Äôs in the main menu right under the atom shop. Click on it and claim any rewards it lets you claim. The ammo converter is one of the earliest ones so you should already have it unlocked for claiming.
---
Referring to the camp module. There's a skin that was a reward for season 1. It was bugged like fucking woah (your camp would no longer show up on the map, it was still there, but there was no icon) and you have to remove it and move your camp to fix it. (it works now, but you still have to remove it and fix it to get it to work again)
---
The sneak question depends on your armour and Agility level. If you run full bloody/unyielding and your agility is over 25 sneak cards have very little to no impact on your sneak level.
---
Lots say that ultralight armour helps, but if you can manage to get agility to 29 it makes no difference that I can tell.
---
Source: used to run full unyielding modded with ultralight, switched to SS full unyielding none of it UL and noticed no difference at all.
---
Doubt it was me unless you demand your god rolls for less the 4500 caps. ( Fixer plan 7k? Is that shyte? IDK) all ammo 1 cap.
---

thanks i wasnt sure if i had to wait till end or not, glad i asked. i made it all the way to 95, looks like ill just buy the last 5
---
All backpacks were changed to a new skin system. Go to an armor bench and modify the backpack, you can add the skin there.
---
Raven Rock is an empty bunker with an AI running it...much like MODUS himself.  The difference is that ZAX/President John Henry Eden is actually in contact with the leadership of the actual Enclave on the oil rig.  He is an acting advisor to the "real" President in fact.
---
Of course MODUS has no idea about that.  Still, he and ZAX/Eden used to talk so he might have some interest in seeing what became of his old colleague.  Further, MODUS doesn't know the bunker is empty...as far as he knows it might be full of Enclave personnel which might (or might not...he is heavily damaged and not entirely rational/lucid at this point) interest him.
---
And of course, even if none of the above are true, Raven Rock represents the one place on earth that MODUS knows for a fact housed a prewar AI/super computer at least somewhat like himself.  He may view it as a source of supplies, robots, and most importantly, the type of one-of-a-kind, bleeding edge computer technology that he desperately needs to repair himself.

Push come to shove he might not actually care whether or not ZAX is operational and might be ready, willing, and able to chop him up for parts.
---
Best of all, MODUS has a couple of friends that he might be able to talk into taking a road trip to the Capital Wasteland to investigate for him.
---
Legendary peeks are gonna be awesome, they will give me points to complete my character. I think the + special ones are gonna make it actually fun to make builds,  +3 in str lets me take off chemist backpack and go with armored for example
---
Yeah..... don‚Äôt think anyone I know has $172 just lying around lmao
---
Ah, that makes sense. Thank you so much!
---
I only lose about 20% damage and still high enough to one shot everything that's not a boss so I'm happy.
---
It's east of vault 96 i believe. Lots of good spots down there
---
Honestly this would be awesome.
---
More like selling ballistics for 3 to 5 caps, or shotgun shells for 6. These are the ones that most piss me off. 
---
Sometimes ill see some overpriced junk that someone will think is good, but just has wrong rolls for the type of weapon and overpriced crap. Not saying it was you, was more a joke in follow up to the other guy. 
---
But I have done it before.
---
Honestly Id settle for a regular black Collectron with an Enclave logo, but the kicker here is I want it to have the Bot-Stop voice from the Bots on Parade event.
---
That would be a cool idea. Once the BOS arrives and we've bled them dry of rewards to help Russel be a kiss ass I'm more than willing to take their "hard earned" supplies for the Enclave.
---
There's zero reason to retire these characters. Unless you do a trade where you help out someone's Xbox character and they boost your PC ones with good gear, you gain nothing from retiring them.
---
Also, who knows what'll happen in the future in terms of what happens with next gen. It'll save you having to relevel up, reacquire all that gear again and relearn all those plans etc. if you ever decide to switch back to console or do NW stuff if you mod on PC because it can get real annoying to switch from modded game to NW playable game on PC.
---
Lol, its a start. And was just asked where to get it, not get it cheap. Ill do another search and see if we cant run it a little lower.
---
Thanks lol
---
I've got one of those! If I had a working mic, I could ask if they'd been a good boy or girl.
---
Same. I was doubly bummed when I found out it literally disappears after that quest. The entire arena just goes back to the regular civic center.
---
You would think that something like this would be a priority, but alas that is not the case. Don't worry, I'm sure they'll add more double point weekends and extra challenges that will auto complete to compensate us again. 
---
I'm looking to break my record of 26,000 points for season 2 (that's how many points I lost from auto completions)
---
Seems like a huge waste/miss on their part!
---
If you play 4/7 days of the week yeah
---
I aim to entertain.
---
This is just creepy enough of an idea to be awesome.

What about the Nukatron from Nuka-World, but painted sleek Black with the Enclave Emblem and with MODUS' face on the Monitor?

That‚Äôs cool I do the same whenever I can I can make the tenderizer with all 3 mods bear arm the fixer and the ragstag hunting knife besides all the normal weapons I love plans

Not even coming for the purveyor 50% off sale?
---
I‚Äôll also take a SS clandestine collectron who is all black on black colors and breaths heavy and talks shit like Darth Vader.
---
While we‚Äôre at it please release the clandestine SS armor skins plz, so I can breath heavy and talk shit like Darth Vader.
---
I really love this idea!
---
I thought about trying to negotiate a trade like that; my Xbox gear for your PC gear. I'm just not sure about the logistics of it all: mules and couriers, and what not. 
---
As far as the future goes - I started a Sony fanboy, went through my Xbox phase to transition to PC - I'd most likely go back to my old Sony ways. Crossplay does not appear to be in the cards for this game.
---
For those who stay and loot. Do you loot and die? Or do you loot and fast travel out?
---
Does doing the ammo factory give you a bonus?
---
Cool story, foodbuild.

Post that summarizes the dev interviews from gamescon:

---
"Early winter, maybe November"
---
Don't know what patch that would be, but definitely not the upcoming one.
---
I kill everyone but ultimately I'm a raider in the end.
---
Line in the sand is a good example
---
I can't argue with u since i did buy the game for nex to nothing on pre order at some event i knew exactly what to expect  from it and wasn't surprised but it was what i wanted  now yes game is buggy but it won't cange in my opinion 
---
I hope u atleast enjoy the game
---
See I joined the settlers,but I do like a good number of the raider npcs. Good thing I have a second character.
---
What do you mean? Its working as intended of course.
---
Didn‚Äôt they already address this?
---
I agree. Public teams is a step in the right direction, though sadly most people just use it for the stat bonus
---
High luck helps.
---
Lol thanks!! I wish one of my parents would try video games!! But I love gaming with my kids! We play more than just 76 too
---
Lol i know that feeling
---
Well aside from finding a willing trader (pretty small subset right there), you also need to have a solid 3rd party to act as escrow to hold onto both party's gear during the transaction.
---
Not an easy thing to arrange one of those, let alone both.
---
Up to you though dude. I just don't see the benefit of giving items away or selling them on that very off chance you may go back to that account. Trade is the only thing that makes sense.
---
With how many levels you can get a day with the right build and some time on your hands...not going to happen.  Plus, people cheated to get 100 levels in a couple hours, no guarantees that won't happen again.
---
So is it when you "press any button to start"?
---
No. Two wrongs don't make it a right.
---
Just report the person who has an ammo generator in their camp and move on.
---
What platform? I basicly only play to kill Earl,  at this point. Sometimes it's a struggle finding people who actually contribute to the fight.
---
There‚Äôs no incentive to not lol Idk I imagined it like strike teams in destiny lol. They need to rework the rewards other than stat sticks. Like free fast travel etc
---
As a female gamer, I wish there was text chat because there's no end of bullshit coming your way from toxic dudes when you're a girl gamer.
---
I hate speaking in-game, even if my character is female and you'd think it might be obvious, there's always some "bro" who doesn't understand how NOT to harass someone. 
---
Most annoying thing to hear in any game ever? "Omg is that a girl?" Usually followed by some form of "hey egirl, what's your snapchat?" (Ps: isn't snapchat mostly dead yet?)
---
Orrrr you could just go to the Nuka Cola factory itself (go figure) because it's an instanced interior and therefore guaranteed not to already be looted.
---
I would use the shotgun as I am switching to a shotgun build, but if u wanna give it away to a low level I totally understand
---
Better to probably buy them as then the chicken coop can be shared across all characters if you have multiple characters instead of having to do the dlc 5 times.
---
Why is explosive bait scummy?
---
My script stuff goes into storage, sell items get thrown in to sell right away, and my keep weapons go on displays. Nice to have that icon when going thru your list. I usually have about 25-35 weapons for sale at a time so I just scroll down to my trophy icons for my rotation of used weapons.
---
Ok....so thats the cheapest one :/ not sure what to say about that but looking through etsy, amazon, wish, and Ali baba those are it... Not sure what to say there. 
---
Maybe plans to build one yourself from supplies available at michaels or something?
---
Destroy camps?
---
We're too big to fit in a crib. The mobiles show what Bethesda thinks of us, otherwise.
---
Petition for three round burst
---
I was just in ACP where half the players were Tesla'ing the house down.  By the end I just had to fast travel out because it was impossible to move.
---
Sure would like Todd to be a little more proactive with these funky glitchy games of his.....
---
The problem with the Responders and all of the new factions is that they are all, not to put too fine a point on it, dead.
---
The Enclave at the Whitesprings Bunker exposed bats to a biological agent in early 2082.  By 2084 Scorchbeasts were routinely breaching containment and flying over Appalachia.  President Eckhart released them completely in 2086.  The effect was catastrophic with the Free States capital of Harper's Ferry falling that same year, forcing a few survivors back to their bunkers.  The local BOS tried to hold the line against the Scorched plague but Operation Touchdown failed on 1-29-2095.  Fort Defiance held out as long as they were able but fell on 8-18-2095.  It took a while for the Scorched to rebuild their numbers but the last Responder stronghold, Morgantown Airport, was overrun and destroyed 11-7-2096.
---
Around the same time period, Firebreather Madigan, working with the last remnants of the Free States, attempted to set up a transmitter at the Top of the World to get the Scorched Detection System online.  This would have been a game changer and might, when paired with the sonic lure technology salvaged from the BOS, have turned the tide.
---
Unfortunately, the Raiders at the Top of the World tortured Madigan to death and attempted to ransom the transmitter back to the Free States.  The Scorched overran the Top of the World and scattered the surviving Raiders to the winds.
---
By the spring of 2097, everyone but a few Raiders were dead and the Raiders fled.  The Raider leader didn't make it and was turned into just another Scorched.
---
So yeah, all the new factions are dead.  Have been for six years or so.  It's a pitty because they were much more interesting than what's currently on offer.
---
Its a strange bug , switched to Junkies a few months back from low health . Before i had the bug all the time.
---
Have not had it happen once since switching
---
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/429530883201947270/
---
Say what now
---
I have mothman x01, strangler, red scar I think that‚Äôs the name i‚Äôm not to sure but that‚Äôs on excavator and I‚Äôm currently working on the t-65 I only have the left arm but that has the jet pack on it thanks to the camo skin from the atomic shop
---
Yeah, way faster than the claim tickets. You find the spot, and you can just spam through all the maps.
---
But in reality, we usually just want to help and drop some low level items or extra stuff.. We've all been helped by randoms in this game and the majority of us are just happy to see new players tbh
---
Oh ya, been there too.  It‚Äôs a great weapon to use, but like you said it totally breaks the event
---
I'd just leave the characters alone. If you give stuff away, they might just be turned into scrip or people might quit soon after. You never know what will happen. Maybe you'll give them to a trader/duper and not even know it.
---
Oh shit.   Touch√©.  Well played sir.
---
I've tried that (no junkie though) and I have been underwhelmed with commando.  Yes, it is better against bullet sponges but I feel in general a stealth rifleman with an instigating weapon is 1shotting most enemies.
---
Yeah. That's my worry.
---
Bethesda's created a legendary system that screws people out of perk coins for respecing (or if you've tried different builds in the past) but I usually get downvoted for pointing out this fact.
---
Now you can keep buying them as a quasi banking system. 30k cap Max you say? Got 8 extras in my stash that I can sell for 15k easy because even with high charisma and buffs it's gonna cost that to buy them. Or I can trade them all for a legacy.
---
plasma bows are nice bc of the green goo piles
---
So much rage, yet somehow we can never just quit the game.  Stupid Bethesda.
---
Did the Battle Royale mode ever release? I never heard anything about it. I just played the beta and it was kinda not good at all.
---
It‚Äôs been killed quicker
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
That doesn‚Äôt even look like a deathclaw
---
Fanboys really be defending Bethesda to the max it‚Äôs sad
---
Looks like just the skull of it.
---
I sell a ton of 556 and 45 and 50. All sell very fast but you need 1000‚Äôs at a time. Ammo is by far my main source of revenue. All for 1 cap
---
Though this wasn‚Äôt for sale thank you. I‚Äôm going to see if I contact the maker
---
deathclaw wellington and steak, yao guai steak AND roast, mutant hound chops AND stew, mutton chops (sheepsquatch) AND mutton meat pie and glowing meat steak. From Reddit. Add fury, overdrive, and nukashine.
---
You dont happen to mean the spot at the flower SE of Top of the world ?
---
If you‚Äôre on discord, I can dm you an invite
---
I‚Äôve been considering this but I really like my instigating lever action.
---
They do if you multiply them :D
---
Very good point!
---
They‚Äôre largely the only ones left with this game. Me? I have a soft spot for problem child‚Äôs lol
---
It does, up to the limit of 15. (And I saw your other comment about already checking the wiki) but consider this.
---
You have 15 perception already. You get the Perception legendary card and level it to 5. This allows you to move 5 points elsewhere.
---
Effectively, If you went full 6 legendaries and leveled them. Youd have an extra 30 perk points to spread out.  That means you're new total of perk points (including regular) is 79. There are 7 specials. 5 could now be at 15 with 4 leftover compared to 3 with 4 left over.
---
You want to be a stealth sniper and a Heavyguns for when shit goes sideways? Do it 
---
Overall the possibilities are insane.
---
I remember when I changed. It was a massive change to ammo usage but a massive increase to dps. Best decision I‚Äôve made in this game
---
Absolutely, I know I‚Äôll be back for more tomorrow.  ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know how to quit you!‚Äù
---
Can't wait to see this nerfed for no reason whatsoever
---
Worked with both, sided with Settlers, brokered a deal between them, still will kill raiders attacking settlers, raider hunters, or raider thieves, but if they are just minding their own business like Bones, Blackeye, and the rest of them down at the Ohio River Adventure, won't lay a finger on 'em. Raiders who are trying to leave the faction, however, I spare and send to Foundation.
---
It's my go-to for this challenge because it's a short walk from the westek fast travel, it does spawn 100% of the time, but like deathclaw island that does not mean it's ALIVE 100% of the time.
---
I like heavy weapons because I can save ammo using the plasma caster or Gatling gun since they are strong enough and don't use as much ammo but I can always switch to my 50 cal or Gatling plasma for automatic
---
I think its the plans to make one, or thats what it looked like to me.
---
Changed from commando to heavy. BEST CHOICE EVER
---
haha explosive minigun go brrr
---
Glad it‚Äôs not locked behind a rep and buillion grind üëç
---
No but doing it just to see them get toxic is the issue. It's what you said and your motive that makes you part of the problem. I have no issue with being attacked at a workshop, I know that's the risk I take and I'm not mad, even if they take my junk lol. 
---
&gt;The point is being toxic hardly matters,
---
This is the problem I have with this. You don't get that it ruins the community to provoke for no reason. Pvp is fine, we all know that this is part of the game. It's the extra stuff, chasing someone across the map or getting on your mic to hurl insults. They are unnecessary.
---
Yep. Can never completely go back to pure Rifleman. That being said, swapping is very easy, and an I/E or 25 Lever Action with Gun Fu is super fun, especially against hordes.
---
BOTH NEED TO BE DEMOCRACY'D BY STATE OF THE ART ATOMIC AIR STRIKES
---
Cap did it in 13 with his unarmed build! He could've done it even quicker but a couple punches missed.
---
You don‚Äôt really die it just fades to black and then you are outside the mine
---
It‚Äôs a limitation they just don‚Äôt know to or won‚Äôt do. Shame because this is the type of game where cross progression absolutely would benefit. Destiny does it so nicely. Modern Warfare too
---
Yes I love that event I got the backpack plans today I already have them but it‚Äôs been so long I forgot they gave them lol
---
Im honestly upset that's all they added.
---
They need something like Bunker Hill tbh.
---
Bolstering will give you better defensive numbers, get an Unyielding set and see your SPECIAL go HIGH AS FUCK. 
---
The Unyielding armor and Bloodied Melee weapon combo is where damage is. I went from punching for 700 to punching for 8000. And that's before chems and other buffs. I think my hardest punch was 17K and I wasn't even trying to test my limits.
---
Ya i do it with modern warfare i have a Bethesda acct i think it would be pretty easy to cross check things i own
---
I‚Äôd love to see them set up a similar operation at that big ass bridge looming over Flatwoods. That would be an excellent spot for another Riding Shotgun like event. 
---
(That spot takes place in the forest though... Unless they can make the event spawn max level enemies and reward max level loot, the event wouldn‚Äôt be worth doing if all you got was low level stuff. That‚Äôs what makes Riding Shotgun great, max level enemies which means max level legendary loot.)
---
I can‚Äôt say I haven‚Äôt been tempted
---
That‚Äôs not even it‚Äôs skull, it‚Äôs just the horns tacked onto some weird ogre skull prop
---
It‚Äôs just another QOL shortcoming.
---
Yeah it was in the beta now that I think of it
---
People being selfish has ruined the game's economy for everybody that plays fair. Duping equipment has made higher level trading beyond idiotic, caps were never rare but everybody and their uncle has mules loaded down with so many presents they have functionally infinite supply, the ammo factory exploit has killed selling ammo, and Bethesda only gives a few day suspensions to people they can confirm are responsible. Bethesda is NOT going to fix this.
---
Ideally, they'd do a global reset of everything and start actually punishing morons that actively harm themselves and the game long term for short term benefits but we all know that won't happen because they're scared of whining and downvotes on Reddit. (Yes, I hear all the entitled reactionaries downvoting in advance.)
---
This is the only legitimate use for Explosive Bait at the moment, too.
---
People like this make the community less fun. Let people play how they want. Personally I probably will take the survival syringe perk
---
I know, its crazy! I think had they had a few smaller quests that would have been awesome.
---
I‚Äôd be down for faction battles, if they could keep pvp from being a stealth/bloody nightmare. Nothing like taking down Enclave stooges.
---
I just finished the Run and ended at level 149. I can't wait.
---
Sturdy looks waaay better than heavy leather.
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain it does give well fed/hydrated, though.
---
Aren‚Äôt those just scummy people?
---
Heck I'd be happy if we got modus themed vendor for our camp.
---
I would like a R-91 to be rewarded to you when you complete the event that would be cool
---
Oh that's a good spot for sure. Maybe the event itself could spawn higher level enemies despite it being the forest. I can see it!
---
They definitely need to expand on them why don‚Äôt they have a skin for power armor they should Attleast have one guard in pa and like you said where‚Äôs the outside missions
---
Because all they did was copy paste the ones from fo4.
---
Naturally, yes. Base damage simply refers to no damage buffs except the mods. True base damage also excludes the mods
---
Same. I have never been accused of over pricing, and I never sell scrap. I have nuked dumbass camps b4, but niw I just run, Earl, sbq/Earl, sbq/Earl. (My group calls it Qearl, pronounced like the teacher in Harry Potter.
---
The yes man from New Vegas.
---
Ammo generators?... maybe, trap camps? Aw hell yeah!
---
Also, I was under the impression that explosive bait got a recent nerf that prevented it from being effective at destroying camps.
---
It's a nice tool, the sliders are a bit too unfriendly tho.
---
Also, dark mode makes websites 100x better(and that's a fact)
---
Yes!! How about the clan leader gets a second camp called a clan camp that starts out with a single box that you can put resources into (think rebuilding atlas but you can donate anything) and then the clan leader can use the resources to build up the clan camp with like workbenches, turrets, and special clan items like a pure donation box or a clan signal beacon (which produces flares that members can through which shows an event for clan members that says ‚Äú-player- needs help!‚Äù.
---
Nah man, I think you‚Äôre on to something!
---
This is not a bug, it is an undocumented gun jam mechanic!
---

---
Valid point, but I don't wanna. I am very careful to log out for any nuke. All I am saying is that you shouldn't take camp damage if the nuke already land.
---
Stay and loot
---
I‚Äôve never had anyone ask me for anything and i‚Äôm 257.
---
I'm lvl 330ish and literally have never had anyone ask me for anything.
---
Youre lucky then
---
Thats great, i hope when i start a family i can do the same
---
PEELS HERE
---
I know not everyone gets asked but when it happens its annoying
---
While you have sludge lung get another disease at the same time worked for me.
---
Same but I also tend to use my private server when doing lengthy farming runs to prevent those types of interactions
---
I've never completed a round of NW so I'm clueless but is the loot box where you get the rewards or do you just mean loot box as in a box where you get items for the round?
---
TANK! TANK!
---
does that change to BEHEMOTH! BEHEEEMOTH!
---
Ever played a L4D round where someone has hacked their player emote sounds to use some of the hidden unused recordings (death rattles, outtakes, etc)?
---
Hail america. Hail the enclave. God bless them
---
For the ENCLAVE
---
In morgantown go to this place called bolton green and there is a little square looking thing and spawn there there should be a few big boxes and behind the hedge there is another and on the roof there should be 2
---
He literally said xbox already
---
This reminds me of people buying Spiritual Shard Crates in Runescape to surpass the 2 billion cap. You nailed it bro, they must be the most expensive item per kg
---
Tempting, considering everyone is saying it kicks butt even when you're not specced for it.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs more I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm gonna do something stupid. Like one hit a legendary and everyone thinks I‚Äôm the a hole. I‚Äôm not that player. I just panic sometimes. The I‚Äôm sorry emote was made for me.
---
Not looking forward to subsequent legendary runs because of this... the struggle is real in all RPGs and battle pass systems LOL
---
I'm never going to financially recover from this!
---
But seriously I don't think this will completely kill the market. Not everyone is 200+ like we are so there will always be a need for ammo as not everyone will immediately max this legendary out right off the bat.
---
Good call! Not a PA user at the moment, but this can definitely come in handy later!  I have a few sets collected just in case and this could help min/max later!
---
Why would we add an adrenal reaction multiplier to it if its included in the damage?
---
Just did the same myself a couple hours ago. Very pleased so far. The significantly increased ammo consumption is *definitely* going to take some getting used to, though.
---
I dunno.  I will go there and check.
---
I'm not sure I understand your question, would you mind to elaborate?
---
Well... Another weapons dupe is *definitely* active with the collectron, I saw 3 of the same BFFR handmade in a collectron. I didn‚Äôt take them - I don‚Äôt want another banning. So maybe more people will want my 5.56 when it‚Äôs made public!
---
Was farming flux and had a lvl 20ish spamming trade and kept getting in my face when I was trying to find the scorched I killed.  Was very annoying. I‚Äôve helped new players in the past. This person was just too much.
---
They made punji walls legacy?
---
Cool I have something old now
---
Might be patched out today, if not it will surely be done soon. And it is dependent on that specific camo paint in the Atom Store. I don't use power armor, but I did this as well as a few other little precautions in case i end up hating my builds after this stupid blanket nerf coming up. Gotta have options!
---
Sounds like you just need a friend. Are you on PC?
---
Hence why I also suggested AA/E/FR, I was using one of those a bit before I traded it to someone and was doing at lease 500 every shot
---
For real?
---
I think they‚Äôll change Atlas regardless if we meet the goal. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll auto complete for the extra stuff like second Meat Week.
---
I don't think making hard working traders and grinders restart their entire game would be the best way to go about anything. 
---
some people have thousands of hours. imagine loading up the game and seeing you're in 76 and go check on the patch notes, "global reset of everything, have fun." that is how you instantly kill a game and have nobody ever come back.
---
Aside from the top of the world flower comment... anybody have anything more concrete?
---
Been wandering southern divide and east of 96 for a bit now... and nothing.  Lots of nice places, just no waterfalls and no stone arch.
---
Would be great if they let us add notations to the map ala breath of the wild.  Would make all their hard work on unmarked landmarks and etc more easy to share.
---
I wonder if they‚Äôll add the backpack mods to PA with the new BOS update. That‚Äôd be really interesting
---
Dude, if they can find some BS reason for the BoS to come back even though at this stage they'd 100% be incapable of such a trek across dangerous territory.
---
They can make some weak excuse as to a few responders coming back and founding a new group. Hell, some settlers from Foundatiom can be found to have backgrounds in emergency services and go on to train new responders.
---
They already have a woman in Flatwoods and one in Charleston. They can already go that direction.
---
Is this PTR or has the legendary perks hit the live servers?
---
They did in the menu lol
---
Stacked blueprinted punji only is legacy. Punji can't stack now
---
See this is why I don‚Äôt prime.
---
I've seen 4  legs at AWOL before, super lucky I guess.
---
Last year when nuking white springs used to be the hot thing, it got bugged after so many nukes on it and everything started to be  a legendary. We knew when all the legendaries started spawning non stop that the server was going to crash about 5-10 mins later LOL
---
Had a buggy server once where there were dozens of level 1 legendary eyebots all over the place.
---
Found the game pass user. Jokes aside, fear not my friend, for lord Toddy Oddy will bestow the almighty ammo factory upon us on the 15th
---
*I should have prefaced, they have already modelled the existing Enclave Vendor, i.e. the MODUS screens, and those already serve to send you to a dedicated vending screen. So in essence the vendor already exists and they simply would need to add that model to player blueprints and rather than connect you to the NPC store it would function like all other player vending.
---
So half-yes. Just like how NPC‚Äôs are occasionally seen with gear that we cant obtain- it does exist its just a matter of moving the model into a usable format and making sure any coding that has to be applied works.
---
nubs on their periods
---
"I have collected... some items for you"
---
I love the long pauses MODUS does.
---
Sorry if I'm being stupid. 
---
At low health the adrenal reaction multiplier and the bloodied multiplier will have already been applied (and maybe some others) so you wont need to add the multipliers using the website posted by OP. Of course this is ignoring the other multipliers, armour piercing (which isnt even shown in damage numbers) or mods but maybe I'm just wrong. Maybe (for bloodied) it's best to go to full health and just add the multipliers using the website to avoid confusion.
---
I don't think so. The models use the fallout 3 designs, and no assultron there.
---
I had to exit and re-enter a world 3 times and try again.  It worked after that, in case this fix never comes.
---
Not really. It really depends on what your build is and what perks would help work towards that. Having more slots doesn't mean you get good value for those slots.
---
Given some of the decent legendary perks that are available, I don't see 6 legendary special perks as being even close to meta. Maybe 1-3. The rest will be the higher tier legend perks.
---
Hrmm... I‚Äôve only killed two so far and it‚Äôs counted both of them toward killing aliens.
---
Though, it‚Äôs bugged on killing the Flatwoods Monster itself. Go figure lol.
---
I randomly had the flora challenge complete itself after being bugged on the ‚Äúswamp flora‚Äù part. Had collected quite a few strangler blooms and it never completed. But randomly did while stocking my vendors yesterday.
---
I don‚Äôt see why people are against them. Certainly not if they intentionally use any other exploit in the game.
---
Gotcha. Though I have to say, even as someone who knows nothing about code, I can tell you, nothing is ever simple. Moving the modus model to a traditional vendor would not be as easy as it seems. Even that is a lot of work.
---
Might mean the original founder of the brotherhood, Roger Maxson
---
Well, I knew it's been a while but since there was no response..
---
He's referring about this:

(this one is one year old, there might be a newer one, I'm not sure)
---
My camp is a raided church in the middle of a swamp. In the bathroom I have a jail for one prisoner
---
It's Roger Maxson.
---
It's a fun little toy üòú
---
A lot of comments about ammo here. I play Junkie Commando and it just doesn't seem like that big a deal to me. Scrap weapons, know what junk gives lead and take a 10 minute trip to Lucky Hole in Excavator armor every week to 10 days. Also ammo machine.
---
You have an infinite supply of ammo which you turn around and sell.
---
That rock arch has a lead and acid (in cave underneath) node and also two silver deposits in the walls. It's a common as fuck build area and you'll get the odd server hop denial. My father in law had a camp there. 
---
Regular molerat attacks too allegedly. He kinda bullshitted a bit though.... 
---
Just so you know incase we are talking about the same place. It's southern Savage Divide.
---
How is that bad? Who tf finds it fun farming for ammo
---
Need a floor on the other side to have the wall snap to, then remove unwanted floor piece. That's how I do mine.
---
I am very hard on player i love shotguns but if a lower level wants to have thier leveling up weapon they can have it
---
Really? This makes me happy asf
---
It might also complain if there's a roof piece it's trying to line up with.
---
Don‚Äôt forget super duper
---
Don't go straight to a new session. Force close the game/application at the Medical Center, restart &amp; run to the terminal and click analyse, then insert the T-fuse; the T-fuse resets in your inventory when relogging.
---
If the above method doesn't work, then attempt to find a friend who has a private server; try it on there.
---
I encountered the same bug, and restarting the game is the solution that worked for me.
---
Oh I don‚Äôt doubt that, and you‚Äôre absolutely right. But the premise it that they have a model, albeit one that would definitely need a small tweak (to add a base), and they have the code to send you to player vending. A modder in theory could whip it together for free, and in Bethesda‚Äôs position, the work is cut out for them more than it was for the donut vendotron- which required new sound files, a whole new model, and even the capability to snap on other parts, which Im sure was a nightmare compared to what they would need to do for a MODUS camp vendor.
---
No i didn't cancel just ended i bought it for only 1 month
---
Getting all sentimental here (*_*)
---
I wish that my mom/dad even would remember how to turn on an electrical device, or their email password! 
---
Lucky Guy!!
---
Honestly, if we're at your camp, we want a place to scrap, a place to stash, or to drop off a bunch of items that we don't need.  Don't fear the loot bags, unless you saw someone die and drop it.  Then it's polite to give them a few minutes to come back for it.
---
That .45 is mine getouttaheeeeere! :)
---
Please read my other replies below im tired of telling everyone the same thing.
---
As an ammo seller I stock 308, 45, 556 and 50. The 45, 556 and 50 I usually make 10k each and the 308 is usually 1.5k - 2k all sell at 1 cap per round. Its quite a lucrative business.
---
Isnt maxon the family name? Couldn't it be any of them.
---
Maybe if this game was a actual survival game where ammo is scarce but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs literally everywhere.
---
Oh, so this is what it's about, I get it now. The point of the website is that you don't know the total damage(with bloodied applied) yet, so you can experiment around with things. 
---
As i've said before, base damage refers to the damage with only mods included. 
---
Besides, using the bloodied damage as base damage messes up calculations.
---
Here's how things are calculated:
---
1. Live: Base(buff1 \*  buff2 \* buff3...)
---
2. PTS: Base(1 + buff1 +  buff2 + buff3...)
---
To clarify, here's an example(pts calculation) with a weapon that has 100 base damage and a 10% buff from a 1\* weapon card and a 50% buff from adrenal reaction. 
---
Calculation 1(with 100 as base): 100(1 + 0.1 + 0.5) = 160 &lt;- Correct!
---
Calculation 2(with 150(adrenal reaction damage) as base): 150(1 + 0.1) = 165 &lt;- WRONG
---
Ammo maker from the Raider camp.  Worth it.
---
I still think it would be great if they create a Wendigo or a Wendigo Colossus wearing a clown costume to go with the mission: kill a Wendigo wearing a clown costume. I went looking for a bit trying to find only to read it again figuring out I needed to wear the costume. 
---
This or have ghouls wearing costumes.
---
I did buy 1 month.Thanks for the info,but i still didn't get them when i bought it.
---
Without a doubt, for the scrap box alone. The survival tent is def a nice touch, but I'm such a "materials" whore, I couldn't function without it. If you ever played ESO, it's identical to the craft bag.
---
Fair enough. And hey, I‚Äôd love to see this. I‚Äôm sure that in the next year, post Steel Dawn, player camps are going to get a lot of content to turn them into faction outposts - you could probably even designate your camp as a certain outpost, and your defenses would attack enemies of the faction such as other players or something.
---
Nope. All part of the fun
---
I think it happens with every automatic weapon that I know of. I was personally hit by this bug while using automatic barreled tesla rifle. It forces a reload at anywhere from 1 to as many as 13 rounds still in the magazine. 
---
Happens more often than not, and my suspicion it's somehow tied to frames per seconds, as I would never have this issue at 60 fps. (I might be completely wrong)
---
Yea they broke it. They also broke another significant quest in the main story involving the settlers.
---
So it's best to go to full health then calculate it with the buffs included?
---
Launch on Karen and Earle nets caps fast.
---
Reading through the list I can really only see Follow Through/Hack and Slash (if you melee) as my "every day carry" apart from what rads in certain circumstances, such as running non PA/hazmat in nuke zones. 
---
The QOL stuff from the other legendary perks just doesn't seem to be worth 5 perk points. What am I missing?
---
Yes, 100%, without a doubt. I've got it on my Excavator right now
---
It's an exploit... One that's easily documented and reported...
---
It's the polar opposite. It's these limits that prevents duping from running rampant.
---
Removing the limit gives dupers limitless chances to secure top tier items (especially future items) that they can then dupe and either sell for real money or flood the in-game market and ruin what is already a pretty unhealthy economy.
---
Oh honey...
---
I‚Äôve been playing a bloody rifleman for over a year.  It‚Äôs gonna be sad to switch, even though commando is still pretty fun.  I likely did my last solo SBQ today, as a little send-off.
---
I‚Äôm gonna try Earle this week, but I expect to die at least once.  The minions are tricky if you bump into one.
---
"Thank You,Member, for contributing an outpost  to  our  little  Enclave."

*Brings up face with blank,glowing eyes and creepy grin*
---
Jup, that's how things are done \^\^
---
Exactly your point, Bughthesda can't write for shit.
---
Can't buy them - they must be found in-game.
---
This guide is brilliant - and easy to memorize.  It has helped me find pretty much everything in the last two weeks.  Just a couple left.

The colpectron 8s referring to the founder of the BoS Roger Maxon. 
---
Arthur Maxon in Fallout 4 is his descendant.
---
Are Children of Atom a thing in FO76? I haven't encountered them if so.
---
I would love the option to join/ally with the Mothman Cultists though.
---
It is. But you‚Äôre the one advocating for using a exploit against this one as if you have some moral ground to stand on. Are they ruining your experience? If not have Nuka cola and move on
---
I have a camp there for the location try looking up lead and acid camp
---
Same! I spend most time at my CAMP, which is a small house I‚Äôve been building since launch
---
It depends on how much you use VATS.  I never really had that problem because I ADS 90% of the time.  Using VATS as a commando feels weird.
---
So it should auto re up.  It takes the money out like 2 days before the atoms hit your account.  But you didn't get any atlms when you first bought it?
---
This is the first perk I plan to max out.
---
Yes, please! I will reroll my flair instantly. 
---
Also, there's no Blue Ridge flair!
---
Advocating would be - "hey guys... When you come across a exploit camp, use explosive bait to destroy it".
---
I was simply asking for people's take on whether doing so would be yay or nay
---
Thats an idea, some new hair dye tints, like gold and silver. Or Hair Ornaments like Curlers, Chopstix, Hairpins, ect.
---
I think he means all the time, instead of having to wait until you generate a new syringe, which by then you‚Äôll most likely be starving/dehydrated
---
I mean it's been twenty years since the walk from Mariposa to LH so it makes sense their base is secure.
---
Well if you want my opinion idgaf I online ever run my ammos on a private server.
---
270 rounds of prime 2mmEC holly shit! i was interested in this before now i want it!
---
Look I don‚Äôt care if you pull a Batman on me afterwards but at least let me help you
---
I really just decorate a cozy home and think about what RNG lottery I feel like pursuing after my daily bullion grind. Lately Ive been chasing after the western chaps but Im sure once people start tackling ACP again next season Ill try and grab the helm or the earle heads for my house.
---
That's about 99% of the CAMPS on PS4 in my experience.
---
Anything will work if you have over 200 dps and over 100 damage buff the shit out of a normal mini gun and have fun.  like others have said don't fuck other people's event up
---
You're not that smart
---
Considering how lackluster the season 2 rewards are compared to season 1, I don't see how they can keep them up. Not unless they revamp the SCORE system and make it less grindy. Because I don't see anything I want to grind for in season 2.
---
They can do alright environment story telling and their lore for Elder Scrolls is interesting but the guys writing the story obviously have little control over the actual game and it SHOWS.
---
Blame the dated engine or just people who suck at game design but their games rarely deliver on the epic setting they take place in. Funny thing is TESO does better in making you believe that you're in this huge fantasy world because it's running on an engine that won't reduce a siege battle to a fight between 10 people in an alley.
---
The problem started in Oblivion though. You can write 100 books about how awesome the Imperial City is but when your engine reduces it to the size of a large village at best it's kind of embarassing.
---
Yea i didn't notice a increase in my atoms once i bought it.
---
Thankyou! 
---
I figured it out. I was doing this on a second floor. And the floor under it was facing the other way, so the top wall was wanting to conform to the bottom wall.
---
So what i did was delete the bottom walls, install top walls to my preferred direction, then do a double wall, and then re-install the bottom walls that were there before.
---
The whole building system is so tedious.
---
There‚Äôs only 1, and it‚Äôs for raiders. Give mirelurk meat to the raiders at Ohio river adventures, Queen mirelurk meat gives you the most rep. Only once a day though. And the first time you go there you can help defend against mirelurks to get some rep but that can‚Äôt be repeated
---
yeah i use the shoty when i go serious mode. But I'm hitting colossus with a junkies gat plasma pretty good it's fun
---
Thanks! When I get home I'll see if I'll still be op.
---
Even if we somehow magically didn't get it, you can't really say you saved up scrip for *nothing*. You'll just get half as much for them as you were hoping.
---
They give bonus XP for you and everyone nearby so I like to pop them before ACP or Line in the Sand etc, usually others in the group will do it as well, the bonus stacks up to +100% I think. Worth using them in groups!
---
Thanks for your contribution, your parents must be proud.
---
Half my daily caps come from selling radaway and diluted stims
---
On pc I haven‚Äôt seen a single good weapon selection yet. Everyone is just selling crappy plans but no actual gear
---
The BoS could make the trip easy with SuVs and Power Armor
---
Honestly I sorta hate beth for it, I want to play but have zero motivation to do so, ended up picking up 2 other games as I wait for dailies n weeklies to return with legit rewards again.
---
Yea...customer support ticket ...sucks
---
Or implement an actual fix, like putting in a system to prevent duping of weapons/armor and by assigning it a unique tag, so if multiple are detected one is deleted, and then raising the max level on weapons so the old ones will become worthless
---
After swapping to commando, I use a b/ffr fixer for hip fire/close and a b/e fixer with a short scope in place of my beloved lever gun.  The b/e is totally controllable for single shots.  The fire rate isn‚Äôt brraaaap like the ffr version.
---
The only thing that‚Äôs annoying is having two fixers (first world problem, I know) and I have to rebind them to favorites every time I log in.
---
The Enclave are the biggest threat to the wasteland. Free States For Life!
---
i thought VATS commando was great bc you can empty your entire mag with half AP left
---
I have stacked punji walls in one of my camps for thing I kept it that way
---
That's why i said they recruited Initiates and Hopefuls along the way. Only originally 5 came from Lost Hills: 1 was KIA by Raiders in Nevada, another took a group of formerly captured Brotherhood personnel back to Lost Hills which left 3 to continue their track east.
---
I used to do this, would mod them out and make them 38 instead of 308 to help with ammo consumption. Unfortunately I stopped after high levels started buying them off my vendor I would list them at 5 caps
---
Has this subreddit downgraded even past all the auto completing challenges posts and people pointing out the same bug for the 1000th time? Now there‚Äôs beggars running rampant l? Seriously I don‚Äôt anybody is going to help you. Not only did you ask for some ammo, you offered absolutely nothing in return. Maybe next time ask for help collecting certain materials for the ammo, or help finding ways tog Er it yourself. Nobody‚Äôs just going to straight up give you ammo, especially not primed ammo
---
Well last time I checked they're joining us in Appalachia, not the other way around.
---
*Fit in and play nice, or I'll take a shit in your helmet.*
---
Yeah the Brotherhood is whack but can we get another BoS ally so we can teach a robot how to love again? ü•∫
---
There are a ton that give you far more utility than extra perks in a lot of cases (maybe not all).
---
* Ammo Factory is a must for any high DPS ballistic build.
---
* Master Infiltrator is 1 legend rank for 6 perk ranks. Less of an issue with PC user with mods but such a massive benefit for console players especially.
---
* The poison and fire resists can be quite important for bloodied builds. Poison especially as that's the one main weakness for them.
---
* Taking one for the team is a straight damage buff for all ranged enemies
---
* PA Reboot is situationally good for bloodied PA users.
---
You wouldn't likely run all of these plus the ones you've already mentioned but you can see that you're very likely not going to go 6 special cause you're giving up too much utility that you can't otherwise get elsewhere.
---
For example, a bloodied commando, you'd take at least 3 (Follow Through, Ammo Factory and Fancy Duds).
---
Maybe it's just me, and to be fair it's still to early as no comparative testing has been done from what I've seen, but I don't see a use case for 30 extra perk slots making your character significantly better than say 5-10 extra perk slots and some of the other legend perks. 
---
Only way that'd change if Bethesda introduces new perk cards in specials that aren't key to meta builds that add that value. We're just not there right now I feel. Happy to be proven wrong though.
---
That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs multiple ranks.
---
I‚Äôm planning to continue to use my melons at camp to top myself off, but I‚Äôll pop a syringe when I‚Äôm in the middle of something and don‚Äôt want to run back to base. As I upgrade, I‚Äôll slowly wean myself off of solid food until I can subsist on the drugs.
---
Some world locations have paper cut outs as props. Southwest of Gulper Lagoon in the mire is a treehouse with some cut-outs of mafioso looking dudes, could be a prop like that that‚Äôs glitched out
---
Who Said i was never gonna give anything in return? Just because i didn‚Äôt type it doesn‚Äôt mean i wasn‚Äôt gonna pay
---
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll just handwave that or just never address it
---
I kill the raiders who talk crap. I kill the settlers like the b*tch that spawns by poseidon reactor and Charleston botstop. Rules of of Appalachia. Talk sh*t get lit.
---
What you said are the only ways. The random encounters is really the only "limitless" way of grinding out faction rep.
---
I‚Äôve had random encounters with both settlers &amp; raiders, who are being attacked by something (usually low level ghouls/scorched). I‚Äôve helped them out/killed whatever it was &amp; received a smidge of rep.
---
Sadly bugfixes don‚Äôt make money or is marketable so not a issue as long as the game works
---
If I remember correctly there is a bed of nails bed that got leaked awhile back.
---
Only when they lock their stuff.
---
Except the crater raiders are the dogs that will bark and won't bite, unless Meg personally makes them to. The Tunnel Snakes were more of raiders than those guys.
---
Both are underwhelming and weak.
---
I think it‚Äôs probably a bug and you lucked out on 80 atoms
---
I make a point to loot unlocked collections lol
---
Analyzing before the fuse worked for me
---
First day I played Wastelanders, I went to Huntersville and went left, through the gate and up the path, hunting for a Legendary Sheepsquatch. I don't remember what I found, but either way I killed it/them. I then went up the hill and saw a scorched, so I killed it from a distance. As I got closer I realized I had killed a human NPC. A settler to boot. Then, another settler walked up to me and said something to the effect of "Thanks for helping us out" and I got Settler reputation for it. Crazy game.
---
Switching team/area is a PITA too. At least on PC.
---
 Press ESC, then Z, the click settings, audio, change area/team/auto setting, tab and tab and tab and tab out. 
---
Fuuuuuuuuuck that.
---
OR they could just fix their system so duping and exploits isn‚Äôt so easy
---
Considering Vault 76 was one of the first to open we all know from previous games what the BoS is all up to.
---
Twice in one week some 'genius' built around a fast travel point. I was trapped and had to FT again to the closes point only to get there and 99% of the time it's not their fault.    
---
Armor falls under "Clothing" as some mental midget at BGS thought would be a good idea. I have a set that has effects that are really good for my char and a few include weight reductions for ammo, food/drink, chems, and another I can't remember.    
---
I'm trying to find a good automatic rifle type weapon for when we all get bent over without lube in this next patch.    
---
Most of the time it's a mix of things. I loathe Bloodied, Unyeilding, and Junkie builds and gear. They're not my playstyle and that is what most people have. It's taken over 2 months to get the gear I need and I'm still lacking. I have been lucky in that our of the 5 mutations, 4 I have found for less than 350 caps each. I was lucky with Marsupial as my first one.    
---
I have an idea for a 76 market but I won't fill this up with that as it's kind of off topic.
---
Raiders don‚Äôt bother me, at least the punk rock softies at Crater.  I‚Äôm not too jazzed about meeting the power mongers and right wing  cultists called the BoS and Enclave, though.
---
Mounted blah blah plans....
---
I assume if they have more than 10 plans that‚Äôs what it is
---
MURICA
---
Might step on Free Ranges toes a bit, but I wouldn't mind a route from Foundation to Atlas Observitory.
---
If you are on PC I run as a responder under the same screen name. If I see a lower level player I always try and give a full set of level appropriate deep pocket armor, fixer, BOS rifle, ammo, stims, and radaway. Had a few low levels not get what I'm trying to do. Most are trying to help give you a leg up.
---
Grinding is good to a point and then it's just a waste of time for very little reward.

I play on PC and sell a selection of 'magic' weapons, as I've heard some people struggle to find them. But nobody ever buys them.
---
I'm not sure if it's because magic weapons are so commonplace that everybody has at least one already, or if people don't actually know enough about them and think that UGL with bash damage is nothing more than just a trash roll, (it's not trash; it shreds the SBQ in 30 seconds flat).
---
Ahh okay. Guess I should have kept it then...
---
It's worth noting that the endurance doesn't actually do anything.
---
Then it‚Äôs not fixed on consoles. It‚Äôs time to quit for good after losing 80% of my overall damage. And no, I‚Äôm not exaggerating. Bloodied hasn‚Äôt just been nerfed, it‚Äôs been completely fucking neutered just like everything else!
---
Thanks alot, I'm literally heading there now
---
They added new challenges with seasons, I think they might have also added new ones with wastelanders, but other than that not really. There are tiered ones that unlock after you finish the previous one (i.e collect 76 wood, 760, 7600). I think the base level of each challenge should be unlocked by the time youre out of the vault though
---
For a couple months now they have been adding a few new challenges every once and awhile.
---
Welcome to the club, search it on google how to fix it, it works for me, its kinda annoying, but hey, it just works.
---
Yea this was how I was gaining that little extra bit of rep
---
Vinny even says that Joanna Mayfield, the boss, is planning a trip to Appalachia, so here's hoping!
---
Cool thanks for the info
---
Funny, I rarely see assbags in this game and when I have they've been single digit levels. Right after game pass or whatever it's called. 
---
Path to Enlightenment. Jumping around like crackhead crickets calling those doing the event and the game it's self various racist and homophobic names and shooting and hitting players.
---
Then after a day or so, back to normal. I guess they get bored easily. Or they figured out this isn't that kind of game? (Is there that kind of game? Where that's just normal crowd and not just "the assholes who play it"?)
---
Server wipes work if it's an established cycle, like game seasons. Rollbacks work if they are done quickly enough. This game has been out for almost two years, it is far too fucked for any of that to be a viable fix. Even ""ban"" waves have proven to be ineffective since even the most blatant cheaters get half their accounts unbanned anyway. I was in that boat for a while but at this point there is nothing left to do but accept that this game is fucked beyond repair and cheaters own it
---
I thought you had to be 13 to create a reddit account.
---
This doesn't work for me for some reason. I get back random ammo that I don't use, like cryo cells and harpoons. Never 2mmEC or shotgun shells, which are what I use.
---
And while we are at it, how about 8 person teams (or being able to form a raid party by combining 2 teams of 4). We already know you can do it given the event teams. Just let us do it manually.
---
I agree but i run from raiders cus i dont wanna kill people. my level 30 character today has zero human deaths on his hands.
---
Grind fatigue.
---
Can relate. I have the SS armor, Gauss Shotty, Gauss Minigun and all the best mods, and am at max gold, max caps, max scrip. First world problems huh?
---
Funny... I think I've had this problem too and could never work it out, lol. And yes but on the same token it feels Sooo good when we can get it to bend to our will, lol.
---
Yeah me too lol...and only started last month.
---
If you just started your base and are able to restart, move your base and then delete the foundation, then move it back. If you‚Äôre too far in to feel comfortable restarting, i‚Äôm so sorry...
---
üòë
---
I've fast traveled to a Camp owned by a teammate, excited by the number of things offered, only to realize it was my own Camp when I got there.
---
Tbh I'm now treating Bethesda like EA now. So fuck em
---
That big ol ostrich leg arm having greasy fuck as done that the last 4 times I've been apart of the event.
---
Did you complete Missing Identity during beta? That was my problem and I ended up having to complete it on my mule account to get it to register as completed.
---
They had a fight arena in Ultima online. Where you could rock up and fight other players without any proper consequences.
---
Ah yes the looks of fo4 and poorly optimised lighting. Nice.
---
Thanks it's cool I was working on blueprints so I think I got em, just seeing if there's a trick to it
---
Yep, I quit logging in after I finished the season early last week.
---
‚ÄúI kill everyone..." Arch raider stuff there my friend
---
The practical combat difference between Excavator and T-65 defense is minimal.  They all have 40-ish% damage reduction as a full suit, which is the bulk of PA defense.  DR is largely irrelevant beyond 350.  Additional rad resist is helpful, but there‚Äôs like 1% difference between 350 DR and 500.  You can probably eat one more bullet in T-65 when all of Westek is shooting at you.
---
Wear the suit that appeals to you most.
---
You're welcome.  
---
If you do Wastelanders again with the other side, make sure to do the three for each side and then cancel before deciding which one to go in with. IDK what the choices are for the gold and who takes a hit from memory but that can add up to more grinding.
---
Elder scrolls Online (also Bethesda) has unlimited money for all and unlimited craft bag for ppl that sub. Also no way to dupe items. The problem is the engine they used for fo76 and they are using the hampster powered cloud servers from Amazon. Neither work well for mmo
---
I'm a plan hoarder, at first it was exciting to see tons and tons of plans I can throw my money at, but now it's wonderful if I find one plan in the four vendors I don't know.
---
And usually it is something like "fasnacht ribbon 01" priced to 30k or something.
---
They aren't Enclave levels of anti-mutant, just maybe Vault City levels, other places can have ghouls, just none in there base (though I could see them not kicking out a BoS member who turns).
---
There's no way they'll be friendly with Radiers
---
The bigger concern is for Ghram though, hopefully he can join Blue Ridge Caravan and not out on his own with his pre-war wares.
---
I definitely don't know enough any them. I have no idea what to buy. But I'm a filthy casual sorry
---
do you think the game really works? If weapons have problems reloading, etc?

We know by the time of Fallout 3 and 4 there is no mention of a chapter of the BoS in Appalachia. They could retcon this in of course and just say they never brought them up but &gt;!we know from the coded messages that the person leading the group coming out here is not exactly the most die hard of BoS members. There‚Äôs some insinuation that she was sent out to die. This combined with knowing they lost members during their trek and have recruited more members from people they met its likely that the BoS we meet will not be the same xenophobic BoS we are use to. At the very least they somehow all die or are otherwise removed from the BoS!&lt;
---
A sweet summer child
---
I hope the BOs looks down on the others. I also hope something happens with he Enclave.
---
This.  There‚Äôs like 6-7 machines at Red Rocket.  Cola for days.
---
I had that happen too
---
That‚Äôs simply not true, run the build yourself. You kill stuff so fast it‚Äôs not a problem. I‚Äôve got over 100k .45 and I barely even craft it. DPS is king.....

The trailer for Wastelanders, I thought for sure I was going to hate the Raiders. Honestly though, the Settlers are the ones who are awfully demanding, for people who weren't here before the Vault opened. And at least when the Raiders send me on a fetch-quest, it's for something they *actually* need, not something they have dozens of. 
---
Plus, I like the way Meg calls me Seven-Six. It's endearing.
---
Baaaaaaaaah.  Seems like i merged two different locations.  I found the arch, but it doesn't have a creek or waterfall.
---
Ok next step, since i really do not want another camp so near a fissure (had one in the mysterious cave location before it was a real location)...
---
New goal lol guys.  I wanna go the waterfall route.  Need the biggest and most waterfallest waterfall that waterfalled in 76.
---
I got a fuck ton of plans all 10-30 caps. That way newer players can get some neat stuff. Thats not always the case though. On more than one occasion I jad a lvl 400something come in buy all my plans and then mark them up huge at his cmap.
---
It‚Äôs been the case since the beginning of these events. It‚Äôs a sad attempt to flush out duped materials. And how do you think they would explain a fail. ‚ÄúYou guys suck‚Äù sorry no reward.....ü§î
---
Personally i only fast travel to those with 7+ weapons, i always find something nice and cheap
---
They could try to fix every bug, then the first bit of new content will come complete with a dozen new and old ones and most of that time was wasted.  Live service games like this are a constant battle of bugs and fixes.  It‚Äôs not just 76.
---
Lol
---
I feel attacked.
---
Please
---
I don't have one, and would buy one if I had a way to access your camp/vendors. I'm also PC
---
I hate players that don't turn off their vending machines so you waste caps to visit them only to find them walled off and inaccessible.

You can repeat the mirelurk defense every time you visit, unless they patched it out in p20-21.  I didn‚Äôt see anything in the patch notes.  You just have to ask the guy how he wound up there, then offer to help.
---
The rep gain is so small that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the trouble, personally.
---
Exactly!! Something where you didn‚Äôt have to worry about loosing your loot and just go at it! That would be cool

I want pumpkins and I want to be able to use them to get seeds. Also cranberry‚Äôs because relish
---
Sure, though ZAX had forces :P MODUS is kind of himself, a bunch of robots, and a handful of vault dwellers that only give as much of a shit about him as needed to launch what nukes they want.
---
And please let them give us a few weeks to enjoy Halloween decorations and events. I hope they start early October.
---
If a lot of enemies are near each other then yes it does
---
They can up the budget cost to compensate?
---
Neh.. not using up my adhesive becuase someone in the game uses a glitch for an advantage. I do however screencapture all the gamertags/camps/workshops I come across... what to do with um? I dunno, If Bethesda aint pushing the subject I aint either... but I wouldnt be suprised if before the next patch or the one after we see another ban wave.
---
I hate when people don't turn them off, I always make sure I disconnect it so it doesn't show on the map and no one gets upset with me
---
I hate when you reload, but you're lagging, so it shows full ammo but when you go to shoot it reloads again. And then it does the same thing. Again. And again. And again.
---
hit me up on instachat or whatever the fuck
---
The reload issue with gatlas is when you have overcharged cores, is my understanding.
---
If you watch your magazine when you fire, you'll notice it goes to 0 then jumps up. So you've technically used your whole magazine..

---
Sometimes I feel like building a store camp on my alt character that has 500lbs of plans alone but I don't have a reason to want caps. If you think they're mostly mounted plans, I only keep 10 of each of those.
---
Where is the arch?
---
Oh boo hoo a nice gesture the builder did doesnt work for your stupid OP build. cry me a river.
---
If you‚Äôre really impatient or really close to ally status, there‚Äôs a few ‚Äúversus‚Äù random encounter spots that you can server hop to grind tiny slivers of rep each time.  Mind you, it‚Äôs a truly unenjoyable grind for almost no reward.  Defend the settlers/raiders, speak to them after the fight and get 1/2 pixel of rep.  Repeat until you feel ill.
---
Off the top of my head, there‚Äôs versus spawns at the rest stop near Ripper Alley, the trestle bridge  just east of Safe N Clean Disposal, and at the tree fort in the middle of the road just north of KMAX Transmission.
---
You can change the pip boy light in your .ini on pc, and it changes the text color on inventory ui as well
---
Haven't checked out the armor yet but just finished setting up the planetarium with the crafting stations in my communist bunker, it's pretty rad, have the other lights on conduit and on a switch so when it's dark you can have just the planetarium going and really see it.
---
Their camp, their choice.
---
Dude, we just spoke about people like you. Read the room/sub.
---
New meta's going to be full health magic damage.
---
I just use the normal one and change it to collect what the raider one would via the terminal.
---
His love of scrap is heart warming
---
I respec'ed from  commando to rifleman thinking I'd save ammo. The difference is negligible. But the convenience is awesome. Vats with a full auto rifle is like a laser beam of dps. And its easier on the fingers too lol
---
Stay n' loot
---
Wait. Maybe I'm understanding this wrong. Can legendary perk cards be unequipped? I meant this as a "carry" build - as in going out and about killing stuff.
---
Just like I would unequip ammosmith as soon as i exit camp, I would presumably unequip Ammo Factory? Or is that not possible?
---
Bethesda releasing content before they are ready.
---
SHUDDER.

Woah! Calm down on the emojis there bud

---
If anyone is looking for a group to join im part of a brotherhood of steel group on Discord thats looking for more members to role play
---
No, your caps are worthless anyway go somewhere else
---
Yeah a few times but hes either come back out or we managed to kill him with vats. I try to cripple his legs every chance so he moves less.
---
They will just have to patch stuff anyway so let us start already I say
---
I am so sick of people begging in this game.  FFS - earn it.
---
Ok
---
Yes but it costs you 1 perk coin per swap so it's not something that you're going to want to swap out a lot, at least until you maxed out all your legend cards.
---
Imagine unironically thinking the settlers are the good guys.
---
I went for psycho and alcohol, so I could just mainline psychobuff and vodka in V94.  It still works with Earle, SBQ or wherever.
---
Mentats is good for various skill checks, bartering and xp gain.
---
I also did Mex-X because -10dr doesn‚Äôt mean anything when you wear power armor.  The last one was daytripper, because the penalties were similarly unimportant to me.
---
Yeah I couldn't even find him with vats :( that was my first instinct
---
I always have mine in some corner of my workshop with switch on it. I hate the sound so I'd don't like it running 24/7.
---
It wont be after the update (no more one hurtig everything yay)
---
I know it's annoying and wrong but all I can say is, with this event, plan to fail from the outset and at least if it all works you'll be happily surprised.  I've had about 30% crash / bugged / can't respawn rate so far..
---
Apparently that‚Äôs fixed.
---
Yes. Please. Needed not just wanted.
---
Yeah from what I read here, I attributed the bug to playing nw. Since I never play nw, I ignored the possibility and never experienced a problem.
---
I did notice the new day‚Äôs challenges have checkmarks next to them where at first glance it appears as if they are already completed, but they can be completed normally.
---
Damn! You stole my line!
---
I was gonna say My vending, My choice! üòÇ üòÇ
---
You assume they won't be frantically just banging out code to make the thing work at all, until lunchtime on release day xD
---
North of lake eloise.  Way too close to the fissure for my comfort.  Not in the mood to waste resources on turrets nor repeatedly repairing stuff.
---
The entire Brotherhood took heavy loses moving from Mariposa to Lost Hills. Power Armour makes you more threatening but not invincible which is something they discovered when fighting against the Vipers. Not to say a single soldier couldn't take down a lot of hostiles before dying but definitely not enough to make a cross-country trip safe.
---
Not to mention Lost Hills didn't have vehicular methods of transportation. They didn't exactly have a garage outside of Lost Hills. I always imagined that road vehicles due to their need for fuel would involve far more resources than having a suits of PA which as long as you kept maintained, they did use Airships but they seemed to be a heavy resource investment and again that wasn't the priority of the Brotherhood at the time of 76.
---
Ah.. thats the part I am missing. I wondered why some players talked about having ammo factory on one character only. That would make sense.
---
Base probably, surrounding area? unlikely.
---
Let me point you to fallout 2
---
Ah cool.
---
How about a Thriller dance, like the robot and mothman ones?
---
If I have to help capture Mad Dog Malone one more time...  at least it‚Äôs an easy get. 
---
Fly Swatter is easy. 
---
But mixing in a few new events or Dailies...
---
I‚Äôve been playing a junkie heavy gunner alt for about a year, and just got a v/e/90 50cal from a Gutsy at AWOL.  I never got into vampire weapons before, but it really is a nice little tool for taking pylons and doing all the heavy lifting at Encryptid, ACP and things like that.
---
I think the Venn diagram of players who don't know how bloodied works, and players who use Reddit, probably looks like this    O     O
---
As person who is level 50 taking this perk is like a no brainer. It frees up time and resources.
---
Treat it like a minigame. "Here's a new camp, now can I make it to the vending machines without stepping on a punji board or getting too close to a rad shower."
---
Totally agree!
---
It's under walls
---
The door you speak of is label as a wall
---
The Ounce of Prevention is still blocking my ability to move forward in the game. Im still having a bug problem with the analyzing the blood sample.
---
The door is in the walls tab.
---
I thought both would apply to the base amount, but Ammosmith is applied to the Ammo Factory count. Yikes lol.
---
Oh man, I would love to see him join up with Blue Ridge!
---
I could image wars between clans, and complaint blogs that hacked weapons take their whole group down in seconds.
---
Follow Through is a hell of a boss killer perk for commandos.  That one is must have.
---
The rest I‚Äôll likely put into stats and probably the fire resistance card once I finish up a Thorn suit.
---
I‚Äôd rank up the ammosmith and lockpick cards if I could swap them on the fly.  As it is now, I can live without them.  20k lead should last a long time and I do silo runs in 15 min without shortcuts anyways.
---
All the time, btw what's the deal with people pricing a mutation serum for 9998 caps, or a nocturnal bone club for 7000 caps, it's like they don't even want to sell it or think someone will be stupid enough to buy it for that price
---
I have a similar idea: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gzlqbj/horde\_beacon\_request/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gzlqbj/horde_beacon_request/)
---
Cool, but kinda dead set on having a waterfall lol.
---
Gonna be my first halloween in fo76 so i'll take whatever i can get. . . And then keep it up for the rest of the year
---
I'm new ish as well and from what I've seen, while looking for a weapon to use for scrip, i think its much better to go for 2\*. The minor effects are nice but not necessary when you're starting out and just looking for a good weapon to use. I plan on going for 3\*s once scrip becomes common enough for me. Most high level players are constantly selling legendaries because they're always at max scrip. I think at that level is when going for 3\*s will be most useful. Too expensive when you're still struggling to get scrip.
---
Oh I‚Äôm sure they will. But at least let us start playing the new content
---
My camp my choice where i ppace my stuff
---
Ooooo shit there is one spot I know where there is a cave under a water fall in the mire could that be it
---
I‚Äôm on ps and have barely seen any one with a mic
---
Glitches more like features
---
The game works
---
If V94 ever reopens as a raid, Funky Duds is absolutely must have.  Legendary mirelurks do unreal amounts of poison damage.  Even legendary stingwings and radscorpion can be dangerous.
---
I did that on purpose , theres also a switch to turn it off at my camp though. But if i wanna be a troll i just turn it on while they are inside üòÇüòÇ
---
Maxon is the last name
---
As someone who is 338, I live in constant fear of PvP. I‚Äôm used to Gta levels of bs but when there‚Äôs a gun that tracks players. i‚Äôm out
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs it south west of foundation
---
Same with me. Tried Earle a few times and nothing. Even after a group came in. His health didn‚Äôt move at all. I haven‚Äôt tried it since. It‚Äôs just too hard
---
If you do it a lot, it still only takes like 15 minutes to blast through a silo without glitching or unlocking a single thing.  Free lockpicking/hacking just isn‚Äôt worth the slot unless something like V94 comes back around.  In that case, it would save a ton of time.
---
Did that today :(
---
Been there since beta didn't knew about this Respects to you
---
I don't know, there are a lot of folks (myself included) who really want a MODUS terminal or collectron at our CAMPs.  "Welcome home, Member. I have collected some...items for you."
---
Yes to all. Except " add lots more health ", hate bullet sponges. Rather add more enemy tipes. With different strengths and weaknesses, different tactics, one enemy tipe can be a tank with lots more health. Make them more engaging, the fights more tactical.
---
I use ultracite every time and only switch to x01 for events that require to enter into irradiation zones, such as SBQ and ACP
---
That's a nope.  And screw that mire waterfall.  90% of my search results have pointed back to it... but it isn't it.  This was either forest or savage divide region, similar enough to the arch location for my brain to have made them the same place.
---
It was a decently tall waterfall and not huge, but decent sized pool underneath.  Big enough there was a prebuilt mini dock at it i think.
---
The white springs has a nuka cola vendor
---
I thought i was just absent mindedly reloading too soon this whole time
---
The wild goose chase begins anew.  Will be back with my findings.
---
For Gauss Pistol Mod, shouldn't it be Drum Magazine instead of  **Gauss Pistol Drum Barrel** ?
---
Look up a video on power armor locations and just go to those locations. If there is nothing there than switch servers and try again
---
It sounds like where I have my camp now but there is no natural bridges threw there that I have seen.
---
Ah, I skipped that one, figured 76 gives me the best it had to offer and then some, haven't been wrong so far. Are all the plants the same? Or just the farmable list?
---
There's always been a broken ProSnap camera as a junk item, even in Fallout 4. The one you craft into a usable camera is the broken ProSnap Deluxe, which is still a weightless misc item. I think I'm up to 150 in my inventory now :P
---
This.  I use a purple light to give everything a creepy vibe
---
Silly question, but is this mainly switching to automatic receiver on my junkie's handmade, or is there more to it that I am missing.    Obviously swapping rifleman cards to commando cards.
---
This is a fine summary of the entire story of FO76. And every time I see it I can't help but facepalm at the enormous stupidity of the Raiders led by David. How David, that dumb shortsighted cunt, managed to be a CEO of anything, let alone Arktos, is beyond me. Dude's entire contribution to post-War Applachia was to live out his Bonnie and Clyde fantasies with Rose, blow up a dam and flood the Responders and just be a general nuisance and a dumb cunt the entire time until the plague got him.
---
Oh no.  You missed the part where i found the natural bridge and it was another location i merged with the waterfall one.
---
JFC I better get a Tenderizer plan this time!
---
I have a crummy bloody/block/block version and was hitting lvl 100 mole rats for 500-700 damage.  no melee perks or mutations, just 16 str from uny armor.  
---
My b/e lever gun turned into a Red Ryder with a leaky gasket on the PTS, but my unspecced shishkebab was wrecking things.  Go figure.
---
Alright so looks like i got some quests to finish.
---
Are you not carrying toxic goo? It's really not a big deal to rad up.
---
Yes after hearing all these responses I'm thinking definite for Follow Through on all 5 of my characters (i don't run any melee), then a heavy leaning on Special point upgrades. I think it's a must for any range build, especially since single shot builds are already not great, and by the sounds of it will suffer even more.
---
I can see more perk points really benefitting builds like my heavy or pistol, especially the latter since it's underclassed.
---
Might even make berserkers fun since I'll have lots of points to make the character more robust!
---
Have you finished the main quests?
---
I do enjoy it I have a strange love for it even though it crashes on me daily lmao
---
It screws over lower level players running mutations as well. Starched Genes doesn't unlock until level 30 or so.
---
It was a punishment even before this moronic point system, now you're just double fucked.
---
Sorry I'm work and only half reading.  I'm trying to help ya out I base all my camps around water.  I know if you follow stream from alpha up hill there is some real nice spots and if you go all the way down south to the edge of map there is some real nice water filled canyons
---
Commando from day 1 and since fallout 4 ooh rah!
---
No not yet. I have a full set of power armor already do I get good plans and pieces from main quest?
---
No, I dont think I will..
---
I feel exactly the same way. I like their camp &amp; their fetch quests are more enjoyable for me. I'm still gaining rep with both sides, but ultimately I will choose Raiders.
---
Only Bethesda BOS is racist. Pre-Beth they were just isolationist.
---
This.  I forget to plug my headset in all the time and it's like"Fuck it I just wont have a Mic" bexause I dont feel like restarting the game
---
I also received one from the fly swatter event
---
I hadn't known when I wrote the comment that it costs a perk coin to swap legendary perks. Unless speed lock picking multiple things in a row is going to be common in fo76, this perk is a no go for me.
---
You may have to suck it up and store everything you can and pack up camp. It does suck but it gets easier..
---
Idk I don‚Äôt remember too much of the main quest but I know you get plans for x01 at whitespring bunker you can find plans by killing scorchbeast queens and vendors
---
If you go to fraternity row in Morgantown, there's a frat house where in one room you can find about 6 or 7 free nukacolas, rare ones too.
---
nope. Bethesda is trying fix the problem.
---
Is there a reason to turn off the machines or lock them behind doors? I'm honestly always really confused when I want to buy something from someone but can't because they locked their machines up. Like, don't take my money, I guess? Am I missing something about the mechanics of the game?
---
Good point, theres no way they arent going to try for that bunker full of weapons and supplies.
---
Love it. Most camps built vertically are just a big block to make a tower. Nice to have a view and the high ground
---
Follow Through adds some damage, but don‚Äôt expect to deal a wimpy first shot and them obliterate anything in your way.  Single shot weapons are still hot trash even with the perk active.  Rifleman of any kind is done unless BGS dramatically buffs hardened receivers or base damage on hunting and lever rifles.
---
If I remember correctly, it only applies to stealth hits, so I don‚Äôt know how viable it would be with heavy guns.
---
I manly leveled \\ played as combat rifle \\ rifleman till the last patch. At which point I split up things to add heavy weapon and power armor. I'm sure my build would make peeps cringe, but it is pretty fun and I can safely say I am not dragging down the team in an event. I also rarely have to scrounge for ammo.
---
short scope works ok, you can get some really low vats cost with reflex sight and some other mods cant drop guns to zero vats cost anymore irc.
---
Hmmm.  Gonna try and head up the alpha stream.  The south edge while nice, is not what i'm looking for.  Unless i missed it lol.  Right now following up a sw of foundation lead.
---
It's more that my wifi is so slow I arrive when a camp is still loading up so I can see certain details first
---
That's some nice flame traps you have hidden there.
---
Yes. Option to be on a private server, which is everything!
---
Tent you can place anywhere you travel..or leave it somewhere as a fast travel point... Scrap box at your camp, uncontested workshops &amp; in your tent... Atoms added to your account each month... 
---
It's worth it.
---
Literally nothing, except Earl I think
---
They closed that fissure permanently.  No scorched or scorch beasts spawn there.  You will however have a problem getting your camp to spawn because it's a super popular camp spot due to a lead and an acid resource within the same camp radius.
---
This would be a haiku
---
Of changes since that time but
---
What, you didn't enjoy your double points and extra challenges that also auto complete?
---
He got stuck in the ceiling twice with me, with just a partial limb exposed. Near the area where you drop down from. One of the times I was melee and the other guy a heavy gunner, only could get him down half health, I had to jump swipe heal. üôÉ
---
Im a game pass player and I play the game the way it's intended, I help people and I love giving new players helpful gear and stuff. And I don't even use my mic. I deal with sometimes high double digits but usually triple digit level trolls and have never seen a single digit player doing anything except the beginning quests usually around wayward or flatwoods, areas like that. High levels seem to just get bored and the only way they enjoy the game is by ruining other people's experiences. I am around level 80 now and have decent enough weapons and a decent build to where I can usually hold my own now. But when there is a group, I just hope they go away, because theyll shoot me while I'm fighting mobs and then run in front of me so they can all just delete me from existence. Every trap base I've encountered has been a high level players base. These are toxic people who play far more than 1 day and then quit, they are almost always in a server and you just hope you don't end up in the same server. I still remember capping my first ever workshop around level 10 and a level 200+ fast traveled to it just to 1 hit KO me with a claw weapon and then start laughing and telling me how shit I was lol. I've never had a bad experience with a noob, is always been the high levels and they just have nothing better to do.
---
Nuking the mono mine guarantees a wendigo colossus spawn event, plus score.
---
There‚Äôs a little rhythm you can find to make the vats shot hit almost every time
---
I was one of those who beat the game a few months after launch and came back for wastelanders, so missed Vault 94. 
---
Is it possible to sneak in V94? I know it was also before non PA jetpacks so I wonder if a stealthy character can just avoid them?
---
But yeah for sure, especially if Beth introduces more poison enemies. Come to think of it, one of Earle's attacks is a poison pool? So maybe a trend to come.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm with you on the curiosity fancy, only thing that comes to mind is maybe they‚Äôve reached caps limit?
---
I feel that way going to any camp. When you server hop for an hour trying to find things that are useful as your just below the cap limit I don't see how you cannot immediately regret it. Worst part of the game above everything.
---
This a reference to that one Zombie Army Trilogy promotion?
---
If you do the brotherhood of steel quest to get into the old leaders room you get a full set of ultracite power armour for free
---
If you join the enclave you can craft X0-1 
---
Or you could just find random T60 parts in the wild, my heavy gunner has full sets of everything up to T60 and they aren't even level 40 yet
---
Wait, I'm not familiar with"demanding something" in fo76...how would that even work?
---
Just reached 100 today/yesterday on the 7th and when I was putting in the planetarium lamp it rotates has a blue light but no projection and I also noticed that the Captain cosmos game board does glitch into the wall and also behind wallpaper on Xbox One not sure if it has any issues on PS4 or PC ü§î
---
I think that the life or damage of the creature will arrange depending of whom attacks it and the loot dropped will be avoided to ur level, imagine a scorched that will drop 30 of x ammo instead of 3
---
It's been an issue for about a month. I seem to remember someone posting a potential workaround but I can't remember what it was. Try searching the subreddit for the quest and see if anyone else has posted anything.
---
The level 10 will see that enemy as level 10, basically what Anthem had on release 
---
If it's like anthem low level players might even be able to do more damage than you can
---
Ah got you, so for heavy guns the equivalent would be Taking One for the Team for the same percentage bonus. My bad. Am trying to learn these perks but am console peasant starved of PTS
---
At the beginning you would be lucky if u could play 3 hours max lol
---
I think card swapping will be a non-issue for characters at lvl 1000+, but the decision to make it cost a point is confounding to me.
---
At launch, the card system was designed to allow players versatility and freedom on the fly, but it seems they‚Äôve walked that idea back completely by requiring excess cards to be scrapped and charging for legendary perk swaps.  Until you get to four digit levels, you‚Äôre kinda locked in to what you choose to save.  God forbid you didn‚Äôt pre-plan your build with 3rd party help or switched to a different build entirely at level 200.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_ProSnap_camera this has always been there as junk
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_ProSnap_Deluxe_camera this is the one that shows up as misc and is to make a new one.
---
Well, I've had it since it released, with no issues. But maybe I just got lucky.
---
Actually don't. Most of those videos have outdated info. Nowadays you have to go the a high level area like Cranberry Bog and The Mire to get max level PA.
---
Things use to work differently prior to Wastelanders where it just scaled to your level anywhere.
---
I really like this idea. They BADLY need something to mark items so they don't even show up while at vendors. Lost or had to buy back things at 1000x the cost because of not being able to. If there wasn't lag and the selection box didn't randomly move to a different spot every time we sell it wouldn't be so bad. I've renamed like other people suggest and it helps. But it still doesn't help when you accidentally sell or even scrap(Rare junk finds you want to display back in camp) Angry face for my humiliating memory.
---
How is Bethesda even allowing this buff, that's insane, and I'm not complaining üòè
---
This would be the best. I hate the voice of protectrons and I fuckin love MODUS so I would actually pay Bethesda real money for once and get it immediately instead of what I always do when I want something from atom store and just grind the atoms or miss out
---
Yes everything you don‚Äôt claim is gone
---
" patch 22 giving energy weaps the shaft " How so? I know bloodied is
---
 getting hit hard but energy weapons? They need buffing not nerfing, what's going on?
---
Ah, fellow membur' of culture I see.
---
Buy the serum plans. Those will ensure you always have money.
---
Good luck.
---
I hide mine if I'm about to hit max caps, but that's it
---
That's exactly why I do it
---
You can't get more than 30k caps. So if you're close to that limit and someone buy your stuff you lose all caps above 30k
---
Yes. The board will completely disappear. Claim it now before you don't have an option
---
The joys of out dpsing legendary weapons with a level 1 defender rifle.
---
Weird how all reports of this 'collectron dupe' appear with the collectron unlocked. I wonder if that has any significance... 
---
Anyways fuck dupers lol
---
&gt;It's worth noting that you're perfectly safe in a workshop so long as you don't contest it.
---
In a workshop you haven't claimed yourself, anyway. 
---
I've been oneshot the same moment the contest notification popped up on my screen too many times...
---
That's exactly why I didn't buy it as much as I wanted too everyone was saying it was awful back then. But I saw it on game pass a month ago or so and now I'm hooked lol I literally have only been playing 76 and New Vegas
---
lol it's always fun to run into them. Meanwhile they are running around in a game treating people like assholes. That about sums up today's world.
---
Oh shoot ok lol
---
Yes this needs fixed and is super annoying. Or give us a way to combine cores together at least.
---
Idk guess I‚Äôm just lucky I was able to get a full lvl 50 suit for doing those methods
---
"Low Level" keeps going up and up, now it's like under level 300 isn't it :)
---
So if Super Duper activates that's 1170 per craft, potentially. Fucking insane! I love it.
---
You get used to it
---
The conspiracy theorist in me says: Bethesda has figured out a way to sell perk cards in a way that wont make the playerbase rage.
---
Come next update, it starts burning the playerbases' perk cards, and already has a Score mechanism that rewards more of them, and players can purchase them *now* for Atoms. Same applies to lunchboxes.
---
I used to be Vats Stealth rifleman and I switched to Commando, and you‚Äôre doing basically the same amount of damage for a faster fire rate. 
---
My advice to all rifleman builds: Make the switch to commando
---
I minded my own business when I started FO76 at the start of this July. And I still mind my own business now that I'm over level 400 2 months later. I collaborate with public groups for the stats while solo and for public events, but that's about it.
---
Yes, you could sneak, but you had to have very good gear and full investment in stealth, not to mention some gaming skills.  The vault is generally very cramped, so a lot of fighting took place in narrow hallways and phone booth sized rooms.  You‚Äôre also fighting a tight time crunch, so there was no time to waste.
---
I guess you could jet pack across a few larger rooms, but you‚Äôre never more than 5-6 yards from an enemy at any time.  Looking back, it was 10x harder to solo a standard Dead in the Water run than it is to solo Earle, just because of time crunch and the need to remember and accomplish a variety of tasks while killing or incapacitating a swarm of high level enemies.
---
It should be about a new enemy faction that invades the map.
---
Just hit up that hoe bubbles. With a name like that she gotta be freaky
---
I feel glad for not getting anthem
---
It's absolutely understandable. Especially if you're not used to online games in general. Hell, it's relatable, even - I'm 197 and I still prefer to stay away from others, regardless of their level, even. Although I'd suppose most are just minding their own business, same as I. 
---
I put a great deal of the blame on the lack of text chat.
---
So is the lore that MODUS is like skynet but was stopped in time?
---
Took me forever the first one. I've gotten about one pie for every 100 levels. The first little devil has been on display ever since
---
Server stability
---
It's used to keep you in game as much as possible grinding for it for ever and ever DONT PRIME YOUR WEAPONS you will regret it
---
I feel like we should have a great big megathread stickied at the top of the sub: "issues present since forever and asked about / to be changed ten billion and thirteen times to no avail". This would probably make the top ten.
---
RIP lmao
---
They have added new challenges over the last few months. Undoubtedly to make up for loss of atoms from the legendary run. It‚Äôs not a bu.
---
First nuke for ACP. As long as the nuke field is still on the map, the second nuke at the queen will trigger both ACP and the queen.
---
Yeah but the challenges they added, award score, not atoms
---
Yeah, Taking One is the non-stealth equivalent.
---
I‚Äôm sure someone will figure out how to double dip perks for unintended benefit, maybe even starting with a stealth hit on a boss, intentionally getting hit and downed, then stacking Follow Thru, Taking One and Revenant, with an extra 25% sneak attack multiplier with the Sandman/CovOp trick to bring it into the realm of absurdity.
---
Microwave? I thought they're working on the fridge port now. With plans for an iWatch version after that.
---
What's your ign? Asking for a friend &gt;\_&gt;
---
LOLOL
---
Its a bug. If you nuke ACP and fight earle you use the next nuke and hit FSP. As long as the mine is still in a nuke zone the nuke on FSP will trigger both boses.
---
Kill earle before queen. She will stay up the whole 30 minutes but ACP will disappear after a few minutes.
---
Ive joined a few teams that do 3 earles and 2 queens per server.
---
So basically like zombies from COD? In that case I‚Äôm in
---
Oh I know its not that bad, was just a joke.
---
Also..dps only matters if you cant instantly kill the target. My lever action does 3300 to the head (non crit)
---
Now I dont know how that'll play out with update 22 but we shall see.
---
All I know is right now, nothing but an sb, sbq, mirelurk queen, Earle, and a behemoth survived the first shot.
---
They are atom challenges. Similar to the collect 7600 wood, get all 23 diseases, etc. they are found in the challenge area from the in game menu and are scattered between social, world, etc.
---
Im still waiting for the X02 skin :/
---
You on pc or console
---
Easy rule: If its a great camp, i buy something. Anything. If its a lowbie camp, i leave something and am on my way again.
---
I guess they skipped me, I don‚Äôt have any new challenges that pay atoms. Doesn‚Äôt surprise me. Oh well
---
Fatman's are wayyyy too weak. Explosive ammo on almost any gun is 100x better.
---
I run a full medics build in power armor. Have all the team related perks and share mysterious saviour to help team mates that get downed. I usually run it with a heavy vampires effect weapon as my endurance is pretty low and still wanna make sure that the team medic doesn't drop during a fight
---
Thanks for your feedback! Can you tell me why sliders are unfriendly? I thought it would be a good solution. Do you use smartphone or pc?
---
Oh yeah forgot about dark mode, I'll add it!
---
Energy ammo amounts? It'd be very appreciated by console plebs like me
---
They were anti-super mutant even before. Feral ghouls weren't even a thing before Bethesda, so they never had any strong feelings about raspy voiced decaying grandpas. 
---
The entire story of Marcus (the super mutant) was him fighting one on one with a Brotherhood paladin in the middle of the desert to a stalemate, until they got so tired and bored that they ended up becoming inseparable best friends.
---
You could also put a God Hates Fags sign on your food truck and see how much business it brings.
---
Yes, overly dramatic, but if you want business don‚Äôt drive away potential customers.  I‚Äôm not going to browse if I have to drink 30 gallons of toxic water to get back to normal afterwards.
---
Thats a good one.
---
I did this. Had to reset.
---
Lmfao I have the confetti gun
---
Try talking to ward.
---
Someone steals a medical scanner, because their family need urgent medical attention.
---
You cant talk them out of it, because their family will die without it.
---
You end up having to kill them to get it back (and their family will now die because of this).
---
Take it back to Ward - it must be vitality important right?
---
"Yeah we've never needed it, and thats the spare one anyway"
---
Settlers have you murder deperate people in order to keep their stock levels correct. Raiders build communication lines.
---
Is it also funny when someone calls you a food build, or trolls you right back with explosive bait?
---
There‚Äôs no reason to mess with the way someone plays the game, especially if you‚Äôre hoping they‚Äôll buy your stuff.
---
But damn, people complaining are so boring, right? Like those who protest IRL. Right? 
---
But you get it's annoying but damn.
---
Sometimes it reloads instantly if I swap weapons and back.   When that happens, sometimes it reloads with maximum capacity as though I had a double size core.  Sometimes, it reloads with an existing core.  Sometimes it uses a core from my inventory and sometimes it gets one from thin air.  Sometimes it puts another core in my inventory with as many rounds left as it seemed to have when it decided it was empty.
---
I don't see the issue, this is 1/10 on the #BethesdaBugScale xD
---
Almost every CAMP
---
I was playing with one of my friends and he told me ‚ÄúThis guy is really f*cking selling Bowie knifes for 30k.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt believe him so went to his camp (this guy was in the Cranberry big at the bottom middle to the left of fissure site prime. I look in the vending machine and this dude was selling everything for 30k and the knifes were 1*
---
What are the dailies inbetween the seasons?
---
Collect them all it‚Äôs fun to change them and gives more content modding them all üòÇ
---
If it's a maze to get to your vending machine...i won't even bother. I'll take my caps somewhere else.
---
I don't think there will be any issue with Foundation and the raiders are shoot on sight targets anyways.
---
I mostly sell .308, 5.56, .50, 5mm, 2mm EC, Cryo, Fuel, Gamma Rounds, and Plasma Cartridges. Most other ammo types just don't move quickly enough to bother stocking with a limited inventory. If space isn't an issue, .45 and shells will also occassionally sell.
---
Right there with you, just haven't had a huge reason to play since finishing the season a fortnight ago, it's been real slim pickings on the vendor front too, since a lot of the regulars I see around are probably sitting in the same boat.
---
Hope we get some old pre-wastelanders dailies again for this next week inbetween the seasons.
---
I wonder why
---
That‚Äôs like choosing between constipation and diarrhea.  You don‚Äôt want either.
---
Idk by my camp there‚Äôs a random raider encounter that happens all the time. If they are nice I leave em be but if not I kill em
---
Wendigo mission is a constant now. 
---
Other than that, it's still boring as shit.
---
I think he meant to use them to tag the enemies, not kill them
---
Run like hell, I usually let others loot the box rather not die.
---
Yeah, people complaining about something you don't suffer is so boring, right? Just like protests IRL, right? 
---
I mean I get it. But damn.
---
They did multiple times, in the menu, in the newsletter and Zorbo's spaceship follows the season time.
---
You are correct they have to be found in game.
---
Vats is mostly used in stealth commando because it let's you use vats criticals so MORE DAMAGE.
---
You almost had a point till you compared yourself to BLM or a group suffering something real
---
It depends on the depth of water. When the water is deep enough to fully submerge your character under, you should be able to grab them. I've found if the water is too shallow, I can't grab them. So, unfortunately, I think you'll have to reset.
---
Even for that it's not great. There's a little more delay shooting that than with explosive ammo. You have to get your timing down, especially if there are people killing them before they hit the ground (which happens all the time on PC). It's stupid hard to get any tags when they're doing that. I don't really have any good explosive ammo weapons that I care to use for that event so I usually just stand under them when they drop and hope my Mr Handy Buzz Blade gets a few tags.
---
Well I think I did something right
---
There‚Äôs no much story to it, the Fatman is a great tagging weapon when enemies are grouped. I have a two shot variant that I use on the LITS glitch, the wendigos on ACP (when they are grouped up), and sometimes on SBQ when she spawns all the mobs under her. If you want a weapon to quickly tag a group of enemies and guarantee the loot and XP then the fatman helps
---
You kill them both because the Enclave are the only way forward!
---
Long live the Enclave!
---
It's weird you think they'd test these things out on trial servers or something before unleashing it on the public.
---
LONG LIVE THE ENCLAVE!!!
---
Aren‚Äôt the Enclave basically the puppet masters of the former US govt?  I‚Äôm no Fallout lore historian, but they‚Äôve always felt decidedly nefarious and reptilian in all the games.  I don‚Äôt understand the attraction to admire or affiliate with that.
---
The  behaviour isn't confined to Earle and the SBQ - I've seen it in normal open world fights as well. And it seems to be even weirder than that:
---
If the mob is aggroed and you are in \[Caution\], you do NOT do stealth damage, although the damage floaters show stealth numbers and you should logically do stealth damage.
---
If the mob is aggroed and you are \[Hidden\], you actually DO stealth damage.
---
Which I think argues that this might be a bug. But even if it isn't and the damage nerf is intentional, they should still fix the client so it displays the correct damage numbers.
---
I've noticed that as well there. I tend to use about 6 of the green barricades to keep them all in, and some missile turrets on a switch if I'm feeling lazy. Beware of radscorpion waves though, if they get underground it becomes a painfully long game of hide and seek. 
---
A useful tip too: throw some concrete ramp foundations up behind the fusion core generator. They'll block line of sight from any ranged mobs that spawn at the little shack through the woods and save you the odd headache.
---
You will be getting an explosive gift from my friend the Kovak-Muldoon very soon.
---
Though they may just be because of the nukes going off. After all, if the nukes are causing the NW pyroclastic storms, I have a feeling that those will be the death of Appalachia eventually.
---
You find flux in nuke zones. Different areas will usually have different flux
---
Yeah I‚Äôm shocked that season 2 has less than season 1 also no bonuses for being a fallout 1st member which I‚Äôm legit only paying for for the scrap box.
---
The only thing I really want, which is something I‚Äôve wanted for ages is the greenhouse set (glass windows/roofing) which is a 99 unlock so I‚Äôve got a grind ahead of me unfortunately.
---
My level 110 character has 0 human deaths on her hands. It depends on what you call a "Human".
---
how was this glitch triggered? got it to work once but then it just stopped working for me on xbox. 
---
Usually use an explosive gun to tag everything in a couple rounds before people grenade them.
---
Nuke zones are where it‚Äôs at. Best ones for farming materials (I think) are the Whitesprings and Monongah Mine. Any place with lots of flora to get mutated
---
Nuked zones carry flux off of plants. You'll need to partake in scorch beast queen fights or Colossus fights to get stable flux. Crafting stable flux is a nightmare.
---
That‚Äôs definitely not something a creep would say.
---
I'm not in the PTS and haven't seen the new configuration yet, but based dataminer reports, almost all bonus damage modifiers have been changed to be additive. The exceptions are the sneak attack bonus and critical hit bonus. Every negative debuff is still multiplicative, I presume, because two -50% debuff would make you deal 0 damage.
---
The ‚Äúlittle delay‚Äù with the fatman is just 1 or 2 seconds depending on your range, and atleast that little delay is enough to guarantee a tag on every single creature because the mini nuke have a bigger AoE range while explosive ammo doesn‚Äôt. 
---
Shooting them with an explosive ammo weapon is a great option for killing them but it‚Äôs not a great option for tagging as many creatures as possible because you‚Äôre going to need to spray the area with many bullets in order to get a tag on all of them, an explosive bullet only tag the enemies nearby the enemy you shot which means you‚Äôll most likely always tag 3 or 4 at most
---
The fatman is a weak weapon, yes, but people underestimate its utility. It‚Äôs a clean tagging weapon that deals enough damage in a wide range to guarantee that you‚Äôre going to get the loot and XP of every living creature at the time when the nuke lands. While with an explosive weapon you‚Äôre more likely to miss a few enemies since they‚Äôll be killed before you‚Äôre able to shoot at them or close to them
---
I'm pretty sure I know where you mean, atleast I've seen the arch you describe.
---
Aim for south of the map kinda south of foundation and the train station near the nuclear waste disposal ground.
---
You gotta respect peoples beliefs man. Just because they like putting mutilated corpses in metal cages doesnt mean you have a right to be an arsehole.
---
It does come with the door, I think its in the wall section though
---
Yup, you look in nuked zones for the components and then you have to craft it.
---
Kill any creatures in the nuked zones to get three of the components: High radiation fluids, Glowing mass, and hardened mass. You will need one of each per stable flux.
---
To get the raw flux, you will need to pick flowers in the nuked zones. Different areas have different types of flowers and therefore have different fluxes. You can get plenty of violet flux whenever someone nukes the SBQ on the southeast area of the map. You can get cobalt whenever someone nukes whitesprings (usually in the northern area in the woods). I am not sure what kind of flux is around the Collosal problem. Anyways, you will need 10 plants of the same color per stable flux that you craft.
---
Also, some people sell flux in their vending machines so you can look out for that. usually the rate is around 200 caps per.
---
They don't work anymore
---
The robot gives you a repeatable quest. Stings and things, check your pip-boy and try to activate it.
---
Is it under daily?
---
The flux is basically the plants in a nuke zone. So if you didn‚Äôt know where to exactly get it from, it‚Äôs by harvesting the plants. 
---
Different plants give different types of raw flux that you‚Äôll need to stabilize in order to make useable flux, you‚Äôll need to do a google/YouTube search to find the best spots for every type of flux
---
If that‚Äôs too complicated for you, just play the scorched earth event. It gives you a few pieces of flux upon completion and in my opinion it‚Äôs way better than harvesting it yourself
---
Bulk it and sell it to vendors, or players.
---
Build a large camp.
---
Buy fallout first and never worry about having too much scrap again.
---
Drop it on the floor.
---
You must not be playing with the same people I do because 9/10 times the enemies are dead before they ever hit the ground. Literally 4-5 people have some kind of ridiculous explosive ammo gun that kills them too fast for anything. I used to like Line in the Sand but now it's just stand around and pray you can tag three or four of them a round.
---
There was a what? Guess I missed it. üòÜ
---
Ok maybe the Game works. But when i have a challenge for Atoms as reward. Should they work ? of course the game may work, but there are so many little things that in my opinion spoil the fun of the game
---
So *one* Settler(who was previously a Raider) sends you to do his dirty work, and the whole faction is bad?
---
It‚Äôs triggered by putting a tent on their spawn behind the fences, which forces them to spawn in the middle
---
This level 2 keep killing my brahim bit i did kill him with a trap when they tried to get into my house
---
Two fixers, lucky. :P  I will probably keep mine around for occasional use (still only have the level 30 one) but the reason I love my pipe revolver so much is that there is absolutely no sway.  I am one of those weird people that likes sitting on a roof forever looking through a scope waiting for the perfect moment to take a shot, can't do that with any automatic that I have ever used in this game.  Quickly moving targets are a bit better but not looking forward to how things are going to be.
---
Thanks! I can feed my gauss minigun now
---
So I checked the walls and the only one in there is the normal rolling garage one and it doesn‚Äôt fit. Btw I like how you have rocket in your name like it‚Äôs some direct support lmao.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for it too!!!
---
So what you gotta do is nuke whitespring after that go into the nuke zone. Collect all of the raw flux you can. Kill as many creatures or enemies as you can, MAKE SURE TO COLLECT THE HIGH-RADIATION FLUIDS, GLOWING MASS, AND HARDENED MASS OFF OF THE THINGS YOU KILL. After that you take the high radiation fluids, glowing mass, hardened mass, and raw flux and craft stable flux in a chemistry station. You need 10 raw flux, 1 hardened mass, 1 glowing mass, and 1 high radiation fluids to craft 1 stable flux. I highly suggest using the green thumb perk because you get one extra peice of raw flux from one plant. Nuking white spring is a great general place to find all flux types, there is mostly yellowcake there is a decent amount of cobalt and crimson and there isn‚Äôt a whole lot of violet but it‚Äôs still a decent amount if you use the green thumb perk. The best place to get violet flux is in the cranberry bog but you don‚Äôt get much else. I hope this helps.
---
Loot fall under the map. Mostly 3 star legendary gouls or something. Maybe i been weong but thats main things in a game
---
Down in monogah
---
Lurks Earle The wendigo
---
You gotta nuke him
---
Not 12 words, but an haiku
---
Probably the only time i would use the cursed shovel as well
---
Been doing that, it worked the first few times till more players showed up then it stopped.  
---
Tried putting it at different entrances closer or further back, not sure what I'm doing wrong.
---
Rn i us the treasure hunter outfit and assault gas mask to look like a raider
---
I know what you‚Äôre talking about because it happens to me sometimes, they touch the ground as dead bodies lol
---
This is why using a weapon with a large AoE range is great, you still have a chance to guarantee a hit on any enemy that is still standing. I just stand back holding a fatman and once I see them spawn in the sky I shoot the ground, it yields way better results than using an explosive assault rifle. 
---
You can also use a flamer and it works just fine, you‚Äôll still not be able to tag all of them but you‚Äôll tag more than you would if you were using explosive bullets
---
Maybe there‚Äôs a specific spot for you to put it on, I don‚Äôt know I haven‚Äôt done it before but I know that‚Äôs how people do it
---
You don‚Äôt use a stabilized mod on one of your arm pieces?  It almost completely eliminates scope sway.
---
Yes, and they have unique camp objects so raiders have raiders watchtower, guard building that has the door in Harper's ferry and big bend tunnel, guard post and tent, BoS can have the metal guard post things like the ones at Boston airport, the large guard post, that's all I can think of, Enclave can have a bunker where it can be sunk into terrain and has modules like the vault tec workshop from Fo4, Responders can have a tent outpost, shipping containers(like at Morgantown airport), Free states can have a small bunker, guard post like the one in Harper's ferry.
---
Also I hope for a flag that can be placed on your back and have a couple options where you can put your flag and patch. I would love to hear more ideas as I'm quite biased towards raiders and I do love the raiders
---
If you look around you can find his speeches, Roger Maxson is the founder of the BOS and great grandpa to the asshole Arthur Maxson
---
You have any idea if the short scope is more steady on a handmade or the AR?  I am not usually a vats user unless absolutely needed.
---
Ammo generators are indestructible
---
Usually someone will have a stopper so one person cant buy out all their items to ward off thjs glitch that would occasionally happen then get fix and rehappen. If they can buy all your items fast enough and your camp wasnt loading up fast enough it would start selling stuff from your stash at their base value,
---
lmao are the nukes on the globe supposed to be tendies?  thats so darn funny lmaoooooooooo
---
Yep, that is all you have to do.
---
Ladydevann said they are still talking about this change because it's not coming with One Wasteland
---
Not sure then sorry, my one has a door ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è maybe it bugged out and got removed
---
That fine (the driving business away, not the breach of terms of service). If that's what the owner wants to do, that's on them. No one is entitled to anything at another players camp.
---
yes, that may very well be the case. Going to pay more attention to it next purveyor event but we'll probably never be sure.
---
Fireproof 1 and 2 apparently grant immunity from self-damage for ballistic explosive weapons on top of their documented explosive damage reduction. Fireproof 3 for some reason only reduces but does NOT negate explosive self-damage.
---
Did you get a keycard?
---
Or look at it and immediately say, "this is a trap".   Or spend too long just trying to find the vending machines.
---
I literally look at the map and find low levels to help. I'm sure I'm not the only one. If a high level comes to you with a gift emote or tries to help you, most of the time it's just a friendly person. 
---
If you're on PC and ever want help, I'd be glad to team up! I have a new-ish character with a less intimidating level if that makes it less scary.
---
Just take your business elsewhere, problem solved...
---
You should be fine after the update then.  The damage cards barely add anything on the PTS that I have seen.
---
That‚Äôs true, but it seems counterintuitive.  Common sense is a fairly rare commodity, so it‚Äôs understandable.
---
The globe represents what the meat industry does to the planet. Those explosions are the major factories like Tyson, JBS, Cargill, etc.
---
I run a Medics build with a vats sneak comando and put out about 750 to 1000 per shot depending on the target
---
My artillery is in range of the whitespring. And i nuked a trap camp 2 days ago
---
It is not a big, it is an unintended feature.
---
Because of how DR works in this game, you can just play any PA and you‚Äôll be fine. Get the Emergency Protocols mod and you‚Äôll be set.
---
I have extra PA set but I stuck with the X-01 because it looks the best imo.
---
When I did this they refunded my atoms so I could buy the whole set bc I didn't realize the porches weren't included in the wall set. Maybe worth a try?
---
Yea it's broken for me too. We just have to mod the normal underarmor until they fix it (if they fix it)
---
Scorched Earth event also rewards 4 random fluxes on completion, and Earl rewards 2. I can give you 5 of each if you want?
---
the way I get around it (sometimes anyway) is to favourite wheel to a different weapon and switch back and fire again. It's a pain
---
Fuck the raiders. Everything bad that happened in appalachia is because of some dude name Thomas or the raiders
---
one of those explosions is me when im gassy from eating your mom's cooking
---
I have a heavy PA food build. Doesn't quite punch has hard for boss encounters to outdo the specialists but good enough to cover for them if they're not there, heal escorts during events or take over keeping the trash mobs off the specialists if they are there.
---
For me, support is less of a build and more of a mindset. Friendly Fire is my only support build related thing. The rest is covering for stuff that others won't or can't do.
---
I'm looking forward to Bethesda fixing that bug, but I guess expecting things to work is annoying.
---
Thats really clever, you know like DT-clever... and I'm sure no one has ever thought of fast travelling out of your camp
---
There is only one week I between and I doubt there will be atom challenges. Season 2 starts on the 15th unless it has changed.
---
I came over from Fallout 4 and took exactly the same path mate rocking a 3* Gauss rifle .. a HM Furious ff 25%crit changed all that around level 60..never looked back it's carried me through over another 300 levels now..when the day comes that I finally get a decent Fixer drop I'll mount My HM on a wall, never getting rid of it ‚úåÔ∏è
---
That's pretty damn impressive.
---
I fast travelled to a camp built in a relay tower.
---
Problem is that the fast travel marker was like 4 stories up and in midair.
---
There are baby mirelurks pretty often near foundation in a little pond with a pipe on a cliff. It's got a few big ones and a bunch of eggs. They always spawn there. Kill the big guys and let the little ones crawl around til you catch it.
---
My camp isn‚Äôt too far from the mine- plenty of yellow and crimson, with a bit of cobalt in the area.
---
They store them in the fissure sites, you just have to jump in and grab ‚Äòem. üôÉ
---
I found that plasma grenades are great for bagging a good group and still let others tag them
---
Because that‚Äôs when the patch is coming, some of the challenges are in relation to Daily Ops.
---
Join The Enclave. Become a General. Look around The Enclave Military Wing Command area, there are lists of what types of flora that will give you the various types of flux scattered all around that area.
---
You loose them and cannot get them. Although some will be available for bullion next season, like the chicken coop
---
Yes, but I always have some raw fertilizer on me to leave in the bed in these cases. Every cloud...
---
&gt; So when I've made a mistake please tell me and in the best situation you could give me the right solution. 
---
The current live system isn't fully multiplicative. For example, Adrenaline, Adrenal Reaction and Bloody mess form an additive group. Similarly, the normal, expert and master weapon perks add up to 60%. Some weapon mods also work off of the base damage, some mods and legendary effects interfere.
---
&gt; I don't know how melee weapon damage are calculated 
---
Each point in strength means +5% additive damage, after which mods and other effects are multiplied onto. So `base damage * (1 + strength / 20)`.
---
With all things being equal i.e. you use a normal weapon and armour and Mr 10 using the same weapon and armour but at their level, you'll dish out about the same amount of damage (as an overall percentage/ratio) and receive about the same amount of damage.
---
Obviously you'll likely do more damage and take less due to all your damage buffs and resistances but instead of the current system where Mr 10 would tickle that enemy and get smashed by it, they have a fighting chance.
---
Same too with you vs low level enemies, except they have a fighting chance against you.
---
Dont hang about st the Queen though, I went to ACP and nobody turned up as it cleared the rubble, I thought hey ho, whipped out my TSE minigun and proceeded to melt Earle z just as he dropped a 3 or 4 player marker popped into the mine area, they couldnt enter and were giving me angry emotes.... sorry guy's, you were late :-)
---
I was so sad when me turning on the brotherhood broke Danse, sigh, rip my hunk robo boyfriend
---
Hmmmm. That only works if you're carrying 1k pound of junk
---
Just today i went to a camp and for some reason the fps of the game dropped so badly. I think he had too much stuff and that was killing my fps. Regretted going there. He left after a while and yeah fps went back to normal.
---
Different people have different priorities. I've stopped trying to apply logic to things that often make no sense logically.
---
Ok, I am a dumbass.  I have it on both arms, forgot I was on a different account testing Commando on a melee character.  Thanks for reminding me, should be fine now :)
---
Seconded
---
Feared as much... Need to spread the repair kits and all that shit around
---
What we really need is an opossum pen that produces intestines.
---
And a spice weasel pen that produces spices.
---
It is.
---
There IS a specific spot, facing out from the main building, you have to place your tent right in the middle of the 3rd entrance from the left and it will trigger the glitch every time.
---
You broken the rules
---
But your haiku is legit
---
Kudos to you dude
---
Me too! My camp has a kinda spooky vibe and pumpkins would be perfect!
---
I like him as a Vinny
---
I think the only thing due during the down period is the purveyor sale.
---
I hate low levels - they always run away from me and i dropped all the plans and stuff for nothing again! I'm a level 144 melee with a chinese stealt suite and i drown in unused ammo, weapons and armor.
---
Oh yes, I forgot about that! üòÖ
---
I seem to have been one of the lucky few not to have that issue.
---
Which is typical of my luck in this game...
---
Terrible luck with the purveyor, great luck with bugs.
---
A schedule is a schedule. The season and Atlas event is supposed to be content enough to fill the gap since the last major content update and one whole week without something isn't gonna kill anyone at this point.
---
If it's a maze or a glitched underground camp  ... I'll just be ... nope, I'll take my caps elsewhere thanks
---
What legendary effects are magic?
---
I have tried once in a while and got one last night. It was perfectly preserved.
---
Yes. It won't damage the fence either.
---
No, not ‚Äúfuck dupers.‚Äù I can think of several things wrong with that.
---
Number ONE! Dupers make the good weapons and armor widely available for the dregs of Appalachia, and when they were banned last wave it was a great sacrifice that needs saluting. 1/55000 odds of getting the weapon I want from the purveyor is unacceptable. And spending 1000+ hours only to still not get my own god roll without tradings is unacceptable. They‚Äôre a necessary evil. Like Vietnam.
---
Number TWO! Do you really think that they *want* fucking? That would be rape and that‚Äôs not cool.
---
Number THREE! Duping is still a massive issue *two years into the game?* Really? We shouldn‚Äôt even have this argument.
---
Everything responders!
---
pretty cool, thanks :)
---
As long as it‚Äôs not cross platform with PC way to many hackers. I‚Äôm happy for crossplay between Xbox and PS though.
---
RESPEKT
---
Cool idea but I agree that the sliders are a bit unfriendly on mobile, it took a lot of poking to get it at 1.5. maybe it's better on pc?
---
Idk man, at the end of the day a lot of people did miss those rewards, granted they have drop rates to force some sort of rarity, but these people should get the chance to earn it as a reward before people start charging thousands of caps for a meat cleaver plan.
---
Grow a spine, we were all low levels once most people probably dont even notice you no matter what your level is. Gaming is an escape from the struggles of reality dont bring them with you.
---
My sweet America, when John Henry Eden builds a nation he builds it to last.
---
Yes, and it's weird because I don't even own a penis!
---
If it was near Watoga that might have been mine. I have no control over where people spawn. Sorry.
---
Wow! That's my goal too. Yesterday i bought my 2nd one: egghead. How much does a serum cost from you?
---
Everything, nothing.
---
&gt; usually the rate is around 200 caps per.
---
I never see for less that 400, and just sold a few dozen at 500.
---
Wonder if different servers in different regions have different economies?
---
Feral ghouls were in 1, under necropolis. And the Super Mutants in the original games were a militant force, so there would have been conflict. But the culture of the BOS didn't have the pure strain racial purity that it does under Beth. Originally that mindset was reserved for the Enclave that appeared in 2.
---
Yes, I hate the 300+ plan camps that have 20 each of 15 different plans
---
This status quo supports and encourages cheating. It is not sustainable. Nobody "earned" millions of presents. Quite literally more than 99% of legacy items in circulation are duped. This is why gold bullion items aren't(supposed to be) tradable.
---
The question isn't if drastic action is necessary or should be taken, but how long it's going to be put off for and what form it takes. We shouldn't encourage dupers by saying it's acceptable that they crash entire servers(which is more than the 24 player shards we see) and ruin everybody else's time just to gratify their greed. We should not be supporting this toxic mentality.
---
Do you know specifics? It was my impression that they just won't go off on foundations, you can still use them but it takes finesse.
---
Yeah, people sell things at whatever price they want. 
---
It's just a game there's no rules anywhere saying what price items should be, unless you've written down your own rules;) but even then.. People aren't gonna listen to community made up rules.
---
Slow your horses, bub. They're still getting things ready for Daily Ops.. Would be awesome to have more events like that, I think it's one of the best events we've got.
---
Yeah, what I did was taking a picture of a tent that "works", then replaced mine in the same spot on a private server, then waited for a LiTS to start so I could test it. Because it doesn't work anywhere on the road, some placements just doesn't work
---
It's difficult, therefore shouldn't be bothered with?
---
I realize it isn't really an option, but....
---
Securitron MODUS.

Thanks for the tip!
---
I only know from personal experience, I used then against several camps and nothing
---
What happens if you claimed them but didn't load a character
---
Bahaha, that's not true at all.
---
nOICE
---
What platform? If you're on PC, feel free to friend me (Lamorak\_2000). I make no demands (other than share a blasted perk! :-) ), and if I'm not in the middle of anything, I'll even help with a higher-level area (I'm only in the 160s, but two can take on a 'squatch easier than one).
---
This goes for the OP too! My main has most of the weapon plans, so I can craft pretty much any weapon that you want (barring heavies - haven't found many of those plans).
---
No not meta. 1st off you need 10 times the levels normal players reaches,then it depends on what perks you choose. Adding qol won't win you fights if you dtill lack damage and gear.
---
Raiders are more polite than the Settlers.
---
Did you grind, and then pay the 24000 caps for the plan to make the serums? No? Then you'll pay whatever the person is selling them for. Stupid logic thinking they should be cheaper than bread lol.
---
So you grimy vagabond weirdos can't sleep in my bed.
---
if u are looking for cobalt flux for the jet pack I recommend u nuke morgantown, assuming you are an enclave general. there are tons of blue plants (raw cobalt flux) there once the area is a blast zone, southwest of mama dolce has a giant field that will have dozens of them. also make sure to have green thumb perk equipped (perception)
---
I didnt finish it. I'm sad.
---
Little feedback: slider should go from 1.0 to x, not start at 1.1 when selected.
---
Just based off of the games history, I‚Äôd bet that you would lose them. Even if you finished the run a week early and just didn‚Äôt claim all your repair/scrap kits. Bethesda didn‚Äôt pay out lost score as far as I‚Äôm aware...I don‚Äôt see them reimbursing you for lost scrap kits. Just my guess
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eleutm/fallout_76_on_macbook_pro_boot_camp/
---
Does this guy even play anymore?
---
But seriously yeah.. probably goes to your last loaded one
---
Just north of Whitespring.
---
Yep. Bottom line... Just claim the repair kits on your lowest level characters...
---
Claim the perk cards on the same?
---
No, and no, and ef NO! When I see ridiculous clearly laughable prices, I laugh, set an explosive bait under that vendor and move on, I'm sure someone else will be happy to get my caps, it's called free market, look it up!
---
Many times in fact. To find non legendaries or 30,000 caps items. Next is a nuke dropped specifically at their campsite to make up for it.
---
Man....I didn‚Äôt even think about using one of my mules to claim the perk cards. That‚Äôs using your noggin
---
Get out, leave , immediately.....
---
Nah
---
Same time as daily season refresh and atom shop drop. So usually 5pm uk.
---
Had his body clip through the ground, managed to loot him because a cheek was visible...my team was not so lucky. Once he did this thing where he was levitating ten feet in the air...fun times.
---
I laugh at people like you because you feel the need to say it is ridiculous stupid prices, but yet you won't go through the content to get the items that will basically be free for yourself after a while of owning it, it's called the i want everything handed to me market, look it up!
---
I always put the saturation up in photomode, the bright red and green complement each other.
---
The door is separate but I do not recall if it is misc., or walls. Would note though it has to be spun to snap. I think it is backwards like the jukebox and a couple other items. The door should be in your c.a.m.p. menu no matter.
---
Wow, 400 levels in 2 months? CoVid quarantine?
---
I'm not sure what we need for the legendary perks, but I got 5 characters all level 100 plus... Figure they need them more than my main who has quite a few
---
All could be explained if we all just accept that 76 is a simulation Vault. Where sensors are gathering live data of the outside world and relaying that to the program we are all in to see how we survive. 
---
Same day over and over, scorchbeasts, ability to respawn and fast travel in real time. 
---
*adjusts tinfoil hat*
---
He could have atleast made an announcement. He pretty much ghosted us.
---
I actually would like to rename my main character, I named him hobo because he looked like a bum on creation. First outfit I got was tattered rags to, but now I'm a bit of a wasteland Capillionaire so I feel his name doest quite fit.
---
Not to fussed with aid renaming if I'm honest. Onky because I don't struggle to find what I want as everything is equipped to me wheel that I use, in a specific order.
---
For example the right is energy weapons and aid, bobbles the effect those. On the left ballistic, then the bottom is rad x and radaway + water.
---
This is possibly the most George comeback ever! Great job biff!
---
Thank you!
---
BoS weren't aware of the Enclave until the 2240s and we know that the BoS headed to Appalachia currently are from the West Coast so it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense.
---
Im gonna stop until about 2 weeks into season simply because I know the update will be buggy as fuck. It Is Bethesda. We'll be lucky if the update doesn't break the game. And no, there isn't shit to do between seasons. Yes, they already know how incredibly boring the game is. No, they do not care.
---
I think I might have bought from you, is your camp in the road just next to the overseers camp?
---
See with me after i get what I want from them Im going all murder enclave  hobo on bos.
---
But what if they are selling the toxic water cheap in the vendor. Playing the system!
---
They already had a week, with over 20 chances every day. If people weren't able to gather multiple sets of everything in that timeframe, they were, hands down, doing something *VERY* wrong. Not to mention the abundance currently in vendors for dirt cheap. 
---
Whether by sheer laziness, or by having the worst luck imaginable, it boggles my mind how someone couldn't have a set of everything by now, of course excluding the Tenderizer plans. We literally had people just dropping their rewards by the final day, because sitting on 10+ full sets of Chally costumes, bloody chefs and grillmasters hats is absurd. Don't even get me started on the 30 backpack plans...
---
Point being, the value is already low AF. We don't need a second Meat Week for folks to get their rewards, people just need to actively search them out while the value is still low.
---
I use stinging on all mine. I think I scrapped about 50 total to get all the mods. Just put on 5 pieces of unyielding and get heavily irradiated to boost your intelligence as high as you can get it. Same for when your crafting handmades. You want your luck as high as you can get it to get super duper to trigger more often.
---
Nope, you lost me when you called it 'frightening'.
---
If it really bothers you that much just headcanon 76 as an alternate timeline.
---
I swear the worst thing that happened to sci-fi and fantasy fandom was the obsession with consistent 'lore' as if it's vital for good storytelling
---
I prefer the Raiders, but I am an ally of the true heroes of Fallout, the feral ghouls.
---
Feral ghouls just want to live peacefully in ruined buildings and sewers, but rude pesky humans keep trespassing, killing peaceful ghouls and looting all the nice junk the ghouls worked so hard to collect.
---
You mean a Securitron from New Vegas?
---
It happens.  :)
---
Weve had very different experiences so I have to ask, what platform?  I'm on PC.
---
Free stimpacks
---
It seems that if I leave the mine b4 count down ends. I get a notification of a legendary awarded to me for completing the event (not from earls body nor cursed weapon).
---
But if i were to wait for the cave in. I didnt get to see this extra legendary award.
---
Is this just me or?
---
Yes. I agree that the box is useless to loot. Nothing fancy in it... adds on to the weight
---
I hope so. If beth do the Enclave right we can have proper evil characters. No the bland we are good people and everybody is welkome raiders we got. 
---
But I don't know lore wise if the Enclave was already experimenting on people and trying to exterminate everybody like in F3 this early after the war, they were still on the oil rig. Although they already did the vault experiments, so...
---
I guess, for both of us, that depends on **if** there's more than the essential and named characters. And, for me, how rude they are. If any of them call me a mutant Ill use my kangaroo legs and kick them back to maxon.
---
From what I've seen AA should be a pretty good choice when the patch drops but I could be wrong. Nothing is yet set in stone either so there's that. I like AA now, and if you test it Junkies doesn't do a lot more damage than AA. I actually tested it again the other day. The JE laser however is stronger than a BE laser, significantly. Event without addictions. Using it bloodied is OP.
---
If I can scoop it up for free or buy it, I‚Äôll buy it every time.  Give me convenience or give me death!
---
When I suddenly see a high level with power armour my heart skips a beat but when they emote or drop something I calm down, startles me a bit too
---
Haha
---
6ish months ago I was. I moved camp to an acid point for flamer fuel and was it on PC?
---
As a level 8, I don‚Äôt claim them
---
There's a difference between forgetting a base your ancestors were at for a few months to forgetting an outright war with the remnants of the US Govt
---
This game is a chore. But one you feel guilty about if you don't do.... I hate you Bethesda but know that I love you, while I'm hating you... you piece of shit &lt;3 xoxo

Yessssssss, let me lead my Horsemen/Ohio River Outriders into battle. I already got a logo designed and everything.
---
Not you then, was on PS4 and it was yesterday
---
Have you ever heard of mule characters or alts since you‚Äôve been playing so long? Lmao I have a trading character that‚Äôs under level 10 still I only use to hold weapons, gotta wear enclave uniform or some shit so food builds understand that you can have more than one character lmfao
---
I am 99% of my time in PS4 chat party so I do not hear other players either.
---
Well I am still glad someone is selling plans cheap for all to have.
---
I was like "it'll be there until the reset you can go off play a little bit of division finishing season 2 now you've finished logging in every day for the legendary run". But no. 3 days. So frustrating and disappointing
---
They did? Someone tested it live a week ago and it was still there.
---
I run like hell for immersion sake. plus I like the little adrenaline boost
---
MODUS isn't really talking with the Enclave at large though, he sent the plans for the Vertibirds and the prototype advanced power armor schematics to the Rig and he talked briefly with the computer that becomes President Eden but he's fairly isolated from the Enclave as a whole. 
---
If he does retaliate, he'll send his robots, which could happen and could work within the lore since from the BoS's perspective it's just a bunch of malfunctioning robots someone has commandeered
---
Yup don‚Äôt trade with strangers they can take your stuff until Bethesda stops being scumbags. Spread the word let low lvls/new players know so they don‚Äôt get screwed.
---
The only time I go shopping is when I'm near or max caps and Im ready to spend big. If they've got a rad shower blocking my way to their vendors, I couldn't care less. I'll take my 30k caps elsewhere to spend. Their loss üòÅ
---
Other than Prime, and Prime automatic, I think there's like 2 or 3 you can buy, and the rest are pretty common.
---
We must have read different things üòÇ
---
It won't be 2030, that'd mean there'd be 15 years between 4 and 5. There was only 10 years between 2 and 3 and 7 years between 3 and 4.
---
You can have a maximum of 120 unique plans for sale. Any higher count is duplicates, but they could also have 120 mounted blah heads.
---
On the chart that list all mods likeliness to get when scrapping it list all but the primes and Night Vision as very low chances.
---
I know they won't work on ps4 threw 5 at a giys vendor and did nothing
---
I like the glitch. It gives me time to contemplate life and the slow, tortured death I want Todd to suffer.....
---
I kill every NPC except the drunk settler and the raider that wants to help you cook and gives you recipes.
---
It's honestly crazy how the community gathers so much materials in such little time. 
---
Does anyone have an estimated number of players on consoles?
---
And one of those is your mum queefing... *BOOM*
---
The Whitestone clubhouse used to be like that when you nuked it, waves and waves of ghouls would spill out. It was brutal.
---
Taking off your under armor?
---
Oh dude that sounds like something I would have loved! Bummer I missed it
---
They go to the last character you logged in as. Made this mistake a while back, I had purchased one of the  atom bundles that had repair kits, the kits went to a character I was intending on deleting but hadn't got round to, which happens be the last one I had logged in with before purchasing the bundle.
---
So log in with the character you want to claim them on beforehand.
---
I struggle with deciding too.
---
Im fairlt new and still learning things ü§™
---
It doesn‚Äôt reset till later today, uk here. So should still be available?
---
.308 and flamer fuel are still too low. I just don't get that logic when you get so much .50 and so low .308, when LMG consumes much more ammo than 50cal
---
Junkies is still going to be the weapon that does most damage on a full health character (unless they un-nerf two shot, which is unlikely) . Anti Armor is big right now, because Earle Williams's damage resistance is just so high, as is the SBQ. AA makes these bosses less spongy. So, for everyday adventuring I'd go junkies, but save an AA for the bosses.
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem to. U can cripple Earle and explosive seems to damage him
---
Nope. Was only available until the 7th
---
Ah well that sucks. I logged in Sunday. Grabbed the free stuff and played fifa. Didn‚Äôt even load the game in.
---
When you click on the name of the  multiplier you get the option do delete it or reset it.
---
In case of the Weapon Perk if I choose that you can go from 1 to 1.2 you can still choose 1.05. 
---
But you're right I'm not really happy with the solution but I didn't find a better answer to it.
---
Keep with junkies it‚Äôs best full health prefix for HG weapons
---
Do you have concentrated fire?
---
Don't forget that with the new update One wasteland stronger enemies come in the game too. Super Mutatns(other enemies too) will be level 100. That means they'll have more health and damage.
---
Well, that article was posted a week ago..
---
Then why did anyone else do the grind? 
---
Honestly this mentality is terrible. You aren't owed a reward for not completing the task.
---
Yeah.... I missed the beret and sign.
---
Why they‚Äôre not permanently available, I don‚Äôt know.
---
Oh wait, yeah I do, it‚Äôs to keep us logging in once all the quests are done.
---
It's a shame. I can easily swap cards around...especially when card load-outs arrive to enjoy using an automatic I carry, but there should be a place for rifleman.
---
Even though it's a game it's not fair to ruin builds and handicap a large selection of weapons.
---
One of the best things about Fallout is the depth of immersion and even coming across people who very much role-play their characters can be brilliant. Once bumped into three friends who were as real a troupe of Brotherhood recruits as you could get outside a tual NPCs....wouldn't they struggle with the way energy weapons are now..?!
---
The greatest thing about the Fallout genre was the range of builds and types of people you can be. Making weapons and types of play redundant is rotten and seeing some of the 'O.G' styles left behind only hurts the game as a whole.
---
Didn't know information was there until I went looking for it
---
Hmmm, will Bethesda return to giving us essentially free money?
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
---
They do.
---
i know it sounds bad but private servers are a great way to farm power armour if you or a friend has fallout 1st grab a guide and have a little walkabout looting all the locations
---
I logged in every day for 3 months to do legendary run, was incredibly burnt out, and went I'll have a few days. 
---
I get making rewards limited so it's connected to fortifying ATLAS, but 3 days (given traditionally it's reset) is punitive.
---
Always check your launcher
---
Until we benefit from it of course, then it‚Äôs either hotfixed or eliminated next patch.
---
And equip Super Duper when crafting the flux! The chance of doubling it is excellent.
---
Reading Atom Shop articles in PS4 interface is painful. It's painful UI.
---
Luck doesnt boost super duper
---
Due to life happening, I haven‚Äôt been able to get on much.
---
Fair enough I missed meat week, lot like other events. 
---
But the atlas ones are community rewards, they should be available anytime.
---
&gt; hould obviously just log in to the game every single day to cash out 200 gol
---
This is what i'm doing now, log in to the game every single day for about 2 minutes per day to cash out 200 gold and close the game. there is nothing to do until season 2.
---
stay away from my camp then Mutie
---
I don‚Äôt think he is cripplable. My tormentor and tank killer seem to think not.
---
My decon arch isn't even close to my vendors but people still manage to ignore the direction signs and storm right through the decon arch, up the stairs and into my house.
---
I've hooked the arch to a switch. That's to the left it. To the right is a rad barrel.
---
I feel that this is reasonable enough. If it isn't, I don't need your business.
---
According to the challenge tracker, I still haven't discovered Abandoned Bog Town, after playing since Beta.
---
And have never killed a Scorchbeast Queen.
---
One good thing about private servers is that at least the place where the red asylum dress spawns isn't always picked clean and also all the lead places. Also you can glitch out line in the sand wit hour tent for easy exp
---
I kill the settlers and the raiders alike, the raiders are not real raiders. I want to join Rose and rebuild the Cutthroats.
---
i was given one of those when i first started and i loved it!
---
Test it first, might overheat so can suggest placing it a bath of cold water before turning it on.

Unfortunately I was on a public team when someone launched a nuke, so it auto-completed my final quest and I never got to do it myself. I no longer get the prompts, so I'm not even sure how to start the nuclear launch quest - is it in a terminal in the enclave war room?
---
fix it
---
same, there was one raider i didnt kill though, he was really friendly and when he saw mw he asked: "hey, you need some more ammo?" didnt care who i was or my rep with them being at cautious, he gave me like 20 fusion cells, after that i did not have the heart to kill him
---
Junkies is stronger than bloody in pts?
---
&gt;Raider Vendors
---
Remember that you can also find 1 of each of the faction vendors at The Whitespring Resort.
---
Wow. First time I've heard of this. Maybe try hooking up a controller and see if VATS works on it? If it does, then at least you know it's keyboard-related. If it doesn't, then your copy has a serious bug.
---
It‚Äôs just a fallout bug they never bothered to fix because there lazy!  If you go to the weapon factory you can make the weapon terminal in to a blue print and then build that in your camp it‚Äôs probably why they release the ammo factory buildable in Camps because there too lazy to fix it.  It‚Äôs not exactly game breaking games not pvp so I don‚Äôt bother reporting players doesn‚Äôt even make ultracite or 2mm meh
---
The raiders of Appalachia may still be violent but at least the one leading them isn't someone like Lev. Meg has... standards.
---
The settlers treat you like some bum off the street no matter how much you help out.
---
Oh. He‚Äôs been static a few times when I‚Äôve fought him. And I‚Äôve seen posts saying that he had been crippled. Maybe just coincidence
---
That‚Äôd be dope.
---
Do you have a PS4, I can give you mine.
---
Only thing I ask for is nuclear material, crystals and circuits. Doesn‚Äôt even have to be a lot, whatever you can part with.
---
No bloodied js still the strongest but the JE laser does more damage than a BE laser.
---
Add in an animation for me feeding them and I‚Äôm sold.
---
Haven't tried it yet, is it any good or am I better off sticking with my Raider bot?
---
Would be cool, but you expect too much from Bethesda, imho.
---
NGL I‚Äôm one of those people. Lol. Mostly cause I‚Äôm still trying to get my crap together stash wise. Though I hardly have plans in my machine. I put them in there with hopes some lower level person would take them off my hands. 
---
But yeah it‚Äôs either a ton of plans or ammo for 2 or 3 caps. That‚Äôs all I see on PS4
---
Thank you
---
Outside my boathouse there's usually two raiders out by the road. They need help, I help. They insult me, they get a shotgun to the face. If you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all.
---
That would be dangerously close to having useful PA arm mods. Therefore, it will never happen.
---
I would like it if it was that way too!
---
 I guess I should finally get my military ID card now.
---
Calibrated Shocks called. Told me to tell you "what the hell"?
---
Ahh interesting effect. This update coming sounds a bit nuts as I'm suddenly seeing everyone going nuts for aa
---
Afk in nuclear winter of course
---
Is VATS still bound to Q? The game doesn't seem to recognize my German QWERTZ keyboard either, so the Z and Y is kinda messed up.
---
I always only fast travel to my public team teammates camps cuz fadt travel costs caps and I am too lazy to switch my perks üòã
---
Yeh I've got a lot of AA stuff I was gonna trade but I'm keeping a tight hold of it for now.
---
How is this any different to having no cap cap? You may as well raise the cap given the result is effectively the same.
---
And my hammer !
---
Ok this was bugging me so I went for a wander. There is an archway of rock and a cave near by with an acid deposit, if you travel to south mountain lookout then a pinch south of the train tracks. 
---
No waterfall that I can see. If I find another rock archway or waterfall I'll update
---
I started out helping the settlers, but in the end I ended up liking the raiders more. They‚Äôre different from the ‚Äúkill and eat everyone who isn‚Äôt us, but sometimes kill and eat each other‚Äù raiders of other fallout games. These raiders can be reasoned with, and most of them claim they‚Äôll tolerate settlers as long as they don‚Äôt shit/talk them (which I resonate with). They do have a farm, albeit pretty drab and derelict compared to what the settlers have, but overall they seem like good people that look out for each other, and know that you have to be tough to survive.  
---
  
---
What their endgame is, who knows. If they intend on life to continue being their way, without a goal of establishing civilization and a culture that isn‚Äôt perpetually at each other‚Äôs throats, I‚Äôd probably switch back to settlers. Though it‚Äôs clear these raiders have accepted a gold-backed currency system, once it was introduced.  
---
Kindness also begets kindness. The opposite is also true. Fucking the raiders over on their share of the gold would make them even more untrustworthy of outsiders, and more hardened and unforgiving.
---
For the time being, though, they have the gauss minigun, and the settlers have a cartleprod. So...
---
Or maybe people just dont want to rely on bugs/spent caps on broken weapons. It's not like those weapons are intentended to act like they do.
---
I just break in.
---
Got a piano too close to a window? A tinkle on the ivories and I'm in...
---
From another post:
---
**Earle**: 32k HP, 400 DR, 400 ER, 500 RR, Ignores 80% of all incoming damage, immune to radiation and explosions.
---
**SBQ**: 32k HP, 300 DR, 300 ER, 300 RR, Ignores 70% of all incoming damage, immune to radiation and explosions.
---
When the vendor machines are placed over a cliff I automatically  assume that he, she or anything inbetween, has a small penis. It's the  big truck equivalent of Fallout 76.
---
Motion Assisted Servos dm'd. " Seriously?"
---
I just want enclave stuff for my base. I've put up some notes but :(  I would be happy with even an enclave flag
---
Earle has superior defensive spells(90% damage reduction), but can be crippled. When he's crippled his behavior is altered, he spits more when his legs are crippled but screeches less when the correct head is crippled. Also, his limbs heal VERY fast. If he isn't damaged for ~8 seconds all his limbs heal 10-15%.
---
Ahhh the extra-extra end game for me now I've done the serums is buying all the PA plans from all the vendors in the Whitespring
---
I'm communist Collectron all the way
---
I dont get it if bloody/junkie is still the best why irs now in flavour
---
It's definitely hard to take 76 seriously. The fact that the day never changes, you can teleport instantly, and the SBQ respawns indefinitely does immediately kill any sense of reality. I personally will just be ignoring this one with respect to any "lore" they attempt to create. It almost is guaranteed to not mesh with 1,2, or tactics. Dream/simulation is the only way out of this rabbit hole.

It will become effectively useless once they remove negative effects from not eating/drinking, sadly
---
My level 499 only swapped from rifleman to commando last week. Only thing I don't like is the ammo usage but I'm looking forward to the legendary perk system with that new ammo perk card. Bring it on now I say!
---
Although I did just purchase a vamp explosive lever action for my collection 2 days ago,.. ya know,.. just incase üôÑ
---
Thanks you're right! I'll work on it and hope I'll done till the end of the day
---
Don't know, maybe someone knows something but is being quiet about it. Probably more the fact that even with the nerf AA still ignores 50% or armor, so technically could end up doing more damage than the Junkies. I've not seen anyone test AA vs Junkies on the PTS but both Junkies and Bloodied are still strong.
---
Hmmm who knows couple of weeks maybe nocturnal op XD
---
I personally could use a breather. I'm a little burnt out. But I may be the minority here.
---
Glub glub
---
No, we need a cap limit to regulate the market, I would like to see them implement some sort of mechanic that shuts your vendors down when you hit the limit though.
---
Ya never know lol.
---
Fast travel to someone in the mine
---
Then it won‚Äôt come out until next year.
---
Does Tks Mantis know the game's lore? Roger Maxson was not isolationist at all.
---
It happens a lot to me whenever I use any automatic weapon whatsoever.
---
there isn't anyone there
---
Hell, Bethesda can't even handle their own game, I'm pretty sure the MacBook won't doü§£ü§£
---
There's nothing good in this game to buy.
---
Somewhere, there's a set of Excavater Power Armor with all these mods flipping you off.
---
I personally find Morgantown great for cobalt flux. And SBQ area for violet and crimson flux. It's kinda hard to differentiate the two by color, so unless you know which plant produces which, just grab a ton and sort it out later. IF you want to know - cranberries make crimson, ferns make violet.
---
power armor should give you all the weight reducing perks for free while inside it
---
I used to put my vendors in a red rocket. Had to remove the door because it kept closing and nobody could see the machines. By leaving the big door off, It just looks like it's open.
---
Are you clicking on the location or on the event pop up when in the map?
---
None of this changes. It's exactly the same in terms of proportional ranking.
---
The only real difference is the very top of the damage potential and the very bottom have a much smaller gap that is use to. In general, the things that were good for damage before will sill be good after the change. So bloodied will still be top tier. There's no point changing damage perks/buff/etc. so it's still the more the better.
---
The only caveat to this seem to be specific weapons, which were for some reason hit harder than others in terms of damage nerf. That specific info you can find from either Angry Turtle or InnovSurvivalist's videos on the topic.
---
It's be really cool of they added on some new PA stuff. It feels a bit stale compared to all the cool stuff regular armor has.
---
They'll become less prevalent once the new legendary perk cards come out (ammo crafting card maxed out produces 180% more rounds), so i can only assume we will see them start to dwindle away as time goes by.
---
you know how to get rid of the camera by any chance?
---
 thanks for the info :)
---
The glowing ones in Necropolis were a bunch of over-irradiated mind addled zombies that suffered too much exposure. What they definitely weren't was acrobatic speed demons that got there by slowly losing their minds - Bethesda "feral ghoul" style.
---
Wish my wife liked F76 as much as your family does. At least she helps me researching item market prices, pretty sweet of hers
---
I play a stealth rifleman/commando lvl 200
---
I use mixed armor with an outfit over top as I'm more interested in the bonuses from the legendary armor effects and as long as I have one piece of blending armor then I'm rarely in danger.
---
I use Chinese stealth armor for rad zones and powering up the power plant events where maximum stealth is required and  I don't have to worry about being over encumbered as I take this a lot slower to not drain AP.
---
I find this gives me the best of both worlds
---
Play and see.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a problem but I would much rather them add new factions rather than constantly recycle stuff from the old games again and again. 
---
I mean come on super mutants and deathclaws don‚Äôt have to be in every single fallout game, same applies for the BoS. Now the Enclave makes sense because of the history of the  Whitesprings bunker being built as the presidents personal fallout shelter.
---
She knows u r a golfer...
---
Calibrated shocks is for the legs,normal armor has deep pocketed+backpack=110pounds and mods that remove the need to have traveling pharmacy or through hiker perk's equiped and strength modifiers like unyielding that gives +15 strength if you have a full set.
---
Deep Pocketed (10x5) and Backpack (60) give you 110 extra carry weight. Power Armor with Calibrated Shocks (50x2) give you 100 extra carry weight.
---
It's likely weight reduction things that are giving you the extra carry capacity - like weight reduction legendary effects on your armor, grocers/chemist backpack mod, etc. ... none of which apply in PA.
---
So the real question should be, can we have legendary effects on PA, or a grocers/chemist mod for the PA torso?
---

---
this though your junkies heavy weapons are magic if near 200 fire rate so they will continue to do magic damage after the patch (it's not gotten fixed yet)  
---
the change is just how the bonuses are added together, bloodied will still do most damage followed by junkies and so on

More bugs
---
I haven't seen the video yet, but I like their addition in the game
---
Is a bug, had been for a while
---
Go out of vats and back in again if you miss
---
There are even half a dozen recolors to sell as a bundle.
---
Beth doesn't understand how much low hanging fruit they're sitting on. They make an ant hill out of a mountain
---
There is no event pop up just a circle telling me where to enter this is what I see
---
https://postimg.cc/qhdjYvfc
---
I play a pistol/revolver build.. All I really dislike the Gauss pistol, hope that the BoS will bring some sort of energy revolver. That also isn't super bulky.
---
I am trying to get a good set of Solar armour, for the set bonus, that apparently works in combat, and also because it is always a three star. It is just annoying you can't put any skins on them (yet?).
---
I hadn't thought about it that way. I'm really happy with the weapons I have but plenty are still looking I guess.
---
I‚Äôve got the same plus made game clips of it. Claiming it to be 95% hit chance and missing the whole clip, Also the same with Crits. Especially with a +50% crit dmg perk on and not seeing a single increase in dmg when i activate the crit. 
---
Platform = Xbox
---
Same with 50.cal sucks when I use it with furious.
---
No, if you join the event and complete it the game skips that quest stage
---
It works on a private server
---
Yeah.  I kinda got two locations merged into one.  Found the rock arch one you're talking about, but mainly wanted waterfall and etc.
---
Didn't find the place i remember seeing, but settled for the one at the flower near top of the world.
---
Thanks though
---
&gt; Calibrated shocks is for the legs,normal armor has deep pocketed+backpack=110pounds 
---
Calibrated shocks are 100. For any character with less than 10 strength, you actually gain from using PA.
---
You've highlighted the problem perfectly - unyielding. 
---
Anyhow, this is not my point. Just saying PA already has an equivalent mod.
---
FEV is so overdone.
---
Actually this is nothing new, I get it alot, I just back out of vats and go back in. It mainly happens with TSE Lever Action Rifle. IT JUST WORKS
---
I have my mouse buttons switched around (because i'm a lefty) which stops VATS from working. The Q button still brings up VATS but i cannot shoot. Pressing the aim button (My left click) closes VATS. Been this way since i started playing. I have to switch back to do the score challenges.
---
Event hasn‚Äôt started yet. Nuke didn‚Äôt hit yet. The area you‚Äôre in doesn‚Äôt look like a nuke zone, and if there‚Äôs no one there, and no even marker, either it glitched heavily(unlikely) or they double nuked it and insta killed Earle(more likely, considering two overlapping nukes) , or last option, if you just logged on and saw the nuke marker, they finished it before you came on.(if you just logged on and when you logged on there was already a nuke marker, most likely)
---
I disagree as well. According to dialogue transcripts on the Wiki: The 'First Expeditionary Force' are unable to communicate with Lost Hills due to them losing their long range radio equipment due to a Raider attack near the Rockies (Hence why they lost comms after getting near Lincoln, Nebraska) i don't see it being lore breaking at all - to the contrary i see it as expanding unpon the lore.
---
How i personally see it: The new Appalachia Brotherhood of Steel are about helping people, i believe they'll be their own entity (Similar to the Midwest Brotherhood of Steel from Fallout Tactics) they'll still be called 'Brotherhood  of Steel' but their status with Lost Hills will be dark as dark can get.
---
I believe we'll definitely hear about the Appalachia Brotherhood in Fallout 5 - maybe some rumors/bits and pieces, keep it vague like how the Midwest detachment was in Fallout 3/4.
---
This way it won't piss off the hardcore fans.
---
I myself am a hardcore Fallout fan/lore person but even I'm fully aware that the Brotherhood coming hack to West Virginia isn't an issue at all. It's up to Bethesda to decide, not us.
---
There was an atomic shop item that was a lamp with a fish inside

Ohhhhhhhhhh, is it like the SBQ ok I get it.

I'll have to wait for someone to nuke it again &amp; get there fast. I'm available as backup &amp; willing to give two nuke cards to anyone who wants to come on the euro servers &amp; nuke it :D
---
Water purifiers at your camp you'll be swimming in caps soon enough I also run westtek with butchers bounty. Glowing meat steak sells for 10caps with hard bargain 3 and grape mentats and 3 charisma. After doing a few runs you'll have loads to sell
---
It just works
---
I have also noticed some of the Crit shots just don't apply visual number wise. I actually utilise that 50% Crit dmg perk on most of my guns and also run the Luck 40% crit dmg card. 
---
Apparently flicking out and back into VATS will fix it according to these lads so I'll be giving it a go to see how it is :D
---
It's always something ain't it?
---
1800. Bruh go outside or read a book üíÄ üìñ
---
Pretty sure when legendary perks come you will scrap perk cards for perk coins. 
---
It's my assumption that you will want a lot of perk cards to scrap on your main to get the legendary perks.
---
If your thinking you have enough.. you almost definitely don't. At least to equip and max six legendary perks.
---
Inb4 mass downvote. Idc he has to hear this eventually
---
Yes it is a nuke zone LOOK at the screengrab :D
---
you can see it on the map
---
The second pic is back at my camp which isn't a nuke zone
---
Each time it happens to me i just reload and it seems to fix it
---
I wonder if it's something intertwined with the whole Non-GunFu VATS cancellation. (When not using GunFu the game must think I've killed a target and actively forces me out of VATS whilst I am spam firing)
---
Since I've only really had the issue whilst using GunFu, yet if I don't use GunFu well.. It kicks me out of VATS all the time xD ahah
---
Either way I'll give the ole VATS flick in and out a try next time it happens, thank you
---
don't do this, i regret all the gold I spent on mine.  Can't even one shot a super mutant outside vats exploit
---
So now they are stuck with tons of plans that wont sell,and you have a cleaner inventory and caps
---
goddammit, I knew alexa would rat me out, that bitch...
---
I've got a 'build up CAMP or workshop' (1/5) that refused to move all week. 
---
I built a 3 story, 3 bed 2 bath brick house at one workshop and even decorated it. Challenge never registered.
---
Raider bot is better. Bos bot is just a pretty looking scrap collector (which says a lot about the BOS heehee)
---
Out of doing Earle 40 or 50 times my magic gauss mini has only been magical twice. Usually I am doing 7-22 damage and it takes a lot of ammo. The first time it worked it was only me and a level 62 and I melted him. I thought maybe because no one else was hitting it. But the second time there were 7 other players and we were all hitting him. I had ease up or else I would have vaporized him and been one of those d**ks that melts Earle with no one else getting a hit. I can‚Äôt figure out why it usually doesn‚Äôt work and then every once in a long while it does.
---
Hence the name Daily Quests. You can Randomly Encounter them in the world but you'd probably find that just as frustrating.
---
Don‚Äôt be surprised if you die, I myself struggle with the event at level 230-ish.
---
You misunderstand... I just mean if you unlocked it but didn‚Äôt claim it.
---
Dont forget to mention you're vegan.......
---
but you get 1400 x 7 per week plus all the rewards from kills and quests.  I had to start buying a serum plan a week to keep under 30,000
---
It's getting so tiresome that they continually force the "big names" in Fallout games constantly. This was a chance to explore new things in a time period the games didn't really touch yet here we are fighting Super Mutants, Deathclaws, Brotherhood of Steel and Enclave stuff.
---
I say it again.
---
NW was just a try to get on the BR hype and grap so much money they could until the hype is over. Now the gamemode wasn‚Äôt lucrative and the BR hype is pretty much over  and they move on to other things. The same thing happened to BF BR for example. This gamemode will probably stay dead
---
Yep I blast them all to oblivion.
---
Must be love
---
You can bulk aluminium and lead to save a bit of weight too.
---
I pretty much agree, but at least on pc, every match is full of players. So it would be shame to bury this game mod. Pvp in not perfect in this game, but its not that bad either.
---
Edit: Thank you everybody for the wealth of information
---
I don't think that's even your WiFi. I run a 100MB wired connection on PS4 and CAMPs can still take ten seconds to load. The amount of times I've spawned in and someone's CAMP loads in around me so I'm stuck in a wall...
---
I think Mantis is just hopping on the bandwagon. He sounded like he didn't fully know what he was talking about.
---
In another thread i spoke my piece about it and some insight on what we'll expect.
---
I can paste what i said to this comment but feel free to look at my feel.
---
But yeah i hate it how people claim to know things when they actually are just spitballing.
---
This. I sell all my plans cheap because why horde that crap? Go to a camp with 300+ plans, excited hopefully they have one I don‚Äôt know and it‚Äôs all super overpriced crap for 300-1000 caps each...
---
Man I have had over 5,000 5mm at 1 cap each, noone buys, only amm that sells for me is 
---
45 and 5.56. All the other ammo I give to a low level player anytime I come across one.
---
The sbq and earle are not immune to explosions.
---
There's nowhere near enough content to keep endgame players interested.  Don't get me wrong the game has it's flaws but I'd rather have new content and just continue to put  up with said flaws.
---
I hope it's a mega plot twist and they're the fucking bad guys for a change. I mean, true prick mean-streak ones gone totally rogue. 
---
Maybe they roll in and give Foundation grief, mess up Meg's crew a bit and waylay Blue Ridge runs for supplies. Then we as the true Appalachians band together to drive them back and hold the region. 
---
Wouldn't that be such a cool change of pace from the stoogey rod-in-the-ass buckets we always get. We already have boy scouts in Appalachia. 
---
I wonder how they feel about gold.... Not their deal usually, however that gold could possibly buy them tech they can't obtain through force....
---
Fuck I need ammo. I'm getting paranoid....
---
There's a lot of bugs with vats.
---
Some weapons don't do any damage in vats, like the assaultron head.
---
The bow (and I think the gauss rifle as well, not sure) always misses the first vats shot.
---
No idea what causes it, but vats sometimes breaks and all the shots fail (literally all the shots. You can unload an entire magazine and miss all of them, no matter how high your hit chance is). Closing and reopening vats usually fixes it.
---
Enemies are totally immune to vats shots if they are in the middle of an "animation". For example, scorchbeasts won't take any damage if you shot them with vats when they are landing.
---
Pick your favorite bug xD
---
Bruh how lol
---
I feel your pain. I learned to time it based upon the sound of the radar dish. Stand at the stairs where they all spawn. After they all die, count 7 beeps of the sound dish then toss a grenade at the ground in front of you. You can get at least a few tags that way. Problem is bodies go flying everywhere, so it's harder to loot.
---
Agreed. I suppose I would also be called a food build, but I spend most of my time cleaning up around bosses and reviving bloodies, then trying to get some tags in to at least get the reward. Or being the pylon. All the unfun stuff : P
---
Once I was waking past Sutton and saw a camp on my compass so I was like ohh I‚Äôll check it out and it looked really good from a distance then I realised it was mine
---
She's been hinting heavily with me. I have gotten several bloodied weapons which I will save for an alt.  My favorite is a bloodied mole miner gauntlet. 
---
And two heavy weapons and a light SMG for yet another alt. 
---
Let's see what she gives me during the sale.
---
About as nerfed as everything else will be?
---
Yeh ppl need more incentive to play.. Takes 5-10 minutes to get into a match. I'm actually really enjoying it atm but the wait is to much for the little time I get to play these days. So much potential, could even turn it into a big boss fight, rather than just pvping. I wouldn't want the BR mode to disappear though, just more rewards and choice to keep things fresh.
---
It's still the best weapon in the game ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Wendigo spawn.
---
Yes x2 but nothing triggers
---
That's not a sufficient answer. I needed a percent of the amount it was nerfed. Or like a number in general
---
If I activate Vats Crit at the end of a magazine, after the reload it doesn't register the crit. I've learned to be patient and watch my magazine in VATS. 
---
It. Just. Works.
---
Numbers?
---
Welcome :D
---
Aaah. Pneumatic mods and blocker (strength perk)
---
Ez fix bro
---
Not sure if it was mentioned, but the settlers at least have a random encounter where the person just talks to you, says you're better than being a raider, and she see's something in you, then you get a bit of rep. That one spawns east of the overseer's camp and south of slocum's joe at the house there, and other places, but for sure there. She hides behind the garage chopping wood. Really weird one.
---
I will try with a qerty keyboard but it very sad üò¢ you know you tu report bug like this ?
---
Didn't they remove all the rewards you get from it like the Ghillie suit and that?
---
When it states explosions I'm assuming that its explosions form things like fragmentation grenades and similar. The orbital strike beacon too, because I see people get direct hits on the SBQ but the health doesn't move an inch. Explosive weapons do still do damage to these bosses
---
Very sad situation we have there ... I will try to report the bug. You should do the same
---
I guess if you log in for even enough time to collect free stuff it puts their numbers up?
---
Wait a week and find out. Knowing the number won't change it.
---
Or do the math yourself. It's now additive instead of multiplicative.
---
If I don't have to go chasing after them or they don't  have Lenendary next to their name, I don't bother. Except for the rude one at Foundation, as many times I helped bringing your stuff back. 1st off you rushing me and 2nd you honna tell me you got you eye on me, well hell man go get you own stuff.
---
Hey every little bit of help works!! That's a huge plus!! Sadly I know some who have partners that gets angry if they get on any game at all at any time. 
---
My husband is a trip with it. He will come home from work and he's like "Hey Babe, I read  XYZ today that is coming up on 76" or "Did you know that X weapon/build is getting a nerf??" Or he sends me articles and videos all day... 
---
He's an Engineer so once he gets to work if they have nothing going on he's just kind of there until something comes up or they take care of everything within the first few hours then goofs off the rest of the day üôÑü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§£
---
And thus, the mass downvoting for asking a question shall commence!
---
Idk. How many times can a crack get bigger before it becomes a hole? I understand delays and issues and the hard work behind it. But it‚Äôs lacking
---
I think he just did, couldn't help himself.
---
Yeh they were limited unfortunately. I just know when they have decent rewards then more ppl play.
---
They did patch the limited time rewards coming back out. So you can no longer get them (atm any way)
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank#Rewards
---
But there are still plenty of other rewards you can earn
---
I have no idea how that works or how to calculate that. Im just trying to prepare and do the best I can so id rather not wait
---
Modus pregnant... pause is excellent.
---
Gotta love them Matrix SB's ahahahha
---
Um...I think your shoe lace is untied.
---
Best place for crimson is Cranberry Bog?
---
Yeah I remember I was playing for the Ghillie suit to go with the SS armour. Then one day it just vanished and I never played nuclear winter again
---
Google how to do it.
---
There's no way to prepare. It's happening no matter what. Your gun will do the damage it does. Bloodied will still be strongest. And all perk cards will still add damage.
---
And people are down voting you because you came across rather rude in your response. Not because you asked a question.
---
you can get marginal control of the spawn point, by adjusting where you place your C.A.M.P. and can do that after your base has been built.  
---
It's just a case of placing it, fast travelling to your camp again, seeing where you appear moving the C.A.M.P. again fast travelling, until your happy where your spawn point is.
---
&gt;I hope it's a mega plot twist and they're the fucking bad guys for a change.
---
They absolutely weren't the good guys in Fallout 4...
---
Just mind your own business, it's a game that's known for being buggy and glitchy as hell since it's inception, no game should be taken seriously, let alone Fallout 76...
---
Right, I get that. *If* it's about delays. But isn't this just Bethesda saying "we're doing it at this particular time" and sticking to it?
---
I mean, judging by 76's record so far I'm not expecting anything stellar from this update, in fact there's a decent chance it'll even be quite boring. I'm sure a fair share of people will feel that it's lackluster, which is reasonable to expect. Nobody has to praise a subpar product. But complaining ahead of time about its predetermined release date? Kinda just feels like looking for anything and everything to criticize.
---
From what I understand its all a big fuss over nothing for most of us. The top end food/lbloodied builds are losing about 30-40% percent in damage. 
---
Those figures are meaningless unless you run with a full on build. You would have to using every stackable buff in the game to feel that level of effect.
---
I‚Äôm fine with being picked on like one of the guys. We are all human, no need to act differently or put so much into your 3 schools of thought. Women are simply human, just like you and your guy friends.
---
Damn reading this I hope people don't get the wrong impression about my camp/vendors. 
---
Any plan I get that I've already read I throw it up for 1 cap regardless what it is. This is mainly intended for newer players but also passing on the feeling of going to someone's camp and they have 1 cap plans you can get. I offer any legendaries I don't want for equal to their level required so 50 caps for a lvl 50 so either someone can enjoy the legendary or can buy it cheap and get the scrip for it. Sell radx and radaway cheap because I have so much weighing me down (even with the weight reduction perks) with the occasional stimpak I can spare (often the supers). Uhh I'll offer spare prewar food, alcohol and bubblegum for those challenges.
---
Sell every ammo for 1 cap (bar mini nukes at 10 each); unfortunately I don't sell .45, 5.56, 308 or fusion cells as that's the ammo I use and can't have too much.
---
Generally just sell stuff cheap as because I don't need caps and well I would like the stash space; helping out others that want stuff without being asked a small fortune is just a nice bonus
---
If it helps I started playing the first Fallout before my oldest was a year old, so he has grown up with the franchise. From there we always made it a game of him playing while I would play, no matter the game. I always made sure he had his own controller (even when little, his just didn't work üòâ) As for a spouse/partner, if you're single, make sure they have some of the same likes as you as far as gaming. My husband didn't care for FO at first as he didn't care for games with loading screens like FO has. He knew I really enjoyed the franchise so he suffered through and now enjoys playing as well.. granted I think I'm still more into it than he is, but it's definitely something we can spend a lot of time doing together! Plus bonus is for the most part once you both have consoles and tvs its relatively cheap!
---
Ha! Jokes on you, I‚Äôm not wearing shoes right now! Just ignore the fact I still looked even though I‚Äôm still in bed.
---
Cobalt and Yellowcake are in abundance around Monongah so once ACP launched I was easily able to finally gather enough.
---
Stabilizing material should be your first priority. There is no point in gathering flux before you have a stockpile of stabilizing mats. 
---
You can easily farm flux solo from any nuke zone, but gathering the stabilizing material will require nuking an area with lots of spawns like Whitesprings. Since people fight the queen outside the zone, you can't reliably get the material there. 
---
A word of warning. 2 of the stabilizing materials are listed as Junk and will be auto scrapped if you aren't careful. 
---
One final thing. Flux that isn't stabilized will spoil and become inert flux. You can drink this for a large boost to thirst, for a meager 5 points of rads. I've taken to only drinking inert, and selling all my purified.
---
Tbf... I didn't know you could get prime for this ü§£
---
More so burned out with the already awful grind and repetition I have done for so long. I can only get so many legendaries that disappoint me before I‚Äôm just bleh. I have a very positive outlook for this update. But was flustered to hear that it‚Äôs not even right after this season. I am excited for all the new stuff I want to see the direction it takes.
---
The ghillie suit covers armor.... It's an outfit. The skins for the actual armor came from the legendary run.
---
I was not expecting for them to release the collectron the day after the challenge concluded in the middle of the week. I think in the past they usually wait a week or until reset to add an item to claim in the shop after a challenge. I only managed to grab it because I logged in to make sure I had claimed everything from LR before they took that down. =/  
---
Hope your break from the game was refreshing at least; probably not relaxing since I saw your Iron Horse post a couple days ago lol.
---
I mean yea for some dude that runs around with a vampires shotgun and cant solo a boss im sure it's not a big whoop, but for people who have fun soeed running bosses and have spent months getting good stuff it is a bit of a big deal
---
Would integrate well with ‚Äúone wasteland‚Äù, don‚Äôt you think?
---
If the event popup isn't there it's already done and over. The event is not active for the entire duration of the nuke zone, only for a couple of minutes after the nuke dropped.
---
I‚Äôll look into that right now.
---
I know I mainly wanted the helmet
---
You may still have the beret. I missed the beret and fatigues due to being without internet during a house move, but last night was crafting some outfits and was surprising to see the beret and fatigues there available to make.
---
(Don't know about the sign, I haven't checked.)
---
Similarly, I‚Äôve looked at a camp vendor listing on the map, thought ‚Äòlol, try harder mate,‚Äô then realised it was my own camp.
---
Well when there is a raider thief I need to kill in order to return the stolen goods, well I need to get rid of whiteness
---
Mixed reviews and not one solid one as of yet. Be patient mate, we've all got work to do once the update drops.
---
Cant say my results are the same. I have the bug and dont have any primed guns. Usually switching between my gauss shotgun, cattle prod and vats unknown. It usually ignores the vats unknown and switches between the other 2. No matter what was equipped before. 
---
Also happens on another character
---
Not for asking itself, but for demanding to be spoon fed an answer that is not available.
---
You want to be told numbers, yet the numbers depend on the loadout, because it's not the weapon that gets "balanced" but the way the damage will be calculated.
---
Tbh im just gonna quit if its bad lol
---
Ah, I see. I'm not nearly as worn down because I've only been playing a pretty small amount lately. I've been similarly burned out on seasonal gameplay models in so many games that I didn't even bother putting much time into 76 after that system started up.
---
I'm not asking a lot hear man. Yall are acting like I'm making you do calculus
---
Yeah, stuff has been incredibly slow to load in for the last few months. My connection is fine with every other game, but here whenever I fast travel to a camp I immediately get some distance as it‚Äôs still popping into existence and I don‚Äôt want to meld with a wall.
---
I hate traveling to a camp and then not being able to find the vending machines... If you make it hard to find your vendors I'll just leave.  
---
The other day I traveled to a camp and immediately got a... weird vibe? Like, I couldn't put my finger on it, but it was really creepy somehow, kind of like the person who built it just wasn't quite right in the head.  I noped the fuck out real fast.  ü§£
---
Yeh I hear that alot, kids these days don't understand how good they've got it. God forbid something becomes a challenge.
---
Y'all gonna make me?
---
Do it yourself then?
---
They should not be starting season 2 AT ALL until the auto-complete bug is completely and entirely fixed, and from reports, there are still cases of it happening.
---
Anytime I walk up to a camp that's just a giant cube-shaped building I lower my expectations into the dirt.
---
That's why I said for most of us.... I am sure we will still be able to 1 shot most enemies and as long as I can run westek on a single reload of my Q fixer I don't mind. 
---
We where never supposed to be able to solo the SBQ, it was always supposed to be a hard boss to fight, the idea was to make a boss that would require team work to kill. 
---
I can understand the few players that this will actually affect will be upset, but they could have done a lot worse. They could have outright capped damage instead.
---
Yeah boi I can finally go ham with it rather than just being stingy, may have to work in luck of the draw though
---
Was that on Xbox? I think I've been to that camp, I was kinda impressed!
---
I get it, you want to know how much the value decreases. 
---
The answer is impossible to give, if you want a rough estimate,  hop on the PTS and see for yourself. But remember that is by no way the final shit you'll see there. It's just a start for beth's balancing act, and no one knows if the nerf on the pts will be going live 1:1 or if there will be again some last minute changes.
---
Well the rewards are nice. But it‚Äôs completely useless after reaching max
---
I've started dumping my mounted plans in a bag next to the Wayward when I remember... Hopefully some noobie comes along and gets excited about it like I was when I found a big bag of plans!
---
I would like it if you could have negative rep. If you piss of the raiders enough they send death squads after you like the legion did in FNV. Or the settlers chase you out of town. I'm not saying it should be an either or situation you could have negative or max rep with both. Just want some RP opportunities.
---
I'd like to see a conflict between the Mothman Cultists and Free Radicals, due to their proximity to one another.
---
Yes this one it is a trap camp I saw next to the Rusty Pick.
---
He'll steal your stuff while your at his machines
---
https://postimg.cc/bdmPks22
---
Apparently there was a few people who experienced having players coming and completely emptying their vendor inventory. Then somehow their personal stash items popped up for free in the vendor inventory and could essentially be stolen.
---
Because PA is supposed to be rare and complicated kit
---
It‚Äôs insane vendors don‚Äôt shut down
---
Even when you got really close you still could not activate the vendor menu?
---
Yeah, you've got that right. Seasons work better as additions to the content available in the game. If it feels like there's nothing else worth doing, the season will never last long enough. In a game like 76 where it's so easy to run out of meaningful gameplay, a season can't be the only content lifeline.
---
I generally try and have every category accounted for in my vendors. I'll sell plans for 10% cost, ammo for 1 cap, fusion cores for 50, got bobbleheads for 100, mags for 100, stims for 30.
---
I sell whatever I can't scrip for cost just to get rid and even with being right near a train station I seem to get hardly any traffic!
---
I have a load of plans that I already know in a vending machine all set to 0 caps with the caption "Take what you need, Leave what you don't" to help people out. (Been watching Fear the walking dead! Lol) ..no one has taken the piss so far.  On ps4.
---
Kittysloth is the person looking at the globe in the picture (and also the photographer for this, I'm holding the gun). I Googled the names of meat companies because all I know is Tyson. :)
---
We all started as low levels.  
---
If someone gives you help just remember to thank them and don't start asking for stuff constantly.  Especially high level gear that rarely drops.  Helped a guy the other day, gave him a good three star gun and stims and steel.  Next day he was asking for a QE Handmade and when I didn't answer right away - I was busy doing the colossus - he sent me 5 more messages in 10 minutes.  Blocked him.
---
If there's one game that deserves it though...
---
Fallout 4 was all about how nothing is black and white only gray, it was about making choices based on your own philosophical and moral viewpoints.
---
None of the factions could be seen as truly righteous in their beliefs, except maybe the minutemen but they were boring, one dimensional and annoying.
---
A piggy bank in your camp that all caps earned from your vendor go into, you can withdraw but not deposit. Need to return to camp to access but still have the same carry limit.
---
I agree with you. But I wont go through that arch to have a look at any vendor. It's obvious to me that those players have enough caps already and don't want mine.
---
I'm predicting they will probably be in a update in November.... If there not delayed
---
Worse when you fast travel to a camp that isn't there anymore... quality bethesda, quality.
---
Could even have the daily spend limit set to match the carry limit. No missed caps, rules still in play for carry and what would effectively be a credit limit for daily spending.
---
MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA !!!! END GAME ??? LOL
---
Do you have a piece of Perfectly Preserved Pie ?
---
I think it's because in F4 you couldn't side with the bad guys, or be a evil character (untill the DLCs). The fans complained. And beth misunderstood, they spend more time on the raider faction put more effort in their characters and story. They thought we all wanted to be evil characters meantime we wanted both, RP good and evil characters.
---
I agree with you 100% it just seems like bad/lazy writing on bethesdas part to add the brotherhood just because they're well known. Also on the note of deathclaws and super mutants thats also just lazy. From my understanding deathclaws were so rare in California they were basically a myth (might be wrong ny fo1 lore isnt the best) 
---
Same with super mutants, with all the fucked up things they did before the war you'd think something other than supermutants would've been made.
---
BOS collection still is a xenophobic asshole who reminds you to kill the muties, take your radX so you stay human, and kills all aspirations of being a wasteland architect.
---
Ohio river adventures
---
Whelp, first I heard of it. Would have been nice if they meant the 8th when they said it. Can't even do days of the week right it seems.
---
OK, well drop a list of the buffs you run currently, also what perks and mutations and i will be able to work out what the reduction on your DPS will be.
---
Because it obscures the rewards list.
---
The weapon itself hasn't been nerfed at all. Just builds that utilize multiple bonuses. 
---
If it's bloodied, adrenal, commando perks, sneak perks and nerd rage you're relying on, you go down from 1400% base damage to 460% base damage, so a 2/3 drop (or, if you wanna compare, fairly close to the damage you currently deal when not sneaking). If you used less stacking bonuses, you lose less. If you use more, you lose more. 
---
What this means is a few things. The more damage bonuses you stack, the better other prefixes become. Anti armor or quad become better dps the more food and tenderizer and team bonuses and legendary perks and booze and whatnot you mix in. Two shot becomes much better comparatively than it is now. Losing stealth is only a slight drawback instead of a major hit like it is now.
---
Yep, unless it is something you can use on the weapons or armor you have, sell it in your vendor on the cheap, or drop them somewhere convenient or someone else to find, or scrapperoo.
---
The entire economy is broken in this game. I spend more time trying to find ways to rid myself of caps without adding weight.
---
Have you a trusted friend who could hold onto the shot gun whilst you switch characters?
---
Who knows maybe the reason they are taking atlas has something to do with the Zetans and they end up covering up the early years of their organization. 
---
Really spin offs don't usually end up matching lore anyway though.
---
On my main I do what I feel like at that moment. 
---
On my BoS RP character I kill the raiders on sight and help the settlers, just a pity I'll never get the ammo machine.
---
Oh dear me your words have truly moved me. I am a changed man. I will see to it I never ever post a shower in front of my vending machines ever again. /s boo fucking hoo.
---
I say AA. Junkies was multiplicative and it got nerfed by a decent amount. AA on the other hand wasn‚Äôt touched at all. Even if junkies is 2% stronger, you have no addictions to manage for AA.
---
Fuck yes. Nice
---
Except handedness is irrelevant in archery. I'm right-handed and I shoot a bow left-handed in real life because I'm left eye dominant. Left-handed shooting for the bow in the game makes sense, unlike the left-handed rifles.
---
What did it look like?
---
I‚Äôve said before and some people think it‚Äôs a snowflake attitude, but this game is a form of mental abuse because of the amount of frequent time it demands. We‚Äôre now in a position where we‚Äôve all PAID for a finished game. They give us free new content, but force us to log in every day to achieve it and forcing us to declare our devotion to the game. It‚Äôs honestly a toxic, controlling way to reward existing players. New content should be given or abele to be earned at people‚Äôs leisure - and if it‚Äôs free, it should be a content drop. 
---
You know how, in like nearly every other online game, you log in after a couple months and get 15 notifications that new stuff has been unlocked? That‚Äôs the fair way to do it. Not require players to log in every day to get something free and/or complete mundane challenges like ‚Äútake a photo‚Äù.
---
I don‚Äôt think  AA or TS I‚Äôll be effected by the change. The reason is that the change is on how bonus damage for an attack is calculated. AA isn‚Äôt bonus damage, it‚Äôs a change to the amount a damage the enemy mob can negate. As such it will still be applied to all damage dealt and thus stay multiplicative. TS is also a corner case because it actually creates a second round at 25% dmg. Since TS is not an actual bonus to a rounds damage I believe it will also remain unchanged. 
---
As a side note, AA will be pretty much the same bonus dmg as junkies for any mob with half decent armor.
---
Steel Dawn Army Fatigues September 2 - September 7
---
Brotherhood of Steel Collectron September 4 - September 7.
---
It's in the next paragraph. It's really frustrating they did it like this
---
im not actually converned by the brotherhood arriving
---
 as its probably a small chapter thats far different from the brotherhood we know later in the timeline and therefore it could be interesting.
---
What im more let down by is the fact that they decided to add a whole new storyline to the game rather than fleshing out the one we have.
---
Wastelanders was a bit dissapointing to me when i learned that other than the main story, there wasnt a lot of content. Exploring the crater and foundation wasnt rewarded with any notable npcs, and definitely no sidequest.
---
picking a side didnt really matter as you never felt like you joined either faction anyways.
---
You know theres a little clinic room in foundation but there is no doctor that gives you a quest.
---
theres this water purifiers in crater but no mechanic that asks you on a mission to retrieve some upgrades.
---
I could go on but basically sidequests and there rewards made towns, villages and the factions work in other fallout games
---
when you did all the sidemissions in a town or a faction you felt connected to them and had a good idea about what their motives are.
---
But the absence of any depth rather than the main storyline made the whole wastelanders experience quite shallow.
---
I thought well, this is the groundwork they laid and they are probably going to improve on it later on.
---
With the next big update immediately focusing on something entirely new (the BOS), i cant see how they would improve. 
---
Its most likely going to be the exact same thing over again.
---
Recieve a radio message that tells you to contact the brotherhood,
---
they will be arseholes that you need to convince in order to help them 
---
there will be one NPC that gives you a quest after another and one other NPC that gives you daily missions.
---
Other than that youll most likely only see some named soldiers and scribes walking around the compound with skyrimguardlike generic
---
dialogue.
---
you wont see little outposts on the map that have content hidden inside them.
---
And you wont feel like a part or an enemy of the brotherhood after you finished the new questline either.
---
Thats obviously all just a big guess and speculation from my side, and id love to be proven wrong but lets say im sceptical not because its the brotherhood they are focusing, but rather the fact that they focus on anything but there current story at all.
---
What does a Collectron do ?
---
And how often does the Atom shop refresh ?
---
how is this nsfw?
---
I don't understand how the servers often still perform poorly, given that I'd assume Bethesda were hoping for *more* players and therefore more traffic.
---
advise you just push on through on your quests and get to level 50. Buy 2\* from purveyor at Rusty Pick as you go.
---
Yes they are very disappointing, so much so that I scrapped my evil character. I'm still hoping beth is going somewhere with this, the raiders are luring us in, giving us a false sense of security. And then just as we all think they actually are these nice "we are good people that welkoms everybody" bland raider, the other shoe drops, they sprung their trap.
---
I can turn them off on the map but technically they‚Äôre still active and people will still buy from them if they can. I don‚Äôt like it either but I don‚Äôt want to lose good items due to max caps. Blame Bethesda for not having an easier way.
---
Not sure if you know...  A 'new' icon appears on the home page when there is an unclaimed free item in the shop.
---
who cares. it's a gun for wasteland barbie's.
---
real players use pipe pistols.
---
I checked, they‚Äôre not there. Maybe you got lucky somehow
---
That‚Äôs what I was wondering. If we face the same enemy and the level 1 takes half the health with two shots, will it appear as half health for me?
---
That raid is so fucking awesome. I'm not surprised design doc was leaked for world first, imagine trying to figure it out cold
---
The math says that AA and junkies will be pretty similar in dmg. If your non Legendary effect bonus dmg is greater than 77% then AA will actually give you more dmg against any mob with at least 29% dmg reduction from armor. On low armor mobs there will of course be diminishing returns.
---
I‚Äôve been playing daily since March and it finally happened to me yesterday! I feel blessed!
---
First I thought 0 human deaths,  that's not the Enclave thing to do. Then I remembered the Enclave think they are the only untainted/un-mutated real humans left. Well played.
---
this would be absolutely ace and add a lot to the community
---
Nope, never been experiencing that. Usually there are some good stuff. Overpriced, and i'm not looking for it anyway cuz i play trash build, but still.
---
I would wax poetic but I guess I should just say thank you. So, thank you. Thank you indeed.
---
I kill every settler on sight. Because Ward.
---
How bout dah?
---
I don‚Äôt know if I like that. I don‚Äôt want every battle to be a major fight. Sometimes I like to run through morganton airport and plink on some easy scorched and loot the place. So it‚Äôs going to basically nerf me so lower levels can keep up? Why did I spend all that time and effort leveling up then?
---
I‚Äôm hoping they finally release the quest where you have to run for President and you get access to the rest of the enclave bunker as a result. That‚Äôs be nice plus wouldn‚Äôt it be perfect timing with the current election?
---
With max weapon bonus plus bloody mess (75% total bonus dmg) they are EXACTLY the same dmg.
---
If it's the same as how Anthem handled it then yes, that could make low level teammates insanely powerful leveling tools for high level content
---
It would also make strike beacons useful
---
Wow, that‚Äôs pretty crazy...
---
Since you asked, no.
---
Not unless you have a couple thousand perk points
---
Well BF did get updates with the base game, but EA abandoned BFV. It was a great game mode, despite having a lot of flaws, but still got updates. And I hardly see how Bethesda could make money off NW. I havent seen anything in the atom shop just for NW.
---
NOOOOO! I thought it would be up for a whole week. Why Bethesda? Now I couldn't claim it.
---
At this point i kill everything that gives me xp lol
---
Or not?: [https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-76-is-a-surprisingly-sharp-reflection-of-how-we-could-survive-the-apocalypse/](https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-76-is-a-surprisingly-sharp-reflection-of-how-we-could-survive-the-apocalypse/)
---
We'll be 14 points short, each stat can go to 13 if you want everything even
---
They came to Appalachia JUST to move goods back and forth through the tunnel. There are no wagon trains leading to or away from either tunnel entrance. Also, where are they suggesting they're taking the goods? There are no settlements in the Bog or the Ash Heap.
---
I have this same problem with my combat rifle it‚Äôs at 7 rounds and it just auto reloads
---
Depends on your point of view
---
Yes. Yesterday. 
---
I am level 29 and only just discovered I COULD fast travel to other's camps and so off I went Travelled to someone's camp in Toxic Valley and landed deep in some highly toxic waters, instantly muted (a crappy one) and the rads nearly killed me. Equal parts panic and laughing when it happened.
---
Yeah, it's really annoying when people just complain about bugs and Bethesda just keeps ignoring them.
---
I feel so sorry for you.
---
It's hard to describe, but it was three buildings, all built at weird angles to each other, so you'd go out one door and the corner of the next building was in your face.  There were stairs that didn't lead anywhere. The floor in one of the rooms was covered in animal skin rugs, all kind of forming a ring. There was a door you couldn't open because a piano was just randomly blocking it... I dunno, it was kind of like one of those paintings (Escher?) where you can't tell if the stairs are going up or down, lol.
---
And we‚Äôll kick their ass if they try.
---
Mild swearing, also best to be causious because people have didn‚Äôt tolerances to that.
---
I was going to, then I decided I didn't wanna he the generic good-guy protagonist, to switch it up a little. Now, I'm a cannibalistic raider wearing Ritual clothing.
---
I learned quick to sell ammo at 1c or give it away, though since the ammo converter came in i've noticed you can get away with charging a cap for shit like .38
---
I play on Xbox, and I've tried everything, even resetting the console, but nothing works.
---
I already tried to use the terminal first and then inserting the T-Fuse, but it also didn't worked.
---
I guess that I'll have to live with the fact that until they fix it (if ever) I'll only be able to do daily missions, events or side quests :/
---
It's not the end of the world, it's not like the game is unplayable...it's just disappointing...
---
Given the topic of this post I really didn't think a /s was necessary.
---
explain that last part again?
---
I run away abit when I spawn at a camp. Got stuck in too many walls. Then I would fall off a cliff lol. So now I make sure it's not a cliff and run out a little. If its a cliff. I see if its easy to get to camp, if not I move on.
---
Thanks for the ugly snort of laughter I just did üòÇ
---
My whole economy (5 playbable chars) revolves around flux and it has been more than a year that I farmed raw flux. I get all my flux from Scorched Earth and Collossal problem. Never really felt the need to go farm and make it.
---
My camp sells every plan for 1 cap. No matter what. Lol
---
I feel the same. I play rifleman, but now also carry an explosive 90%rw .05 machine gun and have all the heavy weapon damage perks equipped, for boss fights.
---
Imagine using Fallout Tactics to justify something.
---
Hyped for the update where they add rainbow super mutants!
---
I had it happen once all season, the one time I happened to be playing during the reset. 
---
Made a point of logging out 10 min before reset and logging back in 10 min after and never had the bug again.
---
Its a closed cult, only true family members are going to join it
---
If your B2525 fixer did 302 dmg then after nerf it would be 161.
---
I've taken up commando once finding a Two Shot Bash Damage Railway Rifle.
---
Bash damage makes it magic, and automatic two shot is fast enough to take advantage of this when using VATS. Two shot also means I should get twice as many spikes back, so it takes a good while before I run out. Unfortunately the spikes are quite heavy when carried in bigger piles.
---
I have seen camp i wish i could unsee.
---
Like they looked purposefull awful.
---
Floating platform vendors spread between levels, stairs blocked by trash.
---
Id feel no guilt bait bombing those shitheaps to rubble.
---
I'm on a cliff, and I spent SO LONG fucking around with the spawn point so people wouldn't fall of the edge and would drop in somewhere convenient. Seems like basic courtesy really.
---
just go into build and disconnect the wiring to them
---
Or going camping for labor day weekend
---
Ah, I'm sorry to hear that. I don't know how I ended up with them then.
---
Same here, it seems like they only stated it once and that was as far as it went.
---
Where do you farm lead for this process? I am interested in a similar gig, but don't know a good, steady source of lead.
---
Ah, the old loading camp dash. I know it well. Happens at my own camp too when I first log in. I got to high tail it about 30 feet or I get stuck in my concrete floor everytime.  Ugh. You never know with another players camp, so like you, I always run for cover until their camp loads.
---
I'm interested. Hmu on DM's! I'd like to know more
---
From what I can remember about the games before F4, it was only in F4 that the BoS wanted to kill everything that wasn't human. It's like they were infiltrated by the Enclave. It's ironic because in F3 the BoS fights to stop the Enclave from killing everything they don't consider pure human.
---
Improvise, adapt, overcome.
---
Sadly I am friendless. It's not a huge deal, more ironic than anything. Is it actually ironic? Or is it Alanis Morrissette ironic? I'm tired.
---
Just gave it a watch, he is glossing over some major issues to make his point sound reasonable.  
---
Off the top of my head.   
---
1.Three functional nuclear silos.   
---
2.Weather control facility.  
---
3.Area untouched by nukes.   
---
4.Lost connection with Appalachian section.  
---
5.The threat of the scorched plague.  
---
6.Three functioning power plants.  
---
 Yep, no reason whatsoever for them to check that out.
---
Unlikely to be fully integrated as a joinable faction as they are the true Anarchist Raiders of the wasteland and as such they wouldn't be very welcoming to outsiders who are already allied to either of their competitors. The game would have to introduce a brutal method of negative reputation (as opposed to the current one which relies on stupidly small increments and so very, very slow to lose rank) to enable a fair representation of consequences of siding with opposing factions. This could probably be introduced fairly easily but the fallout with dropping it in a mature game where top level faction rewards are already owned by a large proportion of the player base would be very problematic - imagine if Beth announced you could join non-Raider/Settler factions but you would have to give up your Gold Bullion weapons and items if you nolonger qualified for the required reputation rank...there would be hell to pay.
---
Lucky hole mine near fort defiance, clear it of enemies then while wearing excavator power armor collect the raw lead from the walls you should get roughly 400 ore. Afterwards equipping the super duper perk smelt the lead ore, you'll get at least a couple thousand lead from it.
---
But you are missing out on the treasury notes if you don't do the vault raid until max reputation.
---
Don‚Äôt be sorry dude, thanks for the idea.
---
The sign was one of the few things I actually wanted. Hopefully a friend can place it in my camp, like some of the other atom shop stuff.
---
I got burnt out with legendary run, now I missed the  Fatigues and  Collectron .
---
I can wait
---
When the camp‚Äôs fast travel point is ontop of a million punji boards and radiation emitters.
---
Hey, just because I'm an uncreative fuck doesn't mean I don't sell tons of .50 cal ammo or decent (aka not mounted head) plans for cheap.
---
That's why they have so many plans. I sell my plans for 10-50 caps usually.
---
if you're going scoped, you might try the stabilized limbs for whatever armor set you're using. And handmades have a lot less recoil than fixers, so that might be up your alley
---
They haven‚Äôt been formed yet in the lore
---
Yes, because my camp fast travel spits me out inside of a fucking rock
---
I missed it too as I was away for the weekend. Not happy about it.
---
I am level 600+ and I don't even do Legendaries at most events when other players are around. Because I don't need them they can't possibly give me anything I don't already have. But some people do get bent out of shape because of Greed.
---
The closest we have is a black n white flagpole I managed to snag it when it was available luckily
---
That‚Äôs just ‚Äúremove the cap limit‚Äù with extra steps...
---
Brotherhood Boy Scout....
---
Radshield doesn't suppress the mutations
---
*0.01 I believe
---
People have videos demonstrating the "impact". It all normal mobs but actual outcomes is quite minor. People freak out at raw number loss but in practice it's an extra few milliseconds &amp; a few extra bullets.
---
Arena 1v1, 2v2, 4v4 or 4-for-all would be fun PvP. But just not enough interest in PvP sadly. So much so they changed the original intent of the game. Back in the Asheron's Call days we'd call them all carebears. Surprised that term didn't really stay around. I thought it made sense. But I digress.
---
You ever fast travel to a camp but the seller left the server? Most disappointing thing
---
Amendment: If it's a crappy camp, it gets a bag with fertilizer and toilet paper left on the bed
---
Always priced at 100 and up, despite being trash.
---
I've gotten sooo many msgs about my 30k bobby pins lol
---
And how much time do you spend outside or reading a book? The fact your on a gaming subreddit would suggest not much either
---
I wish...I need more blood eagle corpses to feed my supersledge...
---
They shoehorned the "Appalachian branch" of the brotherhood into a time/place where they didn't exist, and retroactively changed the Fallout history/timeline to gloss over the fact.
---
Also, screw the BOS. I've never like their faction, and don't appreciate the fact that I'm being forced into supporting them.
---
VATS is just buggy in general, same bugs for melee attacks aswell.
---
Yea please that would be great.
---
&gt;I‚Äôll slowly wean myself off of solid food until I can subsist on the drugs.
---
r/rarecomments lmao
---
I think some of it is burnout; people list so much trash it gets exhausting to look at anything that doesn't at least start with Bloodied.
---
Well sure but doesn‚Äôt that just keep it from showing on the map?  If somebody stumbles across the camp they can still access the machine and buy things.
---
You can get a Max of 5 at 15
---
Full Health PA melee... launchin nukes was always a breeze for me.
---
I just want to come home to camp and see that warm smile.
---
They've already buffed Herbivore, so eating is almost a necessity without even thinking about the downsides of starvation/dehydration
---
There was a fish lamp in the atomic shop long ago. I've not seen it offered in a very long time. Fish swam around lamp base when light was on.
---
Nope, slingshot's a slingshot
---
It's very likely a Bethesda problem to help you with.
---
You could try to create a new Bethesda account via their website &amp; try to use that login to connect via steam client but that's pretty much it.
---
I sided with the raiders and still kill all the raiders o come across
---
People like this also called "reasonable". And people who "want to play how they want" and don't take any advices from others often come here to post their rant about how hard is going to be after damage balance and one wasteland, because they already struggle even now.
---
the cap limit exists for a reason, you may not like it, but it serves a purpose.
---
why not ask for cap sinks instead so you (and everyone else) are constantly spending caps so you aren‚Äôt at max.
---
as an added bonus if the sinks are good enough, then people will have less caps to spend in general and prices go down
---
I'd don't want to know how many times I've VATs those armor plated fireflies.
---
Yes, if you go to the far end of the war room (right of where you come in I think) past the lazer grids, you should go up to a room with a few terminals and a bunch of posters.
---
The posters give you a high level idea of the steps you need to do to launch a nuke.
---
The terminals give you the missions to walk you through the bits you need to do in preparation for launching (get a nuke keycard, get the code pieces etc.).
---
The other wall has the decoding cipher you'll need to work out what the code is - this is what Nukacrypt gives, so you if you use this you don't need to code pieces or to work out the cipher, but would still need the keycard.
---
If you want to do the decoding yourself then go for it (particularly the first time), but you might want to look at some websites to give you a bit more detail about how to do this because there's nothing in game that makes it clear.
---
Once you have all this, head to whichever nuke bunker you have the code for (the 3 bunkers have separate codes), and work your way through that.
---
There is a chance that someone else might get to the end of the bunker first and launch the nuke before you can.  This happened to me and was pretty depressing, but hopefully you'll get to do it.
---
I'll try that, thank you üòäüëç
---
Isn't it made pretty clear during the main campaign that we are in a simulation. They can do anything they want with lore in 76.
---
They already reused the same vendor with different colours to sell different things, armour, serums, etc. In the different wings of the enclave so they can obviously reuse the vendor skin with different items because they already have. Just not for us. They could even make it a rare enclave event reward
---
&gt;Well, in my humble opinion: No they don't test. Never did. They players do test and report. The review the reports and decide. Nah, fuck it, it will be fine.. Thats to hard to fix, and not serious enough to postpone the release.
---
This is by far the first online multiplayer game that everyone seems afraid to use a mic that I ever played.  
---
I get the whole anxiety thing, but I‚Äôve never seen it to this scale before in a game.
---
I do not enter floating camps. A single staircase is not enough to support a whole structure. I'm not risking my life to visit vendors in a structure that is about to collapse, no matter how full those vendors are.
---
Yep i came across someone's camp like this some weeks ago, bought a minigun mod as it was cheap and as soon as i did they left the server. Could just be coincidence but it was just after player vending became available again so they may have thought i was trying to steal items
---
TIL there was a Beret and a BOS Collectron.
---
Are you serious???
---
Once you finish the tourist quest, you can drop the camera, which will destroy it, or put it in your stash.
---
No, optimization, reading guides in advance and experience with grindy online games.
---
I'm a plan vendor and I sell all my plans at 90% off msrp, and it's still not popular.
---
Eventually I'm just going to make them free just to get rid of them.
---
Can they? When critters broke my generator my shop icon was gone and it didnt look like anyone could buy anything?
---
VATS is fubar at the moment. I can't even get it to register at close range. Driving me nuts as a snipper character.
---
This is how I look at things too.  I put stuff in there to get rid of, not to second guess how much I priced it at.
---
Oh feck nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
---
100 times this.
---
Yep.  Sell all my plans for 1 cap.  Occasionally I will throw a legendary in at 1 cap as well.
---
Silly how they just don‚Äôt just add it to every account like they did with the mountain scout uniform.
---
Agree, I have only a few power armour plans to buy from vendors then it‚Äôs looking around player vendors for the missing ones, or doing events.  Saw sitting gorilla for 29999 caps!!!!
---
Are you on pc becouse I'm on xbox and the most problem I had is the colossus getting stuck in the cilling and floor, though that doesn't last and just gives me and my team a few laughs
---
Even with targeting assist in power armour, Legendary vats hit chance effects combined with concentrated fire perk fully leveled, I was used to seeing almost guaranteed hits miss but now seeing no damage increase with better criticals either is really getting ridiculous.
---
un - prime your gun.
---
you are not worthy.
---
The sad thing is, I've done this AND all power armor mods (and everything else the vendors sell) on one character, and I'm getting close on a second character.
---
Congrats!
---
I suspect I know why. The sniper weapons require a lot of VATS for one bullet. You might simply not have enough base AP for one shot since you're level 18.
---
try: 
---
* drinking a nuka cola/nuka cola cherry to increase AP
---
* any other AP enhancing drug and/or food
---
* changing the sight on your gun to a more basic sight like the reflex sight. It will reduce your range but also the required AP per shot. Sights have a large impact on AP consumption.
---
He meant your arm laces are untied, cuz u belong in an asylum.
---
jk, ur right, they do test it (even the community managers played that event on quakecon), but sadly not enough.
---
No I‚Äôm on ps4, The other guy was able to get the last hit in &amp; complete the event so he got a reward at least, Just really annoyed ha ha
---
Thank you :)
---
Make them this and under armor
---
Hum i will try with other weapon but I think it doesn‚Äôt change 
---
It‚Äôs very sad there are not juste an msg text Ingame to explain that ! 
---
Thank you üòä
---
They talked about that, and it is NOT proper fish care
---
Because performance costs money and if they want this game to be profitable, then they have to skimp on the servers. Which is because they shot themselves in the foot at launch, then kept shooting themselves in the foot every month or two there after. Occasionally they do something that's great, but then they go right back to shooting themselves in the foot. I'm surprised they have any feet left to stand on.
---
I hope it actually shows proper care, I don‚Äôt want a FUCKING LAMP, I want a filtered, heated, and big tank
---
Yeah, you need to click on the event marker when it pops.
---
I like to don a suit of PA, equip my biggest weapon when I gift low levels free loot. Idn why. I'm sorry.
---
but those big beautiful fusion generators powering them aren't
---
Always comes down to the type of plans.
---
Mounted anything? You're lucky if you get 1c. 
---
Recipes? I always sell for less than 10c. 
---
PA body parts? 100c. Accessories? 30c if they're worth less than 500, 100c otherwise. 
---
Weapon and armor plans or mods? Anywhere from 0-100c. No, the mole minor gauntlet isn't worth a penny despite what the game says it's value is. 
---
Rare or event items? You know damn well those are gonna be expensive.
---
no thanks
---
All of my plans are 11 caps. I also price all my Bobbleheads and Magazines for 11 caps too.
---
your name is literally based on the game you fucking halfwit
---
&gt; on PS4
---
Well there's part of your problem. Ps4's have hdd's which are slow to load assets like camps. Then the game is also poorly optimized and servers are slow on top of that. Afaik, you can get an ssd for your ps4, but I doubt most people have. I don't have any issues with stuff loading in, but the servers are exceptionally laggy the past few months.
---
Agreed, Getting over encumbered when entering my PA is really shows just how magical the legendary effects are if basic armour &amp; how out of balance things are.
---
My camp has the following prices:
---
Weapon and armor plans: 25 caps
---
Recipes: 15 caps
---
Ultracite armor: 100 caps.
---
Event plans (Like fasnacht and grahms) 50 caps. 
---
I think they are very reasonable prices for any level. 
---
I sell mostly ammo though. I have about 300 plans but over 30k ammo all for 1 cap.
---
When i find a camp i don't like (those floating ones that are a box supported by only a flight of stair ü§Æ) i always turn off all the lights. Or nuke 'em. Depends if i have the time or will. But yeah, you gave me an idea on the generators
---
I purposely leave the collection unlocked. I also always put one in every workshop.  If you need the stuff take it.  It's free.
---
Hey, they've also got missile launcher plans for 1,500c! That's half what the game says they're worth!
---
You realize caps have no value since there's no guaranteed way to spend or minimum value to them.  
---
Caps will hardly regulate anything
---
I like to call it the jumping game.
---
The Steam key is only linked to your Steam account, so the previous suggestion should work, but you may loose access to unspent Atoms. They are still in your account, but you'll have to log in with the same account and the same method (Steam or Bethesda.net) to spend them.
---
I don‚Äôt think skins are content. You don‚Äôt need them to play the game. No one is forcing you to play.
---
&gt; Seems like basic courtesy really.
---
It would be if it didn't take 
---
&gt; SO LONG

But seriously. I did that for my main characters camp when player vendors first released, but it took weeks so I said fuck it for my other characters. It wouldn't have taken so long, but not everyone spawns into the same spot. It would be just so neat if Bethesda had something we could place to indicate where we want people to spawn. You know like a welcoming mat or something...
---
I have not tried this, will give it a shot. Thank you üëçüòä
---
I've said it before, I'll say it again. Bethesda is really stupid the way they distribute free content.  It's never just provided to everybody, nor do they alternatively try to integrate the content in-game so you could maybe find a blueprint of the item in-game by searching, or buying it at a store.  
---
Instead, every free item must be taken from the Atomic Shop within an arbitrary time limit despite there being no shortage of digital fucking items.
---
Get a 25% less VATS cost, I can get 3 to 4 clips in half my AP bar xD (also have 35 Agility but who is counting)
---
Every time i got to one that shows it has loads of plans and its just an abundance of cooking spit/chemistry stations. If i wasn‚Äôt so lazy, i would go through the leg work of prepping a nuke just to drop it on their camp.
---
Hate those camps that trap and kill you! Grrr
---
I‚Äôm no lover of FO76 but that video stretches things a bit. What I do agree on is that the BoS is only here for brand recognition ‚Äòbecause Fallout‚Äô and it‚Äôll probably be a better money spinner, that bit is right IMHO, so yes lore considerations come second and will lead to some mental gymnastics to bypass inconsistencies with existing lore and canon. As another poster has said, the timeline here could have led to some very interesting narrative around the war itself and life just after but instead we got typical Fallout tropes to make it recognisable.
---
You piss on people's piano's? [I'm in](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/666/080/25a.jpg).
---
I‚Äôve found that camp building plans always tend to sell, Everything else not do much despite setting my prices below average or basically just asking for 60 caps to cover my fast travelling cost at least.
---
What took me several weeks to discover was the fish stopped swimming when you turn the light off. Lol.
---
This happened several months back, has it been fixed? I've seen so many vendors up recently that I figured it must be safe.
---
Yep, it seems like the only way they damage the fence is if they're specifically targeting it. If I'm standing behind it, they can hit me, but it doesn't damage the fence.
---
That's the main downside to using the fence rather than, say, the concrete barricade, but I've found the fence much easier to place without gaps. I'll usually throw some concrete behind the fence as a stopgap.
---
Or put a hidden switch to them so that they remain wired but you can turn them off?
---
I had a pretty full vendor yesterday. Multiple AA, TS, Bloodied, etc weapons, a few decent pieces of armor, all the ammo and plans I've been hoarding for a month or so, etc. 
---
So I headed off to kill me some Earle while my cap stash is around 22K. I'm just sitting there with a couple minutes to go until the boulders fall when I start hearing the caps sound. Some player is coming through and buying up all my ammo.
---
No worries, I'll take a small amount of caps disappearing. It's only ammo. But he keeps going. All my ammo, gone. My plans? Gone. My armor? Gone. By this point I've missed out on about 20K caps, but he stops. I'm done. No more missed caps.
---
I go in and start fighting Earle. We're able to eat off about half his health but I get killed. While I'm waiting there praying for someone to revive me, I get the cap sound again. That same guy had made himself more liquid by opening presents. He's still going through my shop, buying each and every weapon while I lay there dying. 
---
I lost around 75K caps in total. I'm glad someone is using all the weapons and shit, but I know damn well he doesn't need all of them. Someone else could have enjoyed them.
---
If I could gift it to you I would but sadly I can‚Äôt.
---
Honestly, it depends.  Sometimes it's a solid selection, they just never changed their camp in 100+ levels.  If they have a few Atom Store items, I'm willing to give it a shot.  Especially if I see a Raider Tree or Chicken Coop.
---
Huh, they have a value of 1 cap, lol. 
---
But seriously they are a way to put value on things still, all junk/flux/ammo/plans have a "cap" value on the trading market. All but the higher tier weapons have the same "cap" value
---
There is also a lot of things to spend them on in game, plans and recipes for a start. Then there is recall key cards. 
---
Having a cap limit prevent people from charging too much in vendors, if there was no cap limit over time prices for weapons would just go up and up. So 2 years after the game was released it would be a horrendous experience for some one to start playing. As they would not even have enough caps to buy a single stimpac from other players
---
Oh yeah, everyone wants a camp plan, no matter how lame they are. Backpack plans, too.
---
He probably had something dumb listed for 30k and someone  bought it on accident ... or hell maybe even on purpose and now he thinks it'll happen over and over.
---
Magazines always sell too.
---
Possum badges plan
---
This doesn't change where other people spawn into your camp, only where **you** spawn into your camp... which for some reason isn't the same spawn point.
---
I‚Äôm down to having less than 25 plans that I don‚Äôt know.  There is something like 1100.  It‚Äôs rare for me to find one but I still scroll (because Bethesda loves to annoy its player base) when I‚Äôm shopping.
---
I try to only keep interesting plans in vending or what I think should sell easily.  I only keep one machine with them and my pricing is sweet.
---
Yes I can carry more in my undies (no legendary armour) and small backpack than in my fusion powered robot suit. I can build a fusion reactor surely I can tie my backpack to my PA with a piece of rope.
---
Unfortunately you gotta do the tadpole quests, start it by using one 9f the posters in a train station or finding the camp then its a slog and a half
---
Standard Flag - Responder Bots
---
Clean Flag - Possum Badge machines
---
It one shots the whole group. If you do this while other players are there make sure you don't have a vendor advertising your camp location.
---
Oh yeah, they're weird though. You can sell them for 20c and they'll be gone within an hour. Or you can sell it for 100c, and one single person will come through a week later and buy each and every one. 
---
Also, Ballistic Bock sells. I make dozens of them each day and sell them for 20-25c. Everyone wants some especially since Earle started. That extra 15% damage comes in clutch when stacked with chems.
---
Yea but I dont gave that many hours lmao I have wayy less
---
I guess it's a Wendigo thing? If it's not locked I figure they don't care.  Put a level 0 lock on there if it's an issue.
---
Playing devil's advocate for a second here, I think part of the mentality of putting the work in right away to unlock something is that you get it quickly. It's not all that different from when a game releases at $60 but then goes down to $40 several months later, and then $20 at some point thereafter. I *could* wait for it to get cheaper or I could just fork over the extra money to get it right now. I could put in the hours to unlock something from the season pass, or I could wait a couple months for it to be released as a freebie. Not saying I agree, but I think that's the logic behind it.
---
A lot. This is a hobby of mine. Not a job. Youre defending someone with an addiction that's throwing their life away bro
---
Pretty sure you can only have 3 legendary perks equipped and only still have a max of 15 perk points allocated to minor perks however you can still get a 20 STR just get to put in more minor perks
---
Pain
---
Ty tho
---
yeah my rule of thumb is no plan under 500c list price sold.
---
Everything over that goes for 100c.
---
I drop off the useless plans as they pile up.
---
A road just south east of monongah mine was perfect for a raider rode base. Was my favourite camp spot but I had to move to the bog after first week of people nuking it for early.
---
Ur Mad because the best gun you have is a nocturnal pipe rifle
---
I‚Äôm British if I called my friend a fat cunt it would be a perfectly acceptable greeting. Now if I was in America that would be a deadly insult, Karen would have fainted and I‚Äôd probably be in a fight. Different people, dependant on their backgrounds, have different tolerances to that.
---
I am glad they did that. Enemies will feel more intimidating as they should be
---
I'm up to 7 from machines myself - of course since you can go and just pick one up in the world they lose their cool(whip) factor a bit
---
Exactly. At least that‚Äôs how I look at it. Anything unlocked is open to the public. Essentially donation boxes
---
1. Player has not tuned spawn making it hard to find vending.  If I can‚Äôt find it in a few seconds I leave.
---
2. Player vending on PC sucks.  Every Tom dick and Harry throws up a vending with 3 stimpacks, 100 ammo and 20 plans.  So hard to find a camp with actual stuff to shop.
---
3. BUT the best are the ones that trick and kill me.  The trap camps are fun.
---
Interesting. Thank you. I'll take note of that
---
I have a base like that. Inspired by the Winchester Mansion. That character is one of my highest and I have a fair amount of 2-3* bloodied weapons on his vendor for 3-5k. No one ever stops there lol.
---
I'm on xbox
---
No shit sherlock im on xbox
---
these things happen
---
So? You don't know their story, maybe they're homebound, or maybe they arent fortunate enough to have a hectic social life, or maybe they just take a lot of joy out of spending a few hours per night on a video game after a hard day's work. I tell you what though, I'd much prefer to spend my time with them over someone like you.
---
Every MMO has clans and tbh they're never any good. Maybe instead of clans we stick to ingame factions like the raiders, settlers, BOS, and enclave.
---
Completely untrue. Theyve said you can solo it by yourself. If you want to play solo you should be able to. The fact that you can't solo it or don't want to shows your reasoning perfectly
---
lol yeah there‚Äôs always that one person who buys almost every magazine you have.
---
I mean you should unless you wanna be an addicted sad person like this dude
---
Lol, when 11 year olds try to teach others about economy...
---
I both loved and hated doing those tadpole challenges. On the one hand, I loved that there were some worthwhile challenges, but on the other hand, I am a super casual that doesn't have any time to go badge hunting.
---
Gt: harryy ii uk

Add me up bro, I can look at your weps armours and talk about perks to see if there's better options for a silo. ll give you and your buddy some meds in exchange for some treasure maps and help you run the nuke silo if you'd like. First nuke you drop is the best nuke :)
---
Calm down boomer. I know a challenge. I spent months collecting gear and supplies only to have my nuts stomped on by todd and a bunch of salty food builds because "REEEEEE TOO MUCH DAMAGE STOP HAVING FUN!!!11!!
---
PRIMED Furious pipe rifle. with max stabilised and green thumb I pwn the wasteland.
---
Fixer players must really get gud already. Have to have strong back equipped at every event just to carry you noobs. !!
---
Just wanted to say I just logged on and noticed the upvotes and awards! Thanks everyone for the support! I‚Äôll try to respond to people throughout the day because I enjoy engaging with people who comment on my posts. Have a great day and stay safe in the wasteland!
---
That happened to me too.  I jumped back down after dying and immediately died from fall damage in my PA.  lost the rewards too.
---
Meh. Just sit at the cap limit, who cares. Caps are mostly useless for veteran players anyway. Yeah, sure there are good items out there, but the way to find them is pure 1:1000000 luck.
---
Doesn't he use weight reduction things?
---
Lol I have all honors and AP classes and still paint, have other hobbies, and work out. What's his excuse. Lemme hear it.
---
Was expecting the post to be about immediately getting swallowed up by the wooden foundation
---
Handmades are easier to come by if you kill blood eagles. Might take you a day or two server hopping at an outpost to get enough handmades to scrap to learn the mods if you don‚Äôt want to craft them. 
---
It says small chance but it‚Äôs no where near as bad as Radium Rifles. *cries in 37/43 for the last two months of scrapping*
---
What console does it matter it's all the same. Still the same math? Maybe you should learn to add rather than try get everyone to do it for you!
---
That too lol
---
Oh shiver me timbers. What was your sbq solo time? 2 and a half hours? DPS !!1!1!!!1
---
I have a hard time believing they'll do anything with the challenges this week. They'll probably just send any earned SCORE into the void this week.
---
I don't think you actually even deserve an answer but here goes. 
---
B2525 is not nerfed, weapons are not nerfed, weapon legendary effects are not nerfed. What is "nerfed" is the way damage is calculated. Right now on live all damage calculations are multiplicative (for example how bloodied mess and weapon related damage perks are calculated) and on PTW is has been changed to additive. Meaning ALL DAMAGE has been toned down aka nerfed.
---
Or they do it moments before you buy something
---
I cant use the pts. Am I supposed to read someone's mind?
---
I think you are right.  It should not be deactivated even one day early.
---
I know. Makes the compass and map harder to use. I hated playing on old style teams, and my friends would have EVERYTHING active, while also being team lead. And then they wonder why, when they actually try doing one of them, it was so hard to know where to go, or what to do.
---
The short one with the flag not flying is possum badges. The tall one with the flag flying is atom shop.
---
I really, really hope we get expeditions and daily ops that aren‚Äôt just BoS.
---
Yes sir, thank you for your enlightening words. I will take them to heart and I promise I'll grow up and not laugh at dimwits who don't know how economy works. Nor will I call them on their bullshit. I am the baby and I'm sure you're at cap limit on 15+ characters. Again thank you.
---
I think WoWS does this as well.
---
I wonder if it's something that the consoles make them put in? (the ability to turn off crossplay)
---
"Ultracite armor: 100 caps" please tell me you mean something other than the base power armor plans because the full set is earned easily through the story. The basic plans I list for 0
---
I swear the pc market is so trash lol literally the entire map not one good spot
---
BRO ITS NOT A NERF ITS ACHKTUALLY A RECALCULATION NOW STOP HAVING FUN 11!!!!1!!!
---
Oh you're a kid, this all makes a lot of sense now. The dumbshit posts you make and your shitty attitude.
---
Google? Theres literally a calculator made for this if you looked
---
Even worse. When I fast travel to someone‚Äôs camp and I immediately get a disease because I spawn in water.
---
Ok send link
---
I stick to ammo when people visit they might buy it
---
And im most likely smarter than you, a 30 year old playing a kids game. Whats your point big guy?
---
For some reason vats just stops activating.  Only solution I found is restarting game.   This has happened to me 3-4 times in Total.
---
Ah so I‚Äôm not just really unlucky or cursed ha ha, I hope you &amp; I experience less issues in the future.
---
I‚Äôm thinking of rad x. That stuff is kryptonite to my jumpy powers lol. Just easy to throw on a chinese suit after Earle is dead and loot the wendigos until it‚Äôs gets a bit dark.
---
I agree to a point. Yes, there are stuff to spend your caps on, but I don't think they are any attractive caps investments. I've bought only one Encrypted card and I don't plan to buy any other. It's simply not rewarding. Most are also a one time purchase only.    
---
Cap limit prevents prices going too high, for a point.  
---
I'm pretty sure there are Fixer auctions that goes over what one account full of characters can hold in caps. What limits the price is how annoying is to have multiple accounts to store items/caps.    
---
As someone mentioned here on this thread, if we had a worthy caps sink in the game it would make everything better, supply and demand would prevail
---
When you start up the game on Xbox - during the initial loadscreen there's a message that pops up that says "Controls have been disabled hit \[ESC\] to cancel"...all these years and I still haven't found that key on my xbox.
---
‚ÄúNo-one is forcing you to play‚Äù is such a shit response. A video game company is there to make money and provide enjoyment in return. It‚Äôs obvious no-one is forcing me to play - I want to play, they want me to play it. So stop forcing players to complete mundane daily challenges to get new items in-game. It‚Äôs an unhealthy lifestyle habit to need to log in every day to get new gear.
---
Lazy attitude, welcome to my bozo bin.
---
Sounds really nice!
---
When you spout nonsense like that back it clearly shows you're one of the ones who free load and don't get things on their own, aka babies.
---
Yeah unfortunately without Bethesda doing a simple ‚Äúon/off‚Äù switch, you have to bail from the server if you‚Äôre going to lose caps due to the limit. It sucks for the buyer but also for the seller who just sold a valuable item for nothing.
---
I already spent months sinking time into getting good gear, guns, and bullets only to be shit on by salty food builds. Im not doing it again. Ill find a better game or start a better hobby. Not playing any more of this bullshit.
---
Quad is still doing 0 increased damage as it is in live, so how is it becoming better at dps exactly?
---
Two shot is still the same 25% increased damage as it ever was, how is it exactly "much better"? 
---
"Losing stealth is only a slight drawback" what? :D
---
Please don't comment about the changes anymore :D
---
www.fo76calc.com/weapondamage
---
I have fallout first. I got the game through game pass so first seemed like an easy buy.
---
Flag POLE is defs atom store as others have said.
---
I can't imagine how many "magic" legendaries I've scrapped because it turns out that knowing by hand what effects combine to properly glitch is hard
---
Although I'm sure bots like you who rely on teams to help you kill the SBQ are loving the changes because you still get to leech off your team while they carry you bro. Have fun. Im sure not
---
"Always has been"
---
Do they ever sell anything good, really? You may find a fun gun here and there, or a piece of armor suitable for an Alt. character, but nobody puts anything of any real value in a vending machine. Some people get lucky. But the best thing to look for is pistols. A Commando build with an AA/33/25 Western, as a sidearm does pretty well (for now).
---
Yes even if you‚Äôre not visible on the map, if somebody finds your camp they can buy from the vending machine. Hence why people board it up just in case.
---
I just can't believe that this is happening to ps4. More of a reason to be glad I play on xbox.
---
Wut
---
"Gauss Pistol Drum Magazine" is the name of the plan in game. Agreed that is sounds odd.
---
Ps thanks for the look out im not perfect please feel to bring up other questions or corrections
---
See? Wasn't so hard was it.
---
I cant wait to not have to wait 2 weeks before buying all the levels....I want all my swag on day one
---
of course not!!.Solo her would be a waste since I like every one to have fun. So usually i let the other people shoot her and when they have shot enough bullets and i see they tired i put in the last few shots. I don't even mind that they rush her body and usually leave no loot for me to pick up, as long as i carried them to a successful completion i feel good.
---
As someone who has lived through countless Sci-Fi and Fantasy worlds being established: Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, Fallout, Marvel Comics, Star Wars, and Star Trek to name a few, I will say this.
---
Spending that much effort and time worrying about lore is just dumb, especially when you have multiple creative sources contributing.  As long as it‚Äôs consistent within the story/movie itself it doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Can i guess.. You are 13-15 year old?
---
More Enclave stuff in general would be nice I only started playing in May but I‚Äôve yet to see even a shitty shirt or beret on the shop
---
If u feel That way about a game you need to quit.
---
That's a good question, I don't know if he takes that into consideration. Either way I would argue that most people have that backpack mod as it is (in my opinion) the best one, so most people would benefit from it
---
Maybe call it Nightmare on Oak street
---
I mean yea.. like 5 comments ago I said I'm in high school and take AP and honors. Great work detectiveüíÄ
---
Didn't see you finding it
---
There will be no new atom challenges between the seasons. The point of seasons is to reward players without giving them atoms. Bethesda wants you to buy atoms, not earn them. 
---
They're not going to reactivate atom challneges for 1 week. Its an off week
---
I asked a question. Not my fault you couldn't answer it
---
I thought they were waiting two weeks between seasons?
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right. But if I ‚Äúneed to quit‚Äù a video game, isn‚Äôt the game partly to blame? I‚Äôve never needed to quit a game before, so the anomaly is this particular game and the way it (poorly) handles new content.
---
If you were smarter than me you wouldn't litter your comments with grammatical errors.  
---
https://www.esrb.org/ratings/35838/Fallout+76/
---
Whilst ratings don't really mean much, it's fucking redundant of you to call it a "kids game" when people far more qualified than you rated it as inappropriate for kids. 
---
You're a brat, you have absolutely zero understanding of the real world and you validate your own unremarkable existence by shit talking people on reddit for how they spend their spare time.
---
Also, if he played three hours every day since launch he'd have more hours than he currently does. He's probably had a few long nights on it and a couple of hours a day after work. He hasn't based his entire online persona around it though and he isn't making topics bitching because he's sad that the devs are taking easy mode out of the game, so what's your excuse?
---
Half of what you said makes me feel like you've never even seen the sbq lmao
---
You can have 6 legendary perks you get a slot at 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 and 300
---
Its not two accounts.  Steam game is linked to bethesda.   Bethesda is linked to steam.  
---
If u want two accounts you have to create a NEW account login and buy game again.
---
well fuck me, learn something new every day, thanks for the info :)
---
Plan crap is free, and the mass duped that happen after every ‚Äúpatch‚Äù, make it impossible to put anything in a vending machine except ammo. Well, now they are trying to trash that as well. Bethesda, has no idea how an in game economy works...
---
Theres no fusion generator, just the small ones. Ohh...
---
Wouldn't it prefer to be fed *live* Blood Eagles?
---
These issues need resolving as it‚Äôs a gamble right now as to wether to do the event, Kinda bad that this is the content we were waiting for.
---
Bro youre a 40 year old dude on reddit crying at a 15 year old. Get a girlfriend and a life bro this is sad üò≠
---
It would be a sad joke, really, if they continued to issue SCORE challenges in between seasons, but this is Bethesda we're talking about, so maybe that's exactly what will happen. ;-)
---
So what is this post? Honest question not hating.
---
Is it a I'm leaving post
---
Is it a question post
---
Is it a why I cancelled 1st post
---
Because I feel like it was all these but also none of them at the same time.
---
Well thing is I did? Couldn't be asked with a 10 year old giving hassle and being rude to people who actually play the game because he can't add or can't wait 2 weeks for a update
---
We were always going to get it no matter what
---
Also grammatical errors? I thought this was reddit not my thesis paper lmao üòÇ what are you my English teacher?
---
Check players vendors, marked with a V on the map, many set the cost low for plans, although some leave it at the defaults.
---
I usually set mine at 10% of the default, but i dont wind up with many weapon plans.
---
Yes that's what i fear. Just tought i would se if there was any other way while waiting for Bethesda to reply.
---
The rubble stays, but if you fast travel to the event it will take you inside anyway
---
Just don't due after Earle does or you'll respawn outside with no chance to get any loot of off the body
---
I agree
---
I dont know why you're so mad about a question man. Geez. You must hate school with all those darn questions
---
They went away fast that they did.
---
Bethesda - makes a quest which makes u take on different rounds of enemies in an arena. Doesn‚Äôt consider using it for something else
---
I honestly don't find this compelling.  I have 2000+ rounds of my standard weapons and 50,000+ points in the Ammo Converter. It feels like by the time you can get it, you don't need it.
---
Haha no worries.
---
working with applications, you‚Äôd be surprised how often something works fine in test then breaks as soon as it goes live
---
Why'd you add a decade boy genius? I have both of those, a full time job and a fulfilling social life but feel free to continue projecting your own fears about the complete lack of future you have instead of addressing anything that was said.
---
If you weren't such a little bitch you'd apologise to the first person you shit talked and grow up a little, you're 15, not 10, embarrassing. I'd be fucking ashamed if you were my kid.
---
üíì
---
Lol if i see smoke I‚Äôm out lol
---
True I agree. It's just that this bug seems way to big for Bethesda, their testing crew, and the PTS to miss, I feel like that would've been caught.
---
TNT Dome #3. ;)
---
People like what they like, why do you give a shit how that guy spends their time? They don't give a shit about how you spend yours
---
I‚Äôm just in it for the pie...
---
I logged in every day, to play.
---
I even bought something from the Atomic shop yesterday, but I never imagined that even if I donated, the award would expire if I didn't claim it immediately.
---
I will never participate in this type of event again.
---
Same, I saw the possum list and just said nope, already got my backpack from the qust and flag from the machine, im good
---
thanks for comment buddy! i hope they will replied on this post!
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
I‚Äôve only played Riding Shotgun once but is that event the only way to get any of the Blue Ridge cosmetics?
---
Idk man. If you saw an alcoholic or a dude smoking crack on the street would you just say "LET THEM LIVE THEIR LIFE". They're a slave to their hobbies/addictions. It's obvious. And that's a bad argument
---
Ferns for Violet, Fruits and Berries often are Cobalt.
---
In short, if you don't play solo, in a private server, you are crippling your damage. (Sneaks only tho)
---
It's the not question. It's the way you ask then when people have tried to help you, your just rude to them.
---
You can run, but can‚Äôt hide! 
---
I WILL follow you! I WILL find you!
---
And by god I WILL give you my stimpaks and excess plans - even if it means forcing them down your throat!
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
---
Yes but it‚Äôs not very long, maybe every 20-30 minutes I think
---
We will.  Even if technically we didnt hit the number they will give it to us.  Yesterday was a holiday in the US and they update the progress by hand.  They will update it today and if we didnt donate the 175m they will change the amount needed and mark it as complete.
---
Yesterday I saw a camp that was built on top one of the big power pylons, I have no idea how that player gets up there but he didn't leave the vendors at the bottom. It was like 70 meters in the air.
---
Leather was on 129 million last night long after the switchover to glass. The counter updates are an afterthought in the best of times and this was a holiday weekend.
---
Also, a quick farming run through the forest yields about 30 disease cures. There‚Äôs videos about it but it‚Äôs basically just go to Slocum Joe‚Äôs and get fire caps, flat woods and the forest surrounding it to get soot flowers and blood leaf. Took me about a half hour running around for enough disease cures for a few weeks.
---
Id be ashamed if you were my dad bro. Leave your moms basement. Get a life. Stop talking to little kids on the internet. Didnt your patrol officer tell you that already!!!
---
Steam will just decide to uninstall my game entirely when my subscription runs out. It makes  no sense and is incredibly frustrating.
---
I mostly just sell plans and recipes. Recipes for 9c, most plans for 99c, and the ones that are priced at 3,000 or more I sell for 999c.
---
Lmao so youre 30 üíÄ thats not any less pathetic lmao
---
Ps4, all plans no matter what, 5 caps
---
I'm rude to rude people. Im nice to nice people.. Reflect on your behavior and maybe you'll receive a better result.
---
Interesting - wasn't aware of that. I'll look into switching and see if it helps.
---
I'm level 504, I love playing with newbies. Taking a level 20 through the swamp and seeing them have the first encounter with a giant frickin monster is awsome. Like reliving the experience of discovering Appalachia through them.
---
Your had me in the first half, I'm not going to lie...
---
If you can and want to glitch the magazine size, then use the Piercing one  
---
If you just want to play normally, stinging is the way to go
---
I don't see anybody anywhere close to Atlas except for day one. Nobody is donating and we're still getting the rewards.
---
Yeah I lost a strangler heart and they said to check my inventory ha. I got ounce of preservation to work on a public server the other day as I started a new character. First I placed the fuse then used the terminal then with the centrifuge I press it loads of times and it went through on the 5 or 6 times then I used the booth. Hope this helps
---
WTF? Seriously?  I guess I'll try that.
---
Btw is adrenaline working now?
---
Wow only after reading those comments I realized the shower placement is completely intentional.
---
I thought my controller was shot lmaoo
---
I just looked and we are about 35m short of the goal. I think it will get an ‚Äúupdate‚Äù and we will get the reward.
---
Looks like it
---
I have a jangles the monkey for 30k caps because even though I can‚Äôt display it (yet?) I don‚Äôt want to accidentally scrap it
---
Patrol officer? Lmao, do you mean parole? 
---
I'd be ashamed too if I was your father, I can't imagine what it must be like to have failed so hard in raising a kid.
---
Doesn't look like you like it when people shit talk you online. Ironic.
---
Ok well I'm sure your advice will be taken to heart
---
Like scrolling through a thousand plans you already have.
---
Holy shit bro youre epically pwning a 15 year old over a typo!!!11!!1 women must be all over you.
---
How old are you?
---
You don't *need* Ultracite bullets.
---
Okay I might as well ask now, I‚Äôm totally out of the loop with this junk donation thing, where and how do I do this?
---
Yep. Looks like you're pretty rude is what I'd say
---
When the game launched it was damn near impossible to solo kill the queen, they said from the start it would be multiple players fighting her. 
---
The idea of being able to play solo or together was completely changed with the introduction of private worlds. 
---
On a side note who said I can't solo a queen, Christ 10 mins research and I owned her in less than 15 mins on my first solo run. Not bothered to do it since as I would prefer to launch on public servers as more mobs spawn and you get much better XP
---
Yep
---
I got that the other day. Lost a whole Plasma core. Though it is less annoying then the one where the gun doesn't load or fire.
---
Just a fact man. Some people need that wake up call in life.
---
Happened to me.
---
They had that initially I think, like in Fallout 4, but people were using them to drop people into traps, so they got rid of them.
---
Yes they stack.
---
I know a lot of players say it's a waste but I think some are in the same boat I am. I tend to take all the perks to lower food and chem weights etc.
---
I get really paranoid about not having enough of something when I need it...to the point where I'm carrying 200 stim packs, 100 boiled water (I at least sell the purified stuff), 100 radaways, 100+ cans of dog food.
---
It'll be a LONG time trying to ween myself off of those numbers and this perk might not be a bad thing to fill that gap while I'm trying to cut my numbers down.
---
I‚Äôm right there with you.  I donated materials during that time but I missed claiming them.
---
Sometimes life happens.  They should‚Äôve been available for everyone.
---
What's your point? When the game launched it was also barely playable and everyone had bad gear. Also 15 minutes... bro c'mon
---
TIL.  Hell, it usually takes me that long to down one of the buggy mofos.
---
I may sell only ammo and cheap ulticite PA recipes, but I made a small bar like room and a dock like place where u can sit down and watch the deathclaw isle.
---
Farmable ones are from fo4.
---
Ooooh yeah. I got it, but a mate finished the season and pretty much shelved it for a few weeks... Gonna be pissed he missed some great rewards. Not real fair either
---
I dunno, are those the same as the SQB ones? I thought the PA plans you get through the stroyline are the X01?
---
I've travelled Appalachia tireleslesy and try to explore everything. My camp is right next to fort defiance, and I never knew this.
---
Thankyou !
---
(I'm guessing this rifle is the one we're meant to tagged scorched with rather than simply massacre them all in "distant thunder")
---
I'm just starting to take my CAMP building seriously and I want a magazine rack so I was recently exactly this guy. Who wants to see an empty rack!?
---
Hell no, at least for sneak builds you don't want all Legendary special cards.  
---
I'll take one and no more than that just to add some few perks that I want and couldn't with the current limitation.
---
I agree we need a decent cap sink, and yes you are correct high tier items go for way more than the cap limit for a full account of characters. However removing the cap limit would only increase those prices as well, It is all relative.
---
Bethesda have to consider new players coming into the game far more than they do existing players. Be honest if you has started this game and ever vendor you can across wanted 100k for a crap low level weapon and you only gathered 10p caps in your first couple of hours playing would you have carried on?
---
I got mine by. A glowing decised mirelurk spond in a nuke zone during a radstorm. After I had died by the SBQ. But the way you got it is ok I guess.
---
Sorry for spelling not the best.
---
Lol it‚Äôs understandable!
---
Surely we don't want more BS and poor writing from Bethesda though?
---
The only useful dart for the syringer doesn't work, anyway.  Totally broken, useless weapon.  I scrapped mine after I got that perk that displays enemy resistances and noticed they weren't changing after being darted.
---
My point is, when the game launched solo running the Queen wasn't an option. So from the start Bethesda had said you shouldn't be able to kill her on your own.
---
Awesome gun for low levels. I made one for my son when he started playing and just make him newer ones when he levels up till he can get the plans himself.
---
I also thought those are permanently available after challenge was completed and rewards unlocked. I already filed a support ticket because I also missed it or something. In their support article about community events and its rewards, there are no word about time sensitivity of claiming those rewards. They should add those kind of items straight to player account without need to claim.
---
I would like it to be a hacked version or something like the Bot Stop's voice. "I'm here to collect scrap and \*TERMINATE HOSTILES\*."
---
You know...looking at that it makes me think of the Cybermen from Dr. Who...
---
Those recruits would be nothing but an added burden.  They would be extra mouths to feed, extra supplies to be scavenged, make the group bigger and easier to notice, make finding shelter each night harder, etc.
---
Still terrible lol
---
Your just a Communist, believer of the un-American.
---
&gt; I feel like it was all these but also none of them at the same time.
---
You're kinda right. I'm not hating on the game, and I want to continue with my daily routine, but the management decisions slowly drive me away. Which might be not so bad after all, as it's curing me from my addiction to the game, too. :-/
---
But what I'm worrying about is that I can't be the only one (ref. my and probably everyone's friends list), and this is on them because with the seasons, they've conditioned us all to focus on challenges, not just outliers like me who's always enjoyed them.
---
On the SBs, that‚Äôs I think because their hit box is where they are landing/taking off. I abuse that regularly as a melee build.
---
Fallout 3 the ghoul outside of the underworld "Those soldier guy can't tell the difference between us amd the super mutants. Or they just don't care." The bos has pretty much always gone kill on sight. They may tolerate some but usually shoot first ask questions later. From what i can gather they are not going to get along with either of the existing factions.
---
We were also promised 16x the detail.... so that all didn't exactly work out. We were also promised that you'd be able to be a solo tho whole game, meaning you should be able to defeat the final boss yourself too. So your logic is double flawed
---
I find it hard that this man can't understand how sad he looks lmao
---
I just wish I could inspect the legendaries people sell. I mean, I see inspect in the menu option but it never seems to work on these vendors.
---
Lol did you ever think to just let people play the game and not force yourself onto to people that are just enjoying the game instead of stroking your ego and stalking low lvl players to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù them.  I started a new char the other day.  Had so many people go out of their way to drop shit for me,  then proceed to give me shit when I didn‚Äôt want it..it‚Äôs more annoying than anything
---
The founding fathers once said "enclave droolz free states rulez!" so actually your the unamerican ones here
---
You‚Äôre over thinking it so your ‚Äòresponse‚Äô descends into another ‚Äòwhat I think/would like to happen‚Äô essay so doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòrespond‚Äô to anything - its more of a wish list. The point of TKSmantis‚Äô video was to agitate, to start a conversation, and in that aim he succeeded.
---
MODUS has shown himself willing and able to reward those that assist him in his endeavors.  I'm sure MODUS has access to all sorts of things that he could use to provide incentives to help him.  I mean he wouldn't be expecting his "friends" to do things for him for free
---
Danse is great and all but I prefer the New Vegas line of BoS allies of "here is the token lesbian companion of the game. She uses a power fist"
---
And you can only use melee weapons
---
Collects junk in your camp
---
Every Wednesday Morning here in Aus @ 2am or whenever they want to add shit for a few hour special
---
It doesn't look like there are concrete numbers YET but the current nerfing for bloodied looks to be between 70 to 80% depending on SO MANY varying factors (armor, chems, mutations....). You won't get a concrete number until the final PTS adjustments for the new patch is active. [This YouTuber tests LOADS of weapons both on and off the PTS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDnqYDoYkbQ&amp;t=131s) Should help you!
---
"General, you have the clearence to receive this: raw asbestos. Congratulations"
---
Yes, well President Richardson said it best " Nah nah boo boo, we have cooler power armor then you!"
---
Truly words to live by
---
Thank you for the info.
---
B b b b bot stop
---
I've had no trouble with the bunker.  Wires work with a little persistence, and I've never lost any workbench.  Sorry you are having such trouble.
---
Ty. I saw that vid and was thankful cuz i have a few of those and they seem good lol.
---
No. We need a Modus network! Let him set up shop in our camp and sell us things, Like the other vender dude but actually useful.
---
Yes, it broke after Wastelanders for PvP and has been getting significantly more fucky for PvE things.
---
Bethesda can‚Äôt afford the bad PR from a failed community event. We will get it anyways.
---
Nice :)
---
Ah ok. I see. As a introvert I barely have any friends on my xbox so I'm used to not seeing a active friends list.
---
Hope so spend the last week banking scrip. 4K ready to go.
---
Is your pa the lvl 40 maybe.
---
If you're on PC I'd be more than happy to help.
---
FO2 and FO3 were made by different companies so that interval doesn't mean much.
---
While FO3 and FO4 were made by the same company, it was a company with only TWO IPs (Fallout and Elder Scrolls).  Starfield represents a THIRD IP and as such will increase the interval.
---
If two IPs mean 7 years (3.5 years per game) between games of a single IP, three IPs means 10-11 (still 3.5 years per game) years between installments.
---
Not the case. Prime example of what I'm talking about in the title.
---
How about the one where it reloads when there‚Äôs still ammo left in the magazine....
---
As John Wayne once said: "Life is hard.  It's even harder if you're stupid." :(
---
Wondering myself
---
I‚Äôm waiting to see how they handle it to pass judgement.
---
They removed the hud colors because Fallout 76's HUD isn't monochrome. All the other games have monochrome HUD that is then recolored based on your options. as for the pipboy light they probably removed that in part to make sure players are easily recognizable and to reduce the amount of information shared with the client and server, it's not much but it's just a little bit more optimized without it.
---
...so you got scammed?
---
Someone explain the lore to me a little here; Aren't the secret service guys from Vault 79 basically low level enclave or are these two different secret services
---
After some update they begun giving the ultracite PA plans to anyone who finish the Brotherhood Story line
---
Actually , they give an entire Ultracite PA fully built
---
They are not. They are quite nukable. My buddy did it, destroyed the camp walls protecting all the sweet vulnerable ammo machines so we wouldn't get a bounty. Repair the machine and collect bullets. I made off with like 5000 rounds of 5.56 and 5mm.
---
If you're serious about dropping your Xbox characters, I would be interested. Especially the 50 cal &amp; gattling laser as those are my main weapons. I have over 2200 hours in game, &amp; don't plan on quiting. Lvl 344 now. I play every day. I don't use exploits or dupe gear. Everything I have I either earned, bought, traded or was gifted. I have 4 mules, &amp; never turn good gear to scrip. 
---
GT MagnumForce357
---
You may want to consider holding on to them. You never know...you may change your mind &amp; fire up your old Xbox or get a newer console.
---
If you have the available slots, even temporarily, wouldn't hurt to have both :)
---
I have been playing for 2 months now. I probably dropped 30k in plans.
---
I would hit up all the vendor bots and camps with high plan counts.
---
Now I realize how foolish that was.
---
On bosses in groups, yes. And with ranted sneak specifically.
---
Can't help but think this is just a bait post because you are bored and you dont actually have the ability to solo the queen anyways, as you have ignored the genuine post where I asked for you build, mutations and the stackable buffs you use to help calculate the DPS you would lose. 
---
However, the game launched with no way of solo killing the queen because you where on public servers
---
Does this include shotgun shells ? Are you on PS4 ?
---
I got a shit load of shells in the Wendigo Colossus boss fight but i feel i never have enough
---
Earl/New Lovers/Grind everything/no choice matters/Secret Service Gauss Shotgun
---
That post is wrong.  
---
A maxed suit should be 400/455/453.
---
I felt the same way when I got started haha, especially when slap damage was a thing, I would often hide in houses if I knew another player was close by.
---
Tank killer because Glow sight doesn't work anyways.
---
I can easily solo her with my build. That may not be the case so soon though because of the nerf.
---
If you're *paying* for a full month you should _get_ a full month.
---
Is it possible to go back into that arena area or is it just locked?
---
I believe that link/post is from the time when our PA chassis (the empty thing we put our PA pieces in) would provide defence values. They removed that long ago.
---
I highly suggest you don't consider any post about this game that is that old facts :)
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power\_armor\_(Fallout\_76)#X-01\_power\_armor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_(Fallout_76)#X-01_power_armor)
---
If only I would find a good backpack plan. I'm on Xbox and all I see listed in camps are icy lights, mounted somethings, and excavator knuckles.
---
Agreed! Either 1. Fix so that the damage actually apples as displayed, or 2. Display the damage that‚Äôs actually be applied.
---
The Power armor chassis has 60 dr, 60 er and 60 rr. Yours isn't working
---
Mine is only 400 also, now the T65 is a lot higher.
---
noooo thats such a waste :(
---
Same.
---
atom shop update? later today. real update? [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/43yHXVVJpIawuxYldcXIvi/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-season-2-preview-new-s-c-o-r-e-board-rewards-and](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/43yHXVVJpIawuxYldcXIvi/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-season-2-preview-new-s-c-o-r-e-board-rewards-and) 
---
&gt; With the end of the first Fallout 76 Season on the horizon, we wanted to take a few moments to share a preview of what‚Äôs in store for you in Season 2, which is slated to begin when we release Update 22 on September 15
---
Most of the time try to buy plans and re-sell them for a profit, the thing is that‚Äôs it rare that I find plans that would be cheep and worth re-selling.
---
unfortunately it's one or the other.  I  have maxed concentrated fire and maxed commando perks.  i would have to shuffle some stuff around but I would lose some other stuff that I think I need.
---
Im a low strength low health build lol. Maybe my second character is gonna be a bloodied melee build next
---
Going to ignore the fact of not being able to solo her at the launch of the game now I take it?
---
Glow sight doesn‚Äôt work on the wendigo spawns. So tank killer.
---
I tried to use the bunker but everything I put down floats. Waste of atoms unfortunately
---
really I did not know that.  how long has it not worked for?
---
I completed the legendary run last week, so I've been spending my time earning treasury notes instead of concentrating on the daily?weekly challenges.
---
Do you have the floating items tho?
---
It doesnt pop the bar graph on your screen, so i would assume no, but thats not a final answer.
---
Hope your balls drop soon
---
Press right on the d pad while the oil lamp is high lighted.
---
It doesn't work for wendigo spawns and Earl is what I meant
---
That would have been nice. Just throw a molotov at the entrance and get a bunch of xp
---
"I used to be a BOS Knight...until I took an arrow to the knee"
---
Is this comment why imgur warned me about 18+ content when I opened the link. Is imgur also horny for bullets
---
&gt;Ending a season and not adding the new one be imminently 
---
Kinda cringe ngl.
---
True story: I had never bothered to launch a nuke until I needed to do it for a Tadpole badge...
---
I never encountered this until Earl.
---
The only thing I can do when this start happening is tap fire button to make it stop.
---
Your comment is also a bit off :D :D :D  398/453/453
---
Taking the side of the 30 year old arguing with a 15 year old on the internet over grammar.... alright bro.
---
I use nukanades.
---
When does atomic shop update? 12 right?
---
I mean that entire "beginning of the game argument" is stupid because the game has changed so much since then, and we were promised that we'd be able to solo it. Its a moot point
---
Has Tenderizer been fixed? They broke the damage for Tenderizer and Gun Fu when they broke Adrenaline, but the patch notes only mention that Adrenaline was fixed. 
---
I had Tenderizer maxed out before that update but I‚Äôve tried living without it for now. Guess that might have to change after the patch.
---
I do this. I set up across from one of the train stations, and constantly put free stuff in suitcases.
---
cool, you‚Äôre also a noob (your own words) and haven‚Äòt played for long anyway. what a great point you have lol. he could‚Äòve been here since beta and 1800h wouldn‚Äòt be that many then. 
---
there are lifeless psychos in this game who have over 8000 hours and even brag about it, lmao. 
---
you‚Äòre pretty pathetic going off on someone you don‚Äòt know shit about. chile, bitch.
---
Chassis don't provide defence anymore. Have not done so for more than a year now.
---
Nah, that's fine, I'm only half awake so I could well be mistaken, but did you actually put your suit on to pull those numbers?
---
'cause that's what was on my screen when I had it equipped.
---
Mhmm. Idk about the rarity of the of the mod plans but the basic armor plans are so damn common I see them everywhere.
---
Yeah, I'm using the time off to catch up on WOW and playing Grounded :)
---
Yea the magic is always a hit and miss, when it works it also makes boss fights boring. I only attempt to use a ‚Äòmagic‚Äô weapon when the event is about to fail.
---
Favoriting gives a warning before you sell/drop the item
---
Its been taking much longer to get into matches for me, starting a week or so ago seemed like everyone finished the legendary run and stopped joining nw.
---
Anecdotal evidence, but I‚Äôve noticed if someone does camp there, it‚Äôs more likely to spawn somewhere else.
---
Yea but there aren‚Äôt really room for many items on the wheel imo...
---
I put on glow sights for the wendigos. Helps me kill em faster for that adrenaline boost.
---
K.  one of the people I regularly team with tends to swap perks around for different events.  Seems to work well for him, so thought it might be worth suggesting the experiment for you.
---
FWIW, IDK about glow sight being broken - (I run tank killer, glow sight, and incisor maxed out) - with a serrated switchblade, takes 3-4 hits to kill a L42 glowing wendigo.
---
Oh
---
You can only change the Pip-Boy, Quick-Boy and Power Armor "Pip-Boy" color. (and your Pip-Boy light as its tied to your Pip-Boy color)
---
The HUD on the other hand can not be changed, for whatever reason, they completely removed the ability from fallout 4 to 76.
---
It is broken, only provides 2 dr , 2 er and 0rr. My chassis has the 60, 60 , 60 . The resistances go away when you change chassis
---
Alright man. He clearly needs a wake up call about the amount he plays. If I were wasting my time and feeding my addiction I'd want someone to tell me too. As someone who has seen and knows people with addictions youre enabling him. I get its a game and you should have fun... but this and what you're describing is mental sickness and addiction.
---
Fixer
---
My favorite is immune during animation. So flying enimes like stingwings and eyebombs can really hurt a bloodied build if I cant kill them because of an animation
---
Wait how many weapons do you have?
---
Thanks A ton!
---
&gt;_&gt; talk about going off in left field.
---
However you earn atoms for progressing the season    1850 of them. It‚Äôs not nothing but obvi not as much as before. On top of all the atom shop item you unlock. The value is the same but the freedom is reduced.
---
Most of the time, I get good rolls for my other builds.
---
Stealth Sniper got a bloodied minigun
---
Heavy guns build got a Vamp Explosive handmade
---
Have a second account, so I was able to transfer things as needed, but it feels like RNGeebus likes to mess with us.
---
I just hold down the crit button with the fire button.
---
üëç Most of the build menu is like this
---
No we where not, at no point did they promise that we could kill the queen solo. We where promised that we could complete the game solo or in a team. We could chose to play alone or together.
---
Some might say I play a little weird lol. 
---
But I have my main rifle, gating for the queen, secondary and a melee (last 2 for low level mobs to save ammo) 
---
Then food, water, my binoculars.
---
Is it only for the stealth bonuses or there is something else
---
You can kill your teammates if they are wanted. I tested it on someone who unlocked someones collectron with a lvl 3 lock.
---
I have mine put inside my house so people don't have to walk through it
---
Also, even if I'm a kid that still doesn't invalidate my point. Youre using that as a cope to justify your addiction and his
---
Try backing out of his trailer and re-entering if he won't speak with you.  Don't know why but this works for me.  He still suffers from the same issue that all NPCs suffer from still which is they will just randomly pause in the middle of conversation and stare at you for 10 seconds or so and say nothing before they continue on which is really annoying 5 months after NPCs were released.
---
If you're only level 10 then start new
---
Maybe if we can convince them to put them all back in the shop for a week after the whole event is done.
---
the game has been out for two years, your point remains invalid given that you don‚Äòt know when he started playing.
---
Workshops are *meant* for PvP. They aren't even good at giving resources. They're slow and expensive. You get all sorts of warnings letting you know it exposes you to PvP. I play on private servers too now, because lag, but that doesn't change the fact that you're bitching because of one part of the game that actually works as intended.
---
Yea... alone. Meaning you should be able to kill bosses... alone? Does that not compute with you?
---
It‚Äôs a very unwelcomed change and affects everyone above level 50. Just like the mass weapons nerf, it‚Äôs basically a nerf and makes us spend more time and bullets even on garbage enemy, and more time crafting ammo. As they‚Äôve said this is just the beginning, more nerfs are surely coming. A few bullets and milliseconds here and there, we end up spending much longer time to achieve what we can do now, which is exactly the goal behind all their bs nerfs.
---
Whats so big about the Fixer ? kinda new i have the fixer plains but i seem to find more power with the Auto handmade i have.
---
I have played a month from when the game was released 
---
I have never had that problem
---
Based on the terminals, I think they could be seeing their own questline. Their leader is coming up to Appalachia.
---
Nah i was pulling those numbers from wiki. You are absolutely correct, had to go in game and check :)
---
It can push more dps than a shotgun if you got the right build
---
Look man if you want to dump hours into literally nothing at all, go ahead. Waste hours of your precious life instead of making friends, meeting people, working out, or getting other hobbies.
---
Well its the last 2 days for the last part of it...but if you go to Atlas observatory there are bins there to donate glass to for the upcoming brother of steel dlc
---
Thanks. I‚Äôll have to check it out.
---
I'd say that after a few days Angry Turtle, Innov, CaptainNoob etc will all have vids with true numbers!
---
Then don't take over workshops. It warns you that it's a contested area, and that it will flag you for PvP. They aren't even a good way to get resources, farming them yourself is much more efficient. Also, if you're getting one shot, then adjust your build. I run bloody and I can still take more than one bullet.
---
Uh, Boomer is real bad. And I have to do a pirouette before I can talk to Stillwater.
---
Thats alot of weapons lol at least your prepared for everything
---
No, because you are on a public server so you wouldn't be trying to kill her on your own because people would join the event.
---
Same as intelligence making no difference whatsoever how often/easily mods are unlocked. They're just flat percentage chances
---
My point is there has been no point, not even when the franchise was dead and between owners, where there has been a 15 year interval between a main title. Bethesda was also far smaller when it released 3 and then 4, that's why they needed Obsidian to handle NV. Todd himself notes that they're much bigger now
---
How about the random musical instrument (mostly bass) that follows you around for whole play sessions?
---
The idea (that we never get to see, for some reason) is that they‚Äôre taking supplies from outside the region, coming in through the edge of the bog, cutting through the tunnel, and heading to foundation, crater and the wayward. Because apparently the divide is too rough for them. Somehow.
---
Also get all 3 ranks for inspiration very early on and take advantage of public teams for faster experience. Consider your desired build before randomly throwing points into skills you really won't use.
---
Any blueprints with turrets on them?
---
Would not get that razor.
---
Why are you deleting comments now lmao
---
Thats like saying you live in a country with other people but you can't go for a job by yourself. There are also private servers for you to solo events too
---
PC unfortunatly. Have about 4K shotty shells left though üòÖ Dont use them myself.
---
Seems like this is the way to go for me as well, come patch 22 next week. I have to manage my inventory and weight better again, since the stealth suit is pretty much weightless. But that should be doable.
---
How you make them ?
---
If you use VATS, use the magazine mod that reduces reload speed, it also reduces AP cost per shot.
---
[https://fed76.info/a/zerovats/](https://fed76.info/a/zerovats/)
---
I got lucky as shit and randomly logged on to claim what was left on the board. They were only available for 1 hour left. It‚Äôs nice getting free stuff and I haven‚Äôt actually played in over 3 weeks.

As far as i know , X01 and Ultracite Mods still sell for a good price
---
Add in an animation for them feeding me and I'm sold!
---
I just want to be able to piss them off so they will randomly try and assassinate me like Caesar's Legion did. 
---
Bring it you bug fucking lunatics!
---
Ah figured it out. Chassis give 2 dr, 2 er and 0rr now for some odd reason.
---
Yea i fig as much....just like the cork...was just looking to see if we made it on our own lol
---
Yeah I‚Äôm always prepared for every situation haha. 
---
I‚Äôve played like this in every other fallout too. 
---
But being able to lock items in inventory could also count for junk that you wouldn‚Äôt want to scrap when doing so at a workbench. 
---
I have found myself scrapping collectibles way too often because it‚Äôs just muscle-memory to ‚Äòscrap all‚Äô at this point.
---
Keep taking the dailies from Biv until he gives you the recipe.
---
Is it done in a monthly basis?
---
Or just 30 day cycles?
---
Cause a thirty day cycle would've ended on the 2nd of September if you paid on the 3rd of August...
---
Which perks go with it (except rifleman and the one with the stealth damage multiplier)
---
I didn't see any before and even rn just entering back into a server
---
oh well that sucks thanx for the info
---
So far I've only encountered this when I'm aiming to see a little bit better ahead, and as soon as I toggle running, *bang* and I'm now terrified lol
---
Its a shame im not on pc lol.
---
I was watching a episode of f*ck that's delicious and it had the old atomic shop music when I had friends round went to show them and they just changed it :D
---
Well.  This was enlightening.  
---
At any rate, I guess this means that two years on, Bethesda still hasn't fixed the glitched trophy where reaching level 100 doesn't pop it.
---
You are huffing radioactive offgassing from ultracite decay.
---
Are you sure those were real fish? I thought they were fake fish. I can imagine if they add a fish tank the joke would be is that they are all dead or something...
---
I don‚Äôt use rifle man I liked my fixer full auto so that‚Äôll be commando perks and I‚Äôll also use perks for bloodied build since it can work with any weapon you don‚Äôt need a bloodied fixer for a bloodied build and you can use small guns bobbles and ballistic bock to boost up the damage more
---
Personally I want the area for Johnny Weston's quest redone. Rip up the basketball court and make a 1-2 story deep pit. Where you ente,r have a makeshift elevator to lower you in. Toss in some rad barrels, maybe a cage over the top, some barricades for cover, etc. Have more onlookers in the stands who would cheer and boo depending on how the fight is going. Maybe have a tunnel entrance where creatures like Deathclaws would enter in. Maybe even get a better announcer, like a raider on too much psycho.
---
Todd also noted in a recent interview that they didn't expect Starfield until 2021 (and even that was only 70% likely) and that ES6 was 70% likely to be a 2024 release.  That would put FO5, assuming it is even the next item on the list at, say, a 70% chance of being 2027.  Given Bethesda's clear record of delays, not even counting the delays caused by this recent plague, I think they will miss at least one, probably two of those windows resulting in a 20-28 to 20-29 release, if it is even the next game on the list.
---
They may be invisible somewhere.  Try moving your cursor around and look for a turret outline.  If you find them, store what they are sitting on and its should be stored alongside. 
---
This is an older glitch that rears its head every now and again.
---
What,  that argument made no sense. 
---
You claim they promised from the start that we would be able to solo kill the queen.
---
My response to that is it was impossible to solo kill the queen from the start be cause private servers were not available at launch. 
---
You can kill the queen playing solo because it is a public event, so even if you play on your own you would still get other people joining the public event that would help to kill her. 
---
The meaning of playing solo changed when they introduced private worlds. 
---
What part of that is hard to understand.
---
It makes that enemy take 7% extra damage from everyone, so it's really a perk for teams or events not for solo. If you're at an event with 8 people and one person has tenderizer the enemy will be taking 56% more damage overall if everyone is doing damage at once.
---
What I'm not sure of is if it stacks if multiple people are using it. Someone needs to test that, and if there's a stacking limit. Like if two people using it makes the enemy take 14% damage, 3 people 21%, etc. That would make an 8 person event with everyone running it capable of 448% total which would make it one of the most serious damage cards available.
---
So only pre-nerf chassis still have the 60/60/60 defense, new ones don‚Äôt have any, is that correct?
---
No it is not broken. They changed that like i told you. There are dozens of posts about it. Chassis used to give 60/60/60 but when you put armor pieces in the values disappear (immediately or after some use). They now  provide only that 2/2/0.
---
that's truly what i mean! thanks
---
When people do that I pull out my Auto grenade launcher, works way faster than the slow and fat man.
---
Sorry, new player here (level 23): What is the "Toxic Game Pass"?
---
stupid question why does it not work?  is it for all glowing wendigos or just the ones that spawn in this event?
---
If you find a new chassis, there's a small chance for it to get the resistances back/.
---
I've seen this EXACT same thing before on multiple occasions at this site. I'm pretty sure it is a bug, you are not a thief. Pillage without guilt my friend.
---
Bethesda has said they are aware.
---
They also said it would be very hard to fix.
---
Thanks, very interesting to know.
---
Start fresh. A few things I wish I knew when I started:
---
Scrap unneeded weapons to learn mods for them and lower your carry/stash weight. You don‚Äôt need 15 level 5 hunting rifles.
---
Scrap junk at at a bench to lower its weight and still get the same amount materials.
---
Early on, prioritize damage-increasing perk cards for your preferred build instead of supporting a hybrid. Rifleman is, in my opinion, the most effective early-game build, and it can easily be reconfigured into a commando build, which is one of the most effective endgame builds. Melee is also effective and can be reconfigured in the long run to also support heavy guns and shotgun.
---
If you need ammo and meds, they‚Äôre almost always considerably cheaper at a player vendor than at an NPC vendor. You just don‚Äôt always know what kind of ammo and meds are available and in what quantities.
---
For caps, set up water purifiers at your camp. I believe you learn all the plans in the main quest. They generate purified water over time and you can sell them to vendors for a decent price.
---
Lastly, explore and see what‚Äôs out there. Appalachia has become one of my favorite Fallout settings partly because of everything you‚Äôll discover along your travels.
---
I have 530 rr in my t65, so I'm getting the 60. If they removed the resistances, they would have removed all of it, why leave 2,2,0?
---
I‚Äôm ok with the looks and everything of the bunker, very disappointed that they have the mesh wrong causing items to float
---
Trying to imagine how this actually impacts anyone and all I got is the image of someone trying to buy my shit and instead sliding over to my balcony as if they are overcome by the need to take in the beautiful view.
---
Which is to say you'll need to be more specific about how you're seeing things get placed because I'd call my scrubber close but never had it go off on me accidentally
---
What does a game bug have to do with literacy?
---
I usually sell the recipe for a couple thousand caps, and they fly out of my vending machine.
---
I've fucking had it with this fucking clingy abusive ass game. I log in every day normally, but I have been off recently due to it being exam time. I fucking missed the collection and only the collection, THE ONE FUCKING THING I WANTED MOST FOR MY FUCKING FORTIFIED BOS THEMED BASE! JUST BECAUSE I CANT FUCKING PLAY FOR A FUCKING WEEK MEANS I MISS OUT ON SHIT THAT SHOULDNT HAVE EVEN BEEN LIMITED TIME IN THE FUCKING FIRST PLACE!
---
I'm on xbox and I'm not loaded down with presents, legendary weapons, or caps.
---
I have 5 characters that I play, though I'm relatively casual due to work. I really don't see any big economy issues when I play. There may be big problems at the elite upper end of the spectrum but just playing on a daily basis I really don't see any issues. 
---
The way you say it you would think things would be plentiful and cheap in the game...but they really aren't - I don't know where all these players are hiding their stockpiles of stuff but it certainly isn't for sale.
---
How about how in high lag areas your ammo dissapears instead
---
thanks for comment and opinion, buddy!
---
actually mine was deactivated since sep 1st (when they replied was sep 2rd)                             anyway, they explained about 1st system as "auto-renews every 1 months" so it should be monthly basis ([fallout.com/fallout1st](https://fallout.com/fallout1st))
---
This. Especially with weapons that use cores- so many partially used cores so little time
---
Captainnoob has a video he recently posted showing Earle Williams going down in 17 seconds. Bullet sponge you say? 
---
It's a needed change, whether it's welcome or not.
---
It does more damage, sneak bonus.
---
This happened to a buddy of mine just server hop and keep trying. It took us 4 different servers for it all to work right
---
I don't believe it effects heavy weapons, are you using heavys?
---
Likely the grenade launcher. The round explodes on impact, so timing is easy, just shoot when they appear, aiming for the edge of the platform to hit the group that lands up top, and down below.
---
If you equip the right perk, the blast radius covers the entire spawn area.
---
If you use one without any damage boost perks, it'll to like 30-50 damage, and not kill them. Problem is, many use the damage perks. 
---
The highest I got once (for SCIENCE!) using a 1\* Bloodied M79 was 6-700damage with no damage boost perks, this likely one-shots them all.
---
I'm guilty of this, I have giant magazine, bobble head, and drug habit. It's slowed a bit, as at level 400 I realized only one works at a time. Woops.
---
xD when did it happen to u?
---
Every time, people that sell purified water for 15c have to get their heads checked.
---
Go to an area that has been nuked. Make sure you have your hazmat suit/Chinese stealth suit, or your power armor.  A decent amount of radaway as well. 
---
Flux is basically the plants you can pick up throughout the map, however when they have been nuked, the plants will look different and have a different name.  For example, if you want cobalt flux, this is what the plant is normally called, and then what it‚Äôs called once it‚Äôs been nuked. 
---
A firecracker berry (bomb berry), glowing resin (gloam sap), silt bean (neutron pod), bloodleaf (Quantum leaf) wild corn (aftershock stalk), and mutfruit (wild fission fruit). Make sure you have the perk under perception called ‚Äúgreen thumb‚Äù so you‚Äôll pick up double the plants instead of just one at a time. Once you have a decent amount of flux, I‚Äôm talking about maybe 40-50, you can go to a chemistry station and go to the section that says nuked flora. That will tell you how many materials and plants you need in order to craft stable flux (which is what you need in order to craft jet packs, decontamination showers, mutations)
---
But here‚Äôs the catch, you NEED hardened mass, high radiation fluids and glowing mass, in order to turn those flux into pure stable flux. Kill enemies that spawn in the nuke zone for a chance to get that from their dead body. 
---
Keep in mind, the flux you collect CAN and WILL spoil, if you take too long to convert it into stable flux. 
---
A tip from me, I usually nuke white springs. I go there. Kill all the ghouls, leave the server and come back to that same server so they can respawn. Once I have a nice amount of materials, then I go and pick the flowers. Keep in mind if you want certain stable flux, there are many areas throughout the map that you can nuke, that have a lot of different plants, while it may not have others. Just google what‚Äôs the best place to farm the stable flux you need and you‚Äôll find it. 
---
And one more tip. Once you have all your materials. And you‚Äôre ready to craft your stuff, make sure you have the perk ‚Äúsuperduper‚Äù under luck, if it‚Äôs maxed out, it increases your chance by 30% of crafting something, and getting double the items for the price of one. (I might be wrong on the percentage, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong). It doesn‚Äôt always work, but since flux is annoying to make, I don‚Äôt see why you wouldn‚Äôt try to get double out of it. 
---
Sorry for the long post.
---
thanks for reply!  my point is about deactivation in game earlier than actual deadline. but thanks for comment anyway bro!
---
Last month. I took a pause in the subscription after that and renewed this month. I was missing one or two days.
---
All plans for 6c
---
Recipes usually free
---
This happened to me too, revoked a day before my renewal; thankfully the day I was gonna unsub anyway haha. I'm back subbed, but jeez what a lame thing to have to go through!
---
Saw this last night. Inspired this post lol. That and 20 clothings
---
I am aware, I was being facetious. Bethesda is the fucking master of "tell, don't show" story telling.
---
You can find herds of 20+ rad stag usually being attacked by radscorpions or Yao Guai in the toxic valley. Also make sure you have the perk that gives you more meat from corpses, I think it‚Äôs in perception, and get the luck perk good with salt
---
Graham: Why human mad? Big mushroom monkey make for good meat cook! Chally no good for meat cook!
---
same
---
Don't know about illiterate, but when it comes to osmosis kits he definitely can't count.
---
And the small interloper thing in the deep
---
Bethesda is just a dirtbag company, this is not surprising at all. A pitiful shadow of its former self.
---
Got nothing to do with complaints, it's to help calculate actual damage properly. Chems are broke, some prefixes, effects, buffs etc, etc. Nothing makes sense. If anything it will help with optimising specific builds, to get the best out of them. As far as I'm concerned I can do a shit ton of damage, but as it currently stands I don't get how, it doesn't make sense, all I know it pop that, pop this then boom. I'd actually like to know what the fuck is happening with my numbers. This patch once completed will be great for the community, I guarentee it.
---
I fast traveled to a prospective camp site with aluminum and acid nodes near each other in the bog. When I showed up there was a legendary sheepsquatch fighting a scorchbeast. When I showed up the both fought me instead. I did not put my camp there.
---
I like Foundation's set up more, but Paige and the other dude is just an instant nope for me. Ungrateful twats.
---
I'm playing on Game Pass and I've yet to run into a single helpful person :\
---
Only level 23 though. Maybe everyone else playing is too high level to hang out where I am.
---
Okay smartass LOL. I'm in my 20's but üëç
---
Ouuu what platform are you on? I'd like to buy some ballistic bocküëâüëà
---
Exactly! Thanks for all the loot you hand out!
---
Uranium fever, if I do it solo on a private server, yields tons of glowing meat.
---
I bring one whenever both events go active, since we're short on time.  I switch between hitting Earle and clearing spawns, so people have plenty of time to get their hits in.  The magic procs less on Earle for some reason.
---
Most often we'll get down to SBQ with 15 minutes left and she still hasn't mutated.  It's magic weapons to at least get her inside the "half health bar per 10 minutes" ratio to let players on later instances of ACP get in and try to get hits.  Once she lands with less than 5 minutes left, death machine goes BRRRRRRR.
---
Can barely play runescape 3 or even Minecraft on my MacBook.
---
Might just be me ofc. But I would be very surprised if you could run this game on yours.
---
All I use is .308 so I sell all the ammo I get for 1c each. It sells pretty well.
---
Idk why I'm getting downvoted for explaining how shit currently works lmao

The man, the legend.

It's always the wind chimes for me

According to Steam, my Fallout 1st was supposed to end today, on the 8th. In the game, I had already lost my benefits yesterday.
---
Unfortunately we take 1-2k In junk daily, so you could never do enough damage.
---
That's like blaming drugs for being addicted. You're the user who chooses to continue using because you think it isn't your fault. It's your fault if you k ow it's bad and continue to use.
---
That's how most subscriptions work.  I wonder what issue Bethesda are having.  I still haven't received my atoms on PC.  I know it takes a few days to process the payment but the money goes out of my account.  
---
I'll wait a couple more days before filing a ticket.  But worried about the atom bugs they've been having over the last week or so.
---
Colonel kelly monument usually has a herd of radstag fighting yao guai. Like 10, out on butchers bounty and profit.
---
Rare ones probably going to be mega sloth for ya. More has a few spawns. Deathclaw are on Deathclaw island and big station just north of watoga. Scorchbeast at any fissure site every 10min, and mirelurk in toxic valley lake near grafton damn or more in cranberry bog by sunset farm and superior sunset farm.
---
The pain one to get will be Sheepsquatch. Free range and random encounters in bog and savage divide. If you need specific places there is one in ash heap by beckley station up the road, too of the world ski lift on opposite side of the lift. Finally bog has a few near the sundew grove and along power line rail pylons
---
That is a good variety I think let me know when ur open for business I'll buy all ur Sheepsquatch and Deathclaw I have expensive. Tastes
---
And fast travel mats. Please and thank you.
---
Wait the absorption legendary card heals you when hit by an energy weapon? That's the first I've heard of it. That's cool
---
I agree with you. F the downvoting haters
---
I would go for an lmg or .50 cal. The gattling gun just has a slow fire rate.
---
Yeah it's great for general use.  But I would invest in those 9 commando perk points and a good auto gun for the end game bosses. You can always go back and forth. That's what I did but once I felt the power I have never switched back, ammo be dammed.
---
Xbox, but I tend to sell out within an hour or so when they go up haha. 24c each right now. 
---
I can take orders, though. I enjoy making them.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true at all. I think a lot of people would agree that addiction is an illness. 
---
And even if we do take your analogy, drugs are illegal because they‚Äôre addictive and self-destructive. If this is like drugs, the games practices are extremely negative if they‚Äôre being compared to drug addiction.
---
Pretty sure we missed the leather/50% off murmur sale
---
This i hopped 4 times. Didn't work. Next day I log in. Still nope. Hopped again just to give it one last go and THAT got it...keep hopping I guess?
---
That one statue upnear crater will always have a bunch of bear or radstags. And goto wayward and kill all Brahmin
---
Good to know before I bothered to contact them. That's not the resolution I want. I'd rather they keep the atoms but just mark the challenges complete. I might actually pay atoms just to get them to mark as complete.
---
There‚Äôs a mod for PC for switching perks via hot key, def worth it
---
I sent you a message w a link.
---
Tank killer helps also and bloody mess helps for every weapon.
---
Damnit, ps4 here üòÇ thanks though
---
Yeah I have a great lever action sniper gun that sits in my stash :( commando is just too fun. I one shot most anything anyway with my b/e fixer.
---
Get the right legendary fixer and have the right perks and you can do over 2k damage a shot if not more
---
Let's hope so. Then we might have a real war on. I will happily shoot the hell out of the BoS and the raiders. And the settlers.
---
Maybe just try your luck with Gauss Minigun crafting?
---
Yes it works regardless of knowing recipe
---
AFAIK, the LMG is the best weapon in the game.  But finding a bloodied one will be hella expensive

check again, feral ghouls have always existed, just under the name of Ghoul crazy most of the time.

I‚Äôve got something for you. I gave most of mine away. I‚Äôm Daigouji, I‚Äôll be on in a few minutes.
---
What is a full month of you buy it on the 11th. Is it the 11th of next month or a set never of days? I'm asking I really have no idea how it works.
---
Get an ad blocker.
---
The Event plans' value grow exponentially over the next six months, as that's when they'll be furthest away to be reobtainable.
---
I was under the impression that the wendigos were not actually glowing, so glow sight may do no good.
---
No all chassis got removed the 60/60/60. Doesn't matter if it is pre nerf or not. Thats why there are tons of posts complaining about it after the change happened.
---
I've built my camp in the toxic valley, right next to the golf course and crashed vertibird. My 4 missile turrets set up to killbox the guaranteed spawn of snallygasters and grafton monster. They only occasionally require repairs. I hope the one wasteland thing doesn't ruin this, because I've got a great thing here. I come home to like 10 meat piles containing 100 caps and a bunch of acid and oil. My base is on raised foundations, so they have a hard time hitting anything except my glass domes, but I'm worried the turrets won't be able to kill them anymore.
---
That‚Äôs the problem with those youtube vids, certain things can be done but vast majority of players don‚Äôt do it. Mass nerf everyone because of those vids is the dumbest approach. For instance you‚Äôd have to do it at night to use Sandman buff, how many players wait until night to do ACR. Those ‚Äòhey look how fast i can kill‚Äô vids do way more harm than good for most players.
---
I often travel to vendors that sell more than 5 weapons.allot of the time i find someone selling over 20 weapons its all garbage 1 stars and normal guns
---
probably bethesda gathers all of those missing days and makes new 1 month membership like recycling :d
---
I actually have a Bloodied Explosive LMG, chews through 308 ammo and recoil is ass
---
It's that event, they apparently look like glowing but aren't, or its a bug.
---
 Well that‚Äôs an emote lol
---
The gatling gun is just really nice on ammo compared to most other heavy weapons.  Ammo is cheap and abundant and the gun sips it slow.  It also packs a decent punch, even if it is out damaged by other guns.  And it even has decent durability.
---
That said, I wouldn't center a build on one, but for a daily driver that's cheap and alots nicely into a heavy build, theres nothing really wrong with them.  They just aren't dps weapons.
---
ffs stop spreading false information...
---
Same way your bills work, same date every month. Doesn't matter if the month is 28 days, 30 days, 31 days if your billing cycle starts on the 11th that is the day it is due every month.
---
Really?
---
The bunker floating issue is known since the time they brought it out. The contemporary  house also has some annoying niggles too like incomplete set - no switchback stairs and the floating walls were nixed in the last update. Sorry you feel you wasted your atoms.
---
oh okay thank you again
---
Scrapping already constructed objects gives about half materials back. Contractor perk card lvl 2 means you spend half so no waste
---
As a newish player (40), should I be trying to gather cheap unknown plans from peoples vendors? There‚Äôs so much I can‚Äôt build / craft it drives me crazy
---
Congtats the pipe wrench!
---
I use to use a gattling gun and I agree with what you have said here completely.
---
lmao, exactly the same here. That ugly snort laughter that comes from right behind your nose
---
You‚Äôre only need your health low, not good, chems, or drink.
---
You on now?
---
That would make sense. I'm pretty sure that's how mine is. It renews on the 1st every month. Thanks.
---
I guess I will miss out on this as I'm in virtually meetings until 1:30pm ET. üòû
---
yeah! they should explain about this :D
---
How can he do that??
---
Yep! Just learned myself. Angry turtle made a video showing another set of legendary perks, and while I suspected the perk could negate the damage, I wasn‚Äôt expecting healing either!
---
lv. 225 here from Xbox and yes to the vending machines however you can place a total of 4 altogether depending how much you have to sell in which case however many you actual need. you can have multiple allies but can only have one present in your camp. meaning you can have both beketts bar and daguerres console available to place at your camp anytime but you can only have one of them out and about though (and the meter doesn't reset to helping them if you choose to scrap there equipment for another ally). honestly for power you can for your level utilize the medium generators and use power connectors to lay power lines connected to them to around your camp to make light sources light up and give power elsewhere. unless you have the plans for the fusion generator or someone who can build it for you in your camp, you'll want to use medium and small generators to help get power to a lot of things in your camp.
---
I play on xbox and 98% of the time its plans from the high quality present.
---
Im ok
---
Sweet
---
SBQ fight. All kind of meat there in one place
---
Yeah, uhh, what time zone are you in? ‚ÄòCause I can do it now.
---
I personally just throw every plan on 5 caps, except some gatling plasma etc, which are 100cps
---
Oh i see, so 60/60/60 is gone even if we don‚Äôt equip any PA pieces, is that correct?
---
Thanks!
---
Had a guy with loads of plans ammo armor and weapon. He had everything on 30 000 caps, even non legendary weapons, like why man :(
---
No, only one active at a time but you don't lose them just scrap build the other camp item
---
Clean in my opinion is wires on wall corners with conduits through walls. Very tedious and takes serious planning to get the most optimize setup
---
They should add a new reward pass thingy. But also create like a separate game mode like 4v4 so u don‚Äôt have to ply nw to get the rewards
---
When you get a bunch loot them before killing more being some will disappear
---
willing to bet, No
---
I have both perks :)
---
Wow that actually makes the perk sound helpful. I'll have to look up the video.
---
Any info on if it can trigger off of legacy energy weapons?
---
It‚Äôs 0942 here...
---
So it's kind of low health-high damage, while SBQ is low damage-high health. The Colossus can melt you as well, on top of having higher health/defense
---
Eastern time.
---
literally got one after only making 5 of them plus a furious and junkies üòÇ i must have got in good with lady luck xD
---
Alright well I'm sure they can enjoy it while I do something else because the dev team is a bunch of literal orangutans that can't do anything correctly. I think instead I shall hone my painting and artistry skills instead of playing
---
It's literally an abusive relationship. They just keep beating you down with bugs, broken gameplay, and MTX. But you look back and fondly remember the good times and know that deep down they're the same Bethesda that you feel in love with back in the Morrowind, Oblivion, or FO3 days. You can't help but stay hoping that one day they'll change for the better. You've invested too much time to leave anyway.
---
Most games unlock community events automatically.  The only commitment should be pressing a button to activate it.
---
I‚Äôm not sure it is. I play it regularly and don‚Äôt suffer any of the issues your saying. I have played games, early COD, which gave me motion sickness. So I couldn‚Äôt play them but never felt any mental anguish over a game before
---
Spruce Knob Lake south of Foundation is crawling with mirelurks and has a mirelurk queen.  It also has tons of bloodleaf, so if you can stock up enough pepper beforehand, then you can make a stack of mirelurk cake w/ bloodleaf aioli.  I also have pretty good luck with legendaries spawning there.  The last time I hit it, 3 of the mirelurks were legendaries, including the queen.  You usually have to swim right through the middle of the lake to get the queen to spawn.
---
Wait, are you ET too? Or is it 9:42pm for you? If it's pm, maybe we can catch each other on the weekend?
---
VENDING: Yep! 30 slots for each one. Items that are able to stack though (Stimpaks for example) will only take up one slot if you‚Äôre selling multiple.
---
ALLIES: You can only have one ally placed at a time. I‚Äôve never switched allies, but from what I can tell, you need to re-launch your game after switching allies for the profess to sync. 
---
POWER: I think it really depends. You just have to be crafty. My camp is 70% outdoors but needs power all over. I hid my generator behind one of my buildings and used very tall street lights to help run the power around. I also like using the stubby power connectors to run power along the roof of buildings to keep the wires from being visible.
---
hey buddy, they announced about delay granting atoms and it was resolved. ([https://bethesda.net/community/topic/426810/resolved-fallout-1st-rewards-delay-sept-3-2020?language%255B%255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/426810/resolved-fallout-1st-rewards-delay-sept-3-2020?language%255B%255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en)) 
---
so if you still don't get atoms, you'd better to submit a ticket!
---
More like "I'm glad I'm wearing power armor so when this jackass lifts and shifts his CAMP I'll survive the fall".
---
Look man you clearly can't understand me no matter what I say or youre just baiting me. Either way I'm leaving this discussion
---
Uh...?
---
No idea.
---
I have not tested wearing empty chassis, but i do remember it working on empty ones in early 2019 after the nerf when i last tested it. Meaning it would work if you had no armor pieces on, giving you that 60/60/60. But as soon as you put in the pieces the values disappeared.
---
Again, have not tested wearing empty chassis and this bit of knowledge if from memory.
---
It would only be right to have the week between seasons to claim as they haven't warned of it being unavailable but who knows.
---
The best place for me is every where i go. Just pick it up as you go along. Sometimes i farm fissure prime for their brains
---
My saved Scrip rewards auto-claimed (or disappeared) when I went to cash them in yesterday.
---
50 cal is good balance of DPS and economy
---
Gatling gun hits hard and very economic.
---
Gauss minigun is expensive but best DPS modded with prime it's better ammo craft to materials but mostly end game.
---
Energy weapons lack power right now and I haven't tested PTS but Gatling plasma still best of them in damage passes 50 cal and cores are seemingly common of you do bog daily and kill some scorchbeast. They drop gat plasma with core occasionally as well as blood eagles on rare occasion.
---
in my honest opinion.  I'm not spec'd out for any particular build, but my LMGs absolutely melt everything.  they are noticeably superior to me
---
Vampire gattling gun with 25 faster fire rate and explosive. Its a explosive stimpak üëç
---
I love in fucking Ohio, no wonder you‚Äôre having a hard time.
---
Okay. Thank you for the info! Will definitely have to look up the video
---
The minigun is a heavy weapon, not an automatic rifle. So yes, make an automatic gauss rifle because the other main builds all got gauss weapons.
---
It was a reply to the person who thought calling me boomer was an insult. Apparently I did not properly click reply.
---
Are you talking about the one with the event that you have to defend the island from mirelurks?
---
I don‚Äôt feel mental anguish as such, I just think is comparable to mental strain of chores or an office job where you constantly need to give it attention. But I‚Äôve paid money for a recreational game to enjoy and unwind. 
---
My issue is that there are a lot of players who have normalised the behaviour, and I think there‚Äôs merit to a psychological study on the effects it has on people - similar to loot boxes being designated as gambling in some territories.
---
He‚Äôs not illiterate, he‚Äôs just trying hard to remember whether you‚Äôre one of his 892078 visitors today
---
I always hate that glitch cuz it's been present in the game for so long and Beth stil won't fix it. I've lost so many heavy laser turrets due to this so i gave up and just have my wandering wastelander as my camps bodyguard now üòî
---
maybe thats the explosive part.
---
I have a prime bloodied/limb damage, and a AA/limb damage, and both of them have perfectly fine recoil, they are machine guns after all.  yea they do use a lot of bullets, but each bullet does a lot of damage. they absolutely obliterate any baddie
---
FFR and explosive cannot coexist.  If you have one, it's not legit unfortunately.
---
That said, I run junkies so I have a J25 gatling gun.  Still looking for a JE though.
---
yeah it doesn't matter about how many day are in that month. by the way, i think even if they have offered membership as 28 or 30 days cycle with bethesda.net system. they should offer membership as monthly basis on steam. cuz they are now offering those membership via steam subcription system. and that's how steam sub system works
---
Listen to this man!
---
Yes or you can get them through trading
---
I'd say tesla in ACP is its only real practical "non cheese " use. It allows you to deal with alot of ads quickly .  But overall the earle fight is very unoptimized . I'm usually just happy if I can complete the event without my system crashing and making the horrible sound stuttering noise lol .
---
When meat week starts again, do that. After that, run A Colossal Problem, that gives 8 notes each time.
---
I always was running low before meat week. After meat week I had like 150. Now with ACP, I've got almost 300, and I turn in notes every day.
---
Not exactly....
---
I'm an architect, and I've FT to many (so many) camps, and my immediate impression is that they desperately need some design sense. Issues like: No sense of arrival or front door; Vendors hidden in obscure locations; or, Big boxes of a building with nothing inside (to name a few).
---
You killed the really annoying guy and they were secretly happy about it.
---
We already got it. It just hasn't popped up again yet.
---
If they sell weapons and aids, it's mostly good players since they have mutations for sale. I assume experienced players are tired of filling up 3 shops with plans. I am one of those with 3 full shops with plans and no inventory btw.
---
I'm so glad that I got all these when players sold them for like 3k caps each back when queen dropped them.
---
i can't believe there are so many people like us who have same problem!!
---
No there‚Äôs not, he has absolutely no clue what he‚Äôs talking about. Don‚Äôt go wasting your time looking for a chassis with resistances, they don‚Äôt exist anymore
---
Yep, I've tried researching this for months but it's completely random and inconsistent. The only common threat I've found is it happens when trying to sprint, usually after pressing many inputs and often after trying to loot bodies
---
Thanks for this!  I will check later to see if they have been given.  :)
---
No, it would make it too easy to get rep if Beth allowed that lol
---
I sell all plans for 5 caps
---
It's not difficult, it's impossible. Bethesda has proven many times to be both unwilling and incapable of fixing it
---
Lol no it doesn‚Äôt. You can kill them in under 5 seconds
---
In my opinion, if you're dealing with a boss or mobs of enemies, yes.  Less so for just wandering around the overworld, because the spawn points and compositions of enemies really haven't changed at all.
---
nope.
---
I guess being able to only play at night or on the weekends has some limitations. That said, I could log in at 1:30ish - in case you'll still be on.
---
I signed in yesterday just to make sure I claimed everything. I wouldn‚Äôt chance it. They won‚Äôt even keep the BOS rewards in there for more than a few days.
---
they're not here to make you happy, they just need your fallout 1st money and then you can go away
---
I have the same issue with the daily quest NPCs at Crater, although it's not as bad as it once was.  I used to have to initiate conversation four or five times to get Rocksy or Wren to let me turn in quests, but nowadays it's down to once or occasionally twice.
---
I'm suspicious B added something to try and head off the reputation exploit.  Initially, you could cut off the quest turn-in conversations at just the right time, allowing you to get the reputation reward without completing the quest.  Rinse and repeat for max reputation.
---
A couple patches ago, though, their behavior changed, the rep was awarded differently and the exploit fixed.  In the process, they became less responsive.
---
I'm down to the point where I'll by them before most things
---
Even with contractor, there's still drop-off of mats. The more complex the resource cost, the greater the drop-off. While wood walls may be near equal in cost and regain, things like a fusion generator new you way less overall
---
super important since legendary perks are coming out next patch.
---
I have the clean flag with a neon e over the center star lol. Also I have "remember Navarro" on my wall
---
I dont have one but im sure i saw then in vending machines. I have vampire 90% weight explosive and with bear arms and more usefull than carying 50+ stimpaks. Have same version 50 cal.
---
I would assume not, and would absolutely claim this stuff *immediately.*
---
Who said we were sleeping?! ;)
---
Don‚Äôt have to be vegan to know how bad the meat industry is for the environmentü•¥ Source: Am not vegan
---
PC
---
By fix, is it implied they will make it worse?
---
 I never understood why they've had to change this mission so many times, breaking it more each time.
---
First they moved the fuse from Greg's Supplies because people couldn't find the entrance.
---
Then they reduced the number of blood samples, which I never understood why, and introduced the current bug.
---
Same. Except mounted plans, those go to 1 cap. Everything else is 5 unless it's some rare Fixer plan situation, then those are 500 max.
---
Had someone do this a few days ago.  Toss low level grenades in the midst of the spawn and it should do small amounts of damage to them so you'll get the XP
---
Gatling gun, nothing like walking around with a civil war cannon
---
Thanks everyone for the replies. I can see I'm not alone in finding no clear communication on this.
---
Thanks I think you‚Äôre right, I was looking at my T65 the other day, the total defense number was about the same as adding all pieces‚Äô numbers together (no extra from the chassis).
---
I would suggest priming it then, it will still chew through ammo but you get much more using ultracite and if you're ever low nuking white springs gets you all the fluorescent flux you'll ever need
---
I can't sell the Ultracite plans at 5 caps a piece. I'm thinking about dropping them to one cap to see if they move.
---
I don‚Äôt think we got the leather challenge completed my dude
---
Gauss minigun ammo is expensive to produce and heavy to carry around. Ultracite version is more ecco friendly but ammo weight is still a problem.
---
It depends whether you're asking about which meta build is the 'best' or which weapon is my favourite? Because my favourite weapon does so-so damage but looks so dang cool (it's the flaming pitchfork), but I'm currently using the usual commando meta supported by a very nice 3* Fixer.
---
If they're walls, just store them. You can always change them into different types of walls(windows, doors, etc.) or different style/material walls when you go to build them again with the 'replace' function in your menu.
---
I was never able to find a 'fix' for the bug. I left my character for a few days, came back and it decided to work for me : /
---
I enjoy the handmade rifle.
---
Oh i see, thanks, no chassis hunting lol üëå
---
They should at the very least add it to the gold vendors, like some of the legendary run rewards. 
---
But they probably won‚Äôt because it would disincentivize buying the scrap collectron in the atom shop.
---
No, that event is bogus.  This is just a place with a lot of mirelurks.
---
You may have seen a Vampires Explosive 25 Less VATS cost and just read it fast.
---
I keep a vampires gatling plasma around for my vampires fix or for face tanking.  Though my rifleman build keeps a vampires 10mm smg.
---
Even if it lacks in power, vampires is ridiculous, and I fell that if it fits into your build everyone should have at least one for various points.
---
No, doesn't have to be BS just people acting like "well all Responders are dead so nothing can be done" forgets the fact the same realistic could be said for the local Brotherhood.
---
They're a number of ways they could be written back in, even if its a group of survivors from Vault 76 rebuilding it or settlers from foundation wanting to create a more organised resistance to Raiders.
---
I use the perk load out mod, so I can change between the builds within  seconds. After a month of practice it's just part of the weapon switch process now. That said, I find myself on Commando far more often.
---
I honestly wouldn't mind if they just fixed the issue by making the generators fine for camps but limited it to 1 or 2, then fixed the camp build glitches they cause.
---
Ammo isn't really a big deal anymore, so many players sell ammo dirt cheap anyway - who cares if there's an extra machine generating some it isn't really the end of the world. While I don't like the exploits, I'd be happy if they just turned it into a normal item with some limits.
---
90% of  the CAMP plans I sell are at 100 caps  
---
It'd have to be something really rare to go up  
---
Armor and Weapons mods are usually less
---
I only have like 300 hours playtime on the game, that equates to less than half an hour daily since launch. How many hours do you have?
---
Also, in response to "Literally grasping at straws or a troll. Hard to tell", you had to run to my profile, make up wild accusations (including a thinly veiled accusation of paedophilia which is extremely scummy and only offset by the fact you thought it was called a patrol officer and not a parole officer) about me, change my age and then fall back on "im just a little kid :(" because you couldn't respond to what I actually said, it's you who's been grasping boy genius
---
It does work. I use .50 LMG with exploding bullets.  Just fire a few rounds each time they spawn.  Even my 10mm pistol with exploding bullets works.
---
If we didn't they'll probably just fudge the numbers a little to make it seem like we did.
---
It's the one that kills enemies faster than they can kill you.
---
I would be safe and claim what you can now.
---
You could be right. 
---
Vampire heavy weapons are great for ACP.
---
Yea I'm stuck with battery included...gotta fire them off it just feels wasteful
---
Ok but nothing u can miss. Legend race. Meat week. Faschnat day. Actually directly impacts on the game. The rewards are not better weapons or armour. It‚Äôs skins. Building stuff. Nothing at all that you NEED to play and be successful. So
---
You never NEED to play. It‚Äôs not a chore. It‚Äôs not a job. If u don‚Äôt do it. There‚Äôs no consequence to the action. And even better I can pick up the vast majority of the rewards from these events for next to nothing in vendors.
---
If you go to their website I think we‚Äôre like 30-50 million short
---
Watoga has like 5 PA spawn locations, and being a higher level area, higher chance for max level.
---
1. Roof of Watoga high school (only one that spawns T-51 in my encounters)
---
2. Near the crashed vertibrid near AMS HQ.
---
3. Transportation center, behind a level 3 locked door
---
4. Roof of the building next to the civic center, walk across the bridge to the vertibird with broken landing gear
---
5. Roof of Emergency Services. You can get to the roof by going through emergency services or tightrope walk along the monorail rail and then marsupial jump / jetpack to the roof.
---
I was wondering about this the other day... I guess I should have just put two and two together and got 76
---
I don't buy Fallout 1st as I think it's a strong reason why Bethesda wont make improvements to the base game because of it's existence and is a shitty way of getting extra money.
---
However, you still should absolutely be getting the time you paid for and happy to add my voice that it's ridiculous for you not to get it and realistically Bethesda should be compensating anyone who hasn't received their full time.
---
Me too!
---
I'm not arguing with you over grammar, I'm arguing with you over the fact you're a fucking idiot shit talking hard working people online whilst hiding behind the fact that you're an (incredibly stunted) 15 year old.
---
Don't chassis hunt, not worth the effort fot he extra 60
---
I'll upload a vid of what I'm talking about in a sec Einstein
---
I keep a quad 10mm pistol with extended mag for tagging/low level kills. Barely moves the health bar on anything over lvl 40 and I can ping all day. I call it my BB gun.
---
Depends...  
---
For my regular gameplay: AA Fixer with exploding bullets and Instigating Gauss Shotgun.
---
For SBQ fights: Hunters Auto Tesla or Vampires Gatling Laser.
---
For low-level Public Events: Deathclaw Gauntlet w/ extra claw
---
What the hell. This is really bullshit and legit the first thing that really makes me angry.
---
And make a reward be the Ghoul Mask from FO3.
---
I told you! üòÇ They won't let us fail because it'll look bad on them.
---
I feel even worse for those of us that have to read it.
---
Great work everyone! We (the devs faking the numbers) did it guys.
---
I walk by there every time I do tea time, just hoping she‚Äôs got something to say.
---
Yeh but I never said they were advantage-based content? That‚Äôs like saying that new maps in COD don‚Äôt give an advantage - it‚Äôs still new content that people are playing? 
---
You‚Äôve also missed that CAMP building is one of the main reasons people love 76. It‚Äôs a way to be social and demonstrate your style and taste in an online platform. 
---
As you pointed out, there‚Äôs no weapons or armour - literally the ONLY new and free CAMP content is still locked behind silly community tasks or needing to log in every day and complete daily challenges - or pay with atoms to level up. 
---
I can‚Äôt say this any clearer - they‚Äôre forcing players to log in daily, creating an unhealthy attachment to playing a game every day OR spend real life money. That sounds pretty toxic to me.
---
I added power user perk recently and slowly shifting to heavy gunner energy weapons only. Fusion cores are now doubled which means insane ammo amount for gattlin laser. Just need to find proper vampire version üòÄ
---
Man I need to know where some of yall are hiding. The plan vendors I see around the world so far want ridiculous prices for stuff. Lol
---
What even is the purpose of the sign? I completed all the quests ages ago and am wondering why even bother placing it down. Does it do anything?
---
Lucky me I got that and the reloading my gun non stop simultaneously!
---
Dude it hasn‚Äôt even been an hour there‚Äôs no way we got 40 million in &lt;60 minutes. Why do u think that‚Äôd make them look bad (the bugs &amp; delays already do that) I don‚Äôt think it could get much worse
---
That'd do it! Well, now we know at least.
---
Trading is not allowed here. You should check out the market sub.
---
ad victorium, you need more BOS in your life
---
What's even the purpose of the sign? Does it do anything?
---
I was gonna say, this is the only thing I can think of other than some sort of bug. Because my rifleman doesn't know the recipe but I buy it out of vending machines all the time. 
---
Could it also be that it is working but your numbers just aren't reflecting the true amount? Some drugs and stuff don't show the correct damage numbers but if you look at the enemy's bar while you are inebriated vs sober you can see the difference sometimes there.
---
It was also in an episode of "Preacher".
---
Sorry :( confused
---
Whatcha play on? I got quite a few keycards if I remember correctly
---
The LMG, it looks like an mg42 and that's  tight
---
Try to not interupt him while he is speaking. I noticed that skip button is causing him to to just stare at me.
---
Is for completing one of The Wayward quests. After that it doesn‚Äôt serve much purpose (besides looking cool, just not for my camp).
---
How did I never realize that the most signifigant lesbian is great at fisting?
---
I keep a lvl 3 mule with nothing but plans I sell at 10% of whatever the auto vendor price lists on all 4 vendors.
---
I don't bother selling most plans any more, as so few of them were selling at the low prices I set. I carry them around until I see a player under level 30 or so, then gift them all to them. It usually makes them happy, and that's worth more than the 200 caps or so I may have made.
---
I went to an all wood camp. 
---
Bought 10k worth of serums at 150 ea.
---
You don't have to play just because it's there. I knew that completing this season's battle pass was going to be unattainable because, well, life. 
---
What is a virtual asset in the grand scheme of things, how will those virtual assets, (skins, camp items, in game currencies) enrich your actual life. The answer is they won't because they don't really exist, they're just data. It is easy to get caught up with everything that a game throws at you, but as a gamer you need to take responsibility for the time that you spend engaging with it. If it helps use the example that I have given to help you assess what exactly you get out of it and the impact that it has on your life.
---
I did come across a camp where the person made a hedge maze like setup with punji boards.
---
Everyone I saw going through it just jumped over them all
---
This is kind of an obvious question, but why couldn't Bethesda just make it so any available rewards are auto-claimed when they remove the season run? Many are account wide rather than character specific. For the character specific ones just add them to the first character so they don't totally go to waste if someone forgot to claim them.
---
What's sad is that participating these events doesn't even guarantee rewards, just whoever signs on every day and is capable of seeing the free item notification, you don't actually have to participate at all.  I didn't participate in a single one of these events, yet, I was entitled to the rewards because of how backwards Bethesda's distribution method is.  
---
The fact that I can get rewarded for the event and somebody else who actually participated in the event is basically told "oh well, too bad, you were busy during the reward window" is all kinds of fucked up.
---
I missed the collectron as well. Why is it limited time?
---
In spite of its criticisms I enjoy the plasma caster from the gold system, hits like a truck in vats even if its a bit slow, i also got the nailer cultists blade for if things get close enough to hit me
---
All the time, but that's mostly because I'm only ever buying a few things.
---
My favourite is the Deathclaw Gauntlet.

I'm good buddies with a level 18 who showed up at the queen fight with in modded hunting rifle. Im a level 450+ and he kept talking at me so I put on my microphone and I have been playing through the game again with him. It's been a blast as I have only one character who actually plays, the others are mules.
---
Yup :)
---
In add them for an me feeding sold im animation! üêü üêü üêü üêü üêü
---
The only reason I don't have anything good in my vendors is bc someone just bought it.  I don't run bloodied so that's a pretty hot item right there, then I try to always have 5.56 in there but that goes fast too.  Plans are usually 25c but I still only sell a couple.
---
No, those caps are gone.
---
Healing part is not clear atm. Works with robot energy weapons but not with mounted laser turrets.
---
Same. I prefer the handmade just because of the skins. The combat/Fixer needs some cool new looks.
---
It's not like they haven't had time to do it.
---
I don't really care if Bethesda doesn't save them from themselves. BGS has enough other problems that need dealt with.
---
I'm really appreciate for your support! and i'm agree with that they should compensate about this problem
---
Oooh that super mutant has a mini gun. *kill* super sledge? Wat.
---
If that‚Äôs not a bug, I‚Äôd be shocked.
---
Wait. Has anyone tested against blood eagles with plasma or flamers? I know my source didn‚Äôt.
---
This only happens to me during A Collossal Problem. I reload and the gun just starts ripping. I never have it happen at any other point.
---
7th September was labor day, a public holiday in America that could have delayed the numbers being updated on the website
---
I think it mostly comes down to it looking like they don't know how many people actually play their game, how many resources people have (ie the concrete donation debacle), making the game look too inactive to complete community events. Things like that.
---
Plus, imagine the sub if we hadn't gotten the sale and everyone's been doing a scrip balancing act for the last month or so? There would be a thousand threads of complaints, on top of the ones that are already piling up from bugs, delays, currency caps, etc. 
---
Basically, if it looks like we kicked ass and we're a big, happy, active community, it looks better on them.  Again, this is all my personal speculation, I'm not trying to claim I'm that smart or anything. üòÇ
---
Not popular?
---
Oddly, last night I was playing and a lvl 33 joined the same public group. I had just turned in some technical plans (screw you BOS for yet more grenade rounds and stims) and I saw the player outside of the camp die. I ran out to see if I could help and cleared out a bunch of lvl 62 or so charred ghouls so he could get back to his stuff...I waved him over and he ran up in his skivvies and unarmed then sent me a message that read "gun".
---
At that point I just left and went on about my business only to notice him following along in a PA frame from the camp frantically waving to me with the panic emote whenever I got too far away. I checked on him with my scoped rifle and there was nothing near him.
---
At level 33...well I just gave up and fast traveled to another part of the map. Sometimes it's fun to help lower level players and sometimes it's just painful.
---
Me too but on Xbox.
---
You can't go around wasting time and effort making sure everything is idiot-proof.  Sometimes people just have to not be idiots.   
---
If you do this there would be someone making a post that their auto claimed scrip went to their first character who was already at 1000 scrip and they cannot BELIEVE how stupid and bad bethesda is for not making sure it would go to the next character.  It never ends.  People would still complain.
---
If you get shit on by food builds, YOU'RE THE FOOD BUILD ü§£
---
I don‚Äôt feel that at all. And I‚Äôm not sure the majority do either if I‚Äôm honest. As I said at the start of you honestly feel like that, and I‚Äôm not being a dick I‚Äôm being absolutely serious. Stop playing.
---
I have vid proof moron
---
Maybe? Parts of MODUS's computational components were damaged in the struggle against the Enclave members originally living in the Whitespring bunker, so he's really more insane and obsessed with mutation than anything else at the time of Fallout 76. It's not clear he would've tried wiping out the rest of humanity if he were still in the state he had been when he decided to start killing the ones in the bunker.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox, I‚Äôd be happy to act as a middleman between you and your alt!
---
I don't care how it got completed as long as it did lol
---
I run a flexible bloodied power armor build. I can switch perk card loadout for heavy weapons, shotgun, or 2H melee weapons). I run at about 19% health and can one shot or melt just about everything. Because of all my damage reduction perks even with low health I'm VERY hard to kill if I'm not extremely careless or something with high level poison damage hits me. The SBQ can hit me and I take like 2 damage. Earl can kick me in the face and it tickles a bit. Once legendary perks come out, I'm going to be nigh invulnerable.
---
I also have carnivore, so with strange in numbers, I get +8 to all stats from various meats, as well as +25% XP (tasty squirrel stew). +38 Damage Resistance, +88 Energy Resistance, +50 Max AP, +10 AP Regen, +50 Carry Weight.
---
Here is my exact build:
---
Chinese stealth suit worn under T-65 Power Armor with Emergency Protocols, Targeting HUD, Calibrated Shocks
---
Mutations: Carnivore, Adrenal Reaction, Eagle Eyes, Bird Bones, Marsupial, Egg Head, Scaly Skin, Speed Demon, Herd Mentality
---
Strength Perks: Blocker 3, Heavy Gunner 3, EXHeavy Gunner 3, MHeavy Gunner 3, Bear Arms 3
---
Endurance Perks: Fireproof 3, Radicool
---
Charisma Perks: Strange in numbers 1, Tenderizer 1, Magnetic Personality 2
---
Intelligence Perks: Nerd Rage 3, Stabilized 3, Demolitions 3, Batteries Included 3, Scrapper
---
Agility Perks: Dodgy 3, Action Boy 3, Thru Hiker 3
---
Luck Perks: Bloody Mess 3, Class Freak 3, Starched Genes 2
---
Angry turtle tested with robots and assaultrons and its working. Perk card descr is not saying anything about healing atm, so its either bug or they need to update card description.

That'll do it.
---
Thank you for this guide. It helped me complete my first junkie toon last week and he‚Äôs a full health, tanky, Junkie, stealth commando. It‚Äôs a different flow from Bloodied builds and it‚Äôs fun!
---
I had a question about whether you‚Äôve heard of an addiction glitch that sends your stats into negative? It seems when I use day tripper, I should have 12 luck but instead it‚Äôs showing -13. Thanks!
---
Just thought of this : we should have a Mystery Meat Pie where you put different kinds of meat in a get random effects when you eat it ...
---
In an area west of The Crater, there's a spot between two guard towers that spawns an assload of radstags, yao guai's &amp; mirelurks occasionally. I pretty much never run out of radstag meat.
---
She gone
---
Interesting, instead of 565, yours does show 625 which means there‚Äôs an additional 60, from the chassis I guess.
---
I hope they just need to update it. The card is much better this way, honestly.
---
Daily
---
We don't know anything about the story, for all anyone knows in Fractured Steel we can fight against the Brotherhood with the new residents of Appalachia
---
She was my favorite companion, but unfortunately, Boone fit my play style more.
---
&gt;Does jumping at them with my fists count as ranged?
---
No, all those caps go to the Insult Bot so he can afford his gold detailing.
---
Unfortunately, anything you make after you max out any of your currencies goes into the void.
---
Agree. Without healing part its useless. Fusion cores are easy to collect anyway.
---
Thats it, im launching a nuke on bethesda headquarters
---
Oh!  Well dang!  :D
---
Grown. Ass. Man. Right here. Honestly man, I should be thanking you. Youve given me a clear goalpost of how not to act when I grow up. Being a 30 year old autist reeing at a 15 year old on a video game forum is a great example
---
I made that change and had the same reaction.
---
Yes, 60 60 60 from full chassis. 625 - 565 = 60 
---
It comes and goes, it is wildly inconsistent 
---
The extra radiation is coming from Rad x that I used to suppress my mutations
---
There are a lot of low effort camps in this game. :(
---
When I spawned in mid-air, without PA, at Seneca Rock...
---
For a two-year old game, these little updates are the only thing worth playing for a level 200+ these days. I know they aren‚Äôt necessary, but it‚Äôs a pretty core aspect of the game to have new cosmetic items - so for them to be cruelly locked behind a 60-day grind (or pay real money) is pretty shitty.
---
Same here, I switched from a Heavy Gunner to Commando and back in two days because I went though so much Prime .45 ammo with my B25/25 Fixer.  I guess I will hang the Fixer on the wall.
---
What quality control?
---
Cobalt and yellowcake (*tons*) around Monongah, mostly, with infrequent crimson. No fluorescent or violet that I found.
---
I usually cut power to my vendors around 25k caps, and lock up my vending area until I can spend some. That being said I‚Äôve lost a few thousand here or there many times when I can‚Äôt get there or log off fast enough. It‚Äôs stupid, frankly.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs useless, but the card would be significantly worse.
---
He has it hard for Maxson, like how Ace has it hard for Rose.
---
You can probably tell by their body language or whatever.  If they mostly watch or ignore you entirely they may not even know what's going on. I've ran by vault 76 and some level 2 was trying his best to kill me. Was kind of funny.
---
Absolutely 100% confirmed that someone will complain about something there, but earned rewards that require an extra click on that inexplicably laggy gameboard to claim isn't a particularly great system. There was more than a few posts about people missing the Brotherhood unlocks, which were available for a pretty short amount of time really. If something was earned just award it. Certainly seems it would be more efficient on their end to not need to waste additional customer support time fielding those complaints.
---
Go do Project Paradise, you'll get all the meat you could ever use before it spoils. 
---
Otherwise, drop by Toxic Larry's, one of the few places you can get Cat Meat - short of becoming known as a Cat Killer.
---
I believe it's the Col. Kelly Monument near Crater, you get sent there to photograph it by Davenport as part of the daily, there's always a pile of animals there.
---
And, right outside of Wavy Willards, maybe at times near Kiddie Korner, there's a couple of spots where a huge mass of animals spawn sometimes in the Toxic Valley.
---
YOU ARE A GROWN ASS MAN BRO. üíÄ üòÇ YOU sir need to talking 15 year old kids‚úã and get a hobby or something man, maybe a gf.
---
Username def checks out. This fella is definitely uuhh... special
---
Not really. Best thing is just to loot up. Find materials for future camp building. Problem is building in camps still gives exp. There's not alot you can do.
---
Well like I said too, I don‚Äôt massively feel like that. I did have a couple weeks off and I haven‚Äôt played since finishing the season. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to want everyone to be able to enjoy new content without the threat of another 60-day chore where I have to eat bubblegum and take photos. It‚Äôs meaningless. 
---
What I really hate is that it‚Äôs not even making Bethesda any money! If you paid atoms for the season pass, like literally every other pass-oriented game, it‚Äôd make sense.
---
Is this the new meta on complaint posts--pre-emptive complaining on complaint posts that haven't happened yet?
---
Man I wish my Gauss Shotgun only missed the first shot in VATs.  Sometimes one shots everything and feels amazing, though usually on trivial enemies where there's no risk of death. 
---
Then when I need it most the dam thing refuses to focus the beam ever!
---
I'll swap in and out of VATs a dozen times only to have every round just magically curve around the enemy. 
---
Manually aiming is pretty much the same thing. And sooner or later some enemy winds up right in front of me despite my continuous efforts of backing away and jumping making me blow my own face off with explosive damage.
---
I'm glad for a week's grace period to gird before patch 22 and do a bit of prep work with a new toon before the nerf.
---
You could also pop on the Can Do perk card and hit up trash cans for non-perishables for your restaurant!
---
Ok, thanks :)
---
I was wondering why I kept seeing low fusion cores lol.
---
I thought it was three lefts
---
I mean yea becauae they're all the ones who support the nerf lmao. They want the game to be equal because they suck so much so they wanna drag everyone else down with them
---
Well like I said it's displayed that I only have 5 online, I've been looking around but can't figure out what I'm looking for nor have I highlighted what I should be looking for
---
We'll see it again... for $20.
---
Awful time for me to not have Gold then. On top of being unable to play, I see now I can't even access the Atom Store or load menu. Unfortunate. I'm fairly sure I didn't have any pending rewards, but I suppose I'll never know.
---
Your forgetting the town of Huntersville and West Tek which is full of super mutants that's what makes the route over the divide more dangerous I believe
---
Doesnt work with ballistic heavy weapons if that whst ur using. 
---
Bug or intended I have no idea.
---
Its very subjective.  I have seen amazing camps built bu high level players who are selling trash.  I always assume they are doing do to help the low level players out which is fine.  I have also seen poorly built and unappealing camps who are selling decent items.  Just this morning I came across a camp that was so disorganized I almost left.  But then I saw he had 3 star legendary weps for 300 caps each.  I bought the couple junkie and bloodied one he had because I know I can sell or trade them up for things I want.  I am mostly into rare attire so I am always on the hunt for clothing items to either collect or flip.
---
Ok, so L10 to 16 is about 30 minutes of play. As you increase levels signify it gets harder and harder to level up. At this super low level even finding new locations can give you XP to level up. Do your own thing and they'll catch up soon enough.
---
10c for plans 1c for recipes. Its not an economy, its a completionist support system.
---
You definitely have the correct format, just the wrong sub.
---
If they don't that's their fault.
---
&gt;There was more than a few posts about people missing the Brotherhood unlocks
---
If you can't be bothered to spend 15 seconds to log on and claim the item you do not deserve it.  Maybe I'm a little harsh on this but people had days to claim those items.  If they didn't that's on them and I have absolutely 0 sympathy for them.  I'm sure it's way more work to develop a vehicle to deliver something to all the accounts  as opposed to just adding a free item to the atom shop.  Maybe I'm wrong.
---
Yes the game board is inexplicably extremely laggy.  Truly a mystery that one.
---
Thanks :)
---
You can get started on the tadpole challenges to get yourself the backback. They are very grindy and some require doing events or killing enemies but there are a lot of challenges to choose from so you should be able to find something that doesn't award much xp
---
So the added defense sometimes would disappear? It‚Äôs amazing how inconsistent this game is.
---
It seems to happen after I've played NW. Sound familiar maybe? Or is it just me?
---
Have had so many situations where I smash the attack button a dozen times just to sit there with a dumb look on my characters face at point blank range. 
---
Worse is when I'm chasing a target down and miss over and over again despite seeing them react in pain, blood gushing out, and hearing that crunch of contact. 
---
And all this with what should be a 1 shot weapon.
---
Probably at max caps and needed to burn money. I too search vendors for anything I remotely need to burn caps. I guess I should donate more like that guy.
---
yep
---
Send in a support ticket. They are generally pretty forgiving about refunding Atom Shop purchases that don't work as you thought they would.
---
when the customer service leaves this much to be desired, the spillover into social media  is inevitable. 
---
simple questions like "why is auto-claim not a thing, when many other AAA games don't require you to go hunt for your reward, you are just given it" come to mind.
---
Intelligence has nothing to do with learning mods, and the handmade has 42 learnable mods total, with 6 that have to be bought/found. It takes more than 50.
---
I honestly cant pinpoint it to anything concrete
---
I assume alot of things, maybe I'm completely wrong.
---
I'm assuming they did some level of basic testing, But, it was likely with 8 people, on public server hardware (not the lower spec stuff used for private servers), and low latency. Basically ideal situation. And I'm also assuming they tested only on console, being that this game is a console game ported to PC.
---
It was very nice of him anyway! I‚Äôm still trying to get the mutation serum recipes, so I can always use the caps üëçüèª
---
Yes they stack, that's why a bloodied build  is so powerful. 15 SPECIAL points to all but one.
---
Idk this game is a shit show lol
---
If your father had done a better job with you then I wouldn't have to be schooling you on here. Sad really.
---
It does depend on the build and event.
---
The Vampire Prime Gatling Laser w/90% reduced weight is my go to for SBQ and Colossus Wendigo fights. I use my Vamp Exp 50 cal for Radiation Rumble and Line in the Sand. For other events, I use my "magic" Quad Combat Shotgun unless it's overkill and then use my Quad 10mm Pistol.
---
Complaints are so repetitive that it's easy to predict them.
---
What atom shop bundle? I want that tall one.
---
Reading lore in game, taking nice pictures.
---
I have both, as I have already explained to you. You should stop digging holes for yourself that you're not mentally able to deal with. So, how many hours have you played 76?
---
The laggy gameboard is truly an impressive feat. It absolutely ran better prior to one of the patches. I really wonder if there was some way to claim some items multiple times so they had to slow it down on purpose to combat that.
---
Nailer &amp; BE25 10mm Pistol.
---
Username def checks out. This fella is definately uhhh....guilty of obsessing over a game he accuses other people of being addicted to on the internet
---
 Another option could be to start an alt and play on that when your friends aren't playing.
---
I put down a bed and all the work benches and some other items and everything looks normal to me. If they're floating I never noticed it.
---
Just server hop after u get your card
---
Ok, lets see you try getting out of the empty chassis and back in. Or fast traveling and then jumping on the empty chassis. What you are seeing is a visual bug.
---
I used to have the same issue when I had turrets.  Basically, the game disables the entity and never turns it back on, so its effectively and functionally gone, but still there.
---
In my case, the turrets were on my roofs and I knew where they should be.  So I could go up to the roof, and when I highlight it, the turret gets outlined as well even though its not there visually.  It's the same as if you put something on a floor and then move the floor.
---
Once it was located, storing the roof it was on, stored everything on top of the roof.  The turret(s), conduits and otherwise. Then it could be placed back down or scrapped from the stored menu.  
---
If your turrets were not on something else and were just placed on the ground, then you'd have to replace you camp to move them to storage with everything else.
---
I haven't been able to find where they disappeared nor have I gotten a fix.
---
I have 10 slots and 5 used yet I can't use the 5 others..
---
That sounds annoying that people would do that.  I spent time making a huge open base but also put the vendors out front in my porch and labeled them with the letter packs.  
---
Why make it worse?
---
The health regeneration effect on Electric Absorption is intentional based on how it was coded, so it makes Power Armor an even better tank. I would like a Tesla set of Power Armor, but the one from Fallout 3 cannot come since that version was not developed yet in the timeline.
---
VENDING: The previous posts cover this very well.
---
ALLIES: Both Beckett and Daguerre have questlines. Once I'd completed Beckett's and gotten the "Final Word" reward, I scrapped his bar and replaced it with DaGuerre's console so I could complete her questline. As noted before, you don't lose progress with an ally when you "store" them. So when I put Beckett's bar back in, he still thanks me for helping him out.
---
POWER:  The cleanest way depends on several factors. Are you using one central (fusion) generator to power everything, or distributed generators? I actually try to plan out the power "backbone" of my camp in advance so that I keep the wires and power conduits to a minimum. When I layout the power conduits, I factor in that they provide a spherical area of effect to power lights (roughly 4 square), so I spread them out to get the best coverage. I use a central fusion generator with 3 through-wall conduits to exit the windowless shed its in. One conduit provides general power for the lights, the other two have switches: one for the garage doors, and one for the vendors. One other thing to keep in mind: after crops, generators are next favorite thing for spawned mobs to attack at your camp.
---
If you really need some help with power, I can always lend you a hand. PM me your PSN tag if interested.
---
I have that issue also with a fast SDD in my PS4 Pro. Not always but often lately.
---
They'll have to eventually. These constant bandaid fixes  won't cut it.
---
In the meantime, the only tools we as players have to affect the issue are nukes, the mat stashes Rose left for us, and and refusing to deal with obvious dupers.
---
This needs way more upvotes.
---
Between Backpacks, Deep Pocketed, and Unyielding, the Carry Weight disparity between PA and non-PA is ridiculous.
---
yeah especially the camps that are not even well put together, like missing walls generators strung all over the place, workbenches ten feet away from each other as if they are trying to social distance, a single sleeping bag in the middle of the floor, etc the list goes on when I see those camp I know something fishy is going on in that server
---
Maybe learn a few plans and start making your own chems and meds.
---
Bruh
---
Yes because it is a visual bug. The 60/60/60 does not exist anymore. If he would have jumped off and back again to the empty chassis it would not show it.
---
You did, that was me. 
---
If you served and were injured, then thank you and I'm sorry that happened to you.
---
That said, I don't appreciate people throwing blanket statements on entire generations, boomer being one prime example, a generation of entitlement being another. It doesn't do anything to promote a constructive conversation, or intelligent debate. It's literally just parroting political talking points, because that's "easier" than critical thinking.
---
I filled up two racks full of magazines. Now I sell any I come across.
---
They actually tested more on PC with the PTS than console, in fact the whole console missing PTS is probably part the reason console was delayed to begin with.  
---
But I also assume there weren‚Äôt as many servers running for the PTS, people weren‚Äôt server hopping as much, you don‚Äôt have people attempting hacks or exploits as often, etc. 
---
There are so many factors that likely didn‚Äôt even come into play during the PTS (or any of the testing) for them to be able to identify it.
---
So I have to move my camp
---
"Schooling" bro youre a fat 30 year old neckbeard in your moms house arguing with a 15 year old in all honors and ap classes. It doesn't get much worse for you. I won't even try to say anything. If you consider this "schooling" as an epic win against a 15 year old i might as well let you have it. You life is clearly awful so you can have this small victory champ üèÜ
---
Wait so the stupid camps that have their vendor in the room with the spiky traps in all the doorways are trying to kill me? I just thought they were being incredibly stupid in designing their camp.
---
They are probably using that information in one way or another. How many people accumulated SCORE without ever claiming items, how many people grinded daily, how fast did they claim the rewards... stuff like that.
---
Ah who am I kidding they probably just can't be arsed to.
---
since hes under arrest in the foundation he acts lile this i think.
---
not sure why they need him to be in his trailer but well...
---
Dirty, 1 thing I do to prevent this is put my vending machines behind a garage door. Like another said, I lock them up and cut power when I hit around 25k. Maybe something to consider. Sucks you lost out on the caps though. Think we all have 1 time or another.
---
&gt; I have giant magazine, bobble head, and drug habit.
---
Sounds like real life for some people!
---
I've been running bloodied commando for a while now and I don't mind the nerf, I run 2 b2525s one with a scope one with a reflex and shit on Earnie in 1 minute and some change. It's fine with me if it takes me 3 minutes or so instead, just more of a challenge to me üëå
---
Fallout 4‚Äôs was on T-60 (for some reason) and fallout 2‚Äôs was a separate set of standard armor, so those two can show up.
---
Ohhh I got that one too and must say it's friggin awesome give it a good long barrel , hardened receiver and a full stock grip so you don't have to repair it so often ...
---
You shoukd set up another character for when your playing without friends. That way you can set up your perks differently without having to swap them in and out and you can play around with different set ups ect. Plus it's good to have a second one to use as a mule for holding extra caps and stuff (if your friends are trustworthy to hold on to them while you swap characters) and you can gain as much xp as you like and not worry about leaving your friends behind.
---
The tent itself blocks the very specific spawn location, causing the "feature." It would be nice if there was a radius, then placement wouldn't be so specific, but for now you need to just know that spot where they all spawn to force the bug.
---
Magazines still exist in the real world?
---
And at least I have a dad. Mine didn't take his life out of sheer disappointment like yours üò¥
---
I got to level 74 and that was it 
---
No complaining from me
---
I approve of preemptive bitching
---
I say this in kindness, but I think most people with 1000+ plans for sale are doing it because of OCD. Just drop them and free up your space.  You'll feel so much better :)
---
It's weird because any turrets I wanted to move I had scrapped them before creating any more..
---
I might've had a couple more but they might've disappeared and I thought I was trippin so paid no mind until this happened..
---
If they were on the ground and you want this fixed, most likely.
---
I tend to try everything else before moving my camp, so if anyone else suggests anything, maybe try that first.  After all, why start with the nuclear option?
---
Visual bug and remnants of the time it worked. The amount you are seeing won't last, but will disappear.
---
I always get a good cap amount for rare plans and weapon plans. Everything else I tend to sell dirt cheap just to get rid of it
---
Neh.. listening to them is too annoying to have to keep them alive
---
Sometimes they bug out and spawn either out of the passable zone or high enough that bullets don't register and this can take some time or server hop which still takes about the same time cause of quest marker load up time.
---
More projection
---
Shit I missed it too. Thnx Bethesda.
---
I strafe right and left one time to tag with my Exp 50 cal and then let others have their fun. The worse is the Tesla but I've not experienced that recently so maybe the news is getting out.
---
THEY ARE NOT TRUE PATRIOTS
---
True. Same for West-Tek &amp; all the other popular locations. When I take a workshop, which I never did on a public server, I no longer have to worry about going into PVP or losing my workshop. As a pretty timid player, I also find that it's a good way to get familiar with some events, before going onto a public server and doing the event with strangers.
---
I've at least seen those gossip rags at checkout counters. So some magazines still exist!
---
I wish I was good at building.. unfortunately I‚Äôm trash poopy at it
---
I know but it seems like my only option now..
---
I'm sad for the sap who gets level 100 at close of the run so he cant claim it. 
---
He is the only one I feel bad for
---
Hey man, if you wanna waste more time go nuts. Just know you affect other people by letting Bethesda know you like this kinda shit
---
Nope.
---
Talking about how when they released 76 on Game Pass it brought a lot of toxic players to the game that doesn't really care about the lore but just wants to be disruptive and harass other players because they can play for free now. Not all Game Pass players do this but a huge number of them do. We have always had some toxic players in-game but since game pass, it has got a lot worst.
---
Mine is in the other room working. Which is what you should be doing if you weren't a basement dweller.
---
There's another frequent radstag herd spawn just south and down the cliff from the Black Bear Lodge in the Toxic Valley. You'll usually get 3-4 yao guais there too.
---
Also, south center part of the map, down the road from Dent &amp; Sons Construction there is a farm that always spawns 6-10 albino radstags.
---
Even basically giving them away i only sell a couple a night. Not even worth the stash space.  .25 weight adds up. I'll probably just drop them all in front of 76
---
Hoarding and rmt. It's more important for cheaters and dupers to have everything for themselves, having it is more important than having a use or need for it. Why dupe if you're just going to give it away, right?
---
It's usually not a big deal to pop out of VATS and back in, but it's really irritating if I'm at, say, Monongah and I have 5 or 6 charred feral ghouls on top of me. I can one-shot them in VATS with my combat shotgun, but if the bug hits it can be enough for them to thwack me enough times to kill me.
---
I try to pick them off as soon as I see them to avoid that happening, but sometimes I forget the number that are going to spawn and, like, 3 will be on top of me before I know it and boom.
---
Also im fairly sure you took an intro psych class and now think youre Sigmund Freud, yet sadly you don't even know what projection is lmao
---
When I walked up to the vendor I had no idea what was coming. The room looked normal not a trap in sight. But as soon as I made my purchase and left the vendor menu it was like 100 punji boards just fell on top of me and I died before I could even process what just happened. Idk how the player made it trigger-able but it scared the piss out of me.
---
No.
---
If there was a bethesda headquarters in the game it was more nuked then the scorchbeast queen zone.
---
Its animations are so much better than any other gun. And its an "AK"...
---
I know, what a git
---
I was set to beat the legendary run and got into a bad car accident last week so now I missed it. I would've probably beaten it with out using any atoms too. I really wanted that spaceman suit. At least I got the white spaceman power armor. I didnt know about the update until two weeks In too that's how much i grinded to get it. But they've fucked us out so many times since beta that i should be used too it even the first time it isnt Bethesda's fault.
---
I do exactly this.  I have my shops set up inside of a room with the garage door at the front.  When I am getting close to mas caps I flip the switch that cuts the power to the door and the vendors.  There is also a locked door that only I can enter to access the switch.  It removes your vendor emblem from the map so you basically go invisible to everyone except people on your public team (if you are on one).  After spending down some caps you can just open back up for business.  Would like to see Bethesda raise the cap limit.  Id be fine with 50k or 76k as a new cap.
---
yes, we did
---
thanks for that appreciated
---
Well I'm ashamed to admit that I came in on that bandwagon, though I've had very few interactions with other players (I'm only level 23) and therefore haven't had any real experience with what you're talking about.
---
ouch.
---
yes.... yes I have....
---
You know, I was like you when I first started playing this game. Oh there's level 1000? F*ck this shit I'm out. But yeah most of them not that bad. Players in Fo76 kinda a-ok Sometimes you encounter with grievers, but don't let it get to you. You can go with your own pace but its not that bad relying on others sometimes :)
---
Wishing you all the best Op üòÑ
---
Well right after posting this I did the event I was fortunate to get in with a group of people who knew what they were doing. My vampire weapons kept me from dying. BUT
---
Within an hour after its completion, my vampire 50 cal vanished. 
---
So much for that.
---
My plans sell for 1 or 11 coins.
---
Plans @100 = 1 coin.
---
Plans &gt;100 = 11 coins.
---
I don‚Äôt care if people resell, knowing at least SOME got Jetta is for 11 coins :)
---
Idk like 320. Also what are you talking about lmao. This entire convo has just been you trying to epically pwn a child on reddit üíÄ
---
Don't quote me because I'm not 100% but I'm pretty sure it was standalone not in a bundle, about 150-200 atoms and it was around July 4th. I could be wrong though if anyone else could clarify.
---
That's more Info that have found in the past so thank you.
---
I still send this message! The plans for Stimpak Diffusers is unnecessarily hard to get.
---
The handmade has this badass look with or without fancy skins. Combat/fixer is very rounded and has a feminine look to it.
---
&gt;you may can save some points and just use level 1 of concentrated fire, that will allow you to target limbs and do 1% bonus damage and only cost 1 point, you can upgrade to level 2 for a 2% damage bonus, and level 3 for a 3% damage bonus, but its diminishing returns at that point and there are many better perks you can use those points for
---
I sell at the 90% off rate as well. I‚Äôve noticed that plans sell better when I‚Äôm camped on the western side of the map. Also I got rid of most of the mounted plans. 
---
I do still see people listing mounted radroach plans at 1000 caps though. There‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre selling any. 
---
I‚Äôve been wondering if the small letters plan isn‚Äôt as rare or hard to find as it used to be. I know it took me a long time to get it and I paid a lot for it and now I have two copies in my vender at 100 caps (90% off) and no takers.
---
I'd like to see several of the originally faction items to have a slot that we could pick the insignia - like the free states gear I really like but I don't want to wear free state gear all the time so I'd love to be able to patch swap to responders or enclave or bos or whoever I want or a blank area if I just want to be me
---
Johnny what's his faces greed made me drop support for the raiders and go with the settlers for the vault raid. 
---
Was going to just keep the gold but felt bad at the idea of betraying Jet Black.
---
I have my camp set up at an assault random event, and usually will claim the rep them kill off the raiders. Usually leave the settlers be after.
---
Can tell tho that Bethesda is really boas towards the Raiders.
---
They tried to make the settlers look like arsewholes and gave the best quirky characters to the Raiders, but beyond those the rest come off as such greedy jaggoffs that I cant stand even being in their camp. 
---
A bunch of idiot children who wouldn't last a day without ripping off other people continously. 
---
I don't believe for a second either that they rebuilt that wreck to be as functional as It is.
---
Suspect I wont like the BOS at all either.  But I find I have real sympathy for those characters who put a ton of effort into creating something new.
---
Perhaps it's just my artist instinct knowing how much more difficult it is to create something beautiful than it is to destroy it. 
---

---
Yup a couple times I've wound up underneath said camp. And once after the loading screen ended I fell from a height and almost died.
---
I charge the same price for my plans. Put my camp right next to the wayward and those things fly out the vendors.
---
Obviously as a community reward it shouldn‚Äôt be time limited to only 3 days. But just as obviously, Bethesda would rather you pay 500 atoms for a Collectron than get one for free.
---
I‚Äôm hoping that with Patch 22 and the damage calculator reconfiguration that a few things like that are fixed, since they‚Äôre essentially changing the way some of the coding works.
---
Maybe it‚Äôll have unforeseen upsides such as that. 
---
One thing I really, really wish they‚Äôd fix seeing as it‚Äôs meant to be end game weaponry, is the darn Energy weapon armour penetration as well. 
---
Like, they‚Äôd be strong but the fact most energy weapons don‚Äôt allow you to stay in stealth over repeated shots is a perfect balancer.
---
Same

I had never used a lunchbox before, and today all of my enemies were bursting into confetti; I'm so glad I figured out what was going on. I love it, but I was very confused for a while.
---
I have 10 gauntlets for one cap each. I thing I could give them away for free and they still wouldn't move. Might just dump them at a station next time I'm there.
---
Heck yeah as long as they're infected that'd be coo
---
This! 
---
I have a main character and an alt I have for fooling around with my friends/experimenting with builds/extra stash.
---
But how do we know it‚Äôs purely visual bug or a real beneficial bug where the system actually added the 60 to the total defense from all the pieces? Normally visual bug doesn‚Äôt do math, so if it‚Äôs showing 60 after all pieces are equipped, I can see that‚Äôs indeed a visual bug.
---
I have mine at 10% of Beth‚Äôs listed value and I had one player buy 8 sets of plans last night.
---
If he goes to an enemy without armor and then with the chassis and takes less damage with the chassis then he‚Äôs right but if he doesn‚Äôt his little 60/60 video means nothing
---
I never let my caps get that high. If I get to 25k it‚Äôs off to smiley to purchase 300 gold bullion.
---
Do you notice a difference with hit chance?  Isn't it 5% per level
---
No prob just checked the wiki on the below link and the American flag is under "decorations". It was apparently 400 caps.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Atomic_Shop/C.A.M.P.
---
Lots of really cool people out there in the wasteland.
---
Not at all bethesda is gonna bethesda regardless of what any of us say none of this chatter matters to them üòÇ I'll still be running around shitting on foodies ;) and killing Earnie solo. 3 minutes compared to 15 minutes in a public server with backpackers still seems like I'm saving time to me üëç after running around alot of the game 1 or 2 shotting almost everything for a while it's gonna be refreshing to actually have to put a little more thought into it
---
I have a two shot explosive gatling that just shreds. I love it.
---
Wards a funny one that‚Äôs for sure.. 
---
His daily is glitched for me in a good way. 
---
I hear the ‚ÄúFinally someone with the guts to help‚Äù etc..
---
If I then back out and return to the conversation he says ‚ÄúI see you have our missing property‚Äù ..
---
Thanks Ward you doughnut üòÄ
---
Im actually looking for some plans for my X01 , no way i will pay Modus 2k for that, at least to players it will be of some use
---
Oh okay, thanks, so i only need to find a power chasis then.
---
Ok man if u insist
---
Thank you all I could pull up was the tadpole one. Appreciate the help.
---
Quad explosive 25 less vats pipe revolver pistol/rifle since it can benefit from both pistol and rifle perks.
---
They added it u can claim it again if u hit the spot earlier
---
Pbbly a stupid question but is the only way to get a legendary fixer just by spending legendary and hope to get it
---
They were rewards for the community yes, but for an active part of it. If you weren‚Äôt around to collect things during their window, you‚Äôre also probably not someone donating.
---
No prob at all, hopefully it rolls back around soon.
---
Warning accepted...and you're crazy
---
I mean, when it's Earle it doesn't matter as much because you gotta unload on him and the spawns anyway.
---
But I just unequip / switch weapons to try to stop it.
---
I haven't noticed any difference in VATS accuracy, have done alot of testing and just didn't seem to be noticeable enough to justify spending the extra points, but that could all depend on the build as well
---
If you do interrupt, you have to wait a few secs for that line of dialog to complete (as if you didn't interrupt) before he continues.
---
He also has a note on his desk that he wrote, so not illiterate, but maybe he brain farts every now and then.
---
Not a stupid question. I‚Äôve played since beta and never messed with guns until recently but for awhile yes. Once you learned the plan which you get from encrypted event you had to spend scrip at purveyor to get which I got 3 of them there but last patch they added it to loot pool for events. Like I got a 1 star executioners fixer from meat week
---
Yeah it is, as is the Arktos Backpack, the Bear Arm plans, and all of the great drops from that event. I got a bit pissed off at people last night when I did that event. 5 people including myself, 4 in PA and me. I was the only person trying to heal the animals, there were 2 PA guys protecting the bloatfly and 2 protecting the Yao Guai. I saw the Bloatfly was dying, so after I healed the Yao Guai, I made my way over to try to heal up the fly, got him healed, and the one remaining guy who was watching the bear had let it die - then the guys on the bloat fly let it die. WTF guys. That could've been the event right there where some of that gear dropped, but I guess I'll never know!
---
I just happy I finally got the damn radar dish. I have been watching them at people's camp for a year now. It was killing me.
---
I think camps need quest mechanics. When visiting a camp you get to complete the Camp Quest that has been chosen by the owner. The system rewards the player and the Camp gains levels of reputation allowing new quests to be offered as the camp levels up. This way it gives an opportunity to camp builders to get people involved in other activities, like exploring the camp and not just vendor hop (not that it's a bad thing necessarily).
---
I mean it's boring to be normal.
---
Yeah I really don‚Äôt understand these people selling plans for tables at like 400 caps, nobody is going to buy it. I just sell mine at 10 caps
---
This is interesting. Definitely made me think about my choices in legendary perks. Also, I'll update a quote I posted recently:
---
"Fuck energy weapons." -the Bethesda Employee Handbook 2020 edition, pg. 36
---
Yeah I‚Äôve never had it outside of the event. It seems to happen when I‚Äôm firing at the moment he screams and makes you run away in fear, once you get out of that fear running the gun just fires.
---
Is it better to sell diluted stims, rather than purified water + full stimpak? Something I never thought of doing until this comment, I've always just sold the two things individually
---
I don't understand why it even needs to be purchased. If something is free it should just show up in my build menu. This is dumb that I have to claim it.
---
Lots of people play fallout games as the bad guys
---
So you use another weapon to kill them, then feed them to your Super Sledge when dead?
---
Yeah it makes boss fights boring but since it almost never works...
---
Fraternity Row in Morgantown, Red Rocket and Green County Lodge in Flatwoods.
---
I collect plans and drop them outside Vault 76. Weight of .25 per plan it adds up, so I've never bothered selling plans. If I know them, they get dropped, even rare plans.
---
Honestly, whatever you do its extremely painfull. Its hard to resist skip button even knowing that it will break  his lines.
---
Is it worth it grinding for the plan or using a normal fixer is good enough
---
Happened to me the other day for the first time (Xbox).  Best I can figure is this, when Earl gets killed and the mine starts to collapse the entry shaft point to the mine collapses first which does not allow anyone who is above to jump down.  Which is why we died from falling damage.  When Earl dies, any player who dies after that is automatically ejected to the outside regardless.  I dont think its "bugged" I think its just a poor design.  If Earl dies while you are still up top of the shaft you should still be able to drop down and loot for however long you can before the event ends.  The only thing I cant explain is how you would up in the Forrest rather than just outside of the mine.
---
I find this glitch pretty useful when using black powder guns so I can shoot twice, but it still should be fixed
---
Normal is fine but yes it‚Äôs worth it what system do you play on
---
Crap! The fan collection was the ONLY thing I wanted.  Tried to log in a couple times over the weekend and the shop wouldn't show in the menu. Today I can finally log in and now it's gone.
---
This is still happening, I renewed this morning and I‚Äôve not gotten atoms. Also purchasing anything via Steam (atom wise) will not give them to you. Their Steam connection is fucked up and has been for a week now. 3 different people I know all having the same issues.
---
Blue Ridge caravan should be wholly it's own faction (Merchant focused). I really want the flying flag.
---
Ps4
---
Definitely! Very lucky to only have met one griefer
---
I believe there is a new blue ridge caravan location in the mire on the pts but I could be wrong
---
I predict there still will be SCORE challenges they will just literally do nothing for anyone. I have zero faith they have thought of something else or even disabled them.
---
Of all the obnoxious bugs in this game I actually kinda like this one because it's more realistic than most. It can actually happen with belt fed machine guns when the gun heats up enough it starts cooking off rounds and continues firing after you let off the trigger. Also terrifying lol.
---
if i could have a tank full of goldfish in my communist bunker with my grandpa ai next to it, my life would be complete.
---
This forum is 90% salt.
---
"GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!  WE DID IT!"
---
(you knew that was gonna happen, right?)
---
Don‚Äôt they already have models for painted ghouls?
---
If you cared that much, why weren‚Äôt you paying attention? You had a few days to claim it, all the BoS rewards have been time limited so far, the collectron wasn‚Äôt going to be an exception to that.
---
You don‚Äôt have to log in every day. But something time limited? You need to log in once during its window of availability, yes.
---
Given you didn‚Äôt, and didn‚Äôt even check the window of time it was available for, did you really care all that much?
---
Damn I‚Äôm on Xbox. I have extra plans. After buying one on market for 5k caps I‚Äôve gotten about ten of them from 11 events. But go over to market sub and say you want a fixer plan someone will sell you one or give you one
---
High end sellers need to come up with some type of code to indicate they are selling rare items, like put up 76 explosives for sale and then put the price extra high so no one buys them. I'm at a point where it's like 1 in 50 camp jumps I find a plan I don't know, wish I could know before hand if it's someone selling chem stations and tinker workbenches.
---
 It would be great to see the inventory list from the map, although I'm sure that will never happen.
---
I hope you don't have too? But more then likely you will sometime take days to build a really cool camp to show off just to have someone come by and destroy it or kill your cow or pet. Or those people that follow you around constantly stabbing you in the back while you are trying to fight something, and those people that just walk around with a constant (Trade) Free Stuff Emoji displayed are the worst.
---
Vats is based on vault-tec software, which I think a lot of is forget. The pipboy is recording everything we do and then, just for giggles, let's only target radtoad eggs.
---
I list everything at game value, 4 vendors full of nothing but plans. They all sell.
---
Damn if its not a big I will definitely be getting it
---
first of all how dare you LOL
---
Also, in a few weeks they are releasing One Wasteland so no one's level will matter anymore.
---
crap I just realized I was looking at fallout 4 CF not 76
---
Thank you for the help and also for the offer
---
I think it‚Äôs because Earle moves more and his hitboxes are a lot smaller than SBQ which is mostly a huge chunk of meat.
---
I mean, are you on PC?
---
Now i feel stupid for selling it when i was a noob -.-
---
Happens to me in NW after i get rezed. Is worse there because your ammo is really limited.
---
Yep been in the game for about half a year now or so. Really fun for my pistol crits build. It also mod course mostly happens with AA gutsies and Assaultrons, or that max level crowned super mutant with the mini gun. Always great times.....
---
I haven't really run into anyone else out there, yet. Seems like most everyone is higher level than me and is running around in nuclear red zones where I can't follow. 
---
But you've given me something to look out for.
---
This usually happens when my game stutters.
---
This game can stutter quite frequently for me. It feels like the garbage collector is running and causing the stutters but I'm not sure if the Creation engine uses a GC.
---
Sometimes my stutters can last up to 3 seconds... they cause my weapons to continue firing and will force me to jump out of my power armor if I'm wearing it..
---
I've fixed these issues in the past with other games by increasing the garbage collector buffer... wish I could do that for this game.
---
Normal is so over-rated...at least that's what the purple walrus in the top hat here keeps telling me.
---
I would love to check it out too, I will be on in about 10 min. Send me a request if you can - OncomingstormD7 :-)
---
For this game I'm on PS4
---
It  tends to disappear when you server hop and sometimes re appears when you join servers again. As far as I'm concerned, I'm done and I'm not going to ft just show the stats are still there just prove a point. All you've been doing is giving your word,  the only piece of proof from game-play is a screenshot you with no indication of perks or mutations shown , so you're the one lacking proper proof .
---
If it auto claimed we would be forced to have broken glitchy camp skins.  The one thing I didn't claim was the future tech camo skin.
---
How did you go about doing it?
---
I mean at this point if someone hasn‚Äôt had max level a while back, it‚Äôs because they either started late or didn‚Äôt want to do the minimal amount of effort required to get it.
---
BGS even had multiple boosts to the SCORE to make it easier along the way.
---
Whether we donated enough supplies or not doesn't really matter they are going to give it to us anyway.
---
 That's why I have only donated 250 of each supply.
---
Googled and found my answer here on the first click.
---
Thanks!!
---
Was needing to start a new char for the next run, and not looking forward to my main char getting higher and higher in level, making that daily level up take that much longer. This idea is perfect. can just do one char for leveling only and keep playing my main char.
---
I need a black powder weapon that's good at killing robots.  Troubleshooting Anti-Armor Two shot I think would be good, got anything like that?
---
Bit of a dick move really. Fair enough on a private server but bit of a shitty thing to do on public.
---
Good advice! I think I got the water purifier plans early on from taking a workshop, though.
---
I get it with Earle the most, which is why I find it so inconvenient.
---
I‚Äôll be spraying rounds which are essentially being magnetised, pulled to the walls and then I common Wendigo spawn will come up behind me and chew me up.
---
Whereas when it actually works I‚Äôll GunFu all the spawns and utilise my damage bonus to Earle. 
---
It makes it increasingly hard not to tunnel vision one critter as the entire time I‚Äôm fiddling with my gun and smashing down Nuka-colas and waters.
---
Thanks a ton! But unfortunately the bug I have is a different one and occurs after the quest is completed. I did start a new character though, and thankfully managed to get through it bug free on a private server. As someone else mentioned...its kind of crazy how this quest can break in so many ways.
---
I'm not going to bother doing that. The original argument was if it existed and I did my part.
---
Look at his eyes. He's on every chem known to man. Before they tied him to his chair, he'd wander around like an old man in a nursing home. It's a miracle he can put his clothes on (looking at you, Samuel).
---
Good to know. I'll study this "feature" some more. Thanks.
---
Junkies heavy build here. Junkies ffr 50 cal and junkies ffr Gatling gun. I also have been working in using a junkies Gatling plasma and junkies ultrasite laser. 
---
Note for fun if I come across a grenade launcher I burn thru my 40mm ammo blowing up cars n such.
---
Bugger.
---
I do the same, just scrap one wire.
---
That's weird. For me it only happens after a reload. The scream may be connected somehow though because it's not after every reload. I can't say I've paid enough attention to say yes or no to the scream. I use an automatic handmade rifle for reference.
---
Anytime I see one that is like an open terrace with no roof or official building I just leave.
---
Reason being is because their 100-200+ plans are all mounted heads. They thought they were slick opening duped presents, and they just throw a camp together to try to sell them.
---
Throwing a camp together means foundations and a few turrets on one side in a straight line. 
---
And even if you wanted mounted heads well, don‚Äôt get me started on what they price them at...
---
This.  I think all i eat is glowing meat.
---
Yea yesterday when I came to SBQ after a slow ACR, there was only a few minutes left, the guys at the SBQ didn‚Äôt even make her regen. I attempted to use a magic minigun when there‚Äôs two minutes left, it didn‚Äôt work lol. Beat the event with only 10 sec left on the timer and got my precious one star wood piece.
---
I started to sell camp plans for 10c, recipes for 5c, weapon/armor/pa for 10-50c and it works pretty good.
---
Plans from seasonal events I hold on for some time later since most got them lately. 
---
Fasnacht and meat week plans are on hold atm but the Halloween ones were gone in no time.
---
B2525 Fixer for commando and B2590 Cal.50 for heavy (but with the nerf coming maybe return back to BE90 Cal.50 and BE15 Plasma Gatling).
---
I sure hope so,  that would be a best case scenario. I'd totally join up for that. I've been wanting to go against both of those factions since they were introduced.
---
Meh, NW is a simulation.
---
It's just best to just have fun and try to avoid people like that if you can? Most Really High-Level people will try and help you out, don't be scared of them is what I was getting at on the OP.
---
Add in an animation for them feeding on me and I'm sold.
---
Molerat farts.
---
Nope. After 12pm today, the LR is gone.
---
I'm pretty lucky that way, too! I've only had a handful of bad experiences since early days. Just junk trap camps, really. Most people just want to do their own thing and are pretty laidback overall.
---
My rocket aluminum baseball bats are always a hit.
---
Nah, if it's more than 500 caps per serum (which is the norm that I've seen at least on PC) I move on to find a sane person.
---
Even then it‚Äôs less about racism and more that any threat to humanity is considered the enemy.
---
Synths and super mutants are existential threats to the human race.
---
Spawned inside of a locked room and it was far from other locations so I had to waste caps to fast travel there and back just to get out of the locked room. They didn‚Äôt even have the ammo I was looking for..
---
If your looking to make some Ballistic Bock for your self then you should try and grind the daily - wasted one quest from biv. To be able to craft your own is quite useful if you have the crops in your camp to make it.
---
I don't think a lot of the people involved are allowed to take the time to deliver quality. I can't believe that so many people have no pride in quality work, so the best explanation I can think of is that management and bean counters are compromising the quality, and ironically the true earning potential of 76, with poor management.
---
It's estimated that Fallout 4 made over 2 billion. They should have let those people be in charge of this game, given them funding, and kept the accountants and marketing people out of development decisions.
---
Have you tried to "repair all" from your camp module?  If they are broken somewhere, that should cause them to show up.
---
Hey how come I saw dead fish and dolphins and stuff in FO4 but never in the water?
---
Use the time to do all the low XP farming tasks that you are just too tired to do during the season.
---
I spent this weekend farming:
---
- Sugar 
---
- Lead
---
- Aluminum
---
- Cream
---
- Honeycomb
---
- Sugar bombs
---
- Royal Jelly
---
Basically, if it doesn't spoil and I regularly use it I'm stockpiling now.  Hopefully I will farm enough over the next week that I won't need to farm these things at all during the season.
---
I made a bunker called 25cap. Everything is 25cap.
---
That‚Äôs Arthur Maxson and his love of humanity showing; his whole philosophy is about human exceptionalism and potential, and his hatred of anything that threatens humanity stems from that.
---
It's currently glitched and is a plain red cap.
---
Send a ticket into Bethesda and explain that no one can see you on their friend list. They‚Äôll probably send you a list of trouble shooting options. That obviously didn‚Äôt work for me so the next step was the unlinking. If you want to get right to that mention that you want to unlink and relink to fix the problem.
---
Illiterate: the inability to read or write.
---
Ward is a raging  alcoholic. That explains having interact with him several times to get response to single query and constantly losing things.
---
Yup, saw a camp that had like 300 plans and 30+ weapons.  Made it to the vendor.....[pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnMhJU6RsYU)
---
Many other times, fast travel load in, spin around...odd....check the map.  No Camp.
---
I wish people would check the map before logging out if they're selling things.  I always do.
---
Best weapon in the game?  I would say a bloodied or junkies explosive gatling plasma with splitter. 300-400 to earl per round, however that is legacy.   
---
Non legacy and looking at sustained DPS the gauss minigun, I will avoid mentioning the "magic" effect weapons as that could change at any time and new magic items will appear.   
---
Personal favorites when I am not using heavy guns would be a quad pipe revolver sneak build, it is just fun. Personally never got into rifles really but they are popular but you must play a certain way only to make them shine.   
---
I do enjoy the buzz blade on my melee guy while I have some god tier unarmed and 1 handers I fall back on my vamp and bloodied buzz, I mean it is just stupid with the faster swing speed it slices it dices it makes a whrrrzzz sound while blood flies everywhere.   
---
Current main uses a TS FFR Gauss minigun, BE gat plasma, V FFR minigun, a Scorch FFR ultracite gat and a V FFR ultracite gat. For dealing with those that come to close I have a instigating FSW 90 cattle prod for being a one hander it hits pretty hard and makes short work of peons.
---
Bethesda already stated that if you dont claim the prizes they will all automatically be claimed to the last used character.  
---
Who you should feel bad for is the people who were in the last 3-4 tiers and no atoms to buy their way out lol.
---
Here's the part I have yet to understand...
---
This only happens to me on some of my alts, one, never had this issue.
---
Or it's to prevent the buying all the things from your vendor so it starts hoovering from your stash at base price.
---
I'm not sure... it's hard to keep up with what's broken and fixed.
---
I thought it was working, the numbers show it is.
---
Great for selling to vendors (cooked) as well
---
Nice! I‚Äôve fortunately only ended up in what I think was a trap camp? I loaded into a locked room and then became wanted for picking the lock to get out when I was still low level. üòÖ
---
make or use an alt and collect it otherwise it is off to the nether with it, worse case buy the same amount in modules? those have solid use.
---
I think they said there are no current plans for an extra character slot which is unfortunate.   
---
I have 5 characters all who are decently high level and all with unique builds and identities and camps.  I do not want to get rid of any of them but I also want to start another character as there are builds I would like to do but cannot due to only being limited to 5.  
---
Other games like ESO sell character slots for crowns so I do not know why they do not sell extra slots for atoms in the shop.  This would not be sound ground-breaking feat or anything.  It would just be a way for those of us who like to play multiple characters to continue doing that while also making them money.
---
To be 100% clear, it isn't the Firebreather outfit you get from the storyline.
---
It's one that has like a 1/40 drop chance from the first two responder quests in Flatwoods, or .015 from Forest events.
---
Though I'm 90% sure it doesn't drop from the Reaponder quests anymore. I've created abd deleted around 60 characters trying to get one to drop, about half post wastelanders.
---
Why, you can always get one in the parking lot of the amusement park, it always spawns there.
---
Why doesnt Bethesda give us the 2 week gap to claim stuff? I haven't claimed a lot of scrip because I'm close to max.
---
Yeah I knew about the bug but I forgot until I tried to do it myself. Think I might of got lucky when it worked. Yeah I've had a couple of bugs this time round. First time was just at the raid I had to restart a few times when the intercom wouldn't work this time round tho. I've had problems with that mission, Problems with Jens mum not showing up in the deep. Motherlode didn't show up and couldn't get the safe room key card. All worked when I restarted tho
---
Those are two completely different guns with totally unrelated builds...
---
It's up there with feral ghouls that have Rad-Away on them. Like, were you waiting for an emergency to use that shit, or what?
---
But were dose it drop at and what's its drop rate.. I've seen many post on here and said other 76 page but not on form page or wiki page.
---
Ugh yes. A long time ago I found an awesome price for something I needed and just as I clicked on it to complete the purchase the guy logged off and I fell to the ground. :/
---
If it weren't for the troll abuse, I'd like to see them put in the "welcome mat" that was in Fallout 4.  Unless that was a mod....now that I think about it, that might have been a mod since it was helpful and made sense.
---
Trademark infringement? Stepping on your brand?
---
Yes, I'm pretty sure they'll hold the sale between 3:00 am and 3:15 am Nepal time the day before they announce it.
---
I'd be happy if the Enclave event rewards at least made sense.
---
The number of times I've gotten a SAA...
---
But if I'm addicted to the game on 300ish hours by your own claim that must mean you're also suffering from the same addiction. You should get a hobby or a job bro
---
It is more likely that your HDD took a shit and Fallout had nothing to do with it
---
Awesome.
---
Did you have to wait for the relink or was it pretty quick?
---
Nice experience üëçüèº
---
I‚Äôm at that max scrip and too many average 3* weapons so gift as many as possible... only some players feel patronised by the gift? This is a genuine gift and not palming off some heavy broadsider to the nearest person..
---
You were genuinely happy with the gesture,I wish more were üòÄ
---
This is what I'm hoping for. I have a PA melee tank character that has to give up a melee damage perk set just to run traveling pharmacy :/ Maybe the BOS will come through with the tech.
---
My reply was in reference to Boomer the Protectron in the bog who blew off his arms and legs and asks you to collect the explosives.  Also, I do not like blanket coverage declaration of people based on when they were born.  I was born during the ‚Äúmillennial‚Äù decade, but I do not share any of the similarities to make one a millennial.  I am my own person, with a healthy sense of humor and the right amount of snark.  I do not affiliate with any political party or judge those that do.  In fact I judge no one about anything.  I like a good laugh and to poke fun at the obvious hypocrisies of our society.  I‚Äôm sad that comedy is dead (see the flaming down votes).  I apologize for whatever it is that I may or may not have said that may or may not have offended anyone or no one.
---
Just being cheeky.  Down vote to hell now
---
oh the claiming isn't the issue. You would have to rebuild your camp as you need to replace the C.A.M.P device to use the skin.
---
It is my understanding that the Tree Village in the Mire is getting people and a bit of a touch up.
---
Few days ago i bought that damn osmosis kit from player vendor for 10 caps lol. His first lines are usually broken and i have to start conversation multiple times in order to pick up the quest. Second (returning item) part is alwyas working properly in my case.
---
Considering that Beth is actually planning on a "simple" way to respec, there will not be an additional slot coming, at least not for the reason asked.
---
I also find it highly unlikely that they will ever do so.
---
Anyways, as for muleling, I use a secondary account for that, I got it at a sale for less than $10. Also since those $10 translate only to 1K atoms, I think a second account is way cheaper than buying an additional slot, especially when cheap &amp; buggy skins are already more expensive.
---
Kinda what I am assuming but it hasn't had an issue before. Just wanted to see if its been a problem for others.
---
I once fast travelled to a camp. Right after the loading screen the camp is gone. I think they server hopped üòî
---
I dump what I know won‚Äôt sell.  Wasting space
---
I've been at work all afternoon lol, it's what we call a slow day so I've been bumming about on Reddit watching the clock. But you're an American, it must be like 11am for you, you have spent your entire morning arguing with me after your needless comments to the OP. That's tragic, when I was your age I would either be at school, work or out with my friends, not starting shit on the internet.
---
I'm in the same boat, level 221 with little else to do but the daily grind and I for one am loving the season pass because it gives me something to do when I can spare an hour or two here and there. I understand what you're saying about the cosmetics, but at the end of the day Bethesda are in the business of making money and those cosmetucd are the product, however we as consumers have a choice not to buy into their business model. There has to be aspects of this game that you enjoy or else you wouldn't play?
---
Nope. Just harpoons iirc.
---
So while we are talking about secrets have you been inside the deep cave by white springs? And does anyone know if there is anything more to that??
---
I did it before bed and it was back to normal before work the next day. Idk how long it actually took but It seemed pretty quick
---
Don't just hide them, stash your machines. Glitching through camp walls is trivial, and to some people a locked door looks like a sign that says "check here for the really good stuff".
---
Can't lose money from your vendors if your vendors are gone.
---
I looked before work, JUST TO be sure...
---
That's pretty funny but also good to know, got one I want to trade for a AAe but also wouldn't mind getting another one.
---
There are still players who place the rad shower at the doorway into where they have their vendors.  
---
Since we're not usually able to turn in on/off, we either have to pass through (losing 25%+ rads), or skip it.
---
I just skip it.
---
NW is trash. Waste of the devs time.
---
Or when you fast travel and just fall off a cliff and break both legs? Seriously Bethesda....
---
yeah, they did say there are no plans, but then again they already made adjustments based on player comments for the Legendary Perk system. So who knows?
---
Just exploring and running away from enemies if you see them.
---
Make group 1st then get them to wait at site start event and join them
---
The client is really finicky with sound, the only way to get it to use your BT is to disable any other sound devices before you start it and don't change anything while playing else you will have no sound at all.
---
I always let the regular Raiders keep those, I only take them back if it's a Blood Eagle thief. Fucking liar.
---
55 minutes to go
---
Same here.  I hopped multiple times over multiple days (mine was the blood sample problem, not the fuse).  Said "OK JUST ONE MORE TIME" and it worked.
---
It would be the first I've heard of it. It's usually a case of hardware failing and software can trigger something. Fallout definitely won't break your SSD but it is possible it could have triggered a shutdown, not caused it.
---
I've never had drive issues but I've had display driver problems. Fallout makes it worse but the problem isn't the game, it is my outdated drivers and old GPU.
---
Might be worth taking your question to a tech forum. You will find more information on SSD related issues
---
Possibly. Or perhaps they‚Äôre telling us it isn‚Äôt so no one role plays knowing that nothing we do as characters will matter, as in the end, we will all die in the nuclear flame.
---
You may be right.
---
I‚Äôm always happy when people go out of their way to help! It hasn‚Äôt happened to me much since I passed level 100 though. Lol. Worst case, I can turn it into script and maybe get something more suited for my build.
---
I sometimes try to drop some stuff off for low-levels, but they usually run away before I can help.ü§£
---
If only we could have good ones that weren‚Äôt gauss (I know they deal ballistic damage, but the ammo is energy).
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure of that. This is the first one we‚Äôve come close to failing, excluding concrete which had different issues.
---
Yeah next time I‚Äôm posting on here and getting a group together
---
Another wild assumption lol.
---
You're projecting, you said I'm addicted to a game you play more than I do, you've made ridiculous comments telling me to get hobbies, a job, a partner (all of which I have) whilst you sit there trying to pick fights with strangers online at fucking 9am. 
---
No one would need a psych degree to figure you out. Everyone knew a kid like you at school and we have all seen how they turn out. You aren't gonna be the boss of the kids who are mean to you, you're going to end up in an unremarkable 9-5 where people aren't going to have time for your Malcolm in the Middle woe is me routine. The sooner you learn to stop being a little gobshite the better.
---
But if it exists is irrelevant, a random 60 on your chassis means nothing. It only matters if it actually affects you in combat
---
Thats really all I wanted to hear. Thanks
---
I was camping this last weekend and missed it :(
---
Nope. When asked at Quakecon the devs said categorically they have no intention of increasing the character slots as they didn't feel it's what players want. I found this to be a hilariously Bethesda response to what was a frequently asked question presented by a CM. Finger nowhere near the pulse as usual.
---
Beefytrout: Your next line is, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get to claim my prizes from the run in time Bethesda!‚Äù
---
People Who Waited Last Minute To Claim Stuff: I didn‚Äôt get to claim my prizes from the run in time Bethesda! (**Shocked** Wait what?!)
---
(I‚Äôve been watching too much Jojo‚Äôs lately... I apologize.)
---
I'm thinking that's a server tick rate issue. 76 has a tick rate of 20 (cheap bastards), so some (but not all) very high ROF weapons might be running into a bug where the server thinks the gun is dry when the client thinks there's still ammo in the gun.
---
I'm still waiting to see if there's a patch today :(
---
They will just fudge the numbers and we will pass and get our reward. They don't want to hear the outrage from the community.
---
Took me a while to realise that only one at a time works too ha ha
---
I have an explosive vampiric railway that I use to heal.
---
Old, copyright free, elevator music.
---
Yeah, this. I started late and figured I had no hope of getting anywhere, but I'm currently at 70 ish, and quite happy with that.. I can't play every day, and didn't do any of the NW challenges. Wouldn't have been at all hard to finish if I'd started day one.
---
Queen resists explosive effects so that might have something to do with it. But people who destroy bosses with magic weapons are cringey anyways so it doesn‚Äôt really matter.
---
Also the penta barrel gives less dps then the tri barrel so use that
---
&gt;Considering that Beth is actually planning on a "simple" way to respec
---
Do you mean perk load-outs?  This is highly dependent on special in terms of using different builds.
---
Furthermore, some of us don't want another slot for "muleling".  I have a second account for that already.  I want a 6th character to actually play and use.
---
Yeah I was surprised by that when I got the full suit. I was assuming I'd need to build it myself and had been hoarding ultracite for that reason.
---
if you got the gun legitly then it's not a "magic" gun. magic guns are ones people hack into the game with the specific mods they want on it.
---
As soon as there is an update, it will be posted.
---
To my understanding you have to keep it targeted on 1 limb and not miss for a while. It's also affected by frame rate and stuff I believe
---
I have multiples, and have dropped them off for my alts.
---
I have one alt that is max rep with settlers, and has yet to unlock the raiders.
---
Just got it to level 50 yesterday, so I should start working on that.
---
The 60 doesn't make a difference. I only ever use it so I can be as tanky as I can get in pvp against those pesky tesla guns. Not sure if it helps or not, but no harm if it's there, if it goes away than I'm fine with that.
---
Since the legendary run started in the summer I could play every day and do almost every challenge. I paid for one tier and with all that barely finished the run. From the get go we should of had the extra challenges we got from the fortifying atlas challenge. Having to slave away every single day to just barely finish a run where half of the rewards are things I have 20 of is a horrible system.
---
I sell all of them at 10c. Included all PA stuff. Eventually you'll make some newbie very happy. The four shops full of repeated plans.
---
I'll keep doing that until I really need to sell anything.
---
It is possible to have nice elaborate camps AND easy to find vendors.  I think some people just like to troll.  If I cant find or access your vendors in under a minute I just leave.
---
In FO4 I pretty much only build settlements after beating the game.  Camp building is for sure my favorite thing to do in F76 aside from vendor hop.  I have only been playing for a few months and I have moved and rebuilt my camp at least 50 times since starting.  There are just too many amazing spots to stay in once location.  But my current junk tower build is for sure sticking around for a while.  But even amongst all the chaos of my camp, my vendors are super easy to find and well organized.
---
Source?
---
Lol yeah I guess it‚Äôs all relative, as being level 4 and seeing a hulking power armor level 100+ coming towards you, would be scary even if they meant well! üòÇ
---
My main uses a BE gatling gun 90% of the time.  I only break out something else like my BEFR .50cal for things like the colossus.
---
magic guns are just weapons with the bugged legendary effects. they have nothing to do with H'd weapons.
---
i had one of these and honestly felt too bulky and the recoil and reload takes forever. so i ended up selling it for a hefty profit of 3k üòé
---
I fast traveled into a level 200+ camp, and it was one foundation with a vending machine on it, and the workbenches just randomly sitting in the dirt.
---
Sure enough, the guy was selling bad common outfits and really terrible 1 star items.
---
Seriously, brohimo, how even?
---
I only made it to level 83 and that was playing the game every day almost during quarantine. I dont get how others got so much further ahead.
---
Power armor should be allowed to carry 2 backpacks.
---
Nah super mutants can be chill, Bethesda's writing just has to realize that. Some of them would prob still be raiders/warbands like we see ingame, but the non-Bethesda Fallouts show that coexistence is possible.
---
They don't lack empathy, &amp; so if there's a place for them in society, they wouldn't feel the need to kill/FEV everyone they see.
---
The 9th player has another instance, you can leave one instance and join the other if you have team members in that one after you‚Äôve killed Earle If you are quick enough .. i works the other way as well we were struggling the other day and 2 high levels turned up and melted him I assume they were from another instance
---
I just move my tent and fuck the group spawing and lol at batman user.
---
Yes, this has always been the procedure. Once the first instance is filled, a second instance is created.
---
True.  
---
Still, when some of us would ditch the mule and get the extra account, a lot of veterans have 5 character at high levels, all some what "emotionally" invested in. They made those characters before the need of a daily level up challenge was relevant.   
---
Also I'm wondering if Bethesda cares about how money gets in their bank, purchasing atoms or buying a game key. Only thing they might care about is unique logins and a player with a mule account yields them 2 unique logins for the statics.
---
That's not a bad idea. I have to redo my whole camp at some point I'm just too lazy lol.
---
I play on PS4 mainly with my girl but i also play on PC some.
---
Not true.
---
Yeah I dont have to move much with my VE minigun in that event.
---
In between Seneca peaks here. The best I managed is spawning inside a rock, between a nuka cola machine and milk machine which takes a couple jumps to get out. Spawning inside a magazine rack which takes some more jumps to get out (when I had two mag racks this didn't happen, but budget cuts). Spawning below the base so that you need a jetpack to make it back up. I could go on. But I spent like 3 hours messing around with the CAMP to know that was more or less going to be the best spawns. The spawns are always perfect on second fast travel... it's just that first fast travel where shit's not loaded in yet that gets you.
---
Depends what I'm doing. I really love my Junkies Plasma Caster when I'm doing bosses, and other times I use a shotgun for PvE when I'm just walking around. There isn't really a best weapon really it's more about your perks and legendary effects your guns have.
---
haha it's public domain.
---
Do you have any armor with 15% dmg reduction while blocking?
---
magic weapons are apparently tied to your framerate and latency. assuming you're on console, and Brazil, it's likely a combination of both why the magic damage isn't triggering.
---
Yes, acp has multiple instances. I have found that no matter how fast you join the first instance seems to fill up in seconds. I found that if you got stuck outside of the event I just fast travel to my friend and it lets me inside with them.
---
If there was a bethesda headquarters there need to be a quest to play chess with Todd howard.
---
So annoying i hate it.
---
I know shocker, I play 20 hours more than a full grown man. Sounds like you're projecting to me bro. I think all that happened to you. I have all honors and AP classes, have been given awards for being in the top ten at my school for my first year, and have many friends. I think youre the only one "projecting" bro. Pretty sure you were that kid, not me lol üòÜ
---
Yes I am. That‚Äôs a strange bug or design choice, but at least now I know. Thanks!
---
I‚Äôve been wondering how to get the plans to that rifle or what quest it‚Äôs from... Now I‚Äôm wondering what other terminals unlock crafting stuff for you?
---
 Maybe you should unplug instead of being Bethesdas lil Bitch
---
Did you get affected by the auto-complete? Or did you skip a lot of the challenges?
---
I think it's amazing for ultracite ammo. They can't be produced by the ammo converter or armco appliance.
---
For me potentially getting over 500 ultracite .308 from a single craft is crazy. I might finally be able to use my J/FFR LMG outside of special occasions.
---
Yep. Using heavies on that character. It‚Äôs too bad. But thanks for the info!
---
been thinking of doing this event 3x over with server hopping since ive got the caps to burn and worst case see if i can solo the whole event. i like a challenge üòä lol
---
big if true
---
No, loadout is coming anyways. I meant respecing. IIRC Valseek or another manager mentioned this.
---
Lmao im not. And you're the 30 year old with no job browsing reddit here bro. Im sure you wish you could be my age again because thats when you peaked. Ever since then it's been a downward spiral for youz hasnt it
---
I absolutely love it best 300 cans of dog I've spent recoil isn't bad if you single shot it but with automatic that's kinda hard only downside is mag size.
---
Like that fish-tank from C&amp;H? Yeah please.
---
where is this? looks amazing!
---
I sell all my plans for 10 caps... apprently im also an idiot and sold some super rare plans for 10 caps too (rad barrel and croc backpack) lol
---
Because I have a life and responsibilities and other interests that mean I'm not predisposed to playing every day to know what's going on in the game every week
---
Ahh i see I guess I must have missed that.  Thank you.  Well I guess I will hold my breath and see what they are coming up with.  I still would like the option to buy more slots though.
---
Youre either coping or didn't pass math if you think 1800 and 320 are even close lmao. Im an AP/honors student that works out and has hobbies too bro. Keep coping üëå
---
You ever play this game and immediately regret it?
---
They are also forgetting that maxing 5 legendary perks requires reaching about lvl 900 or more.
---
I kinda like the mingun, wind up sucks but pretty good damage and ammo id plentiful
---
problem is im a heavy junkie build so I had little use for it was the issue lol
---
15th is the patch as far as I know
---
I'm leveling my second character and that .50 cal would look really good on him!
---
This would be cool
---
Maybe. Others have said it doesn‚Äôt work for heavies. I‚Äôm spec‚Äôd out and bloodied so even an extra 15% wouldn‚Äôt be that noticeable against basic enemies, and SBQ and Earl are spongy so it‚Äôd be hard to tell there too. Might have to test it tonight without any damage perk cards equipped.
---
They really need to lock the recall process to the person that used the recall card.

Hello! We do not have anything planned for today. Please keep an eye on our social channels for info on the next patch.
---
Ya saucks :(
---
I focus on just selling Ammo Chems and Outfit Items. Parked my shit close to Vault 76 and just watch all the new players come and pick of tons of supplies, did I mention I drop all the prices to pennies because with Bulk purchases it's worth it. My whole outlook is the more new players can get setup for a small fee and not worry about just grinding super hard for supplies just enjoy the stories and quests
---
That's true.. I honestly just got into building a class just a couple weeks ago. Not sure what I want to go with.
---
I've not played the game for 1800 hours, I've played for about 303 or something.
---
Y'know that's fair.  I haven't Primed any of my weapons so that wasn't on my radar.
---
this is the correct answer; the slackers are taking over again
---
I hear you. I'm on the cliff that Mistress of Mysteries ends on. Read on here somewhere that spawn point is roughly north of wherever your CAMP module is, so took a few placements and a good while testing to avoid spawning in foundations or off the edge of the cliff. Now people drop in amongst the trees away from the edge, which works pretty well.
---
That would be epic!
---
I'm out of the loop here, what is this?
---
9.  Also, take advantage of full Building teams.  4x intelligence goes a long way for all kills and events.  It boosts all experience gained, not just events
---
why would they release a patch today, when they already have one scheduled for next week?
---
i joined a month late and still got too level 71 on the legendary run. so honestly I don't think they had an excuse.
---
I'm about 5-6 tiers away and considered buying atoms, but decided it isn't worth the money.
---
Haha good tip!
---
I replaced my controller because of this. -_-
---
Will just shift to posts about not being able to complete the disease atoms challenge.
---
Good idea. I'll give it a go next time. Thanks.
---
same:  prices at 10% of list, minus 1c!  üòÉ  
---
(with a few exceptions e.g. for rare items)
---
 ... the burr under my saddle most recently are the vendors that I travel to (not always "fastly", since my mule char isn't all that levelled) ... will just go \*poof\* aaaaand they're gone.
---
right while I'm in the midst of shopping &amp; looking thru their vendor items.
---
really people, you're lvl 782 .... can't you **LOOK AROUND** *before* you suddenly just decide to relo your f'ing camp!!
---
*especially* if I'm going to pirouette to my death off some giant cliff you've shoehorned onto, or otherwise land in some awfully ~~buggy~~ featureful polygonal Bethesda-nineteenth-ring-of-Hell glitchy spot where I have to logout entirely in order to get out of.
---
is that too much to ask?
---
sheesh.
---
&lt;/rant&gt;
---
I- bro you can't be serious rnüíÄ ü§£
---
100% agree with you.
---
I don't really care about my karma, I just make suggestions on the reddit cause I feel that is the place to put them. However I've seen you make negative comments on lots of my posts since you consider me a "griefer" for playing the game the it was designed during release. If you think following people to downvote/harass them is worth your time man idk what to say other than get a life.
---
Oh man you‚Äôre talking my language! That is exactly what I envision! Great description you got me all excited now
---
What if you are at scrip or bullion limit?  That's why you have to claim.
---
What‚Äôs better is one that heals you as you shoot!
---
It's more like 650ish to max all 6, taking into account perk packs from Season 1 and the free 50 perk points you get from hitting level 50. They changed the math on perk scrapping and how many points it takes to level a card up.
---
I'm level 574ish and with some rough math I'm fairly certain I can max 5 of them on the 15th, and get a sixth one to rank 2 and be pretty close to rank 3. But I've respec'd quite a few times, so if I hadn't done that I could probably get them to rank 4. It probably doesn't help that I use the Perk Loadout Manager and have like, builds for pretty much every playstyle lol.
---
At the moment, your first legendary perk card and its first rank up are literally free. I doubt that will ever change.
---
Yeah usually when the player is there and I have to politely interact despite being 100 levels too young and nothing of value to give them while they pile 20 plans and a legendary weapon on me
---
Hopefully they enlarge the map, it's going to get crowded in the Wastelands.
---
Lag affects magic.
---
I finished ACP and noticed a member in my build group was in a separate instance. I traveled to him and got to do it again. I don‚Äôt know if I kicked someone from his original group or if they had less than 8 and I filled an empty slot. Maybe it was broken and I became the 9th.
---
I was think it was going to be today didn't see anything about next week !
---
Same and despite not including junk plans I‚Äôm surprised at how much stuff doesn‚Äôt move. Something that‚Äôs a bit harder to find I‚Äôll put on for 76 caps for funsies but I‚Äôve had a Gauss Rifle plan in the vendor for a week and it‚Äôs not gone yet.
---
I suppose we had a bit of a heyday with new characters and wastelanders but it seems like we‚Äôve hit peak plan
---
My current camp (no cliffs so that‚Äôs good) moves it‚Äôs spawn between 3 spots all in the same 25 yards on one edge of my camp. I just happened to leave that area unoccupied so it worked out. 
---
How do you manipulate your spawn? Just moving the camp‚Äôs location around a little?
---
I‚Äôve had my turrets disappear if I have them sitting on my roof and I move the roof. I found that storing my roof or whatever they were sitting on for that matter will put them back in your building storage.
---
I‚Äôve had to move my camp before just to have things pop back up. Good luck!
---
There are 8 pieces for a full pie, not just 1 slice.
---
I have 24 (from the pie vending machines, *never* from the in game spawn)
---
The rational approach, huh?  Respect.
---
and 9. Watch the general player base do the exact opposite of all this......
---
Your still able to stack a chem and an alcoholic beverage right?
---
I mean, most of fallout soundtrack are famous 70y old songs. I am pretty sure Bethesda ain‚Äôt the only ones with license to use them
---
Running it solo do you just aim to keep one test subject alive?
---
They say penta is better for pvp since there‚Äôs a damage cap
---
It was in the newsletter last week.
---
100+ meds so you think there is a chance for serums  -\_-
---
Exactly I don‚Äôt have time to grind out a lot of caps so it just feels so defeating when it happen.
---
The one time I broke into see the damn vendors the dude had like 12 crappy legendaries for like 15-100 caps a piece. Worth it since his neighbor merc‚Äôed me for the bounty.
---
I'm close to 700 and I can assure you i'm not even close to maxing 4. Never respecced once,but probably lost some card with doubles.
---
I'll see next week,but i'm not confident one bit of maxing more than 3.
---
thank you.
---
Nice Ted talk üëç
---
This is a cool idea üëçüèº 
---
The atom shop would sell fish food and back drop skins for the tank! üòÄ
---
If memory serves, it's exactly 1800 perk coins to max all 6.
---
Does two-shot affect heavy weapons in the same way explosive does for the purposes of doubling your fire rate? Like a two shot +50% limb damage gauss minigun with penta barrel?
---
I regret playing this pos. A bad addiction, never had I had fun.
---
What platform?
---
Porch is good. Probably the best way to make it easy. I like a little building near spawn for it. That‚Äôs what I always do. MVP goes to dudes with a trail of vault boys to guide you.
---
How much ultracite fusion cores does it give with both perks?
---
Yeah, the really high-levels still intimidate me too. Lol
---
His post doesn‚Äôt even mention pvp
---
I don't get all the prizes and i don't care honestly, that's life.
---
My favorite is when they list a lot of stuff I want and then blow me up or kill me with a trap because they are awful pieces of shit who should kill themselves.
---
I love my Railway Rifles
---
If you happen to kill a raider thief out in the wild, it can auto complete the daily after you talk to Ward.
---
That feeling when you are suddenly just standing in the woods, alone and confused. ‚ÄúDammit!‚Äù
---
This happens to me during ACP.  It's not good when its your Prime Gauss Minigun.
---
You are correct.
---
As far as I know, it will do that if you found a certain item before talking to Ward for the first time. I happened to find the osmosis kit before meeting Ward and never had to do anything for his quests except talk to him. It was great.
---
I do unfortunately ye, can fill As trough to 60 then get deathclaw. Then I use a friendly fire on him. Still leave with legendary and OK exp if no one shows up. If a noob shows I spawn deathclaw then will spawn room to keep there animal alive instead
---
SameüòÇüòÇ
---
If this happens then I think it should come with the guild system Bethesda has been throwing around in the air.
---
Yes it does and it‚Äôs a gauss so it‚Äôs explosive by default so it‚Äôs definitely magic however you won‚Äôt probably won‚Äôt notice against SBQ or earl because there both very very resistant to explosives.
---
Tag and let others bag
---
With automatic the recoil is a monster, but if you use it against larger enemies then get in close you can control the climb and keep hitting them.
---
Also - it's a monster in VATS. I've got an explosive and a quad one that I use and it can chew apart enemies in close remarkably fast.
---
I feel like theyd leave the run open but remove challenges for score, letting people use atoms to buy ranks. Thats my hope at least
---
In my experience what I chose to do to satisfy the dailies effected how many times I got the repeatable XP bonus and drove how quickly I climbed.
---
For example, if I complete Radiation Rumble &amp; Line in the Sand for my two events compared to Manhunt &amp; On the Beat.  Over a month those differences can really add up.
---
I‚Äôve heard a fallout 1st server can work for whatever reason. You may want to search for the that is the sub. It may have been a different quest that worked for.
---
I accidentally purchased the dumb mage robe thing.
---
There will be zero real life consequences to you joining an event with higher level players.
---
Even IF one of them gets annoyed by you for any reason whatsoever, guess what? It doesn't matter.
---
Just play the game.  It's only a game.
---
Oh that could explain why all my supposed magic heavies don't work at all on the queen. People.
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs best to holster my inner Chandler Bing and just talk it out
---
More like "sorry for not using the search bar." There's at least a million posts about this. Use a private server and finish the quest.
---
I don't sell any plans worth less than 350. I'll drop those in newb locales.
---
A hoard event would be great.
---
I really miss being able to change the pip boy hud color and pip boy light from Fallout 4... I always made the light white so it made everything easier to see.
---
Are you claiming you're not in America? Because we don't have AP in Europe. I know you're lying about it but come on, don't make it this obvious.
---
My life is pretty great though, my 15 year old self would probably be pretty stoked to work in aviation engineering. If I was your age again I wouldn't be on Reddit all morning getting turned over by a bored guy at work who was scolding me for being a little bitch to strangers online
---
If they dont fix magic effects weapons with patch 22 I pause until they fix it. The patch 22 dmg nerf will force us to use them, currently they are just a bug to cheese bosses, but with the dmg nerf, they will be the meta and I dont want to trade for these shit rolls.
---
Happens with evety gun, will keep trying to reload or ill have 0 bullets and can shoot three several times...
---
No no no heavies are very effective against the queen, if they have high end heavies like BFFR it‚Äôs only really explosive weapons that suffer the most from it
---
Dang have a bunch of explosive railways on an alt but im on ps4
---
0. don't. just don't.
---
'the grind' is real and robbed me of the joy of actually playing the game. F the legendary run. no way I'm putting myself through that again.
---
private server or server hop.  You are looking for a server where someone has not completed that Quest since the actual information on the server reset
---
No we got the leather.
---
I must have skipped more than I thought. I kinda gave up the last two days because I have been getting the shit shot outta me by other players for some reason.
---
I‚Äôm thinking of doing this myself. How did you adjust your build? Just swap Rifleman perks for Commando ones?
---
I got on L4D2 a few months back and I thought the exact same thing. I hadn't played L4D in years and I immediately thought about how well this would do in fallout.
---
Found an old post for anyone interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hf0dh7/how_to_make_line_in_the_sand_quick_and_easy_does/
---
No it full on disappears! Seems like a lot of work for one mission no?
---
The damage nerf isn‚Äôt going to be as devastating in the long run as they‚Äôve said there going to re work the damage model to make it feel like it is currently. Don‚Äôt quote me on that tho I just heard that from others
---
Whilst I appreciate posts like this, it's dangerous to say "don't do NW" and "relax, you'll get there". The first season started with the sum of all dailies and weeklies being less than the total required for Rank 100. Bethesda had to have numerous double SCORE, double XP, and extra challenges in order to quell the riotous response from the community. Hopefully Bethesda will just copy the structure as it is now, with all of the bonuses we had, but just wanted to write this that the math will need to be done before we can start saying relax to people. Here's hoping it's a fun one!
---
I got a preserved pie at 30k caps for each of my vending machines because of this reason, just in case, but I'm still not sure if it's a myth or not...
---
Yup, I forgot. Was almost to the end and meant to buy remaining and got distracted with NW! Oh well...
---
85% of the time. I mainly do it for plans and IF there is any hope of a decent type of weapon (Bloodied, Junkie, something good for my other character). Since Wastelanders the only thing I found that I had on my "Never Gonna Happen Wish List" was the Fixer Plan for 1200 (yoink).
---
Before Wastelanders there was a lot of good finds in the player vendors, I found my (I use the SS Armor now) set of 3* Unyeilding Scout Armor, granted it took a months and a shit load of caps to get it but People were selling it. It is almost like the pool has dried up.
---
People should also use herd mentality if they aren't already. All you have to do is join a public group even if no one is in it or you're on a private server you'll still get the bonuses.
---
Vendors selling chems at 20+ caps or plans at full price. Or even worse, ammo at more than 1 cap. The only time I get a little scummy with the pricing is with colossal problem items cause they are a major pain in the ass to get.
---
I have a wall in my camp for displaying the busted-ass drops from SBQ
---
Valid complaint about super broken and sucky VATS. Top comment says to just exit out and go back in.
---
I swear it never fails. Upvoted some comments at 0 about how it's not new. *It's not.* At this point I get it: Bethesda can't fix it so get used to it. It's been years. They added bows and gauss weapons and they're even worse in VATS despite gauss being the big endgame goal.
---
It's not okay this doesn't work properly. It's practically the accessibility option for RPG players.
---
That is a welcome approach so long as there are not endless threads complaining about seasons and the grind.  Play or don‚Äôt, makes no difference to me.  I was just posting a rational thread offering calm and tranquility for those playing this season
---
What about a submachine gun? I found a two shot 50% limb damage 10mm submachine gun yesterday. Rate of fire is 92 I think. I've seen magic combat rifles so this SHOULD work. 
---
Do I still need perk cards for it to be any good, even though its magic?
---
But I feel the meta is going to shift to full health junkies builds now, it makes the most sense
---
K I'll check it out
---
I'd want to plant fire cracker berries so I could launch my brahmin TO THE MOON!!
---
can agree had 3 weeks off never did any NW and only spend 300 Atoms to finish season 1
---
it's also important to mention that, allegedly, magic damage is tied to your fps *and* latency.
---
what that means is that if you're struggling to maintain a stable framerate, or if there's a lot of latency between you and the servers, magic damage may not trigger as often or at all.
---
Same deal. Plans 20, recipes 15, fusion cores 50 and missiles and nukes for cheap. Im not super concerned with earning the value of anything i find. In my first few days i found a guy selling tons of plans for like 15 a pop and i wanted to be like that guy. I may end up selling plans you get for free cause i dont know this game 100% but i put it all up there so any new people can swing through and snatch up a ton of stuff to start making a base.
---
Just quit the app and go back in that usually works for me
---
Magic combat rifles? The effect works best when the weapon has a true fire rate of 190-200 however it also has ties with the lag and latency of the server, I‚Äôve only experienced it on heavy weapons tho
---
Welp, little over 20 minutes and we will see :)
---
I like the one where when I switch from my Gauss mini gun to my hand made at the SBQ that I have over 200 rounds in my clip üòÅ
---
That is an excellent point that I forgot.  Mutations!  Egg head, herd mentality
---
They need cross platform
---
its good passive income but shit compared to actively crafting it
---
the grind is hellish and the sub is public. nothing wrong with complaining about a bad thing.
---
if anything it illustrates whether people are satisfied or dissatisfied with the grind.
---
that's great! I keep finding myself weighed down by stimpacks, which I rarely use unless I'm chrewing them constantly in the Colossal Problem. I have some regen armor so if I find myself with a load of stims I'll drop them for a lower level, some water too.
---
I recently had someone come to my camp and drop a LOAD of plans too... I know it's mostly to help reduce clutter in the stash but it's still nice to give things to people
---
If they have the collection bot for free they don't make any sales on the not free ones.
---
The effect works better on private servers because of this, maybe it‚Äôs intentional to get us to subscribe to F01st
---
I love number 6.  Great post OP.
---
It starts next Tuesday (9/15)
---
I know! He makes it sound soo important then admits they have several in storage but its the "principle".
---
I feel bad for the raiders  they say they have sick people and elderly too.
---
next tuesday, per Bethesda's official announcement.
---
Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention that I had a defend event yesterday and discovered an enemy that doesn't spawn in the killbox. Scorchbeasts. :D
---
Sneaking into peoples camps that way always makes me feel like some major badass for no reason at all. I think I got more excited doing that a bunch of times than the entire wayward questline.
---
What level are on both accounts
---
Do you want my vampires Power attack rw vsmpires one?
---
I've spent the time since I finished the legendary run leveling an alt. I will probably just continue to do that until the next season starts. It has been refreshing just working on that without having to focus on the daily challenges even though I complete 70% of them just by playing.
---
I don't expect that they will do anything during the off week. I also would not be surprised if there were score challenges that did nothing because Bethesda (and even those will autocomplete for some).
---
I did the same - until I saw my CAMP budget consumed by each magazine as it was added.  Same for the bobblehead stand.  So now they are all stashed out of view.
---
I love running around with my vanilla handmade with my small blonde character named Gabby. Something about a rouge southern belle lol
---
If you are a low level don't always be afraid if a high level comes to your camp.  I am level 400 and traveled to a level 24 camp, I was getting ready to drop some goods to the guy and he closed up camp and left me.  The problem was he had his camp in between some power lines and I dropped and died.  I made my way back up to get my bag and the only thing left was his Junk Collector hanging in the sky.  It was kind of funny but don't always assume someone is coming in to harass you.
---
I concur with this.  I tested all my magic weapons on solo with SBQ and they all worked really well.  Even yesterday when I logged on a server that had ACP and Scorched earth at the same time, i was the only one fighting the queen for a few minutes and got her to mutate with less than 30 seconds of fire from my magic UGL.  But when people showed up the effect slowed down.
---
Also fps and low server connectivity will affect the magic effect.  
---
Having said all that I hope they do not fix this eventually. As a full health build this kind of equals the playing field for me with bloodied builds with my damage output with my character.
---
I have Fo1st but am not American or European and I can't get magic damage to trigger. my rig has no problem maintaining 60 fps, either.
---
so it's gotta be latency.
---
Yes, absolutely agree. Do not exhaust yourself, guys, there is nothing really important for your game among those rewards.
---
I found a guy with 5 cap jet packs. They literally had 5 cap ultra cute jet pack plans. I thought it was cheap when I got mine for 250
---
fomo?
---
Wow, I felt bad when I lost like 5-10k caps as some dude bought both my Challymoo Backpacks. Really wasn't expecting someone to come in and blow 20k on two items. I now constantly hover around 10k caps out of paranoia. If I go any higher, I immediately buy all of some dude's ammo.
---
Good Prices, I sell mine most of mine for 10%, Recipes for drugs, 33% max, depending on what it is.
---
My main on ps4 is 250 and my alts are in the 70s. PC is all 50 and below.
---
It's multiple instances of the same event on the same server.
---
The logic for how it decides to fill them isn't very predictable.  But nevertheless, from the time a nuke touches down, you have 5 minutes to join the event from the map screen.  After that, the only way in is to team with someone involved in the event and Fast Travel to them.  If there is space in their instance, you will arrive in their instance.
---
OMG
---
Finishing in 7 weeks while not doing all the weeklies nor NW dailies and not participating in the everything is double last week while only spending 1 hour a day to do this? That smelly smell.
---
Mine just suck on the queen, nothing magic at all in them. Even the gauss shorgun(which at least was more 
---
 usefull on nornal enemies) is very inconsistent.
---
If I had to guess:
---
Challenges won't change and will still reward SCORE between seasons, so if they don't end the run, people would still be able to progress.  There were enough issues when they switched challenges over (that mostly still exist)  that I'm sure they don't want to introduce more room for error.
---
Guess we'll all find out pretty shortly.
---
‚ÄòOfficial‚Äô being key.
---
speaking of legendary perks, does the ammo perk stack with ammosmith? because if so, over twice the ammount of ammo, plus super duper equals 4 times the ammo for just one thing of resources
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a low-level, I am over 100, but I did have a few people one-shot me waaaaaay back near launch before I learned about passive mode, so the trauma is there. ü§£
---
It really sucks when people log off just as you get to their camp... even worse if you die because of it.
---
That's how I feel now. Plus I'll no longer leave super valuable items in my vendor if I don't have the cap space.
---
Immediately after the event I went over to Modus and bought a recipe to bring myself down.
---
I'm sorry that happened to you man.  I've been on the road for two weeks and felt I needed to being my Xbox with me (which is fucking ridiculous).  It was tough getting a connection but I was lucky enough to get online and snag the most recent BOS stuff.  It's so stupid they do this...
---
Honestly you‚Äôll get to level 10 so fast you may as well start again cause you‚Äôll save time off the figuring out where you were etc. Join a public building team as the bonus int will boost your xp.
---
The problem with this is that people can still buy from those machines. All scrapping the wire does is remove the vendor icon on the map. One time, I had bought about 15k ammo from a guy. I guess he cut the power like this because his vendor icon dropped off the map, his machine probably quit glowing too. I went back into it and bought some more stuff and he started doing angry emotes. Once I figured out what happened, I realized how I had ruined his day.
---
What heavies are you using?
---
what is the maximum amount of caps anyway?
---
Then create an overflow UI item , or ditch the limit, the point is that their "bare minimum" solution is not enough to prevent people getting screwed either way.
---
Hi, I started playing in mid-July, missing 2 weeks of season 1. I want to add some encouraging information based on my experience as a newbie:
---
1. I hit rank 100 last Thursday.
---
2. I bought 6 or 7 ranks with atoms earned from newbie challenges. Totally didn't have to due to the double score/extra challenges they added later. RIP
---
3. I did 2 or 3 NW challenges (usually the photo ones).
---
You will make it, don't worry.
---
I server hop and visit camps all the time. Looking for rare plans, building ideas.   
---
But yes, some peoples camps are just.. terrible. I cant stand the skyboxes. And while i love building on the side of a cliff, 50% of the time you spawn inside of a mountain or 300 feet below the camp.
---
I would love that.but would feel kinda odd if I didnt buy it or give you something in return.a vampire power attack one seems fun as hell
---
Their FOMO bullshit tactics is getting old.
---
Do they not realize that these continuing tactics **keep people away**?
---
They don‚Äôt even want to start because then they have to play this game like it‚Äôs a job.
---
already got caught by this and didn't look at my current balance prior to claiming - argh!
---
Agreed
---
This is my first live service game and it will be my last. I didn't know what I was getting into but I have since learned that these types of insidious tactics are pretty standard in live service, online games.
---
The collectron thing is an example of  using  FOMO (fear of missing  out) to force you into playing every single day.  This is becoming a standard tactic of these live  service games.  Another tactic  is building problems into the game and making you pay money for the fix.  They did this with by putting in limited stash space and then selling you a scrap box with Fallout 1st.
---
I hope people start to see this pattern and reject it and these type of games  will fail in the future. This is all part of a deeply disturbing trend that needs to be discouraged. The only way to to discourage it is for game developers to be hit hard in their wallets.
---
Have anything up for trade?
---
like rdro's posses but more buggy because bethesda?
---
Damn.i recently changed from rifleman to commando just to switch it up.
---
Not much really. Maybe just start a different character with different playstyle?
---
I've bought several of them. The game was launched promising no cosmetic microtransactions and yet
---
Yeah I'll pm you what I have when I get home
---
God it'll be so nice to have this friend list glitch fixed...
---
I solo it daily. Not sure what the big deal is.
---
I never liked the Legendary Run because it is like you are forced to play the game everyday when they could put the rewards in the Atom Shop.
---
Thank you for raising awareness Keiji. 
---
You make great posts as well as great sandwiches üëç
---
Most those double score weekends were on the calendar prior to the start of seasons.  No one ever took those in account when adding.  Can‚Äôt say wether or not the BOS double score ‚Äúgift‚Äù was scheduled.  The additional dailies came in towards the end.  However that‚Äôs the thing with business, you have to adapt.  Bethesda adapts well to reasonable complaints.  They heard their player base was Upset and realized it was too hard.  They scaled it back.  I don‚Äôt see why they wouldn‚Äôt just stay with this method.
---
However, if Im wrong and they do revert.  Then go ahead and light your pitch forks.  I prefer to stay calm and relax.
---
Thats not true, she is a die hard Member but has different Views, why she dont follow her Orders to 100% (Dont follow there Missions goal and work to get a working radio again to contact Lost Hills)  
---
And she even says (what we can read in the datamine dialogs) that she want to keep the peace as much as possibile between the Factions. Because a big War serves no one.
---
All of my plans are 5 caps each. Doesn't matter what it is. I'm not going to waste my time sitting there and changing each one. I get some funny responses from people when they find a PA jetpack plan for 5 caps. :]
---
dude. you need to fucking chill.
---
Will do, thank you!
---
I'm a comic vendor , at least one of my comics selling is usable for somebody's build haha
---
I‚Äôve only tried Colossal Problem once, but it glitched out on me when Earle was almost dead, so I used up a ton of ammo for no reward, and I‚Äôm a bit discouraged to try again. Probably will soon though!üòÖ
---
It‚Äôs win-win, right? Hopefully you get at least one new plan, and they get pocket space. üëçüèªI often dump my extra plans on my dad (since I play more often and actually do the events) if we get the chance to play together, but we haven‚Äôt been able to a lot lately.
---
You can solo it. Just spam Nuka quantum. And melt him with a stealth commando.
---
It just works.
---
Im 6 tiers away and have enough atoms, but nah. Its only a skin and door.... The door... :)
---
I've found that apologists like to downvote common sense.
---
*because you motherfuckers won't close the goddamn door.*
---
is it possible to activate all 3 pylons solo?
---
small backpack? there are larger backpacks?
---
No, the West Coast is even more idiotic in that therm.   
---
Not to mention that the Fallout Lore gives you good resones why you should kill any Mutant or Ghoul.
---
Google says it‚Äôs 30,000 but I wouldn‚Äôt know from first-hand experienceü§£
---
For my current look, im with you. Havent done it yet but can you wear a backpack in PA? Because ive never seen a backpack on the back of a PA user. Thus an invisible skin doesnt seem that ubreasonable.
---
When I finally finished that whole "wolfe" quest line for the first time I paid for encrypted. I'm just shooting all the mobs around, imposter sheepsquatch shows up and gets vaporized within a second by some level 500. Never even saw it...
---
Bit of the other end of the spectrum there.
---
Heard my pm doesn't work sadly
---
They're all through atom shop, events and tadpole purchases.
---
Here's some of them, there's quite a few more since this was last updated though:
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Backpack\_(Wild\_Appalachia)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Backpack_(Wild_Appalachia))
---
If we do a 2nd meat week soon, there's the Chally the Moo Moo backpack (big barrel), the Big Bend Tunnel event (forget the name off the top of my head) has the Caravan backpack (looks like a crate tied to your back in blue with the Caravan logo on it).  THere's others too.
---
But nothing just randomly drops on normal mobs. It's all event rewards or purchases in some way or another.
---
its not about the number of player present, its about the number of player that do stuff present, its all perspective  
---
if you are 3 player that know what to do and do your part, 3 is plenty enough  
---
if you have 20 player that d'ont know shit about the event and no one has a trouble shooter armor, it will not be enough
---
No thats Bullshit. Bet did the same thing. Just remember Fawks and other "Good" Mutants.
---
Fear of missing out
---
It's better than when you fast travel thinking oh they might have some good stuff only for it to vanish before your eyes, too bad there's not a warning for people are in your camp vicinity before logging out :(
---
Your link is dead.
---
Have you... played the main quest?
---
Doesn't herd mentality only work if you are actually in close proximity to others in your group?
---
no idea, so im gonna test and learn new things xD
---
No, but I did regret stepping thru a decon shower just now when I somehow had starched genes card removed.
---
Login in 10 minutes and find out
---
I feel your pain, I was greifed so many times before they changed the rules and like you said, learned passive mode.
---
Worse is when they actually do but they disappear before you can hit buy
---
7. Yup. Did the same.
---
Yeah i wanna make my Rick Sanchez character not have a backpack. And sadly if you use power armor it takes away the effect as soon as you enter the armor.
---
I made that mistake with one of them too, but managed to get another one! Don't give up!
---
I can‚Äôt get online for a few hours, so hopefully someone else can answer this one for me :)
---
Right? At that time other players were scarier than the real baddiesü§£
---
now that would be overpowerd. you'd basicly be able to hold as much explosive ammo, junk, shotguns, pistols (i think), etc. as you want, plus fill excavator, with motion assist servos, and calibrated shocks on both legs, and max strength with all drugs/chems that increase strength. With all that you'd be able to hold an entire stash box and not be over encumberd
---
In your example Bethesda is a drug dealer and sets up the OP to fail with an all too alluring proposition they know they can‚Äôt refuse. 
---
Don‚Äôt blame the ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù for being vulnerable when the perpetrator is a million dollar corporation that has pschologists on payroll to figure out new ways to ensnare people. 
---
Why are you so eager to defend a heartless grind anyways?
---
Is that rewarding for you lol?
---
That's actually good question - week off or something similar to do :-)
---
Hmmm, wouldn't have happened to be in a group at the time and found a random at the enclave bunker that helped out would you?
---
Another tidbit: The intelligence boosting public team gets renamed with patch 22. 'building' becomes 'casual'
---
it is
---
Agreed - When was the last time they added in a new plan to buy from vendors?
---
Well I wouldn't call it new. I know it from some Japanese players who showed it to me back when Survival mode was still a thing. It just went undiscovered for a long time.
---
I know the feeling but I have been pleasantly surprised now and again by the wooden walled shack with the tier 1 MG turrets.  and found a number of gems at times.
---
Honestly backpacks are not really that useful unless you have a full backpack with the special mods. Seeing as I have the small one, sometimes I just dont use it.
---
There are outfits that have built in backpacks that will show over yours, but yeah I‚Äôd love an invisible skin, or maybe a messenger style bag as an alternative.
---
I purchased the ss backpack and it‚Äôs smaller than the arktos one and I‚Äôve been enjoying it more.
---
Weapons haven‚Äôt changed much, the gauss mini is good but not leagues better than any other heavy.
---
Armor wise SS is the best by far but untradeable obviously. Scout or heavy leather and combat are  the tradeable tier below
---
I personally use the chem backpack 
---
SS under armor is pretty good too as it provides 15 RR but a lot of people like raider which gives 3 AGI
---
Was in a group but didn't have any help from anyone.
---
You can change it a bit by moving the CAMP module, but you get larger movements by placing it fresh. Best thing to do is get this right before you start building - helps to have an idea of what you want to build before you start, so you know where your want your spawn point to be. Place it, and then run away and fast travel back a few times to see how it looks.
---
Actually I moved my camp and the turrets were still fully functional they were just hidden for some reason but didn't show up in my count..
---
Nope. You just have to be in a group.
---
This reminded me that I never remembered to grab my items from the Brotherhood donation event. Goodbye, stupid beret.
---
Probably cause you were being an asshole and you‚Äôll probably get even more down votes by complaining about down votes
---
Ah the timeline was right, i remember helping a group out to drop a nuke once and we all crashed. That was actually one of the last times i played the game until recently. It was a shot in the dark but i figured id take it!
---
That bot that runs the Lucky Mucker game at Camden Park can burn in hell.
---
How many times do I have to press to talk to him and just gives me his speech about how much fun the game is?
---
I have no problems with Ward. But that Camden Park bot is broken.
---
But you get 500 atoms for the last one along with the other stuff, that space lamp is pretty nice I like the purple glow.
---
Quick note the intel bonus is moving to casual teams in patch 22. Join casual teams for max intelligence in season 2
---
I set a build that maximized my intelligence and experience (some enemies were putting out astronomical experience per kill).  Doubt all you want, but I earned everything fair and square.  Just have to take advantage of every boost.  I get one hour from 4am to 5am everyday.  It‚Äôs possible Thomas
---
One PA user to tank pylons and two bloodied melee can complete the event the moment Imposter comes out. Just need coordination.
---
Yes; someone here did the research on it the other day with a screenshot (and ofc I can't find it atm but it was recent) and the ammo output is insane. It all stacks.
---
I agree the minigun looks and sounds badass, hate the spin up though
---
Yeah use a full backpack and I run the chemist mod so I can hold all them stimpack and chems I use.
---
I am 99% sure you could place fast travel location doormats during beta in october 2018, but they removed them. Probably because of griefing.
---
Thank you!  That‚Äôs great info!
---
I think they said that when Steel Dawn launches, those items will be put on the Bullion vendor along with the Captain Cosmos season items as well. I might be wrong, though.
---
Paying real money for cosmetic items just isn't something I'm interested in.
---
I don‚Äôt think Bloodied will be dethroned, but I can see half-health junkies and low-health vampires becoming really popular.
---
All my items are marked down to at least 50% off and i never sell shit...
---
Ahhhhh fair enough
---
Yup, same...
---
Then there's the one where my double barrel shotgun didn't have to reload for a full session. Not complaining about that one though.
---
You guys are life savers with this intel!
---
Love number 2
---
My case - started grinding 2 weeks ago when it looked possible.  Had to go out of town for an emergency last Tuesday, and bought up to level 98 (crap).  Got home Sunday night and pushed to get the last 2...
---
I'm just worried they'll mess with how it works in a group without other players.
---
Yeah i run ss backpack just because its so clean cut and simple but man I'd love to not even see one!
---
I thought the queen was immune to explosive damage.
---
ok well i guess ultracite plasma/fusion cores wont be in short supply then. that is. once i get the perk maxed. what does the perk top out at 100% bonus or what?
---
I live in state above you. After about 10pm, I find a ton of empty servers
---
Is S2 coming out today?
---
they should add an average price range to camps I think that'd separate the bad camps from good
---
Oh yeah she is she‚Äôs immune to crippling and explosives I forgot
---
Wait there was a sign and beret? FUCK.
---
No on the PA
---
I was never one to grind the dailies or weeklies for atoms before the whole score run.  
---
I started doing the dailies/weeklies for score.  
---
This grind is far from hell IMO.   No idea what type of player you are, but any veteran of this game should be able to finish the dailies in 15-30mins easily.   
---
Heck even now that I‚Äôm done with the score run, havnt even looked at the dailies but they all get completed by me just playing.
---
You should definitely interact with people but be careful of trading or being lured into pvp as both things can go wrong from time to time. 
---
As for joining , what you are doing is joining a party that will give everyone in it some benefit. Events teams seem to be the most popular but they all have various benefits. For me building is the best due to it‚Äôs + to intelligence buff for more experience while leveling.
---
I'm sure people will post when it happens.
---
it doesn't. and personally I don't like rng perks like lucky break and luck of the draw, but that's just me.
---
it's a solid build, except for you only having level 1 of each heavy gunner. maybe remove those two (break and draw) and bear arms/lock and load if you think you can make it without them.
---
you'd probably get more out of lifegiver than either of them.
---
oh, and refractor is useless.
---
This is also true.  I probably would have put in more effort had there been a better carrot on the line
---
Both stay in sneak, have one guy run two pylons and you take the third,  then vats the imposter legs.  The robots will all swarm by the building and not bother you.... and the legs are imposters  weak spot.  Easily can be done with two people like this, then just then you can mop up the robots with a well placed pulse grenade
---
Yes
---
No, because he missed alot of things and dont know the Lore really well. Most of the stuff he is saying are speculation and things that dont make sense. For example he tooks the BoS from older Games as reference even if they are decades older (in the Lore) and want to compare them to each other. Wich makes no sense. And is a big point between Maxon and Taggerdy and shows how the BoS got stuck in the West.   
---
Maxon tells that everyone want to close down. Rhamani thinks differently and thats why she dont follow the Order to directly work on a new communication line after they lost Contact with Lost Hills.  
---
He talks about the Brotherhoods Main Goal (from later Games) and completle ignores that there are years between them. And that the small Group that comes from the West had more goals then just Appalachia, it was just the last part on there list.  
---
What makes more sense then leaving the empty space in the lore untouched forever and just sitting in a Bunker doing nothing.
---
We‚Äôll find out in a few
---
This doesn‚Äôt take into account that the most desired season rewards for many were literally level 80, 90, and 100 (# are wrong but you get it).
---
People have been waiting for months for new stuff based on Bethesda‚Äôs promises. 
---
It‚Äôs not like they are a patron saint here. 
---
You gotta account for the fact that they made a lot of promises to get people to buy into the game initially , walked them back, and then a whole ton of others for F1st that have yet to materialize. (Persistent workshops when??)
---
Literally every major and a lot of minor updates has been delayed massively (almost without fail). 
---
The only truly regular update we can count on is the atom shop changes over on Tuesday. 
---
The money time and effort set to progress by Bethesda themselves is never quite seem to matches up with the rewards provided. 
---
If they want us to login everyday - the give has to match the take. 
---
That‚Äôs on them and I‚Äôm sad to see other players defend it like this.
---
Since the introduction of public team it got easier to play with others you need to get user to the social menu https://primagames.com/tips/fallout-76-public-teams-bonuses-and-goals#:~:text=Fallout%2076%20Public%20Teams%20-%20How,or%20can%20start%20their%20own.
---
Eventually you will run out of new places to visit , but it takes a while
---
I boot up the game and immediately regret it
---
I had no idea there was a sign and beret too that I apparently missed, it's especially great when the DAMN ATOM SHOP WON'T LOAD.
---
Bloodied 25% faster fire rate 15% faster reload 50 cal is probably the single best dps tradeable heavy weapon thats not legacy. 
---
I‚Äôd say a gauss minigun with the same rolls is better though. 
---
And in a legacy, bloodied explosive 15% reload Gatling Plasma is probably best, but don‚Äôt want to run around using a duped weapon.
---
I take great pride in both my posts and my sandwiches
---
I saw the 500 atoms and realized it would only cost a total of around 50 for me
---
Hey don't hate on bad builders.   My shops are set up as a cheap good guns market for the low level players.  Im selling at a stupid loss but it fun to pay it forward
---
Example fully kitted out handmade 25 caps
---
I'm not sure about the running away from a greeting, but from what it sounds like is you may have joined one of the public teams and were partaking in their activities. I'm not too familiar with how XP works in public groups but I'm assuming that you might be gaining some extra XP by being in a group. If you would like some help with quests or gear, you can add me on Xbox live SavageKitten456 and I can jump on and give you a hand. We can even go to a private world if you don't want to deal with other players.
---
It works. Takes your C.A.M.P. off the map so only teammates see it. Actually did have a guy months ago I guess we had our C.A.M.P.'s in the same location. He went and picked my locks to get to my machines. So for awhile I was removing my door and placing a full wall in its place.
---
No, the 15th,  however I knew next week all the Falloutragers and flamers would hold this subreddit hostage with their negativity.  Figured I‚Äôd get some positive vibes out now
---
 Quad single action revolver with 250 damage resist while reloading
---
I like the mothman also and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs bad either in real life it shows up to warn of disaster I don‚Äôt think the mothman likes his worshipers that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs vengeful
---
Typical Bethesda. "We know there's a high severity issue with at least one of the product's core features, but fixing it would be, like, *work* and stuff, so we're not gonna do it. Quit harshing on our buzz, maaaaan!"
---
When you say building, do you mean my camp?  Because I built a little hut. Then expanded it a bit. I‚Äôve built everything I have plans for. Planted stuff. But unlike the other fallouts I can‚Äôt have settlers so I‚Äôm wondering why. Also, it keeps flashing that I can move my camp for 8 caps. Why would I move it?  I added a turret. But no one can steal my stuff, so why would I even need security?
---
I immediately thought the same thing. It‚Äôs killed me twice because I was hanging out in pa at the bottom when the event ended and the rumble that blocks it killed me. Respawning far away is a bug that happens but if you fast travel to a teammate or friend that‚Äôs still at the event you‚Äôll rejoin and still get awards
---
Thanks for informing us. That explains a lot regarding my melee weapon drops. 
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to these posts Keiji. Keep it up man.
---
This is where I've noticed it too. It's gotten a lot better in the last week or so, but on occasion I still have my Final Word 50cal "run away" on me.
---
Console cross play sure, I don‚Äôt want to have to deal with hackers on pc.
---
Still no vertiguard PA üòî
---
Good topic to bring up, as there's a lot of interest in it, yet it is still shrouded in mystery. I have collected a vast number of magic weapons for testing and concluded that they don't work on the SBQ and Earle most of the time, and it's not worth pursuing (if you're on console). Would love to hear contrary impressions from other console users though.
---
I attribute this to a few things:
---
* Frame rate limitations inherent on console
---
* Lag, which is seems particularly bad in the Earle fight when people are more likely to be bunched up; and if you see a Tesla in the room, fogetaboutit!
---
* Earle boss behavior. When Earle is not being crippled by anyone he can run around like a jack rabbit making precise sustained fire impossible.
---
That said, I have still done utterly ridiculous damage done also, like the SBQ going down in 3 seconds.
---
no vertibird power armor
---
why even live
---
good, a no Mic option for everyone too lazy to use theirs, or those who legit do not have one
---
Just wandering, you will want to join, or start your own, "building" team. It will boost your intelligence and give you a little extra xp. I've been on teams where there was no interaction at all. Was just there to get the team buffs. I would also continue to wave if you see other gamers. Most will reciprocate. Those that don't, let them go.
---
I got booted from the entire game for no reason around that time, but didn't try to load back in. Maybe it was an outage?
---
people always say that, that their 'dailies get completed without them even looking'. well, I don't remember the last time I took over a workshop or ate pre-war food.
---
my problem with the dailies is that they're disruptive and force me to play, well, daily. I'm not a child, I don't want to be forced to do daily chores.
---
I play this game religiously for better or worse and I hate having to mark boxes off a checklist before I can get to actually playing it.
---
Well i dont have any dailies and weeklies.. guess there is just nothing during this week
---
what's the deal with daily and weekly challenges?
---
totally agree that it is easy to switch among them (which is nice).  but I hardly ever do.  the ACP and SBQ events are just not very interesting to me.
---
If you change the receiver to use different ammo from the default, and you don't have any default ammo in inventory, it won't switch because it thinks the gun's empty. Had this issue when I made my hunting rifle use .50.
---
Just keep one round of the default in inventory at all times (in my case, .308) and it will switch properly every time.
---
This is a remarkably stupid and obvious bug, but at least there's an easy workaround for it.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Also, to your point about PvP. I was reading lots of posts on here Las night. It says to turn on pacifist mode. Which I‚Äôm fine with. I don‚Äôt want to fight anyone. But then won‚Äôt they just kill me?  The night I bought the game I couldn‚Äôt play it because it had two hours of updates (lol)!  I was worried all night of having happen what I saw happen on this game my son used to play (you started off naked and had to find and build stuff but people would come and destroy everything you build and can take it all).  I literally was very anxious. But it doesn‚Äôt really seem like that could happen in this game.
---
What's the price on the discounted bundles?
---
Another disappointing week overs
---
They made promises *on stage* with regards to the Atom Shop and how heavily it would be monetized in order to get people in the door. 
---
That hasn‚Äôt played out as promised to a lot of degrees and they will have to own their words unfortunately even if they are a business
---
I put the Appalachian thunder pipe skin on it. I like both it and the original model. I‚Äôm torn.
---
Just for the sake of argument, what happens if I start my subscription on the 31st?
---
Whenever this happens, I weapon bash to stop the animation from reloading so I dont have partially used cores in my inventory
---
The Vertibird Power Armor probably is not coming for a while, at least Patch 23 or maybe even Patch 24, since it is BOS themed.
---
I prefer number 1. number 2 really stinks.
---
They‚Äôre just gone.
---
OH SHIT I NEED TO FINISH IT TONIGHT
---
The blood eagles are pretty much Beckett‚Äôs story line. You can‚Äôt join them as a faction as they‚Äôre there to replace regular raiders since you‚Äôre friendly with the regular ones but they still wanted human enemies
---
Maybe but it is Bethesda we're talking out. Bugs are just hidden features lol
---
I hope not, i want stuff i love about Fallout. And not again and again some boring Trading Companys, Raiders with no Goal at all.mI dont say they should never add that but in every Game they put new Factions in it, the same with putting old ones in it.  
---
Interplay did the same thing. And having Game after game with Factions that get throw away is more then boring.
---
I'm trying to redo my camp right now and I'm getting so pissed off "cannot remove item" why TF not? God this is so annoying.
---
You only need 1 in Adrenaline and you should run 3 in Tenderizer, Also you should run Radicool and max out strength.  Not a lot of help but...
---
I leant by watching others and a lot of trial and error tbh
---
Any news on dailies/weeklies?
---
A buddy and I have 'magic' weapon but we have 2 rules.  Only use in private BUT if they are to be used in public its either in a SBQ/CP battle that has few people and the boss has regened.  Or in areas/events that we're the only players.
---
Well, expected, but I'm still disappointed
---
Vamp fixers are the best kept secret in the game  :) my favorite build is my hybrid vamp, can shift any way i want from low health b to full health j and anything in-between
---
But tenderizer remains broken :(
---
Well at least they didn't auto complete then.
---
I feel like these should all be no-brainers, but after following this sub for a bit, clearly the community is mostly no-brainers.
---
Always build your turrets on something you can scrap. When you scrap the object the invisible turret is sitting on, the turret will get chucked into storage and you can redeploy it. Some of the shelving units work really well for this.
---
I kept an eye on my 50cal ammo count over the weekend to see if that was really what was happening. I'd "experienced" this myself for a few weeks/months now, but I wasn't sure it was consistently what was happening, or if something else was at play. What I noticed this past weekend is that I do use up all the ammo down to zero, and then as the reload animation begins to cycle, a random low number (generally ~10% of my weapon's capacity) appears on my screen in the ammo counter. That is to say, on my 50cal, which starts out with 250 rounds fully loaded, I shoot on full auto down to 0, and as the reload starts, the ammo count jumps back to 023, or 009, or 017, or some other random low number.
---
Just gone
---
About a 10 second south west of the vault by that lake/pond
---
looool, so awesome :D
---
I can allready tell you, they aint releasing that till right around the time the patch that has the brotherhood dlc drops.
---
Been waiting for that Lodge furniture set, mainly the fireplace. Now all I still want from the ATX datamines is the carved wood clock, new weapon racks, and the new arnor mannequins.
---
Ok then.  Stomp ur feet and cry about it.  Carry on.
---
Oh hell yes that lodge set! Must have that!
---
Which means that with no mentions of pvp, we can infer that he is not a big PVPer, and would be benefited more with the extra dps and lower ammo consumption of a tri barrel
---
Good . . . but it took a year of near-constant complaining üôÑ 
---
This should have dropped with Wild Appalachia. 
---
When it was requested for the 100th time and not the millionth
---
Yes they do stack.
---
Glad you found it useful!  Welcome to the dark side üëçüèª
---
Oh nice I'll have no problem doing all that, thanks.
---
Eh. Semi cool I guess. The reuse of the railroad armor doesn't really impress me, but maybe I'm bais
---
üíØ
---
But I have twelve kids and 4 jobs, I can only pay three minutes a week
---
WTF BETHY SITTA
---
Lol it‚Äôs not gonna drop till the BOS do
---
Make sure you have pacifist mode on, some people can be assholes. (You can turn pacifist mode off or on in game options).
---
I've noticed a fair amount of people who play this game have social anxiety, so if you wave at people dont be offended if they dont wave back.
---
The teams mean you're getting a slight bonus for more people you have in a team. It also means you can fast travel for free to their camps. Just be careful of where there camps are, so you don't get stranded somewhere scary!
---
The black one correct? Without the red trim on the top parts? Yeah I dumped it. Had no idea it was so rare or I would have thrown it in the vendor instead.
---
There are no daily or weekly challenges posted.
---
Thank you for this! I just downloaded the game yesterday, playing it for the first time. Going to be an interesting journey indeed haha!
---
They promised "everyone" gets it, and they didn't deliver. Couldn't expect less from Bethesda.
---
Molerats
---
I'm kind of worried about this. If you make bosses too bullet spongy, more people are going to feel compelled to cheese the boss.
---
I think the nerf is good for normal add damage in the game, but bosses I'm not so sure is a good idea.
---
You right
---
There aren't any. Interesting way of doing things...
---
You only need 1 in Nerd Rage also, if you need points to move around.  1 in Serendipity is very helpful also, switch for lucky break(it doesn‚Äôt work in PA either sorry).
---
That or start running- still annoying
---
I became even more curious about them when I heard one of their NPCs trash talking Crater *and* Foundation.
---
Gone forever - it‚Äôs seasons only now one guesses.
---
There are 2 different types of teams.  Private teams, which is you and up to 3 other people, typically roaming together.  you control who you are teamed with (its by invitation), you share some things - if your teammate gets kills, you can get a bonus; if you hit the same critter, you get to loot it, things like that.
---
The X has invited... are public teams.  Anyone can join anyone else's public team.  There are different kinds - Events, building, hunting, casual.
---
  Members may choose to roam together (or not).  Over time, you "bind" to other team members, earning a bonus multiplier for each bound person.   
---
  Building teams offer full time bonus intelligence, which gives you more XP.  The bonus can be significant.  Combine a 4x bonus bind with lunchboxes (earned during the legendary run) and you can get 100% XP bonuses for every kill and completed task.
---
Events teams also get bonuses, but only during and for completing events.
---
Etc.
---
When the legendary run resumes in a couple weeks, you'll see there are various challenges for performing X action when on a team.  For some things, you can be a team of 1.  (create you own). Sometimes, the challenge is just "be on a team with at least one other person." or "take a picture in a team members camp"
---
Play solo, join a team, choose to interact or not.  Its all how you want to play.
---
I will, thank you. like I said, it's a public sub. people 'stomping their feet' are just posting their own opinion, not unlike you just did.
---
it also serves as a way to measure whether people are enjoying the grind or not. I'm not, clearly. and I'm not the only one.
---
Underwhelming.
---
Bear Arm. For me, it‚Äôs one of the coolest weapon designs in the franchise. Until I landed a BSS+1S version, I ran around with a non-legendary one even though I had better weapons.
---
I/FFR Lever Action Rifles are also underrated. I rarely see people post about or for them, but this with Gun Fu against a horde of enemies (say Line in the Sand): just try it.
---
Best overall weapons: probably ?2525 Fixer, ?E15r legacy heavies (GP, GL, Flamer), ?SS+1S Power Fist, ?E25 .50 Cal, Nocturnal Shovel and Ghoul Slayer‚Äôs Gamma Gun.
---
Ever heard the saying: 'Better late than never?'
---
I was saving script and other stuff cause I‚Äôm maxed out in game and short on time to play. First time I learnt it will be lost. Oh well..
---
I claimed that and had no problems, but my camp is pretty static.  When I eventually move my camp, is it going to screw up?
---
Haha, you have such a need to be sooo right that someone agreeing with you is not good enough. Get a life.
---
1. I play on PS4, but the interaction via emote is very common. Most players are busy running their quests or dailies, but it doesn't hurt to give a "hello" over the mic.
---
2. There are 2 types of teams: Public and "Private". The public teams are the ones you getting the notifications about in the lower right of your screen. "Private" ones are where you team up with friends, etc. but are not publicly advertised, and confer no special bonuses. Public teams are accessible from the map, on the Social Menu (R1 on the PS4), and joining a public team confers a benefit like extra xp, extra Luck, extra Intelligence, or Endurance. The bonus increases the more people on the team there are. Public teams are often comprised of strangers, and many times not even in the same place on the map (Event Teams tend to stick together, however). I typically join Event (bonus xp for events) or Building (extra INT) to increase my xp rewards.
---
I know I claimed my lvl 100 yesterday but now you have me wanting to put work down and check lolol
---
Because everything is better then having even more boring factions that get thrown away.  
---
Not to mention that this is just not true, Fasllout 4 and 76 put more Factions into the World. And the Game is not as its end.  
---
Alone the whole Sam Blackwell/Free States Story was well written.  
---
You want to delete Enemys just because they are in every Game ? I can say the same thing about Ghouls and other stuff what makes Fallout, Fallout. Would it make sense ? No, alone because you need to replace them with similar Enemys.  
---
And again, Bet put old and new Enemys into there Games aswell. If you dont want to see them thats ok, but dont complain there are never new Enemys or Factions in the Game.
---
Every day when I go to mine.
---
As soon as I see mounted head plans
---
If I didn't have piles and piles of ammunition I'd still probably be playing two lever actions.
---
Just saw it... Really disappointing I was hoping the atoms back
---
There's really no point playing this game ATM
---
The ability to catch them and put them in the tank would be awesome
---
Crops grows aotomatically when planted. Its only if you need something to make food/drinks with. The only reason to move your camp is if you simply want to move. There is no benefits or side effects fro moving exept for The caps it cost. Turrets and such is for when npcs attack your Base. Turrets are mostly useless as they're AI is messed up and they take up alot of building space so i would almost recommend that you ignore turreys until you notice that you need them. Enemys that attack your camp Will more often than not attack your crops fyi.
---
That will only end badly.
---
No, just look at the Dialogs of Rhamani.  
---
Not to mention that being muated is not a good thing, and to kill Mutants (who killed a ton of People) is a good idea.
---
Agreed, let's hope. Not sure why I'm getting downvoted though. I'm only sharing info and wished everyone a happy event.
---
We live to see the day when it goes live. That is why we live!
---
You no. 1 should be ‚Äúdon‚Äôt stay logged in around reset time - the bug still exists‚Äù
---
100% expected. We've know this for months.
---
I‚Äôm at 93 but I feel I‚Äôm satisfied with waht I got cause I ignored the challenges for the first few weeks anyway what did I expect
---
Of course. Every other faction did more harm then good to the Wasteland.
---
serendipity doesn't work with PA. 'you only need 1 ion nerd rage' is also a first, you'd be missing out on 10% more damage.
---
## stop calling them magic pls. It‚Äôs just a furious bug.
---
I only have xbox, my pc stopped working a long time ago so I'm on xbox
---
each tenderizer rank adds a measly 1%.
---
Hey man, if you decided to keep up the grind after getting the chicken coop and 5000 caps just because you wanted some skins you're never gonna use... That's on you.
---
Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised.
---
They couldn't even give us atom challenges for a week smh
---
Oh no no no ! Bethesda isn't gonna get me with that "Ranger Bundle" ! I'm sure they are planning something for next week !
---
Very. Guess I'm saving my atoms once again unless the contemporary set is on sale
---
Big time. I can see something like this happening soon as well, the cultists are by far a fan favorite and there is a lot to build on. Them and free states honestly would be great, they are on the top of the list of more wanted factions in game from what I can tell
---
Might as well take a break for a week for those that got burnt out from them during season 1. I'm probably gonna do the same and then go back in for season 2, though I just do them whenever I want rather than force myself to hop on. Still got the rewards I wantes, however for season 2, I want the greenhouse kit.
---
Now we need a 'laugh' and a 'wait' emote
---
It‚Äôs easier than saying furious bugged weapons anyway ü§∑
---
Well, that might explain why my Two-Shot Ultracite Gatling with +50% limb damage seems to melt bigger enemies.
---
Is there a formula how much increased xp you gain per 1 int?
---
Sounds like a quick fix. They can't re architect how the dialog / reward system works so they threw in a delay
---
I came here to say the same.  Boomer almost always screws up when I try to talk to him.
---
Still. Thing is, is if I want to spend MY atoms, to get the greenhouse bundle right away because I want to spiffy up my camp I CAN do that because they are mine! üòÄ
---
Even if the challenges were hints at the next season or stuff to look forward to in Update 22
---
Found the images: https://imgur.com/a/B7BClen
---
They really keep me playing... For 30 minutes a day, if there are challenges.
---
You are wrong on a few things.  
---
The creation of the Appalachian Brotherhood is well written and makes more sense then leaving the empty space of lore untouched. And makes more sense then just sitting in a Bunker and doing nothing. Its everything but not " mental gymnastic "  
---
Then you are wrong about the life after the Bombs. Thats a big theme here nad one of the BoS points. To rebuild the World. Not only them, even the Settlers. Ones who lived before the Bombs.
---
Yup, whole reason for the seasons was to do away with the atom rewards. Guess no one pays attention. ü§¶
---
Ah ok, I know only the utility items from cosmos are going on there. Like the chicken coop and ammo converter.
---
We‚Äôll have to wait and see I guess.
---
I‚Äôve tried to I‚Äôm still trash I can‚Äôt even get my garage door hooked up correctly to the switch it‚Äôs rly frustrating if anyone‚Äôs on Xbox and see this plz HMU
---
Right?!? Maybe they have future plans?
---
"isn't a bad guy"? He is a manifestation of GOD! to worship him you may need to do what I do: do it in your own home. I have my handmade Icon to him and ritual bindings. I am running out of kittens and puppies though.
---
Why they're ending it now and starting the new season a week later is beyond me. Should have had it go right up to the start of season 2.
---
Black Powder weapons
---
Problem is with angry turtle is that i cant understand half of what he says.
---
I‚Äôve been looking for a good non bloodied fixer or AAE or TSE handmade. I‚Äôm currently running that lever and TSvats handmade. It‚Äôs okay but I‚Äôd like more damage. 
---
I‚Äôve invested in a full set of vanguard ss armor so I‚Äôm reluctant to switch to bloodied. I‚Äôm the guy that taps all the enemies then runs around stiming ppl. I guess I could go for junkies but I‚Äôve never even seen a decent junkies weapon, and I sell all my chems
---
Holy shit. I forgot to claim all the stuff (mostly just caps and scrip and stuff. I think I got the atoms)
---
Stop lying. Thats just not true. They existed and the West Coast is untouched and nothing breaks the Lore. Maxon just used Army equipment to reach more Members. SOmething he did in Lost Hills. There got nothing changed at all. And the Story is not as its end.
---
Pacifist prevents you from damaging other players (accidentally). PvP can be initiated at any time if one player hits another, and then the second player hits back. Pacifist will not help you in workshops, because workshops are automatically PvP zones.
---
Not a fan of that outfit.üëéüëé
---
Based good guy Bethesda, thinking about and keeping my wallet safe for yet another week.
---
Damn I was hoping for a couple more days of dailies while the season track thing finished, I thought cos it was still a couple of rewards from the end we'd be able to earn more. 
---
I was so close to that space power armor thing.
---
It's basically the fallout 76 version of an expensive college education
---
Yeaahh, a no mic emote. I sure hope it's a a mic drop animation.
---
Recall key cards... I have 25 of them :/
---
TS FFR Gauss minigun can trigger magic for sure if using a armor piece.   
---
Of oddball note I have had that same gun trigger in PA before however replication has been spotty and do not feel confident in suggesting to use it in PA.
---
Yes, you can do 1 food stack (effects), 1 chem stack and 1 beverage stack at the same time.
---
""to farm screws" as an excuse to ignore the boss is just being a self centered, entitled ass hat.""
---
Like you ? Demanding that everyone needs to play the event how you want it and skip on Rewards and XP some Players want and need ?
---
So if I want a swing speed Power Fist I can only get it from the Purveyor?

wonder if the player counts will drop, me and my buddies probably wont log back on till armour ace drops

No, it's much better to face these kinds of things

""c'mon you get drowned with radaways and rad-x from the very first beginning...""
---
And you use it, i remember the first Days i played the Game. I really could used that or Stims. Not anymore but again, its not High Level Player content its for new Players also.
---
Yep...and not the mystery pick. You have to pick the 2\* or 3\* melee option to get one.
---
I want either the datamined vertiguard PA or the datamined Enclave X-02 APA, and knowing them, they'll probably milk all the other trash first and leave it for last. Guess you gotta leave the big guns until November, when people are already almost one foot out the door for Cyberpunk 2077.
---
It works, your frame rate is probably crap though. Latency is actually a pretty good thing to have for magic to hit in since it is all tied to how they "fixed" enemy rubberbanding.
---
That Drifter Outfit looks really familiar, almost like they stole it from the Blue Ridge Caravan.
---
The only legit complaint imho will be those people who missed out on the helmet that was added later, and had to be claimed a second time.  That one wasn't made anywhere near clear enough, I absolutely would have missed it if this subreddit hadn't told me about it.
---
There was never a chance they were.
---
u/Ladydevann This is something I think you need to see
---
Yup. When I see wood wall...
---
I know he's selling a rocket launcher.
---
But I've been there too.
---
Killed myself twice yesterday due to this bug, both times after being revived.
---
no, not really.  I'm always optimistic as I hunt for plans and I know that the ones which show 50+ plans are more than likely to contain mounted heads. I just hate it when they charge over 100 caps for them. 
---
I expect camps in the forest to have more low-level stuff and the nearer to Watonga you go the higher level they get. 
---
I've bought serums for 150 caps from two by two shacks and 5 cap plans from palaces. 
---
I enjoy the thrill of the chase fast traveling in and locking in on the vendors and hoping there's something good
---
Nice! I bought one level a couple of days ago, but it was an atom reward, so a net loss of zero. Just wanted to get closer to something else I wanted but wasn't sure when I'd next be able to play.
---
Well one is labeled 1 another 2 and lastly 3 and that = profit -Developer probably
---
That's pretty much how the Junkie build trend started. Right after the Tse nerf the Sam Japanese players first showed this to friends I play with.
---
Yeahhh, yesterday someone was in my camp location, which it‚Äôs kind of rare to see someone there because not many know a camp can be placed and built there, I went to check it out hoping it would be as interesting as my camp that‚Äôs there. It wasn‚Äôt, all it was was a measly stash box not even neatly placed. I ended up finding the player, griefed them until they left the server. I‚Äôm not one to grief often but I was highly irritated. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

As a person who plays this game infrequently, I miss our on everything in this game.  I've so stopped caring about Bethesda's gimmicks.  I like the game, but the systematic bs Bethesda does around it for monetization really craps on it.  Fake scarcity in the Atom shop is just one of them, and it's just depressing that this is what Bethesda chose to do.
---
Interesting... offer flux for sale,  player buys it then kill player get flux back. Server hop rinse repeat. I get the idea but it might just be easier to farm flux.
---
No, nerfing yourself is not a argument. The whole Gun, Perk balance is not good. Not to mention that you are completle ignoring the new Perks the Game gives you and other Gameplay Mechanics. 
---
Or that Game devs need to look for Players who want to force themselfs a "challange" and all other Players who want a better Damage system needs to suffer.
---

I stopped using heavy because I'm sick and tired of my be15 gattling plasma and my ultracite gattling reloading with 250 shots left.  It progressively gets worse and worse
---
They‚Äôd have to give you something useful instead!
---
U mein the new  players which are also get drowned with it? Did you played a new character recently? Every event, every quest and every player spams you with this crap.
---
Shouldn't be the season for everyone, especially endgame players since they literally dont have anything else to to besides of grinding junk or spamming nukes which are both repetitive af?
---
I fast travel just to see some non legendary leather armor being sold at over 30k
---
I escaped from Fort Defiance fair and square, I was a prisoner of war! Then I was forcefully inducted to their ranks!
---
Same here.  I think I could have finished without buying out the last two boxes but I wanted to take the weekend off.  Otherwise I actually liked the season.  The daily and weekly challenges gave me a focus that more or less fit my usual play style of dinking around, seeing the sights and blowing stuff up.

Might as well cancel fallout 1st üôÑüòí

No, I‚Äôm just saying you‚Äôre recommending him to use a penta barrel when it‚Äôs a complete waste for him to do so
---
That would .make sense if the "magic" damage was even remotely intentional.  This isn't some Easter egg though, is just a bug with the way damage is calculated with version effects between server and client.
---
And there will be people posting about people who will tell us that whining people will be coming here to cry.
---
Brace yourself.
---
It gets said every week - but this is the lamest week yet in the Atomic Shop. But, I figured it would be because the update will bring new stuff.
---
I yawned so hard after seeing this that a bug flew into my mouth
---
I‚Äôm capturing all the queen drops and will do a dedicated webpage for it, when people see hundreds of one star rolling pins they will think twice before picking up this game.
---
I like to shoot them in the face.
---
I didn't claim the fireworks at around rank 50. Not that big of a deal because they aren't really that much of a celebration though.
---
Well I thought so lol xD the only thing I have left is choosing between settlers or raiders. I haven‚Äôt done every side quest.. so maybe I missed it there?
---
It's rituals like this that bring comfort in difficult times.
---
Can't say I've ever had a billing cycle for anything that started that late in the month, so I cannot answer that.
---
I have a stack of plans just collecting dust in my stash, certain ones I want to keep, but if anyone on XB1 wants some free plans then add me, my GT is BlaccAuraXO, I‚Äôll be placing them in my vendor with all my other free stuff. I just want them gone
---
Well at least free emote
---
Bummer. I wanted that big sheepsquach. Not worth running home for though.
---
Then by all means, spend away!
---
No worries, just my brain having it's morning coffee. Wondering to much about unimportant things.
---
Honestly the season is what brought me back and I only played it this past week and that was it. Really excited for Season 2. Sept 15th right?
---
How many addictions does it take to start getting heavy damage from Junkies weapons?
---
The eyeball test says not  too much, no official info though
---
I think he‚Äôs poking fun at his accent
---
That chess game would be boring. Todd would take 10 years to make a move.
---
I think Ward is just sleep deprived now...
---
Yes his English is excellent but his accent is tres thick.
---
I have a couple of B miniguns with 1 magic attribute, a two shot,limb minigun and at I thinka couple of lmg I don't remember.
---
It is 
---
Isn't it?
---
Was there last week as well
---
9. The best loot is the friends we make along the way
---
Wonder if this magic damage will change with the new damage model coming
---
With the lunchboxes being available to buy from the vendor, this season should be far easier because the accessibility to them will be far higher.
---
350% bonus? holy fucking shit thats broken plus super duper thats... 7 times the amount of ammo. Im pretty sure
---
Wow, I wasn't able to get on over the weekend, so I guess I missed my chance to claim the collectron?

this has probably been one of the few weeks where I wasnt interested in anything in the atom shop
---
Is it a B50LMD minigun?
---
Can't argue with that point.
---
Private server did it. Thank you üòäI did try server hop to regular servers before, at no luck. I am new to this forum so not so well known with it‚Äôs functions.
---
If it's the same as last week then it's full price at 1200
---
Probably. I expected to keep playing after finishing, but I realized how badly I needed a break from the game. I thought I would still be playing, and was planning to open the currency at the end. Maybe Beth will automatically grant the rewards?
---
Yup yup \^
---
I got you fam.
---
They are called magic because of Angry Turtle I think. He calls them that because he cannot say why they behave this way. Why you would get so upset about it is puzzling. Did you have a bad experience with a magician when you were a child?

Probably the same than

I have it already so it doesn't show a price for me

I tank all three. There are so many health buffs between perks and supers and nuka quantum

Do you get the extra XP as you go along or do you have to play until everyone stops to get it?  When I quit last night I wasn‚Äôt sure that I‚Äôd gotten anything ‚Äúextra.‚Äù  I got the xp for finding new places but not even sure that was the goal of the ‚Äúexploring‚Äù group. Was I supposed to find where they were on the map and be WITH them or exploring on my own?
---
I think your friend is wrong.
---
Maybe, but I wouldn‚Äôt count on it.

it's a Fallout 1st exclusive deal, so if you are not Fallout 1st you can't see it nor purchase it.
---
Yeah that happens to me. Can't confirm crits missing. But when it happens if 1 misses all of them miss. It's one of the reasons my build is centered around NOT using V.A.T.S.
---
Im in the same boat, I feel like I have nothing to do until next week, just xping doesnt get my rocks off anymore.  Like to play when I know im working towards gaining something cool (and it has to be cool)  season 2 has a few things I want, not even that interested in the lvl 100 reward but ill most likely achieve it just by playing normally
---
That Blue Ridge Caravan Outfit looks really familiar, almost like they stole it from the Railroad.
---
Thanks to you I am 2 trophies away from platinum
---
Coming from a pioneer Scout that's hilarious. I'd expect a Raider to shit on a bucket head
---
No idea why people thought this was going to be a thing.
---
I mean, they have shown up to a week ago that the run was coming to an end and when. There really is no excuse for complaining. Either play the game, win the stuff, and claim it or don't.
---
Yes, you get the small one from the overseer stash at the airport and the normal ones from the order of the tadpole quest.
---
Maaaan, if it already was a thing I would've been at least 100k caps richier =(
---
SD only adds the base amount, apparently, but it's still a stupid amount of ammo. Then again, that ability at that level *does* cost a slot and it has to be maxed, so that kind of output seems a reaonable tradeoff.
---
You need a weapon with high fire rate or a shotgun in VATS. Like 160+ fire rate.
---
I got to 30-something... I don't know. Who cares?
---
Well, when I was level 5 I joined a solo team person and she immediately quit. Then somehow I was the leader (ha!).  I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do then so I just quit the game and restarted.
---
##no, I prefer calling them magic weapons.
---
You are supposed to be a well-programmed recurring revenue machine for Bethesda.  How dare you miss a few days of being online and spending money in the Atomic Shop?
---
I‚Äôve powered entire large, complex camps with two windmills. Of course, I typically don‚Äôt have any water purifiers (get plenty from quests and scavenging)
---
He showed me a screenshot of it.
---
I don't know that he's demanding spoon fed information. If you don't have an answer, move along. I may be missing something that was deleted from post? I think he was just looking for a general comparison between PTS and not in PTS. I understand that anything in PTS is subject to immense change, and or being pushed back forever again. Still helpfull to know even a base comparison. W.e OP said regarding other posts, he's on his own.
---
You are just better use the perk card "Power Patcher" (intelligence). You don't even need to have it equiped. Just equip it when you need to fix your power armor.
---
And anyway your power armor pieces are breaking at a really really really slow pace.
---
I think Bethesda realized none of their shop items were, ‚Äúmust have‚Äù with the returns on atoms simply from playing I think they shrunk this down considerably to push atom sales.
---
Having one and not using it doesn't make someone lazy. Using one and not muting yourself makes you lazy.. I hate having to listen to the guy who thinks he's a rapper, or the person yelling at their kids, or all the little kids telling mom "In a minute!".

I wondered about that - if we don't move there is no way to change it, is there?
---
What the fuck kind of bullshit is that? Are you serious? That's the only thing I want from the store z and I can't even buy it?

There you go work around confirmed lol

I‚Äôm on Xbox and could help you later if you need help..

A level 20 started encryptid and it was just me and him. Know how you feel, I had to go through 200 super stims to clear it.

Same. Been this way forever, I stopped using quick swap so long ago I forgot it was a thing.

I love noodles. especially udon. I wish I could have a recipe in fallout 76 to make noodle bowls so I can open a noodle shop.

I'm bumping this for visibility. I want improvements to this game I love so much.

Just pull up your map and it stops.

But it is annoying.

it does? not from my experiences because with ammosmith when im making .50 cal I get 540 for only crafting 2 things of fifty call when sd kicks in
---
No worries. I would be happy to help. will be on after 8pm uk time. If your on
---
What Concentrated Fire does in addition to letting you target limbs, is give you an increased hit chance with each shot in VATS. That increase goes up with each rank. At rank 1, you get very little increase from one shot to the next, rank 2 gives you slightly more, rank 3 makes an enormous difference. 
---
It‚Äôs particularly useful when firing from a long distance. In just a few shots you can go from a 10% chance to 95% with rank 3.
---
I feel like the daily ops is kind of going to fill that niche gameplay, except instead of standing still you kinda have to go around a bit?
---
Yass they finally have a "no mic" emote
---
"Maximize your intelligence and experience output with drugs, alcohol, and soups. "
---
I've been maximizing my experiences this way since my college days.
---
It's coming with One Wasteland so it won't matter. The mobs will appear higher level for you and lower for them.
---
Next week
---
another recolor of the Railroad armored coat, ridiculous.
---
when did they add that in because im pretty sure I've been to the airport and have seen the stash. which airport Morgantown or wade?
---
dont forget  the the lunch box exp buff i did soooo many of them 10k exp quest with that
---
Servers are so empty these days, sometimes it feels like Fallout 4 cause you don‚Äôt meet anyone except NPCs... By the way don‚Äôt think I will continue grinding Season 2 as I prefer to play it my way and not Bethesda way. Exploring and having fun but definitely not Boring and Grinding Guts out.
---
K thanks

Yep.  The crew i play with just about every night got split in half doing ACP.  We could see team mates dying on the meter and nothing we could do

Sept 15 patch 22.  It may be delayed.

Ward is clearly been battling with depression and addiction.  He used to be in be all hours of the day and is obviously selling Foundations assets to fund his drug addiction.

Does Grenadier even work with explosive bullets? I thought it was only explosives like grenades, missles, and fatmen

One month in and I've had three people try to start pvp with my squishy newbie toon and one person just straight shredded me (in full PA) in three steps, just for my loot. Not so far between, really.
---
There is a noodle cup! I believe one spawns in the whitesprings clubhouse... ALSO!! I made a bangin bowl of udon the other week! Ill have to send you pictures!
---
I'm kind of torn. The seasons do make me feel like I *have* to play (sure I'm doing it myself). I finished last season 2 weeks ago, and it's been so nice not feeling like I have to log into Fallout. Not sure I even want to bother with this one.
---
While i love the Hunting Lodge Fireplace, I have having to "activate" it every time i log into a server. The modern fireplace is always on while the winter and hunting fireplaces have to be activated, it just annoying thats all.
---
Sweet! I never would have known.
---
You can kind of adjust location of spawn in location with moving the CAMP thingy around.  I was unhappy with my spawn in location so I moved it on the other far edge and then it put me right in my camp.
---
I think you're thinking of RadAway.  Just take the diluted, it doesn't affect mutations.  If you accidentally take a RadAway, you can use a diluted right after and it overrides it.
---
Next Tuesday
---
It's a nice emote btw, cool animation.
---
please do. I mean, I want a recipe!!!!
---
Never on for more than an hour a day??? That isn't playing a game because it's fun. That's just doing your digital chores basically. lol.

I swear it said the 8th

You are correct!  I stuck in fireproof 2 and it's way better!

Not sure if it‚Äôs still accurate or not, but here
---
This effect wont be useful to my specific case, right? Cuz I am using a shotgun at mid range and most of the enemies will die with the first shot. Does the VATS hit chance go up if you miss?
---
I finished way ahead of schedule with no issue and that‚Äôs including missing days here and there.
---
This 100%. Why people think Bethesda intended for them to get every single item they did want for free is a mystery to me.
---
They wanted to remind you how awesome of a reward the ammo converter was. Those missiles can be converted to ammo points to get real ammo. (Yes they could have directly given you the ammo points instead of using a heavy as F middleman, but logic has no place here).
---
Would have been a freaking awesome surprise to see one week of atoms challenges to fill up in case of need to advance one step or two in the next season. No way it will happen anytime. Ever.
---
Are those suppose to be new armors altogether or just new skins?
---
np man
---
Taxidermy, was struggling to find it myself when I first got it too lol
---
This smells suspiciously deliberate.  If all you ever get is a sub-par roll from random world drops, you'll be naturally inclined to try other sources.  So you say "screw it, I've got scrip," and hit up the purveyor.
---
She gives you a different roll so you're more willing to try again, as seeing a different roll (even if it's not good) alleviates some of the frustration of the grind.
---
So you go out to grind scrip and tell yourself "hey, better than hunting random legendaries."
---
And Bethesda laughs as you do exactly what they want and log in every day to grind scrip.
---
i manically did atom-challenges cause my challenges were bugged so i wasnt taking chances bought like 10 leves i was missing
---
WHEW :D
---
So now we gotta expect pre-complaint complaints? Don't you see how vicious this cycle is? We gotta be better.
---
THANKS! That is very useful.
---
That is the business model of these season pass games.  If you have no life and log in every day and get all the rewards, you still serve as a walking advertisement to casual players, who will open their wallets when they can't commit the time to this game.  My advice for season pass games like fallout and red dead is to learn to let go.  You don't need every cosmetic.
---
Floor decorations
---
Great post. I finished a few weeks ahead of schedule and there was never any need to panic. Regardless of what *certain* YouTube channels posted..
---
But money lol.  Don't worry it'll be back in a BOS bundle for 1200 atoms I'm sure. And it'll include something new so we'll all have to buy the bundle
---
I've been playing this game off and on since launch. I dont think ive ever seen a single player using a missile launcher even once.
---
Months ago it was added in, when they did remodeling on the interior of the Morgantown airport
---
Ok Karen
---
Not for me bro, im stuck at 900-1000 caps
---
Thank you  I found it
---
Love when I get 4 missiles every time I launch a nuke :,)
---
Not sure, but I guess it should. It only says explosives. And Demo Expert also says "your explosives..." an it affects all explosions, including bullets.
---
my board is still there to claim the old rewards... weird ive been resetting the game and its not coming up with the new legendary run.
---
X 02 ? Where ?!
---
Floor decor. It‚Äôs with the gorillas if you have those.
---
It‚Äôs been saying on my game on the menu in the top right the 8th for the past week
---
50LMD is limb damage+ It has that.
---
ah thats why Im gonna go check it out, whats the carrying capacity of it?
---
Wait for trades, events, and yes - SBQ
---
How is it hurting you?
---
Okay thank you! Do you know if that patch will have all the stuff on the player test realm of not?
---
the legendary run hasnt reset yet though. they are behind or something
---
I mean you can always get more atoms tho
---
i skip the first week and a half + no nuclear winter challenge and was 99 before double score last week with 30min of playing.
---
The new run is on September 15th. Are you sure the old board is still there? Do you know how much longer?
---
"Enjoy the event, don‚Äôt turn it into a job.  That‚Äôs not Bethesda doing it to you, that‚Äôs you doing it to yourself"
---
Naw. Any time Beth developers create limited-time rewards that require regular log-ins and repetitious completion of tedious or dated content, that is most definitely Bethesda doing it 'to us'.
---
People can still have fun with it, and some of your suggestions are sound. But pretending this is a casual walk in the park and any feeling of grind or tedium is on us, rather than Bethesda, is just plain silly.
---
Thanks
---
No, it didn't. It said Season 1 ends the 8th.
---
i played LFD and LFD2 alot back in the day.  do Borrows runs from beginning to the assaultron finale, it feels similar to LFD run or D3 run.  dont do sneak just go through it letting the ghoul hoard rush in.  sure its not 'endless' but there's alot of them in there.
---
Is it for sale?
---
what ranger bundle!?
---
And for those of us who are deaf ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
This season ends on the 8th but the new one doesn‚Äôt start until the 15th. There‚Äôs a week in between.
---
Camp building only makes teeny bits of XP.  If you get creative with finding locations you don't even really need fancy plans to do lots of cool stuff
---
Even though I don‚Äôt play NW, I know that some people still prefer it to adventure mode. What effect does it have on you that there‚Äôs an optional game mode available?
---
Nothing for F1st users except for the Armor Workbench, the thatched rug and the sleazy heart bed.
---
im lookin at my game right now and its still there. i can claim rewards if i spend atoms. there are no daily or weekly challenges though.
---
Ah right, I thought it meant that season 2 started on that day as well
---
The items that haven't been claimed are auto claimed to the last played character
---
Damn, that reminds me I totally forgot to claim my last scrip reward cause I was holding onto it for the purveyor sale.
---
Great suggestions.
---
A lot of what you said will really help those going forward. Good writeup!
---
full building teams is a must, If you have a free day where you really want to play, knock out all the weeklies on that day... it makes the rest of the week a non-grind. I often finished most in less than 30 mins, sometimes 15 mins depending on the dailies.
---
Make a new character to do the 1 level a day daily if you're higher level, otherwise you end up working harder for that that one. I plan to do this going forward myself, then you don't need to stay logged in as long just to get a level out of it if you got stuff to do.
---
 I have an article I wrote very similar to this on playing MTG Arena and how not to get burned out because of all the negativity towards the free stuff track (and paid track) (it's similar to legendary run in style)... anyway, I just finished that track a whole month early with daily play... considering that, I could have missed a LOT of days, or played more casually and still easily got it done in time. The key on that game is maximizing the points needed in the most minimum amount of time... just like the Legendary run.
---
The real mothman is a harbinger of disasters who warns people ahead of time. He would be ashamed of the cultists and how they've managed to corrupt his brothers. Only the wise mothman deserves our respect and all cultists must die.
---
Ah right, I think i just assumed that the new one started today as well
---
Hmm... I hope it‚Äôll stay there for a bit... I need to claim my rewards
---
I finished this nonsense three weeks ago, and it wasn't that awful. I object more to the daily, time-gated portions of the effort, but it wasn't really awful. Well, that and the fact the majority of the rewards were cosmetic. Otherwise, not that big of a deal.
---
It‚Äôs so beige this week. I wonder if they‚Äôre expecting us to be hibernating until start of season two?
---
The one up north, Morgantown. They added it with wild Appalachia I think.
---
"I don't like this thing so no one likes this thing."
---
I am still waiting on those users that downvoted all and interjected "but atoms are free", when the first fridge came out.
---
Fuck dem bitches and their downvoting. Now there is no more repeatable way to get free atoms.
---
What are you having issues with specifically
---
I think you have fundamentally misunderstood the reason for the cap limit.
---
They are. OP just wanted to complain for complaining sake about complaints that haven't happened yet. They literally get auto claimed to your last used character.
---
Really nice to see someone else who understands this!
---
In Destiny before a new content launch it‚Äôs people that pre-emptively bitch about alleged people who will be bitching about nothing to do shortly after launch because they over-prepared and burned through it all too quickly.

I‚Äôve been playing the game for 6 years. I have always aggressively prepared. I have never once seen someone do that and complain about ‚Äúnothing to do‚Äù afterward. 
---
100% of the complaints are hyper-aggressive white knights of the forum and game pre-emptively bitching about complainers that never have existed.
---
Yoooooo no wonder I was able to solo the queen so fast! I finally attempted to solo the queen because I decided to craft the gauss minigun and I got a two shot. I just checked and it does have the 33% vats hit chance!
---
I need a laughing emote....
---
whats it carrying cap
---
do you have a source for the new run being on the 15th though?
---
Maximize intelligence? I mean I understand the exp part with stuff like Cranberry Relish, the Mothman event exp bonus, etc, but why maximize intelligence?
---
It costs $12 "worth" of atoms, right?
---
Nope. The 15th.

I don't think there is anything wrong with Beth looking to monetize a game that requires maintenance. Without income there can be no development. I recently saw that only 400K Fallout 76 games were ever bought, not very good for a AAA company (Forbes calls it a "niche" game, though I might argue, they all are). It makes for a weak player base so that might explain why it is getting, arguably, worse and not better. Wastelanders was an improvement, but that took 18 mos. They can't fix the game (best example is the fast travel bug and the broken essential quest "an ounce or preventon), and that my be becasue they simply don't have the resources. 
---
It is a shame. I love much of this game, but I've done it all now and I don't think that I will still be playing after Nov. 19. I like to think that someone will take what was right about this game and move forward with it. And I won't balk at a subscription fee if I like the game.
---
Actually I'd like to go fishing and then put them in a tank. Also try and find some rather rare ones. That can only be found in certain regions of the map. It would be nice.
---
Surprising actually because the gauss minigun is absolute garbage against the queen due to its explosive effect but guess you have magic on your side
---
No, dude was just saying the penta is better for pvp. You're assuming he's recommending it simply because he chimed in with a factoid about it.
---
&gt; 1. Stay calm, it‚Äôs a long journey.
---
Even if you join late you can still catch up a lot
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt post about math and SCORE totals required to finish in the beginning. Clearly this subreddit struggles with math.
---
Everbody struggles with math TBF :'D
---
&gt; DONT SPEND ATOMS unless you are almost out of time (which you shouldn‚Äôt be).
---
Especially important because later ranks cost morre SCORE but still the same amount of atoms, by like a factor of 3+
---
&gt; Nuclear Winter is not required, don‚Äôt post your complaints about it being an option for SCORE. ( I did three Nuclear Winter Dailies for all of season 1).
---
Finished my without it (okay to level 90, with bugged chalelnged on the last 4 days) without a single NW match cause uh, mods :D
---
&gt; Maximize your intelligence and experience output with drugs, alcohol, and soups. Sleep helps to. Check out AngryTurtle on YouTube.
---
The 100 SCORE per 10k is forgettablle and is just a drip drip that might get you a level or 2 further TBH
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt buy into the bitch threads about ‚Äúthe grind‚Äù. Just do the dailies and a couple weekly‚Äôs a day. I was never on longer than an hour total each day.
---
If you know what youre doing you can max out caps + Calllenges in a day in less than an hour (wink win blacksomething mine next to whitespring)
---
&gt; If you miss a day or two, don‚Äôt fret. It‚Äôs not impossible. I took off TWO WEEKS and still finished a week early.
---
Started august the 3. and made it to 90 with no EXP grind and NW, also missed a few days, fucked up 5 weekles one week because i didnt expect the servers to go down 3 hrs early etc, its SUPER EASY. 
---
Alsoy ou get free atmos which are basically free levels! EZ! (it was arround uh 7-10 on the SCORE board last season!)
---
&gt;  Beware the natural FOMO and desire to be first. You do not get a statue built of you for finishing first.
---
Good point, honestly the ammo converter was the only usefull thing and i REAAAALLLY wanted that kekw
---
&gt; Enjoy the event, don‚Äôt turn it into a job. That‚Äôs not Bethesda doing it to you, that‚Äôs you doing it to yourself
---
Why do you put the real life hack at the end of the post REEEEEeeee
---
Probably. It is just next week. They just scraped this together because they needed something. 
---
I used to say that it is good because it is another week to earn atoms for the big update drop but now...
---
the bethesda website says it
---
Doesn‚Äôt the new season start sept 15?
---
so it's not as good as the order of the tadpole backpack but it's easier to get. cool. and im assuming you get the plan for it as well?
---
In the Special tab, where you get your free stuff. You'll find one of the most popular power armor skin in the "Ranger Bundle".
---
Well...one of the most amazing power armor skin !
---
I so wanna buy it üò≠
---
Intelligence increases experience output.  The higher your intelligence, the higher your experience gained
---
Same here. Every time someone instakill or use tesla there and keep thah after few shoots at them - I took my TS AGL and noone else even touches scorched after that.
---
Otherwise I use AAE cryolator to tag them. Does minimal damage, have high rate of fire and slows down them.
---
Deathclaw island!!!
---
I came in to Season 1 2 MONTHS Late and still finished 2 weeks early! Season 2 will be a piece of cake for everyone now that we know what to do!!
---
You don't need to do anything.
---
If you're a yearly sub, you'll get them every month on the date you bought the year, if you are on a monthly plan you get them date +3-4 days, because beth charges on that date and will need to see the clearance first.
---
Are experience teams or intelligence teams better?
---
ooohh i see tysm! ill have to go look
---
Ehh, not necessarily. If you saw the spaghetti nightmare that's the legendary item and effects lists, you'd understand. I wouldn't want the job of maintaining that mess.
---
Hahaha I give a fuck what you think?
---
That's a fucking gas
---
Yea that's kinda crazy considering I'm a bloodied so I was so confused as to why I was shredding her, thanks for the info btw!
---
Nah. Leave it so the pvp kids can blow off some steam and not mess the game for everyone else.
---
Because that's how it was before the legendary run
---
I go to those camps hoping to find garbage legendaries at scrip prices. Want all my alts at 1000 scrip when the sale hits .
---
Shut up Karen, it's not on you to tell anybody what they like to play.
---
Fair enough
---
OP 
---
100% accurate in everything he posted.
---
I only sub by the month but I get 1650 atoms on the day it resubs. So you should have received them at the end of August or maybe Sept 1. I know they have been having issues with renewals and atoms in general. If you're on PC I think it's delayed but I'm sure others can confirm. It's always best to reach out directly to support for issues with your account.
---
Do they have to be claimed and not just unlocked. Because I seen a lot of people that don't claim a lot.
---
Is the board still there? It could be there through today, the 8th
---
With the garage door, its also removes physical access, unless they glitch through, but that like extremely rare.
---
No problem dude!
---
19000 for the year? You get 1650 once a month while it's active. If you started your sub to Fallout 1st on 7/31 then you will be getting your 1650 atoms around that time each month the sub is active.
---
You should have bought the last level for 150 atoms and got 500 you fool
---
Clearly that's worth $9, changing colors takes some serious artist labor. /s
---
how would that look?
---
Thanks Man üëçüèº really helpful post when I can‚Äôt get on. Take my up.
---
Still no red wall paper. Why even live?
---
Not untill I finally give up trying to make them work
---
It's a fo1st only
---
That sucks but you weren't cheated out of anything
---
Thanks for the replies folks. Looks like I need to slow my internet connection down a bit! Plus, it was AngryTurtle who suggested the Pentabarrel, to increase fire rate
---
I rather them focus on fixing the exploits than removing it, would probably play it more if I didn't get one shot with marine armor and full health.
---
Get fucked and pay for atoms
---
It‚Äôs just called a building team and isn‚Äôt really meant for camp building though I think the extra intelligence would allow for more experience gained as you build up your camp. I mainly use it for bonus experience on everything I do all day whether it be fighting mobs, lockpick and hacks or cooking.
---
And also a ‚Äústay off the tent and fences during SBQ fight‚Äù emote lmaooo
---
The emote is free this week.
---
Thunder Mountain Substation TM-02 (Substation just north of watoga)
---
Abandoned Waste Dump
---
Hopewell cave
---
All 3 have guaranteed deathclaw spawns just so this don't happen for you on season 2.
---
It didn‚Äôt even show up in the atom shop for me.
---
The should give us shitty statues like ESO...the first statue could be Vault Boy holding a sack of cash and giving us the middle finger.
---
Ah good call.
---
Yes but its way too hard for a lot of people to read even though they are on REDDIT.
---
I didn‚Äôt know was the last day, Zorbo‚Äôs ship looked like it needed an extra day to finish.
---
Sounds like you hit your building budget.
---
Did you try deathclaw island?
---
Sadly I don't think I'll make it, I took 3 weeks off because of my mental health outside of everything as well as I couldn't take the grind.
---
It appears we have a break week.  Don't forget to pick up the No Mike emote. 
---
Also it looks like we can say goodbye to a second Meat Week as I wouldn't spend my game time just going around picking up beer bottles to scrap.
---
This would be a duping nightmare waiting to happen
---
And with today's Atomic Shop bundles it seems they are trying to milk people out of their atoms. I wouldn't be surprised if we get mannequins and power armor displays next week with the new season. Saving my atoms.
---
Yea there was a whole other post about ‚Äúhow to complete season 2 the best‚Äù and everyone is like ‚ÄúWHERE ARE THE DAILIES?!‚Äù Like damn man read for once lol
---
Its sad that this perfectly logical strategy for getting people the things they've earned is so unbelievable for the fan base (understandably so) but yes, that is what is supposed to happen.
---
Oh boy did I, can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve loaded into a world to either see a meat pile or a deathclaw slumped over
---
which is exactly why we were told it was changing.
---
&gt;*someone with an addiction that‚Äôs throwing their life away bro*
---
As if playing 3-4 hours a day since release, if not binging on the weekends, constitutes an addiction. Sure, it‚Äôs not the healthiest lifestyle, but it sounds pretty bitchmade to jump down someone‚Äôs throat about a game that canvases your entire post history.
---
I mean it‚Äôs not even the main devs working on that game mode. It‚Äôs existence has zero effect on adventure mode.
---
Damn that's really an annoying bug üôÑüòí
---
I launched a nuke last Friday, and got the missles and heavy combat armor piece, so I dropped those;  then in the next minute, someone completed Cop A Squatter while I was in the silo, and I got 3 more missles and another piece of heavy armor.
---
Also it's been saying the exact date it ends for a while now, right up on the main lobby a news
---
I want a "nice camp" one.
---
Okay, so when does it start?
---
U should've ask deathclaw location to google not searching everywhere
---
I want to see the grognak stuff again and not the villain one
---
Well lets see deathclaws...deathclaw island, the power plant substation outside of watoga, hopewell cave.   
---
Should of popped on here and asked. Also it was 150 atoms you could have done a few challenges and gotten that and you would have gotten them right back.   
---
Also it was posted and stated all over the place including in the game that the event ended September 8th 12:00 pm EST   
---
Only person that cheated you out of that rank was you.
---
You're the one salty over a stupid exploit in a game full of bugs and exploits to the point where you even consider using another exploit as a form of retaliation, not me, so yeah, you do give a fuck and that's ok, more power to you, just be aware to the fact that new and worse exploits will come and go and Bethesda couldn't care less, so you're pretty much losing your sleep for nothing and being kinda cringe in the process
---
Happens to me all the time using a Handmade in VATS, I try to fire off short bursts to not waste ammo, and every so often suddenly it will dump a whole clip.
---
Only for the legendary perk boost. It'll still give double the ammosmith amount.
---
Yep, it's an untradeable plan, but it's great for new characters.
---
"cheated out of rank 100" when the end date and time has been posted at least a thousand times. Ok.
---
Yeah like I‚Äôve got my build set up to do huge DPS even not in Vats, it‚Äôs mainly the Crits that it benefits from in Vats but it‚Äôs still painful. 
---
I‚Äôm just hoping that with Patch 22 and the rework combat damage stacking that unforeseen good things like Vats working again, happens. 
---
Since their updates break so much stuff maybe it‚Äôs bound to unbreak with a rework of coding.
---
Or the world will possibly blow up as we all float into space, either way will be interesting to see.
---
Despite the inc damage nerf I am actually keen to see how dangerous a pack of ghouls will be now LOL 
---
Might be good for role players :P all your BoS brothers and sisters reliving the Fo4 incident with holding off the ghouls aha
---
&gt; Bethesda adapts well to reasonable complaints.
---
The ever growing list of bugs this game is suffocating under begs to differ.
---
I had this same thought not too long ago, I had finished the Run but randomly clicked on the map and noticed that the spacesuit was unclaimed for some reason. Glad I checked it and I hope they can unlock anything others forgot to claim if they put in a support ticket
---
I didn't say it's not doable, everyone who GRINDED the season finished just as fast as you. I'm saying what you say and what you achieved is pretty much in conflict which each other.
---
But players don't HAVE to login everyday, that's my point. The fact that players feel that they need to do so says more about them than it does Bethesda quite frankly. Do people not understand the concept of agency; the capacity to choose and take responsibility. 
---
I love this game but I wouldn't spend a penny on it, other than the upfront cost of buying a hard copy 2 years ago. I'm more concerned, and rightly so, about earning enough to pay the mortgage and the bills, to eat, to put clothes on my back (it doesn't stop there)... cosmetics in a video game, c'mon!
---
ah. ok. well you're still geting a shit ton of ammo so it isn't the end of the world. That's still 500% i think? maybe more
---
I wish the bundle came with a less shitty outfit.  I hate buying bundled items separately, but man that outfit is unimpressive.
---
It has a bit of popularity so how about you remove yourself since you are pointless. No one even asked you.
---
Any ideas? Locations to build or designs? Were tryna move outta the forest
---
Could you elaborate? How is a Bloodied Fixer able to reach 2K on a single shot? Even as a RIFLEMAN, + perks and nerd rage + adrenal I find it hard to believe. 2K in a second as a COMMANDO? Sure.
---
15th noonish (after patch is done)
---
I asked for it.
---
I‚Äôm not upset it just keeps perpetuating a poor understanding of how the game works in favour of easy hype.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre remember correctly, but this melee limb dmg/agi 90rw bug first happened when Beth introduced the first purveyor sale. At that time, even rolls from there were bugged. They fixed it, but left the world drops being bugged :(
---
Isn't it 2000 caps everytime, to make a recall card?
---
Use Can Do perk card and hit up White Springs, my friend.
---
Tomorrow
---
I guess you're right. My bad for doubting them!
---
Sounds fun!  XBox here
---
If it makes you guys feel any better I am pretty certain that these items are the last items from the previous datamined set of images for Atom shop stuff.  Sooo maybe its coming in the next batch.  Hold on to hope!
---
"Almost out of time" should probably be, like, four hours you'll ever play in this season, right?
---
Well this took place first so....
---
Been doing that and serum recipes.
---
Not sure, I think it's like 60.
---
Intel... suprisingly
---
People are acting like I didn‚Äôt look up Deathclaw spots, I would spend a ton of caps fast traveling in each world to each one and there would never be one, other than that menu notification people are talking about I don‚Äôt go on reddit often and in game there‚Äôs no say of it even in the Legendary Run screen
---
Yup been there; it was especially bad the first week. I walked out of the mine with plenty of time, only to be bluescreened and lose all rewards.
---
The whole "escape the mine" mechanic is also useless. Everyone stays to collect screws anyway. They should just award the loot as soon as Earle dies and let everyone leave at their own pace.
---
Its weird that the gun itself is called the lmg but when you buy the plan it says plan: MG42 Light Machine Gun
---
I craft and use Enclave air strikes.
---
you get it for as long as you are in the team.
---
No guessing needed.
---
that's next week
---
whoops
---
no sept 15th
---
The part that really chafes is that it looks far better than the garish 'riding shotgun' armour.
---
I don‚Äôt reddit nearly as often as you do, I‚Äôm a once of month kind of guy when it comes to this website
---
gave up entirely with the game before halfway through the run. repetitive content with dozens of cosmetics... *yawn*
---
no complaints from me (other than the lack of content to keep interest)
---
Finally, a no-mic emote. Took just 22 months!
---
30 for the small someone else awnsered edit: at lvl 50
---
True I‚Äôll give you that - just don‚Äôt let them off so easy for ignoring one of the top 10 requests for this long
---
Someone lost to a team with frog legs
---
I don‚Äôt use it in rifleman. I have all sneak cards I have all unyielding secret service armor. I will take a picture of damage and show you if you think I‚Äôm lying. Don‚Äôt understand why I would write it if I was lying but I will show you proof once I‚Äôm off work tonight
---
there's a bundle without the outfit. that's the one i'm getting.
---
Me too
---
I feel this I have 500 or so scrip unclaimed and didn't realize it was ending today and I'm close or at cap last I checked.
---
Yep looks just like a reskin.
---
I've had a lot of difficulty getting a magic weapon to proc in PA, but works every time in reg armor.
---
Obviously that's a bug...you should have gotten a three star legendary rolling pin.
---
I was banned for 2 weeks and still finished with plenty of time to spare
---
nope. patch 22 was announced to be released on September 15th. it was never due to be released today.
---
They‚Äôre confirmed to come next patch with power armor displays
---
I thought it was just me - thanks for the PSA
---
literally all you had to do was go to the one in watoga and server hope literally took my son 4 tries yesterday and I saw a deathclaw there everytime I did my xp loop.   
---
It literally said when it ended on the pop up when you login, then also on the upper right of the screen it also stated it.
---
On the flip-side, I had an 8-round shotgun fill itself to 300 rounds...I really need to figure out how to repro that bug.
---
Really never saw it, I get up in the mornings load into a world while making myself a coffee, I rarely sit on the menu screen.
---
I do run all 3 maxed.  I will check it out, thanx for the advice
---
So what are building teams getting?
---
Sliders are hard to move don't you get that? Gawd. The carpul tunnel is serious.
---
yeah i saw all the math from the first one and thought mannnnn i'm never gonna finish. but i did like two days ago &amp; only did 1 NW match and it wasn't for the legendary run. 
---
doing the daily challenges and teaming up for events plus all the med/food boosts worked out great.
---
Does it go on sale?
---
So don't play the game, walk away if the grievance is too much, it's that simple... though I have sneaky suspicion that that's not going to happen.
---
I think you‚Äôre talking about the substation right? I built my base there and it would be dead every time I loaded into the world which really sucked because I built there literally because it was a Deathclaw spawn zone.
---
F
---
This post offers help in taking advantage of bugs therefore exploiting. Isn't that a violation of rule 8 of this sub?
---
Same here, for a day to day weapon there‚Äôs very little that can beat it
---
Guess i wont be logging in again. Thanks for the heads up. Ill go back to fo3 for the millionth time üòÜ
---
It's been asked for repeatedly.  Never acknowledged, let alone added.
---
You could and they are still in workshops fwiw.
---
sounds like you dont have the guts to help OP
---
Damn, we got einstein over here guys
---
How can you tell that without checking their vending machines?
---
This guy gets it!
---
when‚Äôs the update coming out?
---
I guess we can all look forward to your obligatory "my challenges auto completed today - has this ever happened to anyone else" next month.
---
Yeah once my 10mm smg was using ammo out of the reserve instead of the clip. Was pretty cool having an infinite ammo explosive/2 shot but definitely not working as intended
---
I don‚Äôt sit on the menu I load up into a world from my kitchen while getting myself a coffee and getting my daughter breakfast
---
A man of fine taste i see ;) might give the 50 cal and lmg if i find a decent one, never knew they didn't have a wind up though to be fair minigun pretty much wrecks mobs and bosses alike and is super snazzy with that lullaby skin, with the new perks 5mm gonna be super easy to get lots of. I tend to use a gatling if the targets small or i need to vats kill it but everything else gets Swiss cheesed my mini
---
I didn‚Äôt think about that, thanks for the heads up I‚Äôll remove it
---
Yeah you fucked yourself. You built to close which would cause auto deaths. All you had to do was go there and server hop that was it. Hopewell would have been even better but no one really remembers that place.
---
Tbh the nerf hasn't gone unnoticed by the community, when the ITV first introduced the season pass with season 1 people did talk about the lack of achievable atoms but it largely went by the way side because the diehard Bethesda fans downvoted any mention of it.
---
Because as you mentioned we get free shit for doing it, mostly stuff we didn't want or care for having but "hey it's free right and this stuff would have cost us xyz atoms/¬£‚Ç¨$"
---
Bethesda knew the old system wasn't working in their favour, no-one hardly was buying atoms to buy anything in their atom shop. why would anyone buy them when atoms were so easily achievable through daily/weekly challenges, people saved them to get what they really wanted and did not spend anything to get them.
---
This is a financial loss to Bethesda and it just kept on growing, now we get less atoms to get things and use our reserves we saved till they run out. We have two options now:- to buy atoms or get fallout 1st, both put ‚Ç¨¬£$ into the pockets of bethesda/zenemax/shareholders and that is really what they want
---
logged in last night thinking I had until reset. at least I'm not alone in my misery :'(
---
blackfish or blackeye or whatever shes called at ohio river adventures is worse 
---
dont even try to give her queen meat whilst she sleeps.
---
Bethesda built it so you actually had to do the seasons, if not, To go from rank 1 to 100, you's need to spend 15,000 atoms, or $150, so I thank Bethesda for seeing how in other games people buy out the battlepass on day one, and made it costly, personally, it's way more rewarding than just getting a few weekly or daily Atoms for mediocre tasks.
---
I enjoy it
---
I wish it loaded my whole reserve! I have like 20k shotgun rounds. I would love to never reload my bloodied again.
---
Easily soloable event with no legendary equipment and just a little prep and I find it laughable people still complain about it.
---
All I see are excuses, you fucked up not anyone else the information was easily found both in and out of the game.
---
Uh sure? I guess I‚Äôll wait for your ‚Äúworry‚Äù remark then too.
---
Not personally no but I‚Äôve had multiple people warn me
---
Personally I‚Äôm tired of good things being deep sized because they just won‚Äôt turn on a damage disabled for CAMPs for the PVE crowd. 
---
Not advocating for the return of the punji stacking but tired of regressions and making everything overt kid friendly
---
How much would you say the value of a stimpack plan is?
---
You should complain that challenges need to be fixed before complaining about atoms.
---
Works fine when I clicked on it.
---
It's on the Fallout Wiki... just google for "fallout 76 backpacks" and it should be the first hit or two.
---
If what you've told is true, you will have earned my trust
---
Why? 
---
Being on them makes 0 difference.
---
Queens pathing is just broken.
---
I just want the nukashine skins to come back. how long has it been.
---
its Bethesda
---
Great
---
Demo expert affects explosive bullets/Gauss Shotgun explosive effect. Grenadier does not.
---
I'm losing hope in us getting case hardened weapon skins. Seemingly took a lot of work to put into the game, and they're just gonna let it sit dead on a screenshot forever
---
Laziness basically. It's a hangover from a long while ago when the missile launcher was fairly potent, then explosives got nerfed across the board and the devs haven't bothered making this very simple change.
---
How does it feel to ride Bethesda‚Äôs dick so hard?
---
Oic thanks for the info!
---
Dude, it'll be back. Todd can't pass up a chance to get that paper.
---
They fixed challenges from auto completing by not putting them in.
---
The nerfs are proportional. The ones hit hardest &amp; cry the loudest ARE these very class of people.
---
The true dumbest approach is to do nothing
---
I'm saving my atoms... I'm really holding out for some great halloween stuff.
---
Again from your perspective maybe it was obvious information, but a main menu square and reddit isn‚Äôt obvious info to me, maybe in the future they can have a time limit on the Run screen itself, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be any harm for that to be a thing.
---
Yeah! My own camp. Sadly I know what's for sale too. And it's all crap I don't need. Mostly plans I know. Go figure.
---
I personally love a trap camp. They can be very creative. But FT mat would make me walk to camps for the nearest FT location. Really not a huge inconvenience but I'll never do the cliff top ones again.
---
The amount of bonus score they gave, no one should have issues getting to the end. I quite for over a month when the SCORE board came out and still finished it in time.
---
See it is the constituency that is the issue with magic what works for one does not always work for another what works on 1 xbox X doesn't work on another (or in my households cases OG xbox and a xbox X). Playing on the PS4 slim is different also. 
---
Hell servers could be different even private.
---
I found myself playing less after completing it.
---
but the thirst for bullion remained so did as many events dailies as i could 
---
noticed call of duty was getting more action.
---
Liberating in a sense, for the last year if it wasnt dailies for atoms or s.c.o.r.e.ive played this game religiously.
---
make some certain events more common maybe? like Rad rumble and uranium fever, riding shotgun?
---
People are giving you solutions that would have avoided your situation and all you do is give excuses instead of owning your goof.
---
I'm sorry but this is on you. The information is available everywhere, from reddit to Bethesda's official website, including the **game's main menu**. You had all available tools given to you. It's your responsibility to read the game's notifications, not Bethesda's. 
---
"I don't read the game's notifications, I look away and do other things" is still your fault.
---
Fallout 76 has a very faulty design for numerous things and Bethesda is to blame for a lot of issues, but this wasn't one of them.
---
I dilute them out of habit to have more, all I need them for is healing broken limbs in battle. I have healing factor for after, and use nuka colas for healing inside of battles if ever needed. I just sell my spares because I don't need that many. I do it all out of habit, don't really care too much whether I'm losing some caps or not since I stopped needing caps about 250 levels ago
---
Haha. Yes. Payment plan is optional.
---
Not Exactly... You get bonus XP equivalent to +1 intelligence when you join  the team, as if you were alone in a team, because you need to "create link" with other players in the team. Its represented by the blue bar below health bar of each player, to avoid abuse joining team just for an event and leave.
---
Lol in a similar fashion, just got a quad ammo railway rifle. So fun to fully auto out 40 spikes hahaha
---
Yes, to all of this.
---
I started season 1 a week or two late, and I was done a week early. I did go into NW a handful of times, especially when it was something stupid like "build your camp three times" or "survive for 5 minutes". But it's definitely not required.
---
Like the OP, I maybe sunk an hour a day into it. Honestly, most days, I could get 90% of the dailies in a half hour.
---
Sure, it's grindy, and it feels a little like a job, and an hour a day might be more than many people can spare. All of that is true. But it's definitely doable without killing yourself.
---
I was only able to participate in the season about 4 days out of the week the entire time. I have missed 3 days every single week of the season. 
---
And you know what happened to me? I finished a week early which means the double score event the past week did nothing for me. So even if you are behind by the end, if they keep doing double score at the last week and different score and xp events every season there shouldn't be a single season you miss out on. Clearly when it comes to getting score, this is the most generous the team has gotten and I appreciate that greatly.
---
Not sure, I was only browsing here and saw your post. I‚Äôll check when I get home from work and let you know.
---
Really not sure.  I had a hard time getting my camp placed and don't want to chance messing it up.  Bethesda said it's fixed, but I read complaints about it not being fixed here.
---
the fact after the first week anyone who ended up with autocomplete challenges to me is baffling?
---
i waited 1 hour after reset  each day off work i had.
---
If I see a plan for anything over 30 caps, I know the prices are going to be stupid. Ammo for anything over 1? Fuuuhhhgghhhedaboutit.
---
Handmade rifle
---
Im sad because i just got my new pc a week ago and i started playing again about 5 days ago and im knly lv like 14. But oh well ill have the chance to gey higher in S2
---
as soon as I see regular wood walls? Yep.
---
Okay hear me out since you seem to be captain oblivious. Do you know what day and time of the week the game rolls over? Namely the atom shop? If you knew the shop rolls at noon est on Tuesdays then you knew when the event was over.   
---
You literally cheated yourself and are either a terrible at trolling or are too dense to understand that this is literally your fault and not Bethesda (who rightfully is to blame for a lot of things but not this case).
---
I completed it with roughly 2 weeks left and definitely became more and more inconsistent for the 2-3 weeks before that.  I'd skip dailies I didn't like / same with weeklies.  They provided the three different boost events that helped for sure.  
---
I saw someone like 3 weeks in that had the secret door so clearly they were a whale and paid their way through it but I didn't buy a level.  I know FOMO or being first is a thing but there's someone willing to spend a crap ton of atoms on the first week to get it all, I can't remotely justify that.
---
yup!
---
And what exactly is forcing them to? The game's gotten along without any real intervention or fixes. People have come to accept and then idolize the cheaters. Try talking shit about dupers or duped gifts here, see what happens. These people accept it as part of the game at this point. This community rarely ever focuses on major issues, they tend to get swept under the rug for things like the new atom shop emotes or rare insult bot dialogue. You'd be rather hard-pressed to find a studio that is under *less* pressure to fix their shit
---
What if the first season didn‚Äôt brought as much revenue as expected, and they make it harder to get those sweet atoms out of us?
---
A vault Tec experiment
---
Swarmin vermin
---
You ever fast travel to a camp, but the game loads you in under its foundation, so you're basically stuck &amp; have to server hop just to get free?
---
The 15th. Ignore the other person who replied.
---
photography was my fav thing in forza and it still is in fo76
---
When I think of L4D, the most memorable innovation was having teams of players switch between controlling survivors and controlling monsters.
---
A match mode along these lines would be epic.  Imagine running a Deathclaw, Scorchbeast, or Wendigo Colossus!
---
Yeah but when will it hit?
---
I like the idea but replace Vault Boy with Todd Howard.
---
This :( the launcher is that rubbish no one thinks great ammo they think missile 2 weight ouch drop
---
Yeah, same here. I enjoy the Screaming Eagle skin (since they fixed it) since it looks a bit more "modern".
---
Yes I‚Äòm ready to switch to unyieldng vampire or unyielding quad if i need 2 shots per super mutant with my b3325 fixer after the patch. Already got myself a v3325 fixer and a q3325 handmade.
---
I‚Äôm surprised we haven‚Äôt run into a scorched bigfoot lol
---
All I‚Äôm saying is the situation that got me here, the information in game from what I‚Äôm being told was a square in the main menu and that was it, I shouldn‚Äôt be held responsible for out of game info since not everybody has time or the urge to constantly be on social media or browsing specific company websites for information, it‚Äôs just really weird that the Atomic Shop tells time limits within that screen but the Run didn‚Äôt tell any time info on its screen? I mainly used the position of Zorbo‚Äôs ship as a time reference because that‚Äôs what the tutorial for the season said.
---
Communication is the rarest thing in this game on many levels
---
If bought on the 31st it should renew on that day.
---
Just thought it might be better to use the six points in other places. 6 extra points for only 30% damage seemed a little excessive. I can move things around to put 3 points in each though. I had it that way at first. 
---
Why is refractor bad? I took it mostly to equalize the 40 dmg resist you get from nerd rage.
---
Finlly... a "no mic" emote!
---
No radaway just takes away rads. That‚Äôs fine doesn‚Äôt affect mutations. It‚Äôs rad x I was thinking of
---
or for sorting different types of items.
---
That was Generous Stranger ‚Äî long lost twin sibling of Mysterious Stranger. You have to have pretty high Luck for them to appear.
---
\&gt;  Clearly this subreddit struggles with math. 
---
This again?  It *wasnt* that the math was badly off.  It was that, at the time, there was no indication of double CHORE weekends, double XP, meat week, and extra challenges being added.
---
I mean, still take any kind of calculations with a pinch of salt, because more changes will no doubt happen too.  But still.
---
Note - they added more weeklies expressly so you don‚Äôt have to do it everyday.
---
Well that sucks. Thanks for the info.
---
So you only play a game if you are rewarded for playing? I thought this was supposed to be fun!
---
I‚Äôd rather something else then a collectron given we can only have one. 
---
Camps need MOAR life and things going on
---
Yep, it is for me nowhere near worth 900 atoms.
---
it's the 700 atoms one.
---
that's been happening to me too for a few months'
---
im a level 33 just started recently love fallout in general had this happen to me with a level 108? or something but i gave him a few stims randomly n he set me up wit a bunch of recipes and a couple power armor pieces so very cool
---
Eh so the amount of xp you get equates to score too?
---
I don‚Äôt know what day the shop rolls over, I just play the game to get dailies done and play with friends, you need to relax you‚Äôre insulting people over a forum thread. Bethesda could‚Äôve had a time limit within the Legendary Run screen is all I‚Äôm really asking for.
---
wait what
---
It's not 4x int. boost, it's actually just +4 int.
---
I hate it when they have a lot of meds but it‚Äôs all stimpaks. I NEED DISEASE CURES DAMMIT.
---
Welcome to building! LOL
---
What's the exact issue?
---
Maybe no point for you, but someone like me who still has to level up to change my build
---
why would there not be a second Meat Week?
---
fallout 4 did edit: spelling
---
If your ass was glued to single chair without moving for the rest of time - you‚Äôd be reluctant to talk to strangers too
---
They‚Äôre useless. Everybody has multiple copies piling up, yet everyone sells them for delusional prices, which is any price at all, really.
---
The entire population needs a drastic reality check over their deranged perception of what they have is worth.
---
The game isn't very fun if im not working towards something is what im saying it was fun but now with nothing to do on the days i can play it ends up repetitive and boring.
---
Because people amay want a rest from the grind
---
*Asbestos Torso Mod
---
You don‚Äôt even need a troubleshooter armor. The problem is that everyone is bloodied and nobody wants to clear rads. I always tank when I do encrypted with my team and the only thing I do is remove rads, equip first aid 3 and grab all pylons. Then the boss dies in one second and this is one of the easiests events to do out there. Only losing to manhunt. It takes like less than 10 stimpacks for a run
---
### CAMP Skeletons for the Skeleton war pls
---
Lol.
---
Lol, it's great, yeah. But seriously why is there still no text chat?
---
Great, will buy it later. Thanks!
---
Def what they said. Because if you use this perk and loot whitesprings you will get a bunch of them. I never use perk but when I was doing battle pass I would use it at whitesprings.
---
Wait dumb question, as I‚Äôm at work. 
---
Are there challenges this week and if so what do they reward?
---
They made it very clear in several locations noon today was the end. 
---
See you in a week.
---
&gt;  I shouldn‚Äôt be held responsible for out of game info
---
There's so little a game can tell that doesn't require a web browser. A game interface has its limits.
---
This isn't a niche thing, not even a new thing. Every multiplayer games out there use their official website to share important informations, with the possibility to subscribe to a newsletter if you prefer to be notified by email. The season had its own page, we had numerous inside the vault. 
---
Maybe the button prompt wasn't obvious to you. But this isn't a flaw in the game's system. There is no safeproof design that cover everything for everyone. Hell they could add an extra big flashy arrow "CLICK HERE" on the main menu and that would still be missed by some. People will be people.
---
So at the end of the day, they gave numerous tools. It sucks none worked out for you but it is what it is. It's still not a cheat.
---
If you don't take initiative to stay informed, don't blame the world for not knowing.
---
&gt;  I mainly used the position of Zorbo‚Äôs ship as a time reference because that‚Äôs what the tutorial for the season said.
---
Zorbo's ship moved to the last slot (before the big blob) *riiight* before the finish line on Monday. Following your logic, there would have been an extra day past the finish line with Zorbo's ship on the 'end' case. It doesn't even make sense since the point was to reach the end before him.
---
Next time, instead of gambling on extra time, especially for the last slot, just buy it.
---
because bethesda
---
No clue It would help a ton
---
Ah I wish I saw this yesterday, would‚Äôve avoided some heartache today
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/RadAway_(Fallout_76)
---
RadAway takes away rads and mutations.
---
Well that shouldn't be happening, thankfully bought my 1st when they were having issues last week, got the membership and atoms and didn't get charged.
---
Oh, I have had a couple times a short bass riff played every single time a notification appeared in the top left
---
There are no challenges
---
Just matters on diet and genetics
---
Don‚Äôt forget to also equip the Inspirational perk card, too. Joining a public team + Inspirational + Cranberry Relish + Well Rested seemed to make a big difference in how fast I gained a level. I think it also helped that I made sure to use the Class Freak perk to minimize the Int hit from having the Marsupial mutation.
---
For public teams Iooked for Events first and made sure I did a lot of events, or else a Build team for the Int boost. But I would take any team I could get for the boost from Inspirational.
---
Edit: Forgot to add resting, went back and added.
---
Yeah it said Season 1 ends on the 8th
---
Thanks kind sir!
---
They did it was Zorbo's ship that was the time limit including his little gas gauge...  
---
 But you say you feel cheated  the reality is you have no one to blame but yourself. There was options. What stopped you from spending 150 atoms?  Ignorance?
---
During release. Interesting that you say that. 
---
The thing is that the game, vast majority of the player base &amp; the devs themselves have evolved &amp; moved on since that time but you haven't.
---
There was a time when it was considered acceptable to physically harm someone as a form of punishment &amp; deterrent. 
---
We've moved on since those times too. How about playing the game as is considered acceptable by the vast majority now &amp; not how it was as release? You know, stop using the past as an excuse &amp; live in the present.
---
Just a suggestion.
---
Also the griefer crying victim for being "harassed" (your words, not mine) is especially tone-deaf.
---
I buy monthly on Xbox and it goes out on the 12th every month and usually with in two days I get them
---
Yes but doesn‚Äôt affect mutations. It removes them. I don‚Äôt have that issue lol. Rad x makes them not work but you still have them.
---
It‚Äôs a subjective change tho - for those who will ask - only you see the colour - everyone else sees green
---
Wow you‚Äôre greedy
---
Not true. 
---
Queen lands significantly more with players on flat ground.
---
You can also see she will take off within 5 seconds of targeting someone on a tent
---
Currently watching this ass clown construct his base on Whitesprings while also exploiting the spike strips trap.
---
He usually give me issues if I try to talk to him before he can spout his pre-converstation generic line. moving away or just looking away so the button prompt disappears works for me as well.
---
A large number of locked water purifiers makes me sad.  Like I get walking you're collecting and ammo stuff, but once you're above level 10 you've got as much purified water as you need.
---
Umm... It's called the social tab. Especially the section on the far left...
---
The more xp you earn the more times you can get the 10k xp challenge in a shorter time.  In the early stages you can really fly with score ranks
---
NW is the real world. Adventure is the simulation.
---
for me mine come on the 11th of every month. it just depends on the day of the month you registered for 1st (yes this means I get atoms on 9/11)
---
I got the game very late in the season and was able to complete two out of three was trying to reach that damn firefly lamp lol...no luck. 
---
When does season two start as I like the idea of being in from the jump.
---
The plans for plant the rest of the games Flora should be rewards from a vault raid with a vault with a seed bank it‚Äôs a shame we don‚Äôt have one of those. . .
---
Red Rocket power armor / PA station / jetpack.
---
They also showed a matte-black paint for the T-65 as well.
---
I concur. It has stopped me from a couple of bundles like I bought the flea flicker stash not really wanting the bundle and then was like naw I want them fences but nope no discount so I skipped it and they lost out on me spending cash.
---
They gave us a literal ammo printer. 
---
I don‚Äôt think planting cranberries is game breaking.
---
Hahah there's a guy who posted about this several hours ago, can't believe how right he was.
---
That jet will make you jittery
---
You're right.  That's what I get for trying to Reddit and work at the same time.  The Diluted doesn't affect mutations, though.
---
True
---
There's a repeatable weekly challenge that gives you score for every 10k xp earnt. So earning more xp = completing that challenge more often.
---
It also has the added benefit of making the Level up x1 and x3 challenges less tedious
---
The popular locations are on the resource nodes like lead or junk or acid, but in my experience you end up having to re-load worlds frequently to find a world where that spot isn't occupied.  
---
I personally like just going for a run looking for interesting pieces of landscape to build around.  A cool tree, a big rock outcrop or one of the sneaky caves hidden on the map.  Just about anyplace that Vintage Nukashine drops you off after a bender is both interesting and buildable, it turns out.
---
What do those things even do? Gotta look them up, have ten from the board.
---
5000 caps for a season lol maybe?
---
I'm actually just about to get rid of 2 of my 3 vendors, as nothing really sells even having mini nukes and fat man's at 20c and all ammo at 1c. So decided now to farm all my booze outfit aid and drugs to npc vendors now that way it empty my stash.
---
dr and er in general are not as important as you may think. you get severe diminishing returns past a certain point, and every PA except excavator has more than enough of both.
---
flat damage reduction is much, much more important. stuff like dodgy and emergency protocols. and PA gets an inherent damage reduction effect.
---
Homie trying to play on his Compaq Presario with IntelHD Integrated Graphics wasn't part of their test case scenarios.
---
Exactly why I'm not purchasing the contemporary bundle. I paid 500 atoms for the wood floors and 300 for very similar curtains. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
The game has the ability to put a time warning in the Legendary Run screen, they put a moving ship on a board I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve been hard to put a timer somewhere in there. 
---
In reference to the cheated feeling I felt cheated because everyone seemed to get to the Deathclaws before I could and I sadly couldn‚Äôt be on all the time since I have a kid wanting dad‚Äôs attention((which I have no problem with)) truthfully this won‚Äôt kill my day and it‚Äôs a problem that‚Äôs small compared to others, I really just had to be flashy for the sake of the auto mod since my auto deleted thread was just simply titled Legendary Run and was me just sad that there wasn‚Äôt a timer in that screen.
---
How do I acquire said ‚Äúnukashine‚Äù
---
I would've bought the contemporary house bundle last week (just wanted the foundations) if it weren't for already owning the wood floors.
---
The end date was listed in the main menu in game.
---
Among other things.....
---
Hanlon's Razor - never attribute to malice that you can attribute to stupidity.
---
I'm guessing it's less greedy Bethesda &amp; more incompetent/lazy Bethesda in this instance.
---
I just wanted my chicken coop... 4 spaces away!
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt post about math and SCORE totals required to finish in the beginning. Clearly this subreddit struggles with math. 
---
Math has never been my friend :(
---
It should be named "Filthy Casual' to honor the more intelligent sub whos appraoch to the game is to have fun
---
I would agree with you.
---
Agreed. And if you‚Äôre doing an event, switching to an event team at the last minute right before completing it helps a ton lmao
---
I would have finished but did not own the game until early August...just did the events that were available but the level up dailys and weeklies were much easier as well.
---
Honestly at this point it‚Äôs spoonful of ‚Äúmisplaced priorities‚Äù with a dash of ‚Äúblinding revenue greed‚Äù. 
---
It‚Äôs hard not to believe that people would **buy more** if it didn‚Äôt feel like such a **raw deal**. 
---
There should also be slight discounts for owning a repaint fwiw. Just because you made it red or black or whatever doesn‚Äôt justify the 15$ usd cost.
---
That still defeats the point.  In a perfect world, very few people would be at the cap because we‚Äôd have places to sink those caps. 
---
In a perfect world if someone came her to complain about the cap, people would respond ‚Äúwtf you holding onto your caps for?‚Äù
---
I was ahead of Zorbo‚Äôs ship by one space so while I was doing challenges for rank 100 he was on rank 98, that‚Äôs my main issue, and I didn‚Äôt spend the atoms for it because I thought I had a day of wiggle room for it since he was a space behind me.
---
Can‚Äôt wait till my watch explodes from the sheer heat of loading the scene
---
i meant level my fucking auto correct fucked me over
---
Now THAT is a fun question.  You can look for someone's camp that has a punch bowl in it. Dollars to donuts it's got Nukashine in it.
---
OR you can go to any train station and read the poster for the Frat Party and begin the path of the professional imbibist.
---
Yet another week of atomic shop disappointment.
---
I use the powered doors that slide down connected to a switch. That switch is also connected to another switch, so unless you know where both switches are and toggle them in order there's no way you're getting to my stores.
---
I was about to log on to buy a few with atoms to finish it today. I recently bought the game, played every day but despite the fact zorbo ain't at the last place, I can't spend atoms. Should have done it yesterday had I know but thought there'd be a way of making more score today as it is the last day.
---
Very strange. At least I have the atoms I suppose and will definitely finish next season with no struggle.
---
Yeah sadly I just never sat on the main menu, I knew if you just spam A you would load into a world so that‚Äôs what I did in my morning routine from my kitchen.
---
Does the damage reduction apply to the person with the mutation as well and does class freak reduce the extra damage taken penalty?
---
same here!
---
One thing I think this sub ignores a lot is **it is** possible to love the game and support it while also being highly critical of it.
---
They aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive
---
I've had queens on private servers where no tents and no fence and she acts that way.
---
Ive had queens on public where we are all on floating tents and she stays landed 
---
And then ive had ones where its a mix and sometimes she lands and stays sometimes she dont.
---
In my hundreds of queens in the last 2 years I've yet to see any pattern related to on or off fence/tent.
---
I suppose you still believe more players makes her harder to kill too...
---
A litteral timer add additional pressure to something people were already felt psychologically pressured to do. There are studies about this, because seeing a countdown in real time is extremely litteral.
---
That's why very few battle passes use them for game content. The Division 2 has no countdown timer, only a total amount of week (11). Red Dead Redemption 2 has no timer, but we were informed it ends on October 31st. 
---
Fallout76 is actually one of the few battle pass I know that used a disguised timer (Zorbo's ship).
---
Timers are a double-edged sword when it comes to games. Using a ship moving one day at the time was the best of both world.
---
So, again, Bethesda took a decision. It wasn't compatible with you. You wanted a timer, numerous people wouldn't have liked it. There is no perfect solution. That's why you should always stay informed by youself, to bypass the drawbacks and limitations of what a dev can achieve.
---
Nope, you weren't cheated. You blew it. You had lots of information at your disposal both in game and out of game. I even got an email from Bethesda on when things wrapped up.
---
So you had time &amp; the ability to look up Deathclaw spawns, but not when the season ended? Right.
---
Why didn't you go to Deathclaw island and server hop til you killed one? Either that or just spend the 150 atoms to finish. You coat yourself 350 atoms and some items.
---
Sorry dude, this is on you. Like other people said, you had options and chose none of them. Stop giving excuses and just admit you played yourself.
---
man I was in a nuclear winter match last night and one guy had has mic on the whole time, never said anything I guess it was just so we could hear the persistent beeping of his smoke detector going off in background every few seconds
---
The enclave would win they have an Almost endless army just make a lot of assultrons and sentry bots
---
Happens to me a lot at home and others have never had to server hop just fast travel to that same location it's free and just reloads...make sure to run away from where there may soon be an object appearing too.
---
Right. And then if it were a thing you would just have the same people complaining that they don't get a break between seasons and are being forced to log in every day to get rewards.
---
Fallout Mod organizer
---
So many upvotes for this.
---
Does the fireplace have a chimney at the top? Also, can you describe how high it goes? (looks like one and a half walls high from the picture, but I can't really tell).  
---
Thanks in advance!
---
The no mic emote is a good addition to the game, will definitely grab that.
---
nah I found out. Its fear of missing out
---
You're about 2 months too late but a lot of people agree with you.
---
Thing is unless Bethesda loses more money on the season pass that what they might theoretically with how things were done in the past, it's just not going to change.
---
When you fast travel and find yourself in front of a wooden box with small generators parked next to the vending machines and even though you know what's going to happen you still check the machines and see all of the level 15 non legendary weapons and armor.
---
They probably need to enter some extra coding. The problem is probably because it's technicly the bundle you buy and not the items. 
---
I mean the items in the bundle has no price, it's the bundle that has a price. Bethesda need to give a value to each items in the bundle. 
---
( Ex: If you buy your table outside a bundle it worths X,  but if you get it from a bundle, this table actually worths X now. )
---
Without this the system can't do the math...
---
It is more profitable to buy a bundle than all these items one by one. So basically Bethesda needs to give a new value to items in a bundle so the system can dot he maths. This what i mean...this is what i think.
---
I think he was refering to the BoS in general as we see them in Fallout 1 and forward. In 76 I recall Maxson does seem to insist Taggardy focus on BoS goals of gather Technology over helping Appalachia in one of the audio logs. In the fandom there is a concern with Bethesda dropping the political nuance the BoS added by not being heros of the Wasteland. I enjoyed Lyon's approach and how the D.C. Brotherhood was borderline excommunicated over it and felt it was an interesting design and a ressurection of sorts for a faction that on the West Coast was dying. Fallout 4 actually had the Eastern BoS return to a more classic ideology just with less isolationism and instead aggression, though 4's radical endings leaves me wondering what, if any, canon ending Bethesda will take from the game.
---
Do we know if it works in PvP? Do we now have a counter to the Tesla spam?
---
Oh my god its the REAL SINSEER OWO UWU OWO
---
I know but it also means fallout mod organizer xD
---
Really? I hope so, because at some moment I hated having to play every day for some hours, I prefer playing more hours just weekends when I have more free time.
---
Cool. Bethesda doesn't want us to play for a week. That's on them.
---
The rewards for Season 2 are so poor wtf, ugh there‚Äôs not much motivation to do this one tbh
---
anything for ez upboats i guess
---
I just wanted the normal brown railroad outfit or maybe a black version... No instead we‚Äôre getting the outfit with all these weird colors instead.
---
Where is this camp lol?
---
Hi, so I had put it in the log cabin but it looked like it‚Äôs only one wall high so should go from wall to ceiling though I did not test it. It does not have a chimney so it looks like there is no smoke like the modern fireplace. If you want I can jump on later and see to make sure
---
Unfortunately there is a still active bug that will erase all ability to progress so *some* people get shifted into that.
---
If Bethesda properly addresses this I‚Äôd have a different outlook but their indifference is both telling and damning and shouldn‚Äôt be excused or overlooked. 
---
If you didn‚Äôt have this happen to you - congrats but for those who got fucked over it‚Äôs best to show a tiny bit of compassion for something they in a lot of cases couldn‚Äôt control.
---
Yeah, I wanted to do the same thing with my last two but then I chickened out and claimed them over the weekend. Too big a risk. Of course right after that I lost a lot of scrip turning weapons in at the machine because I went over the cap.
---
His ship updated at 12:00 EST again there was a timer. So yesterday morning he would have been on 98 at noon he was on 99 and today at noon he was done. Had you played this morning early you would have finished. You would have also seen he was on 99 and huis gauge slowly filling up.   
---
So again literally your fault no one elses the only person that cheated you was you. You need to settle into that fact this was your fuck up and move on. All you are doing right now is showing how ignorant you are and this level of stubborn makes you look stupid.  You lacked the spatial awareness needed along with the lack of common sense.
---
Yeah I think I‚Äôll be having a light week and saving my atoms. This week feels like a dare to spend them, lol.
---
oh. well this is r/fo76 which is for a game that has no mods no I don't know why they'd be talking about mods
---
Surprised that Bethesda noticed that almost no one was making building teams for actually building stuff.
---
It is very infrequent, not as infrequent as new hairdos and stuff, but I do see new ones every so often.
---
Oh, so it's Tuesday again?
---
The source I pulled from didn‚Äôt test pvp.
---
If I had a guess - possibly? But I wouldn‚Äôt call it a counter. The heal is good, but I‚Äôm not sure if it can handle a full auto Tesla rifle.
---
And if it‚Äôs a legacy, then I have no idea if it even works.
---
Well the thing about Zorbo‚Äôs ship being a timer is that it was inaccurate since I was a space ahead of it and right now it‚Äôs parallel to my ship so it‚Äôs on space 99 and that‚Äôs why I felt like I had wiggle room.
---
There is a third option, just not buy anything. Which is what I will be doing, til they properly fix stuff, like the challenges that don't properly track.
---
You are complaining about the precomplaints of the complaints. 
---
üé∂üé∂Circle of life
---
I usually try to ft to a nearby icon, recently though it hasn't been an issue, a lot of ppl tend to build up, or build small.
---
Not being able to understand someones accent doesnt mean someone has a problem, or are you going to tell me you can fully understand a really thick glaswegian, scouse or irish accent?
---
I know.  Was making a joke xD
---
Keep some popcorn handy. If One Wasteland launches next week the entire thing is going to burn down.
---
Statistically the best weapon in the game is a toss up between a B2525 Fixer and Handmade, I personally prefer the handmade due to 556 being easier to craft. I'm not considering magic or hacked weapons.
---
Yeah... still like its made out of scrap metal and a prayer
---
Yeah I just run the perk in luck that makes sure you never lose mutations.
---
ah ok. its very hard to tell sometimes.
---
Might be the guy who commented above that every plan he sells is five caps lol.
---
Wouldn't charge more than 50-100c. It's a bit uncommon but is mostly needed by novice players who can't afford to spend a lot.
---
That‚Äôs because it is one.
---
Yeah, but just 100 score each 10k XP, which is too damn low score. :(
---
That's not possible. He moves at the same pace. He doesn't jump from 98 to 100. I saw him at 99 the other day. Even if you ignored all other warnings, and only look at the Legendary Run page, you can clearly see his fuel gauge. If it's full, he's going to move.
---
Jesus Fucking Christ are you serious?  It's one week off in between two seasons worth of FREE SHIT they've been giving you.
---
How can people seriously be THIS entitled?
---
Good on ya, bro. Glad you can sustain. Sometimes it's not a bullet that kills you. It's the gamma gun and tesla rifle that instagibs you before you even know he fired. Your anecdotal evidence is not conducive to proper gameplay in an unbalanced ecosystem.
---
Mine either. It‚Äôs my El Guapo
---
&gt;Edit: thanks all, no reason to log in for another week, then :)
---
what is ballistic bock?
---
TL;DR
---
F*ck Bethesda for taking away free atoms and not giving them back while off season.
---
Bottom Text.
---
the new bundle is overpriced but i hope the fireplace can snap to walls
---
The 15th
---
**People are allowed to critique Bethesda‚Äôs decisions.**
---
I don‚Äôt understand why you are going to bat for how much of a bugged out heartless grind the last season was?
---
People want the game to integrate easier with their lives a bit more so time spent is more enjoyable then less.  **That‚Äôs not too much to ask**
---
Are you getting paid to lobby for their less then great decisions lol? 
---
If so sign me up pls and I‚Äôll join you.
---
Try moving your camp?
---
Like I said, the finish line is the 100th slot itself, it's the "end area", what determine the race's end. Zorbo has been on the 99th slot since yesterday.
---
Following your logic, Zorbo's ship would have spent a day (today) on the 'end area' *past* the finish line and the "game/race" would have ended *after*.
---
It doesn't make sense.
---
A race ends as soon as someone reach the ends and technically Zorbo reached the 100th slot today, thus ending the race.
---
Did you scrap your ally?
---
You don't have an ammunition factory by any chance? (The glitched one.)
---
Not if you used the cheated ammo factory.
---
What subscription fee are you paying?  If F1 that's entirely your choice.  If it's anything else, that's not Bethesda's fault.  You might as well complain you have to pay your ISP for internet to play the game too.  Or the electrical company for needing power to run your console.  Or the rent for having to have a place to live to play the game.
---
I like this post except number 7. If you took off two weeks and still finished a week early, thats only three weeks of a breather over a several month period. I play D2 as well and you can get fully leveled seasonal exp in significantly less time than that.
---
The FOMO is real and it is clearly intentional.
---
The door is honestly lamer than it looks. I was pretty disappointed with it.
---
The BoS games, Tactics, and Van Burren had some interesting ideas or bits of world building that are more than salvageable, it's just a matter of if any are worth using.
---
Me too, newish player (lvl 47), but grinded to get that raider tree and got the Halloween venders and the gravestone loot bag...now just sitting here with my skull mask and civil war outfit on...waiting lol.
---
I'm advocating for change. I didn't make a post. We have to be better than them. Do not stoop to their level.
---
Sounds like acid? Edit: wait I drank out of a bowl once and saw colors and fast travelled somewhere without doing anything and discovered ‚Äúcranberry bog‚Äù is that nukashine?
---
Your comment is full of truth! üëå
---
Only information in game was a square on the top right of the menu, I never sat on the menu due to my daily routine, nor did I have much time to grind so I got as much done as I could with my only challenge left being the Deathclaw one.
---
I did look up spawns but it‚Äôs apparent that others did too, I even built my base on a spawn zone but another user is telling me that killed the spawn for me which I had no idea it would do that.
---
Zorbo‚Äôs ship was one space behind me so I thought I had wiggle room apparently he finishes in spot 99?
---
I posted that because in the beginning this subreddit beat the crap out of each other over math.  I wasn‚Äôt stating there wasn‚Äôt enough dailies, just that folks hate math and will yell at each other endlessly
---
There is no current fix for ghost budget until a new budget glitch is found. I suspect a new one within the month.
---
The season dailies have been such an unfun experience that it felt soooo good not logging into Fallout for weeks when I finished it.
---
Once you are linked/bound to the public team (you'll see blue bars above your team mate's names in the bottom left), then you reap the benefits as you go along. 
---
The public team that gives you bonus INT will affect the amount xp you earn for anything you do. The public team that awards bonus xp for events only gets those benefits for events, not random encounters, or crafting, etc.
---
Yes, the post you link to is clear. However, it's a post on the Fallout 76 General Discussion board. It may have been posted by Bethesda in a community update, but I think judging by the volume of replies to my post that were assumption and guesses, Bethesda did a poor job of communicating this message.
---
Zorbo is on spot 99 for me right now he was on spot 98 yesterday I am looking at the screen as I‚Äôm typing this and he‚Äôs still on spot 99.
---
Is that why they never sell it anymore?
---
They‚Äôve had it for sale normally before right?
---
Building teams are being replaced by Daily Ops teams which becomes a 100% boost to Daily Ops xp with a full group of 4.
---
That better be why
---
Supposed to be the 15th.
---
There was supposed to be a ‚Äúfew weeks‚Äù between seasons now it‚Äôs a week.  Not sure if that‚Äôs a good sign (they made a lot of money and want to make more) or bad (they didn‚Äôt meet money expectations and want to squeeze people for more money faster).
---
If you used the glitched ammo factory then you‚Äôll have leftover budget that you‚Äôre unable to get rid of. If this is the case you deserve no help or answers and don‚Äôt deserve any sympathy for any actions in your life.
---
If not idk
---
I really only like the door because you can double up on doors with it.  That way if someone picks your lock. Bam immediately facing another locked door.
---
I'm waiting on the bug zapper, mannequins and weapon stands.
---
radium rifles
---
Tuesday, 12 EST once per week. Although they have some time limited sales occasionally, but I've always just ignored those.
---
Radium rifles
---
Yeah, i doubt it could withstand a legacy - but even if it helps a bit I‚Äôll take it.
---
Not an extra way, but a ways for extra. 
---
 If you donate the vacuum tubes to wren or stolen property to ward you get more reputation.
---
Using a charisma check during Retirement plan, you can send the former raider to Foundation and get settler reputation without losing raider reputation (can still lie to Roxy and complete the quest for raider rep). 
---
If you kill the former raider and tell Roxy "Appalachia has a new corpse", you get extra raider rep.
---
If you have hit allied status with foundation, you can use a charisma check to sell the stolen property to the raiders for raider reputation without losing foundation rep (if you haven't hit allied with foundation yet, you will lose foundation reputation)
---
Makes sense, any idea who usually has them?
---
What are you talking about all 3 seasons? They‚Äôre not gonna just stop the seasons because there‚Äôs only 3 on the roadmap
---
Yea altogether with another milion bugs that are pi..ing me like my gauss pistol keeps missing first shot in vats. Imagina that frustration u have to hold button several seconds to charge, then miss at 95... fix game damn!
---
&gt; Edit: thanks all, no reason to log in for another week, then :) 
---
If the only reason you play this game is to do the challenges and then leave and you otherwise don't even have a reason to play... then you should probably reassess why you're even playing at all at this point.  Because it sounds more like you consider the game a chore or obligation at this point rather than as something you just play for fun.
---
was that something Bethesda said, or just what people were guessing?
---
Demanding free money is absurd.
---
Makes sense, any idea what type of enemy carries them?
---
This game is basically the entrance exam for Laughing Coffin
---
I'm pretty excited for it! 
---
Every update brings something to its knees in this game!
---
I mean, if missiles weighed the same as other ammo, I‚Äôd be more likely to use one. I mean they suck and their dpi is crap for some reason. I loved the missile launchers and fat mans in fo4 but they‚Äôre garbage in 76 for some dumb reason.
---
I imagine we would have a 4th season... and a 5th season... and a 6th... they‚Äôve only released 2020 roadmap
---
But I do agree with you about atoms between seasons.
---
Are you sure?
---
I swear he‚Äôs on 99 and was on 98 yesterday I actually would look every day at the screen and I even took a Xbox DVR of the BP screen, is it possible that my Run screen is bugged because I ensure you I kept track of his position in the BP religiously.
---
Thanks.
---
Oh look more limited time stuff to make us all rush to buy it. Seriously though, is anything not time limited anymore? The only thing worth getting in the Sloccums bundle is the vendor robot because they look cool
---
The enclave was a bit like the free states except they only broke away after the war and the enclave has Their own secret service
---
You can probably see an outline of it sizewise in build mode without having to buy it
---
That's part for the course for Bethesda. The American Assault rifle in Fallout 3, looks very similar to a G3, and in the game files it's labeled as "G3AssaultRifle"
---
Fair enough. Will drop refractor for fire proof.
---
Edit: Glow sight, not fire proof.
---
Yeah if you grind your ass off on double XP weekend, you can get 2 weeks worth easily.
---
Also, the XP weekly was replaced with the Complete public events weekly on pts, and values were changed.
---
Don't expect S1 tactics to work on S2
---
They said this was the way it would be before Season 1 even started. And yet, people are still surprised somehow.
---
&gt;6. Don‚Äôt buy into the bitch threads about ‚Äúthe grind‚Äù. Just do the dailies and a couple weekly‚Äôs a day. I was never on longer than an hour total each day.
---
With you on most of this but what you just said IS the grind. The feeling you need to login daily to keep up.
---
A lot of people got burned out due to the pressure of playing daily for the sole reason of completing the dailies &amp; not just playing the game because they want to. I wouldn't diminish that if I were you.
---
There was also the fuel gauge on the legendary run screen. The in game information was in multiple places. The end date was given when the run started. It's been on reddit thousands of times. People even posted over and over a guide where you could see if you would finish on time. Any point in the last 10 weeks you could have found this information both in game and out of game.
---
Stop making excuses.
---
Well, I finally got this sorted by having a mostly above ground base. Also, some of my frustrations were because I hadn't realized that my second floor was composed of flat roof pieces, rather than actual floor pieces. But that said, what's gettin to me now is the damned limits.. I just got told I couldn't place one of my bobbleheads cuz it exceeds the camp's "budget" .. 
---
The fact that there's such a seemingly steep limitation on how many items I can place in my camp to begin with is one thing, but why do little tiny bobblehead dolls on a specific bobblehead stand, count towards that limit..?
---
It's an uncommon drop. Like criolators, flamers, lmgs...
---
Ah right
---
Deathclaw island...
---
According to scattlebutt it is.
---
&gt;  he was on spot 98 yesterday
---
He wasn't. At noon EST yesterday he moved to 99 and today technically the season ended the minute *he should have reached 100*, so noon EST. 
---
I don't know at what time you play or when you last checked yesterday but factually he was on 99 yesterday PM EST.
---
You are in a situation where for some reasons you ignored/avoided/missed all cues, informations, newsletters about this, which brings me back to the fact that a game design is never perfect. They can't cover everything for everyone.
---
Even if they added a big flashy timer, a big red and yellow arrow on the main menu, sent notifications every hours about this, you would still have one user missing everything and complaining about this.
---
So allow me to repeat:
---
&gt; That's why you should always stay informed by youself, to bypass the drawbacks and limitations of what a dev can achieve.
---
Theyre just another 76 brainlet. Move along, sir
---
With the radiums...most people usually just craft a shit ton of them themselves and then scrap them to learn the mods
---
 Not quite, but I fast traveled to a camp near Whitespring a while back when I was playing the game, and got destroyed by a random Sentry Bot encounter after taking a few steps away from the camp.
---
Screwing over your player base this much is what‚Äôs absurd.
---
When you find a magic weapon every perk becomes obsolete üòÇ
---
I can see dropping adrenaline to 1. However tenderizer at 3 seems a waste. 5% to 7%. The only thing good about it is going from 5seconds to 15 seconds. But I dont usually wait more than half a second before I fire off another shot.
---
Gauss Shotgun. Unlike most weapons mentioned in this thread they require high tier legendary effects to be as good as they are. Gauss Shotgun has built in explosive rounds, access to a perforating magazine (40% armor pen) and always comes legendary. You only need a single star to match your build style and it always hits like a bus. And it's deceptively accurate with high range for a shotgun.
---
[It does though.](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76)
---
Check out [this site](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/04/14/fallout-76-perk-cards-all-the-perks-how-to-upgrade-them/) , it lists all perks.  I do a ton of scavenging and my favorites are Pack Rat (reduces junk weight), Strong Back (increases carry weight), and Hard Bargain (better selling prices at vendor).
---
Thats Mister to you sir
---
\[Suggestion\] Don't be a condescending ass when you post, especially when Bethesda played with the numbers big time to help players complete the season. Also, don't direct players to change their play style to BUFF ALL THE STUFFS for XP when the point of the revamped challenge system was to allow players to play more naturally.
---
I don't agree with number 3 lol. I see no issue if people want to spend atoms. I will be purchasing all 100 levels on day 1 this time.
---
Sept 15th. Also the firefly lamp is underwhelming if you ask me. Hardly makes light. I was excited for it too.
---
The perk card when you can eat ghouls, scorched, super mutants and humans. It seems gross but it really saves on carry weight and having to lug dog food and soup around.
---
I'm not making it I'm only new started 5days now and have the first line of prizes! At least I'm further than the new players, as if I started today I'd have none
---
Yeah, but they‚Äôre *extremely* quick with the ban hammer and they don‚Äôt give you a reason either. I suspect it‚Äôs because I said my encounter with this guy called Sinseer wasn‚Äôt a bad one and asked why everyone hates him.
---
Ironclad is always a waste of time.
---
I feel for you but this is a Bethesda problem to solve. Same with launch nukes.
---
I was just wondering because i had a perk point left and i hate constantly repairing my armor. Not a big deal though. I like luck of the draw since im told the Flamer is notoriously bad at maintaining durability. Not too worried about my PA.
---
I'd rather see them fix up the game mode before they add more buggy broken content. The hacking, load in times, lag and overpowered explosives ruin the game.
---
I tried so many differnt ways. Enter vats charged and uncharged. Charging once I vats. Starting vats at 95% range. Even using a 33% accuracy I couldn't seem to get it. I would say maybe 1/6 would land at 95%. That second shot is early access to night night tho.
---
Sadly, we all know it's going to happen anyway. Let's see the joker is this time who says you need to buy 10 ranks and grind every single daily to make it in time. And can't wait for the threads about how evil bethesda is forcing them to play NW for daring to have 1 out of x challenges be a NW one
---
canible? I cant spell
---
Just filler between seasons I guess.
---
Oof I sold one for 10k to someone he took a hard l.
---
Especially with daily login expectations. I get designing it around 2 days a week, but this one is based on 6 days if you ignore the repeatable weekly (which is a boost, like spending atoms)
---
Of course you don't mention killing Wendigo for their teeth to scrap for acid.
---
I feel like ive heard that name before
---
Ahhh yep it appears I overlooked those items.
---
Sometimes I think about burning this camp down
---
I use Gun-Fu, Adrenaline, and Enforcer with my shotty build. I just aim for the head and they die in one shot. I try to clear the Wendigos for the people burning down Earle.
---
I think meat week round 2 as reality is based on if we got a certain amount of glass I think, donated to the atlas observatory. Project3501 is implying it won't happen because project, and likely many others won't be playing for a week until season 2 drops because there aren't many immediate objectives to tackle. Leading to the absence of players that are the ones needed to donate glass to get that second meat week.
---
Serendipity is a must, blocker is optional but nice. The points for Ironclad are probably better spent elsewhere.
---
Edit: Lone wanderer is a must as well, unless you're in a group in which case you'll probably want Inspirational and Strange In Numbers.
---
All BOS rewards were scheduled. We would have gotten all of them even if nobody participated
---
is that allowed?
---
I'm pretty sure he was 99 yesterday, today at noon he hit 100. Noon is the rest time. If I Google "Fo76 legendary run end date" it tells me the end date in big letters as the 1st result.
---
There are no excuses why you missed this.
---
It‚Äôs always a crapshoot
---
The energy ammo reduced weight perk Batteries Included is a good one if you carry that type of ammo.
---
i have all of those but ill check out the link
---
You know, you can finish the entire season only doing the xp one. If you do this, you can play normally and not have to worry about challenges and playing every day. Check out Angry Turtle's video to see how to maximize you xp output. 
---
But a quick summary:
---
Sleep in your camp for well rested.
---
Eat canned meat stew from Feed The People event
---
Use lunchboxes at big xp events. If you use one in a crowd its very likely others will use one as well, never use 4 of yours at once.
---
Any Intelligence buff gives you extra xp. Berry mentats are useful and you can check the video for other good sources.
---
A personal tip: use an automatic tesla rifle to tag enemies in horde events to tag many enemies quickly and you wont kill em so others can get xp as well.
---
If you check my reddit history I don‚Äôt use this website at all and if I do it‚Äôs very brief, there‚Äôs only one spot in game where it‚Äôs says when it‚Äôs ending ((from what other users told me)) and it‚Äôs in the main menu in the corner, I don‚Äôt check reddit when stuff happens I‚Äôm still unsure what the heck ATLAS is.
---
Not making excuses just telling you what happened.
---
Yup
---
Yeah that's all on him. It's for sale by Modus and you can find them in medicine cabinets.
---
One. The best one, Serendipity. 
---
I run FireProof or Admantium Skeleton on occasion, depending on the situation, or what gun I'm using.
---
Well this is depressing. Finally some good fucking content...
---
What does the original casual team become?
---
Same here
---
Is it on its default setting then?
---
Try selecting one and see if you can then change it to the BoS routine.
---
radium rifle mods are bugged just so you know. the chance of learning them by scrapping is a fraction of what it should be.
---
the odds are more in line with armor mods.
---
Oh, yeah we'll get it regardless of donations.
---
Yeah or have that be the lvl 100 battle pass prize for that season 3
---
You are over nine nine nine nine point nine nine hours late for your shift. A tardiness infraction has been added to your record.
---
I just want to admit my wrongs to all of you. 
---
I was one of those skeptical-bad‚Äômath-guys before season 1. 
---
And even I made it to level 100, 2 days before the end and skipping 2 full weeks as well. 
---
So yeah. OP is totally right on this one!
---
I sure have learnt that patience is key. 
---
Hope this counts as living proof for y‚Äôall.
---
Make sure you spend lots of time in workshops. The "Junk Shield" perk is OP. carry lots of junk to maximize the armor boost
---
Is it strength? because if so. i have no more strength points available
---
Point too
---
I could handle two pylons... Would rather not tho. Lol
---
You ARE making excuses. Otherwise, you wouldn't be on here incorrectly stating you were "cheated." 
---
You said you use reddit one a month. This has been going on for 10 weeks!!! That's more than a month.
---
The information is everywhere. 2 minutes would easily give you the information necessary to know when the event ended.
---
Lol just wait till things start vanishing from your camp whilst still taking up budget..
---
You're mistaken, they only promised that there will be no Pay 2 Win
---
&gt;Also looking forward to the Atom Shop update and to finally have an answer to the question "what does a non-season challenge system look like?"
---
Same as a bye in sports - a game that you don't have to play for a week.
---
And it'll go even further with more xp from higher level mobs. 812xp from a lvl100 super mutant is no joke, that season's gonna be a breeze with higher xp gains!
---
This one is under Intelligence which is awesome cuz my strength is also maxed out
---
Rewards are hot garbage anyway lol
---
I guarantee you that on my BP he was on that weird looking Captain Cosmos suit thing yesterday which is spot 98 right now he‚Äôs right next to me on the Fireplace, and I didn‚Äôt google because I thought his ship reaching the end would end the event not spot 99
---
Ive switched its routines like 6 times
---
ironclad is a waste 99% of the time. evasive really depends on the rest of your build. I usually run the rest maxed in all of my builds.
---
ok well doesn't really mater because i either use unarmed or ballistic with a side of bloodied gattling plasma
---
Not a waste but there's no place for all.
---
I use only serendipity, nerd rage and blocker.
---
I've stopped used lone wanderer in favor of public groups - to use combination of herd mentality, empath and strange in numbers.
---
Recently removed fireproof from endurance, use asbestos lining on SS armor instead.
---
No such thing. There are a group of weapons that are good for differing reasons.
---
There is absolutely no way they could give atoms between seasons unless they dropped the daily to like 1-2 atoms and like 5 for weeklies. Giving a decent number of atoms in the lull would just draw too much attention to how few free atoms you can get during the actual seasons.
---
Thanks a lot
---
I still don't get why they couldn't push the season just one week.... i wont be playing this week cuz there's really no point to do so with no weeklies or dailies
---
I can see the headlines now.where are my rewards?what do you mean claim them?
---
They arent screwing us with atom challenges. They are screwing us with bugs and broken stuff. They need to fix the game. But giving us all free currency isn't helping that.
---
My advice? Scrip it.
---
You'll go through, literally, thousands of screws and nuclear material, to even come close to unlocking all of the mods. It's gotten somewhat easier to farm screws with the ACP event, but it's still a punishing farm/craft/scrap cycle.
---
Mine doesn‚Äôt have a bos routine. Just regular scrap or junk options. What is it supposed to collect?
---
Last time was SS/T-65 set I believe. And the next one will be Chicken Coop/Ammo Converter in a week
---
Personally I'm kind of glad for the break.  It will be nice for a few weeks to focus on what I want to do rather than what they're telling me I need to do.
---
Seen someone spamming SBQ with a fat man once. Poor sod.
---
It still is an additional 8% xp, which gets further multiplied by double-xp and lunchbox bonuses. (at least I remember it this way from the xp numbers I used to get during S1)
---
Freedom.
---
PC and PS4. It‚Äôs amazing how much smoother it is on PC
---
Last time I used reddit was to check the Rocket Arena subreddit, Fallout 76 isn‚Äôt the only game I play, I don‚Äôt automatically jump on google when I‚Äôm unsure of something in game and I didn‚Äôt think I was unsure of the event ending since Zorbo‚Äôs ship was going along on a daily pace and I was playing catch up with it
---
Oof
---
It's  disingenuous to complain about the math done in the begining of the previous event for days needed to complete the event. It's that math that caused the amount of dailies to be increased to make the event faster to complete due to the public outcry. If the math wasn't done and no one complained, a lot of the points in this post would be points.
---
Lol, yea like how they scarped the 150 mil concrete down to 15 mil and suddenly that became reality to get whatever reward came with that.
---
Bravo sir Bravo üëèüèæ
---
You missed out. It's your fault, no one else's. Why you can't see that is amazing. You had every chance to see the info, but chose not to. You went to bed last night without spending the 150 atoms because you couldn't find a deathclaw.
---
I know right? It‚Äôs not like a week of free atoms between seasons will bankrupt them.
---
Got it. Thank you!!
---
If you scour the entire whitesprings you will end up with about 70 pre war food.
---
I think you'll find that there are thousands of 'top 10 requests' if you speak to enough people.
---
I‚Äôm level 431 and still only know 27 mods. Best bet is to request a courier or high karma person to mod it for you if you want to use it
---
[I‚Äôve noticed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ioxxaw/seriously_bethesda_youre_just_gonna_take_away/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Huh, so each int. is 2% bonus XP?
---
I honestly don't care if it's on sale, I would purchase for full price, I just want the damn thing.
---
As it stands, I'm not even allowed to buy it.
---
Store/scrap everything, and move your base several times. 
---
If you had questionable items in your base, you'll need to move at least once for each ghosted item, ie; 10 ghosted items taking space = at least 10 moves.
---
My query is why the fuck is there a train car in with that stuff? It‚Äôs so fucking cuntish
---
planning on skipping the start of Season 2?
---
Not without buying them, since Beth decided we dont need that. They also admitted they were giving you less atoms on the board than you would of gotten with the same amount of challenges without the legendary run.
---
He just comments every so often," So, you people *Live* with these muties? Disgusting..." or "Why keep that *mutie cow* in your territory? And now its licking me...."
---
Wait until Wastelanders drops and check it out before making any drastic changes.
---
You know what, I think Bethesda should put all that brotherhood shit back in the store. Why they thought they needed to time gate the rewards is beyond me.
---
But its just another nail in their coffin. It does make a difference.
---
oh doesn't it show a little speaker and X icon if you don't have mic? I hope people haven't been trying to talk to me cause I just have everyone muted. Not sure what is seen by other people.
---
If you have the plans for them, craft them. And scrap them. If not ask somebody if they‚Äôd be willing to craft some if you paid them. 
---
If not, occasionally when you go to blood eagle camps, in the high level areas, I‚Äôve found one of them using the weapon and dropping it from time to time.
---
Though my stance may come across as somewhat blunt and unsympathetic is not without some merit. I would far rather provide players with the tools and examples to encourage them to look at things more pragmatically. We know this game is broken in many respects, we know that Bethesda doesn't have the best track record fixing what is broken. And yet there is still much to celebrate and enjoy in this game, it really comes down to individual perspectives. For all their ills, Bethesda have done a sterling job at trying to make this game something for everybody, it's in their economic interests to do so, but that I suspect is why the game is so broken, they're spreading themselves a little too thin. It's simply not possible to please everybody and I cannot stomach this sense of entitlement I'm getting from a segment of the player base and I'm going to challenge that... can't help myself.
---
Radium rifles are one of the reasons I still farm materials. Building them takes a little bit of everything and the drop rate for learning plans sucks.i scrapped a couple hundred and some times I get a unlock sometimes I dont.i probably have about 15 mods at the most still need that silencer
---
From my experiences raiding other peoples' collectrons ive seen ballistic fibres and ultracite scrap
---
This is my confusion - I don‚Äôt understand why there‚Äôs so many people defending the general timeline of this release. The only reason people like us are criticising whilst still being long-term players is because we love the franchise **so fucking much** we don‚Äôt want it to be ruined. This game coulda been so big and so impressive, and it‚Äôs just a flop in most people‚Äôs eyes.
---
I‚Äôve noticed this bug a lot lately. Seems to happen when I use a stimpack while reloading. Once reloading completes my weapon auto fires. All you need to do is hit the fire button but still, it‚Äôs pretty annoying.
---
Well this is a lost cause.
---
I don't follow. To my mind it is simply shorthand to describe a glitch. Don't see how it is "easy hype" or "perpetuating a poor understanding of how the game works". No one knows how it works - even Todd says "it just works". It sounds like you are offended at religious faith (I am not keen on it either) but why we should call it a a "furious glitch" instead is beyond me. In fact it is not a "furious" prefix. If you have a precise explanation, please give it. And if you are not upset don't use all caps.
---
Serendipity, blocker, nerd rage &amp; situationally fireproof. The rest are garbage. Lone wanderer is no longer meta. Team perks like strange in numbers or inspirational are it's replacement.
---
Oh thanks for gatekeeping how and why I play.
---
What‚Äôs an ACP Event? I‚Äôm kinda new
---
It was better when the dailies gave atoms and you could buy what you wanted. I didn't feel forced to do every daily and skipped annoying ones. And I could actually spent atoms on stuff I wanted badly enough when it came around. Now it feels more forced for less reward cuz I have no interest in 95% of the items. So I gotta swim through tons of trash for 2-3 items I want instead of just getting atoms and making the choice myself. 
---
Essentially that raises the price of a single virtual item to like 40-50+ dollars if you just wanted that one item and payed up to it cuz you don't have time to do chores daily. Which is a price people are actually paying too that I've seen for my self enough times, sadly, which means it's probably not going away cuz they're not gonna feel bad about ripping people off like most AAA companies nowadays. Battle Passes are the new loot boxes and everyone wants to jump on board with those too.
---
Bethesda was really into selling us bundle only items (they still do but not as often as before cuz of complaints) which made you have to buy a buncha stuff you don't want for the item you do want so this is a super-version of that. 
---
With Fallout 1st making billions of dollars a day, I don't see why they need this scummy monetized jerkaround system on top of it.
---
Did you seriously compare someone's actions in a video to real life physical violence? 
---
You need some philological help. 
---
Also you consider me a "griefer" when you don't have any idea what type of play style I had. 
---
I enjoy pvp, just because me and a group of friends would destroy our own camps or others to get bounties doesn't mean I would intentionally try to ruin someone else's experience with the game. 
---
We wouldn't single people out to mess with it was just harmless fun in a video game. 
---
Also at the time the only way to PvP as survival and nuclear winter weren't apart of the game yet. 
---
But again man just a suggestion. 
---
Get a life.
---
Right, you didn't think. That's why you lost out. The information is everywhere. It's your fault you chose not to heed it or even look at it.
---
I get on at 7 AM and from what I‚Äôve noticed the new dailies happen on 9 AM when I got on today he was on 98, and right now he‚Äôs on 99 for me, I‚Äôve got no reason to lie about this.
---
I‚Äôm not signed up to the Bethesda newsletter and I don‚Äôt look at reddit threads for fun I just put on YouTube while doing work and the occasional Instagram on my breaks that‚Äôs the extent of my social media interaction.
---
herp derp - I guess I just get a week.  But what a glorious week it shall be.
---
So basically what you are saying is you want to play in a wasteland "survival game" but you want absolutely no threats to you at all... Anyways thanks for farming us some junk ü§£
---
I would have enjoyed the break too if I hadn‚Äôt been on break for a month now and sorely lacking atoms... I finished the run awhile ago because of Double XP. If the settler and raider dailies weren‚Äôt there I‚Äôd have no reason to log on daily.
---
Hi, thanks for the info. How and where do you buy ranks?
---
I'm only really excited for Ammo Factory. Thats my number 1. Using a mini gun about to get alot more fun.
---
true that
---
I still don‚Äôt know why we‚Äôre rewarded plans we already know for events ü•∂ can‚Äôt the game automatically discard those in the rng?
---
Wait, does your intelligence special stat affect your EXP gain?
---
Yeah even despite the grind not being AS bad as originally thought, its still tedious and boring and does require playing almost every day. This game does not have enough content to justify a system like this. There is not enough to do to stay engaged for even an hour or two a day. I got to rank 20 or so and just stopped, I havent played in months and I just dont see a reason to bother with season 2 either. I am not going to log in just to pick up some wood, do the same handful of events a few times and log off. It is not engaging or fun. The game desperately needs new high level content.
---
When‚Äôs it out? I know the current one is about to finish does it start straight away?
---
Almost every time but is not because I don't think they're selling anything good it's more like Oh how amazing another Box
---
Could try teleporting to them and using the join my team emote.
---
This wouldn't help for nuclear winter though.
---
So several respondents have said the same.  Why is Iron clad a waste of time?  is it just diminishing returns or is it broken.  Also thank you for your feed back
---
is it broken or just not needed?
---
Well yeah, of course not without buying them.
---
I meant you can buy them lol
---
It should be on the shop for everyone to get for a week at least. And anyone who physically donates should have it just put on their account. Anything else is Bethesda  wanting you to just log in for their own stats.
---
When does the new season start?
---
Pick a different "it use to be acceptable to do this" analogy if it makes you feel more comfortable. Slavery, prima nocta; whatever tickles your fancy.
---
Also bitch please with the false outrage.
---
How many times is this gonna be posted? Jfc
---
So, there is an acid node south of Wavy Willard's. Set your camp there with an elevated missile turret facing north.  You will generate acid from the extractor, and harvesting the Yao Guai (and odd snallygaster) that come visiting.  
---
Just to the west is Hemlock Holes workshop, with three acid nodes.  Put extractors on each of them every time you log in.
---
Pull the teeth from every wendigo you can in ACP.
---
Best I did was something like 350 acid in a session, from doing nothing more than checking extractors and looting corpses.
---
I‚Äôm tired of camp hopping trying to shop for stuff. I find it easier just to grind for it
---
I can't wait for more spooky shit
---
It makes sense for them to wait with huge items like mannequins until patch drop though. Shareholders will see a player/income increase on patch days, which will further interest in patch development
---
He‚Äôs not asking them to defend their reasoning. Just curious about their line of thinking.  It‚Äôs not utterly meaningless, you could use this response for most of the post on Reddit. Its called a discussion you anti social robot.
---
Don't worry. Bethesda's got you covered.
---
I'd like a thank you kindly but no thank you emote. It would be great for when I'm leveling up my 100th level 1 character for the daily challenge and some generous high level player approaches me to drop off a moving van load of plans he thinks I don't already have 15 each of.
---
wow, this is pretty in-depth i will refer to this in the future thanks
---
I'm definitely not making any actual changes until after the update, but I'm trying to iron out the big details for now at least.
---
Sure? I mean if you‚Äôre choosing to ignore everything else I said beforehand and be upset at me over something that I found just to be a little annoying this morning be my guest all I said is that I felt cheated from the position I was in, we don‚Äôt have to agree and you don‚Äôt have to sway my mind to yours but you‚Äôre choosing to try to ridicule some random dude on the internet that just wanted a planetarium and got a little bummed out over it and that was it. Don‚Äôt you think that‚Äôs strange?
---
I'm sorry, but at this point, 90% of the players are either directly/indirectly benefiting from exploited, glitched, or duped items, that Bethesda has done nothing to quell.
---
So, kindly get off your high horse.
---
Instead of a new set of perk cards, couldn't you just not load the third card and still have the other two maxed?  Still 6 points, does it calculate differently or something?
---
I've already explained it so not going to repeat myself.
---
This subreddit struggles with math. Yes.
---
Well you're not even playing so I guess you're doing fine gatekeeping yourself.
---
A Colossal Problem
---
Recently introduced public event where you can enter Monongah mine to fight a unique wendigo colossus after you nuke it.
---
Like I said in another thread, Bethesda directly told us that atom challenges were going away. They said this before Season 1 even started.
---
And if the only option is to buy, then you are screwed. Hence the "feel sorry for these guys instead" sentiment
---
Serendipity, evasive and lone wanderer since I play alone
---
Edit: no need to mention nerd rage
---
Absolutely people are allowed to critique Bethesda and this game, just as I'm allowed to critique and challenge what I perceive to be entitled behaviour.
---
This game is going to mean different things for different people. Go and take a look at the FilthyCasuals subreddit, no matter how buggy this game is they as a group are determined to make the best of it and have a jolly good time doing so. 
---
As for being paid to lobby for Bethesda... try and deflect a little better next time.
---
The reason for the math being off was that nobody accounted for the bonus challenges and stuff. Without those, it would have been a more significant grind.
---
Also, it is a grind. We shouldn't pretend like they are handling these very well. If you look at other games that have a similar feature, they all do it better. None of them, that I know of, force you to play practically every day. Furthermore, the weekly challenges in most other games do not reset and can be completed at any time during the season.
---
They speculated sept 15th with the next patch. So as long as we get the next patch on the 15th
---
diminishing returns is one of the reasons why ironclad is useless, yes. most armor setups can meet the threshold without ironclad.
---
but even then, it's 5 points for 50 extra defense. evasive nets you the same for 3 points, and barbarian nets you 80. granted, you need 15 agi/str, but most builds max at least one of them anyway.
---
bottom line is that the extra dr is not worth 5 perk points. there certainly are better things you could spend them on.
---
The "A Colossal Problem" event at the nuked monongah mine.
---
It does not have a chimney at the top (no smoke or opening, only brick), and doesn't reach the ceiling for regular wall height. I clipped mine [through a half-wall/slanted roof](https://i.imgur.com/xLGKw0D.png) so it works fine for me, but if that's a dealbreaker for you don't buy.
---
Is it ok with you if I decide when and why I play?
---
If you use the "craft a ton and scrap" method to unlock the mods, look for the collectible magazine Guns &amp; Bullets #5 and use the Scrapper perk. The magazine will give you extra materials back when scrapping and scrapper does as well.
---
I finished with a week to spare and didn‚Äôt do NW once.
---
moving camp and breaking down your blueprints allows you to rebuild your camp all over again! as long as its just stuff in your "stored" menu, you won't get any xp, not incur any cost to rebuild. (except for camp move fee)
---
I use inspirational on a private server in a team alone and still get the benefits of the card. I haven‚Äôt put lone wanderer since public team came out.
---
Zorbo's ship started on like space 30 or 40. Should have been the first indication that maybe the ship isn't the best gauge of the gameboard behavior.
---
As I and others mentioned, this info was in many locations. Twitter, Reddit, in Game, Official Forums. Not keeping up to date with important news regarding the game being played is user error when the information is in multiple, easy to find locations.
---
That‚Äôs total BS that none of the four cosmetic rewards offered from this event Are available permanently. With the amount of shots we all donated keeping them around as free gifts is the least they could do.
---
Yep, I didn‚Äôt reddit or google on a whim, shame on me, I‚Äôm a fool for relying on the game‚Äôs built in timer which apparently is a day behind for me, jested once again by my hubris thank you Newsman777 for being my guide in these dark times.
---
&gt; I‚Äôve got no reason to lie about this.
---
Except pride?
---
What are you looking for exactly with this thread? 
---
Numerous redditors have given you solutions, advices, explained things to you. I've even given you my own perspective as a game designer as of why a litteral countdown timer was not used and why it's not a good idea.
---
And nothing we've told you is enough. You always come back with a "but I don't do this, or that" and this is going in loop.
---
If you don't want to learn and improve from that experience, it's your choice, but don't waste people's time.
---
I was done before the increase in dailies and I even mossed a couple of days.
---
Dude, this is not how to get upvotes on this sub. Lil. Great advice! Can't wait to tackle season 2 more casually üëç
---

What exactly is the vertibird PA look like?
---
Are you on Xbox? I could show you my camp do you see what I'm talking about.
---
Did you ever play Fallout 3? A big reason the ghouls in Underworld stayed in Underworld was because they couldn't leave without the BoS stationed at the Washington Monument taking potshots at them
---
Fallout 1st exclusives are per month, those are september and august's items respectively. There's a 1st exclusive sale on the Red Rocket Ranger bundle (ranger PA + jetpack and PA crafting station) that's I think 30% off though.
---
1. Agreed
---
2. The SR doesnt struggle with math, Beth just changes the math on a whim
---
3. Agreed
---
4. I would personally like to see more NW challenges
---
5. Those matter less than just doing XP runs
---
6. Again, Beth changes this on a whim
---
7. If you miss a few days, it just means you gotta put in more time on the next few days. Its only impossible if you play an hour or two a day
---
8. Agreed
---
Not only a fish tank, which is a great idea, but they need to add in those Victrolas. Like the one at the Blue Ridge Caravan West Entrance. Also, what‚Äôs the deal with not being able to select the type of music out of the two jukeboxes? I‚Äôve never heard classical music come out of a jukebox until Fallout. Please Bethesda, add in the different versions like you have with the regular radios. There is more music in the game than just the classical.
---
Yes sir, more int equals more xp gain. Faster leveling
---
I mean to be fair, they could have still offered atoms these two weeks between challenges as it still wouldn't really get you too many atoms anyways (I don't think it would even convince those who might otherwise buy atoms not to but it would convince some of us to keep playing just to get what we could).
---
But yes, soon as they announced seasons and that challenges would give you score it was very obvious they wanted to reduce how much atoms they gave away for free (and pretty much say if you want atom store stuff, pay for it). I'm honestly surprised not more people were upset about it.
---
The 15th with patch 22

I got the game not too long ago the tutorial said to keep up with the ship so why assume it started 40 spaces in((first time I‚Äôve heard of this actually so thanks)) and I shouldn‚Äôt be required to look out of game for in game info, my mistake was not sitting on the main menu and pressing right bumper to see that one notification.
---
Yes, everyone does. Next Tuesday.

https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iow9u0/september_8th_atom_shop_update_for_those_just/
---
My god I have really undervalued that stat in that case...
---
yes approximately
---
Use the search option? A lot of different fixes.
---
The way Bethesda sees it is that free atoms must be tied to in-season progression only.
---
No chimney and it's not even the full hight of a wall. You can see edit in build mode
---
Wait till later when people are home from work. We're gonna see a lot more posts about it. Lol
---
I still get that bug where it shows I'm doing damage but nothing is happening to the Mob. The health is not even dropping and rubberbanning back, its just not moving despite numbers (in the thousands in the case of my bloody commando) ticking off for a full mag. 
---
Man, that one star Scorch Beast in Surface to Air is really tough! Took a full magazine from my B2525 fixer and took no damage!
---
Bless you and your family.
---
Force?
---
Thats an insane idea. Making another character just to horde shit? Dude were gonna be stocked on resources thank you so much
---
Damn, I must have missed that part of their announcement.
---
It's not anecdotal, it's fact. You have to choose between carry weight/food buolds and combat focused builds. You can't take over a PvP zone (workshop) with a lackluster build that's all over the place, get owned, and then bitch about how the game needs to change to accommodate your playstyle. That's ignorant, selfish, and misguided. If you want to not get ganked, then use a different build when taking over workshops. Or, better yet, don't use workshops. There's nothing a workshop can accomplish that you can't do more efficiently on your own, without the risk of PvP.
---
Before you talk about proper game play, try playing the game *properly*.
---
Did you exploit the ammo machine?
---
There's a fix for the budget, but if you didn't use it then I'm not going to take the time to write out the solution
---
Well, looks like it time to start doing the unyeilding glitch to get 70+ int.
---
It's 1800 or so with max charisma/mentats. I've purchased probably 20 cars in the last 3 weeks and received 11 fixer plans out of that. I can easily sell those for 5-10k and make my money back, and that doesn't count the occasional decent weapon or armor piece that I can flip in my vendor for a couple thousand caps.
---
How do I start that? Sounds pretty fun
---
If you‚Äôre in PA, reboot can chain revive you, and the recharge can and will heal you. Trust me, they‚Äôre all good.
---
Except blood sacrifice. Blood sacrifice can go burn. It‚Äôs worthless. Even if it looks cool.
---
Yeah the grind was real for sure but got done on week 8 with missing a few days and I didn‚Äôt buy any with atoms. So you can miss a day or two here and there. Main thing is doing weeklys. Also I didn‚Äôt always get the lvl up on the daily either.
---
Now you've compared pvp in a video game to slavery. 
---
Incredible the you're digging keeps getting bigger. 
---
I'm sorry if someone blew up your minecraft house must have been just as bad as slavery.
---
Oh that makes sense
---
Things I‚Äôm looking forward to? Black SS Armor/Power Armor/Backpack paint jobs. That grey skin just ain‚Äôt doing it for me and is the main reason I‚Äôm not getting them with GB for now.
---
(Especially a black SS backpack, it would look like the modular military backpack from Fallout 4. I loved that backpack.)
---
Wait you can craft meds?
---
The risk of having us go farming other games is we may not come back...
---
Whats onel wasteland?
---
I can‚Äôt believe no one else‚Äôs has mentioned this. I just can‚Äôt quit my shotgunners build. Anti armor combat shotgun is good for close quarters but when the bloodied gauss shotgun comes out, everyone(including the shooter) better look out.
---
Try placing the thing elsewhere, blueprinting it, and then place the blueprint of the object where you wanted it initially. This works more often than not
---
The season ended
---
Sounds like what I normally do lol
---
Yes, since you cant earn it anymore the only way to get it is to pay for it.
---
True, but it was A LOT of bad math and in fighting.  Ultimately it worked out, but you just know week 1 the math battle will begin again.  Just complain there isn‚Äôt enough time to complete it, don‚Äôt hold algebra classes about it
---
When Bethesda makes Rockstar look really generous the problem isn't the customers being greedy....
---
Its a free spit in the face for enabling everyone else's raid boss.
---
They said you can buy some of the items in the run in the atom shop. If you want to get it
---
This is the emote I've wanted for a long time.
---
Yeah, I was thinking about the 4x from Herbivore mutation.  My bad
---
Finally, a no mic emote
---
Constantly moving your camp over and over seems to make it pop back up for scrapping or storing.
---
That would prolly be my second choice. Not sure if there was more then one PA perk and since we don't have legendary PA peices that seems nice. Kinda trigged their gating QoL improvments to perks. I hate swamping locking picking/hacker in and out. I dont need it to auto complete. I can do the pick faster then switching my perks.
---
I was too, but I‚Äôm just bad at math in general
---
Oh get bent. Bethesda‚Äôs been generous. People are just fucking greedy. You literally get over 100 free items, fig just doing things you do in game and you want more whims you have to waif a week.
---
It‚Äôs fucking greed and you all know it.
---
The Gauss Shotgun has ruined most other guns for me. I got a Bloodied Explosive combat shotgun from the legendary vendor. And I'm like "Hell yeah this thing can kill a nuke silo assaultron in 3 shots!" And then I realize "Oh wait. The Gauss Shotgun can do that while I'm at full health because fuck everything in front of you."
---
If the game was properly designed, I'd be right there with you. Everything you say sounds great on paper but that's just not how it works. I've been playing this game since beta. Pidgeon-holing yourself into a particular build is gonna not gonna save you from Mr. Hax0r Legacy Weapons. Basically, you're just saying it's a fact that tacked-on PvP is broken in a single-player game and players have to over-specialize to conduct a minor portion of the game-play loop. Cool.
---
Ah yeah that‚Äôs one of my missions
---
It's almost like BGS needs more than the initial $60 you paid 2 years ago, to keep the game you're still playing, going, huh?
---
Who'da think it!

Hot, wet, and surprisingly gentle.  Why do you ask?

---
ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT, LETS SEE WHAT WE GOT...
---
I didn't see what you posted, I mean, it's an in-app text box but I just really click on the notification and respond while I do other things totally unrelated. I don't really go back and read what you posted before and I don't have time to see what you posted in other threads.  /S
---
See how stupid that sounds?
---
New atoms are distributed by numerical order using your social security number.  What‚Äôs yours? We can give you an idea of when the atoms will drop.
---
The price is still there but you could just buy it for a month and gather as much junk as you can so that you never run out.
---
no you can't spend your atoms to get the greenhouse bundle right away, you have to wait two weeks
---
I‚Äôve never said anyone was wrong, all I did was reiterate what led me down to this scenario and what the heck is pride on Reddit? That‚Äôs like caring about the little emoji reactions on Facebook or how many stars you‚Äôd get on Myspace.
---
Providing solutions to problems already concluded isn‚Äôt a waste of time to you? I never asked for solutions either I really wanted to see if others had different experiences but some people think their opinion matters in a melting pot of strangers, which makes the idea of pride even more laughable.
---
All I really said was I wished there was a timer in game, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to have one and presenting it as a moral issue placing pressure on players is as silly as you think I am for not looking online for things that could‚Äôve just been shown in game.
---
Not in season 2 you don‚Äôt.
---
My one sized fits all weapon is a Vampire's Bashing Minigun. It has one of the magic effects so it shreds things very well and keeps me topped up on health. Also, the ammo is cheap.
---
Awesome thank you. I have the hardest time finding any info on Bethesda‚Äôs website.
---
You might get really into building theme camps and you never know what might be the absolutely have to have ties the whole thing together plan.
---
Open a ticket with Beth, official Forum says to remove the camp-paint, even when it's not applied.
---
Ok thanks, i thought it would be today and was disappointed when I came on the game today üòï
---
Give me less challenges to complete or something. Just taking away the option to earn them and forcing you to either pay up or wait until the next season starts and grind it to death in order to buy the new ATX item. At this point they might as well get rid of earning them in any way and just make it a paid only feature. At least they would be more honest about it that way.
---
It was more for the ‚ÄúBethesda is out to steal my money‚Äù folks who made claims that seasons was only created so people would be forced to buy atoms.  Just a reminder that you don‚Äôt have to if you don‚Äôt want to.  You got atoms to burn, then by all means
---
Use 3x Inspiration on top of "building" or casual this round I believe for even more of an XP boost!

Well yeah your comment is irrelevant to what I said so it‚Äôs incredibly stupid, look buddy you‚Äôre getting way more emotionally invested in me than you should be, go ahead and say your final statements loaded with vitriol and move on with your day, this is reddit after all.
---
So basically the one without the outfit is 700 but to get the clock you gotta tack back on 300. So youll still save 500 atoms over all. What worries me is in all those pictures. Cool shotgun skin,new carpet and tileset that goes with this bundle but not included. So expect a few atoms gone next week when they follow up with those items.
---
Suggestion noted.  Thank you for your view and response.  Have a good day!
---
It was and still is (as of Thursday when I looked at least) part of the initial discussion of seasons.
---
Given the limitations of the building system, do you have any suggestions?  How do I create a sense of arrival?
---
Middle finger or laughing either one
---
Hey mate, I would do a few writeups on the old oddities, like the assaultron head you mentioned, or the misc item version of the tinkers' workbench, but there isn't too much to write about. I originally decided to write these writeups for trades involving these glitched weapons, as an info sheet of sorts. There are plenty, as I plan on covering mac's alien blaster, the glitched combat shotgun, the glitched ultracite laser (shoots plasma) and many more.
---
As if they don't already do enough of that daily log-in horse crap. Fuck em. Put all the Brotherhood stuff back in the store!
---
Why not use more than 4 boxes?
---
 the atom challenges are what kept me coming back for so long. The game really doesn't have much to do I mean after you've spent so many hours in it. Plus the amount that they spent to develop the score system and seasons probably could have went towards more end game  or pvp content. 
---
Like the small arena could have had team deathmatch type events after you finish the questline or another event like encrypted. Maybe even just a questline for blue ridge caravan but nope we get grinding as an endgame. 
---
If they nerf the screw drops in a colossal problem it will probably kill the event.
---
I just wish they would put some actual effort into the game instead of all these mini add ons. Its been out way too long for amount they've put out.
---
At least buff energy and explosive weapons they're the trademark weapons I mean come on already
---
I keep getting a bug where i just lose ammo when taking it out of my Stash. 30 shotgun shells in stash, move em into my on hand inventory and now i only have 19. I've lost full cores this way
---
it's less than $150 because atoms are actually 5000 for $40, plus you don't have to buy rank one. on top of that, the first few ranks are laughable easy to achieve
---
I gotta remember this
---
Yup, you can complete with 5 minutes a day of working on "challenges" or by just playing normally and doing events and quests for half an hour per day.  People calling it a grind are S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
Don't forget those awesome Plasma Cores.
---
&gt; I‚Äôve never said anyone was wrong
---
Except implying you felt cheated by an "inaccurate" timer and arguing about this, like if it was Bethesda's fault?...
---
&gt; Providing solutions to problems already concluded isn‚Äôt a waste of time to you?
---
This isn't concluded since Season 2 will start next week, so hopefully what we've told you will teach you (and others) to stay informed on the season's deadline in the future so this doesn't happen again.
---
For the rest, we've both made our point, no need to drag this more.
---
The paint job on the actual camp machine?
---
yes it will
---
Not what I'm saying at all. It's not "pigeon holing", it's called min/maxing. It's a baseline mechanic in every game. If you want to be the most effective, and do the most damage, then you have to build your character around the most effective means in the game.
---
All your doing is defending your choice to have a shit build, and trying to say that justifies blaming the game for *your own* inadequacies. It's ridiculous. Workshops have been a PvP zone since launch. They are *not* an essential part of the gameplay loop. You're just a whining try-hard who thinks his butchery and green thumb should be left on 24/7 and should still be able to survive in PvP. Get over yourself dude. The time you waste trolling this reddit, whining about your own shortcomings could have been better spent farming the same stuff you're trying to get from a workshop.
---
I guess I should consider myself lucky. I have never had any issues with it, but I see these posts pretty often.
---
For what it's worth, I use the lever action rifle and the handmade rifle on the PS4. Again, never noticed any problems with them. In fact, I seem to hit a lot of shots even when the chance is low.
---
I wouldn't re-work your entire build because of one Wasteland.    Bethesda put out a statement about the nerfs in the PTS.  It sounded more like a starting point.   They seemed to suggest that more  damage changes would come later in the future long after one wasteland drops.
---
some people say it's worth it for the guaranteed 3 star. I'd beg to differ, considering the amount of lead you have to pump into Earle. the wendigoes might be worth farming for screws and ammo, though.
---
Earle has a flat damage reduction effect similar to the Queen, except it's even stronger.
---
It‚Äôs technically unlimited scrap storage, hence the name ‚Äúscrap box.‚Äù  Junk you don‚Äôt want to scrap still takes up weight in your stash box. Personally I think the scrap box is a hack to get around limitations in the game that we didn‚Äôt have in FO4, and thus it should just be part of the base game with no extra fee.
---
1st is worth it to a lot of folks just for the portable tent and not having to haul junk around, or accessing your inventory, cooking, or resting from just about anywhere. I don‚Äôt like to buy atoms so the ones they include with 1st let me still get my atomic shop fix.
---
Like I said, easy on the feigned outrage there bud. You might pull a muscle.
---
What you want and what is offered does not match, and honestly, the price for a yearly sub is $10 / month. that's less than a cup of good coffee once a week.
---
Are you representing Bethesda? If not then your first quote does nothing, as for your second they should put a timer in that one then, but I agree with your last statement have a nice day.
---
Quick edit: I never really argued I just repeated what I said to multiple people because they essentially kept saying that it was my fault and sure I never said it wasn‚Äôt just that I felt cheated, how I feel shouldn‚Äôt matter to you we don‚Äôt know each other.
---
It used to be one of the few ways that people who tried to run explosives could easily get them.
---
Then they realise how much explosives suck in Adventure, and they stop. But, there's that short window when they're still thinking "cool, I should launch another nuke so I can get more missles".
---
The toxic one is a good place holder for now lol
---
It was only in the main menu very recently. It was not always known the exact end date until like a week or two ago.
---
Yep just have to wait and see if they patch actually drops
---
very cool thanx
---
I guess there's gonna be even more backlash when people will actually see *more* NW challenges. Like a whole weekly one to complete 3 NW dailies. (Seen it at the PTS with my own eyes, I guess it's pretty safe to assume it's there to stay)
---
Not to mention several dailies and weeklies that require you to complete Daily Ops, which will be quite problematic for some due to questionable/build-breaking design of some of the event's mechanics.
---
Maybe you just spent a lot of time "min-maxing" your character around unpolished gameplay mechanics and feel the need to justify it as a proper playstyle. I respectfully disagree and we'll leave it at that.
---
But that is just the problem, the game provided an in menu pop up that you also didn't bother to see. So the game gave you 1st party information to tell you an end date and you just blindly passed through the screen. That is on you. Not the game.
---
That seems a little low for a bloodied .50 on him but not absurdly. He has super high dr. But if you want ammo back make sure to loot the mini earls as you go. They give back the ammo you‚Äôre using I usually come out of the event more or less even. Also it‚Äôs a pretty good way to farm ultracite ammo if you use a primed weapon on the mini guys then switch to regular for him.
---
Thats basically the purpose of it
---
my mistake, i was uninformed  =[
---
Ahhhhhh gotchya
---
The solution is not to remove the missiles but actually make them a good weapon
---
no blocker?
---
Lol I look stupid? That was sarcasm. 
---
If you spent as much effort trying to get to 100 as you did complaining on reddit that you were "cheated", you would have finished the run.
---
also thank you
---
That was apparent
---
My question was if there was gonna be any challenges that awarded atoms, or anything else in between the seasons. That was amswered, and its sadly no
---
You have reason.
---
You could have some Imitation Seafood with that.
---
To keep you from fast traveling out of the event? It seems like it. You launch a nuke, and want to get down to the fissure site, but first you gotta dump out.
---
not yet as far as I know.
---
Definitely not getting that. My collectron bitches more than commander Daguerre
---
It's worth it for melee no matter what. For gun users it's worth it if everyone does their part in dealing damage and you're not expending a stupid amount of ammunition throughout the fight. Bosses have some sort of huge damage mitigation which is why you're seeing smaller numbers.
---
A strategy I saw last night was to have one guy that does a shit ton of damage (like an unarmed bloodied unyielding melee player) go into the boss fight solo and sneak attack the boss for like all it's health before they get in danger and then everyone come in to tag/kill it. The reason for this strat is cause even if it says you're hidden / cautious / dealing sneak damage in the fight you're not actually dealing extra damage if even one person in the area is in danger.
---
Thank you. After trying about six or seven times it worked
---
equipping 2x 3star commando = 40% extra damage
---
equipping 3x 2star commando = 45% extra damage
---
because each card gives 10%, 15%, 20%
---
equipping 1x 3star glow sight (for enemies that actually ARE glowing) = 60% extra damage
---
so, if you equip 3x 2star commando you get extra 45% extra damage, plus extra 60% from 1x 3star glow sight (to enemies that are actually glowing) = 105% extra damage instead of just 60% from 3x 3star Commando
---
by equipping 3x 2star Commando, you lose only 15% raw damage and can use other interesting 3star cards
---
If you're looking at this game as a reward to ammo ratio, maybe you're better off playing a different game.
---
I do ACP because it's still fun for now. The rewards are ancillary to that.
---
will the last seasons rewards vanish if not claimed by the time the next season comes out?
---
Never found much "scrap," though.
---
I dropped 96 from my heavy character the other day.
---
I would if my account would work on both
---
It‚Äôs a consumable you can learn to craft. Temporarily increases ballistic damage but also increases how quickly your weapons deteriorate. Very helpful item for boss fights.
---
Couldn't say the current status but I used to use them about a year ago and never got banned for anything. Haven't heard of or seen any posts from Beth saying that they aren't allowed. Don't even know if they'd have a way of detecting them since they are all client-side.
---
lol, yeah.
---
I have 4k script ready lol I was nervous I wasn't the only person saving
---
Ah yes one hour of repeating something to people is effort, as strong as an effort as your sarcasm was great, you definitely look smart to me and the rest of strangers try at stumble into this thread, you done so we can say goodbyes or do you want to keep wasting time with someone you‚Äôll probably never run into again?
---
Heh
---
Don't be so quick to assume that is helpful advice.
---
When you are in workshops that you have claimed or are claiming, you are open to PvP automatically. The only thing people can take from you when you are killed is your junk. So by telling you that, waster is setting you up to be killed and have your junk stolen.
---
Don‚Äôt man, it‚Äôs all bullshit anyways. When I want to play I‚Äôll play again. I‚Äôm not a fan of how much Beth has put in to limit us.
---
haha, oh wow. as if I needed even more reason to skip the next run.
---
surely it's a bug, right?
---
This is probably because the PTS and live servers share the same challenges; since there's no challenges this week, only the PTS-exclusive dailies and weeklies are appearing. 
---
The challenges have been fine up till now in the PTS, this is definitely not something to be alarmed about.
---
I received atoms as legendary run rewards
---
I work a full time job I have a wife and six kids and I have no problem with them taking the free atoms away being they need to have money coming in to support new patches and dlc. Like if they didn‚Äôt have any income coming in this game would die. Then everyone would bitch that there is no content. There‚Äôs plenty of games that do it like this and we had two years of free atoms. Tell me a game that has done that.
---
Not really worth it
---
i mean as long as it doesnt give you an advantage over others I guess its ok?
---
That's weird I haven't changed that for weeks and the problem only happened yesterday. Thank you for the info I will give that a go!
---
I forgot today was Tuesday. Thanks for the update!
---
Right, it was there a week ago. The only excuse for not seeing it within that week was not playing for that week. At which point, the legendary run was already finished for the player or they didn't care to finish it.
---
üÜô‚è´ Let‚Äôs take this one to the top. Again.
---
Yeah, just about time, it's already fixed at the pts :D
---
"We have finally fixed the auto completion bug plaguing the daily and weekly challenges. How you ask? we removed them. Now they no longer auto complete. Now enjoy a complete week of absolutely nothing."
---
Aww, someone is mad.
---
The beatings will continue until morale improves
---
(Rarely) some of my Prime plans sell at a base price (mostly being 500). Gatling laser, plasma, those im pricing at 1500 and have almost no problems selling them. 
---
I dont even know at what price i should put 3\* armor pieces with 20% weight reductions as even at 500c nobody wants them.
---
I hope so, tho the challenges always were the same as we had on the live servers. Maybe its just because we don't have any right now.
---
I'm more concerned about the repeatable, the gain xp were much more valuable and was still too grindy.
---
check my reply below to  Livid\_Zucchini8397 for a bit more detail
---
Nah. I honestly get those with other events and use way less resources. Plus I'm being honest, my build just isn't up for it. The windegos I can eat through but Earl I don't seem to make a dent.
---
Bloodied will still be the meta. Everything is taking a hit.
---
There‚Äôs a pop up? I genuinely didn‚Äôt know my mornings are pretty hectic so I just load in ASAP, all I‚Äôm saying is that there should‚Äôve been a timer in the Legendary Run screen itself instead of an arbitrary ship timer that apparently started at space 40, doesn‚Äôt even have to be a precise timer it could literally count down the days to final hours.
---
Its more about the repeatable.
---
Damn, that exploit made the leveling speed feel right *insert pouty face
---
Don't feel bad.  I have an irrational fear of low-level players with "wonder weapons" capable of one-shotting me even when I'm wearing my best stealthified Power Armour.
---
I did MAYBE five nuclear winter challenges and finished like a week or two ago. Very few days needed more than half an hour to complete the dailies
---
I always made sure to share rank 3 Inspirational on teams.
---
To be honest for me and my friends we can kill her quickly rather if she lands or not, there's been multiple times when we killed her in mid air, then she turns into a rubber bouncy ball. Lol I have no idea why you got down voted man
---
Nope. Not even remotely. Meta remains largely the same. AA is about the only dark horse to keep an eye on since it calculated damage a little differently
---
That's 58 minutes more than it would have taken you to find out when the event ends.
---
If magic should work junkie is still one of best choices too
---
Yes and yes!  Angry Turtle had a video about it.
---
It was a harsh reply. I should have pulled back a bit but I think we need to rally together around this stuff as opposed to infighting. 
---
At the end of the day it will be better for all of us
---
Have not donated a single item.
---
Really like that repeatable though!
---
Looking back at my post, I wasn‚Äôt very clear.  Posted on my phone at work
---
I usually try to deal with the wendigo spawns, and I stay afterwards to kill more and loot what I can.
---
Well fair enough. Sorry that happened to you.
---
Yeah and I need those elite ranger armor back. Had to evac for two months
---
Do the math...
---
It'd be way overused. Some vendor has his prices set too high: middle finger. Just cleared out West-tek, and are scrapping, when a high level enters the cell, and all the mutants respawn, and kill you, while high level marsupial jumps away: middle finger. People one-shotting legendaries: middle finger.
---
You've been playing for awhile, right? Look at the volatility that happens every time dupes happen. What good are they doing? Do we benefit when they force a server to crash so they can have a 39th B2525 Fixer for one of their mules? How are all these cheaters with 60 ammo factories at their camps devaluing ammo even further sticking it to Bethesda by keeping everybody not in the know from being able to make caps selling ammo? This is going to destroy trading and selling if nothing is done. Dupers only benefit themselves.
---
&gt; Are you representing Bethesda?
---
Why is this relevant? Since when one need to represent a studio to defend something they do?
---
 I've been extremely vocal in the past on how Bethesda is extremely flawed in its designs and decisions. Fallout76 has tons of issues.
---
But when I see someone complain about one of the *few things* that function correctly, it's my instinct to give my insight as a game designer myself.
---
&gt; they should put a timer in that one then
---
Okay this is silly. I've [explained to you a few posts ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iox4aq/i_was_cheated_out_of_rank_100/g4gk1va/) why a timer is **not** a good idea. Can't you even read what people say to you?...
---
It's all good
---
This one caught me off guard and made me laugh. I can relate to this.
---
i bought the rest of the game board once it was available and claimed all the things. then the next day i was sad cause i took all the fun out of the game. this next season i wont do that cause its doable
---
more reason to add it then
---
I wonder what the tenth request on the thousand group is
---
Or bloodied magic
---
Only thing I can reliably sell is ammo. My plans are also very cheap and sit forever unless it's something recent like Wendigo Skin Rug or Statue. Those go quick and I can sell easily for 1k caps.
---
Other than that I sell serums and flux for under 500 (I'm still looking for that sweet spot) and they don't reliably sell.
---
It's in wall decor, you must have missed it
---
Cheated was a strong word for sure, pre coffee terminology is spicier than post coffee, right now I‚Äôd say it was just a feel bad moment I‚Äôm pretty much okay with it now since I really just wanted that planetarium
---
Most players can do two public events far more easily/quickly than they can grind out 10k XP. It seems fine to me.
---
For end game players we usually use less intelligence as it has very little effect on builds like bloody, stealth or tank
---
I took a break from fo76 shortly after the second week of ATLAS community event. mind that I ask what season 2 is? has it started already? FOMO has me thinking I should stop what I'm doing right now and start the Appalachian grind again.
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre joking or not...my neighborhood burned to the ground and I don‚Äôt know if my house was in that.
---
I feel like natural explosive weapons (missile launchers, nukes, grenades) should ignore armor without perks needed or deal much more damage.
---
That's the stuff! 
---
It's more like radioactive moonshine than acid haha
---
Bloodied commando just serendipity and nerd rage, 1*blocker for me.
---
They didn't even bother to completely fill out the atom shop, when completed stuff for the atom shop has been sitting unused in the files for months...
---
Nothing about the Deep makes a lick of sense so sure, why not
---
In my opinion the battle pass trend ( in all games ) is the cancer of online gaming, by just forcing us to login every day to do repetitive challenges.
---
I am more interested to play single player games now because there is no stupid battle pass in every single game.
---
Thanks, if anything at least I got the Fireplace Door which I‚Äôm stoked about
---
Yeah, for this player I give him less credit. But I am sure there are players who took their time because they didnt know the end date was looming.
---
I'm fully prepared to believe it's just the spaget.
---
I usually follow the rule of not attributing to malice what can be attributed to incompetence.
---
Just observing that it's a bit convenient for Bethesda and their design goals/philosophy regarding player retention and "engagement."
---
I had that happen when the ally item was in a spot they couldn't easily access. Try scrapping, not storing, the item, then put it in the middle of an open area to test.
---
Not seeing the connection to the railroad car in the Slocum's Joe bundle. Is there something in the lore I've missed?
---
Starts the 15th as of right now
---
Most people don't equip any or just equip serendipity. And they whine they die too often
---
Finally gave in and signed up to 1st about halfway through August. No sign of September's atoms yet...
---
Alright, Ill get wasted at every party I go to!
---
What and miss this conversation? Never would I want a universe where I never meet Newsman777.
---
They do pay a monthly subscription for it.
---
You all are fantastic.  I can't wait to get home to play now!
---
There are never two public events, and in between each is a timer till the next one spawns. 10k exp is easylie done within 2-3mins and is farmable without any flaws.
---
So no, it is technically and physically impossible.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
tysm. almost a straight week without having to worry about that. I love the game but my break isn't quite over yet, lol.
---
Don't forget the middle finger...
---
Not really that surprising. Building(soon to be casual) teams give you bonus intelligence which applies to everything you do, Event teams only give you bonus on event XP(just the XP for doing the event? or for kills and doing it? not sure which way it is)
---
I always use building even when alone for the added xp from cooking, killing and doing missions.
---
Thats not cool, you should put in a ticket asap.
---
Best way to get mods is crafting radium rifles and breaking them down.  
---
It‚Äôs gonna cost shit ton of materials though.
---
I would prefer an "expose my genitals" emote myself.
---
I got it to work thanks. Joined another multiplayer game, logged in,  then came back and it brought up the zenimax tos. Then I saw the friends list. Awesome thanks
---
Plus, private worlds were all they used for PTS, which was how the critter/Fasnacht debacle came about. Another environment that wasn't tested thoroughly.
---
It actually does hit zero, but then the clip magically partially refills.
---
I‚Äôm not going to looking at your history Chabb it doesn‚Äôt matter to me.
---
What you stated is that it‚Äôd pressure players and to that I said it‚Äôs irrelevant, it‚Äôs better to have information available than restrict it because it made little Billy feel anxious in a world where someone can sneeze in your approximate area and you or your loved one dies in three days.
---
Would make the no emote less harsh
---
Yup, going for the gold is all I've been doing.
---
Wow, thanks for the explanation.  I just thought it was an increase per star.  Perhaps I should actually read up about this perk card system.
---
I play on ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù mix of uny armor, low health (depends on situations) + junkie rifles &amp; heavies. Bloodied weapons live in stash)
---
Should they give you the survival tent and private world while they are at it? Its just how it works, always has been. FO1st is a good deal anyways if you often buy from the ATX store as they give you nearly as many atoms as the cost of the subscription anyways on top of all the other features.
---
Same here, I only get this bug after playing NW.
---
If you signed up halfway through August you won't get Septembers atoms till halfway through the month. You get atoms on the day you sub and then every month from that day after.
---
They will come halfway through September, in your case. It's based on when you sign up, not the beginning of the month.
---
You only get atoms every time your subscription is renewed not at the end of the month unless of course you bought it at the end of the month.
---
That really sucks. 
---
There isn't anything I can do but upvote and hope that Bethesda considers the idea of reposting the BOS items for at least a week or so.
---
If like me you're from r/fo76filthycasuals if you go through all the rewards and find out the thing you want most is 2/3rds of the way through and not the final item it can ease the pressure to get there so much, just play the scores til you get there instead
---
Put them immediately into the ammo machine
---
Mine only shows the option to collect xmas presents.
---
Not selecting that, it collects junk items.
---
The only collectrons I have are the BoS and Santa.  
---
Given that narrow experience range, it seems you have the option(s) to select a category picked up by any collectron you own, or the Bos no selection default, which appears to be junk.
---
Dat Slocums bundle doe
---
Oh look at that. Exactly 175m on the dot.
---
Took you 20 days to come up with that little zinger? Damn sure put me in my place :p
---
Im not demanding anyone do anything just pointing out you can easily kill earl and farm tons of screws at the same time. As opposed to completely ignoring earl and losing out on all the quest completion rewards.
---
But hey you do you.
---
If you want to ask why: the game has way more problems than this. Also it would be a real problem to fit all outfits and align them propper for each hairstyle and outfit. Sure, if you want more assets that bugs out and are broken you could complain, but this shouldn't be the standard or even a thing to consider. We won't need more bugs and glitches.
---
Yeah its not like mods you'd see in FO4 or something that gives you new guns or abilities, though there are some cosmetic ones that change textures. The NCR ranger outfit was modded in a long time ago haha. Other people won't see it but you will. Nothing thats related to gameplay.
---
The ones that give the most "advantage" imo are the ones for glowing items that just make it a LOT easier to see certain open-world loot items. But yeah its not like you're going to be installing mod for a 500 fire rate Fatman or anything
---
Oh, so it's like basically everything else in the world.
---
Whose outraged here? 
---
I'm letting you know how ridiculous your comparison is. 
---
If you actually think that actions in a video are at all comparable to real life violence you need help. 
---
Seek out help.
---
It‚Äôs a really fun fight, and spawns have tons of xp, I get a decent chunk of my ammo back.
---
Only sucks if someone spams a Tesla
---
Yep, just saw it when I loaded up. Guessing everyone gets it.
---
&gt;  it doesn‚Äôt matter to me.
---
Yet you questioned if I represented Bethesda. So surely my background interest you minimally.
---
&gt; What you stated is that it‚Äôd pressure players and to that I said it‚Äôs irrelevant, it‚Äôs better to have information available than restrict it because it made little Billy feel anxious in a world where someone can sneeze in your approximate area and you or your loved one dies in three days.
---
lol, Pot meet Kettle. It's better to have a figurative timer for our own sanity despite the fact little SimplyTiredd isn't independent and resourceful enough to seek the proper information himself in a world with tons of tools and datas to stay informed. See, it goes both way.
---
You like litteral timers, some don't. There are studies and precedents about the drawbacks and issues of a physical litteral timer in video games. Bethesda chose to not use one, and this worked for a *wide* amount of people *except you*.
---
Sucks to be you.
---
Oh yes, i love how they bring back stuff from 1-2 months ago like it's nothing, but stuff that people want from a year ago and so, just never get re-released. What a disappointment
---
Don't worry, you will still get more xp from highest level muties with one wasteland than what you get now from level 68s even with uny double dipping. I tested it on PTS and it was roughly 814xp from a lvl 100 mutie without the glitch with my xp-farm setup. On live I was getting ~660xp from a lvl68 one during s1 with additional +15 to all stats.
---
Yeah I had it also. I think they changed them in some way and we have to agree to the new terms. I‚Äôll admit I was worried at first also. But I‚Äôm on and doing my thing now so no big deal.
---
That fireplace is a definite purchase for me.
---
The helmet was missing from the outfit and they added that in.
---
Introverted player here... Do you need to play events with your group to get xp boost, or can I join but still do my own thing?
---
This has sorted it! I was fuming thinking I might have to move camp haha, thanks again mate.
---
if youre low health, and use unyielding armor, why wouldn't you use bloodied weapons?.
---
As a side note to that, the 'building' team is going to be getting a name change soon and will eventually be called 'casual' team. It will still provide the same exp bonus.
---
That's the thing, the red rocket skin isn't a fo1st exclusive skin. The current sale is. I don't care for the private servers, the scrap boxes or the NV armour.
---
If they were to put the item for sale at full price, and give fo1st members a discount, whatever. Perks of the subscription.
---
But no. They aren't even going to sell an item without the sub. An item that isn't a subscription perk.
---
AA is going to be second tier with Junkies. Both have the same top end dmg give or take a few percent. Junkies has addictions and AA has diminishing returns with low armored mobs.
---
I like this idea; I'd like to think Mothman's just sick of (most of) the Cultists' bs, but likes Brother Moncrief, and is willing to appear to him and his flock as the Wise Mothman.
---
Can't wait for the higher level sentry bots at whitesprings. At level 50, they give around 1k
---
No idea what OP is saying here.
---
I say start again. A LOT has changed. 
---
Everything changes next tuesday with a huge update. Wait until then to look into builds. 
---
and [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Can you share that budget feature? Pls?
---
Atom shop items and bug fixes are handled by different groups of people. Therefore there is no reason why they can‚Äôt add more hairstyles and tattoos since they add things to the atom shop anyway. I‚Äôm guessing the only reason why they haven‚Äôt released many is that they aren‚Äôt popular enough.
---
The meta will still stay "Unyielding Bloodied" due to all the benifits it gains...
---
You have extra carry weight, extra melee dmg, extra v.a.ts perception, extra xp, extra action points, extra stealth...
---
The bloodied meta is beyond its own dps potential. It fits just too well with the best armor legendary effect.
---
Bcz i have pvp sometimes) the difference of bloody &amp; junkie on low hp is invisible. But junkie has magic damage
---
Well if you liked it before WL did nothing but make it better. Wether or not you start a new character really doesn't make a difference, it's your choice. I know Bloodied is all the rage, but full health builds are fun too. A little more ammo intensive, but that's about the only draw back. There's two new bosses other than the SBQ as well.
---
I really want a laughing emote to use when a level 7 tries to trade with me or someone wants to PvP.
---
Yeah, RDR Online has its share of griefers. Too bad there isn't a pacifist mode as in FO76 it would make the game more enjoyable.
---
You can stick to your character, totally no need to start over. Some quests will be a cakewalk since they are supposed to be early game, but you do them only once anyway.
---
Beside of bloodied (which is indeed THE meta) you can also play junky or anything else you prefer, almost no build is wothless - you even could play without any legendarys aswell.
---
Idk if there is a guide, I personally don't like guidance when I'm supposed to play the game myself. Just hop in and enjoy, but beware the game ain't got better in ways of bugs, glitches, exploits, hackers or anything else except client and server stability. The endgame is a worthless grind to oblivion aswell.
---
1. You could restart or play on your high levels, I hit level 50 2 weeks after owning the game and have been playing close to 2 years since then and 700+ hours since then on the same character and it‚Äôs still tons of fun.
---
2. I run a junkies heavy gunner character. Junkies let‚Äôs you do a lot of damage and still have all your health, all you need is 5 addictions and you get +50% damage without having to be low health. I would recommend a junkies heavy gunner or sneak rifleman build with junkies weapons, if you don‚Äôt like the idea of being a druggie you could also run furious but it‚Äôs not as good.
---
3. Just explore the new quests on your own, it‚Äôs more fun. If you get stuck use a guide or if you want to know how to make your build better but I‚Äôd recommend doing the quests without any guides
---
1) At the beginning it's hard, i won't lie, but with time it'll grow on you, you'll enjoy the new content
---
2) i don't like bloodied, i don't like junkie? What do i use? A magic shotgun (it's a shotgun with 33, hit chance, making it very strong in VATS)
---
3) it's not that different
---
Also, day one player here too, i miss farming the whitespring, they nerfed the ghoul xp a long time ago brother
---
I‚Äôll have a look at a complaint then üëåüèº
---
There were only a handful of things out of the first season that I actually liked, so the grind to reward ratio was pretty high for me. 
---
The plain atom challenges let me select stuff I actually like, so naturally I liked those better. Maybe if the seasons had some kind of story/gameplay elements instead of just being random tasks, I'd like them more.
---
Nah your background still doesn‚Äôt matter to me, and I‚Äôve never had to look for information because I followed what the game said and if the game wasn‚Äôt clear then whatever, keep trying to impress Redditors though, sick fedora.
---
Another week of garbage! Hurray!
---
Scrap it and replace it, it will go back to the default.
---
You can set collections to collect any collectron you have purchased
---
Missile launchers were good at some point?
---
You can do your own thing!
---
I wouldn't say invisible. there's about a 50 or so damage difference between my bloodied combat rifle and my j2525 handmade. the combat rifle is inferior, but the bloodied is just better than junkies
---
LOL, yeah Bethesda please fix this guy's inability to find things.
---
Did not have this on PC.
---
It never showed as available for free in the Atomic Shop on my end. I thought I misunderstood and it was only free for some. Did you have to contribute to the Brotherhood?
---
Agree 100% with ‚ÄúUnyielding‚Äù. J weapons do practically the same damage on low hp. But works on full hp too
---
Yeah I‚Äôve had subs for it since the server started just the last two payment has been taken but atoms haven‚Äôt come through to my account.
---
I understand. Being so close to that reward and missing it because of such a minor thing feels bad
---
Maybe based on your level or build it‚Äôs impossible.  I have a very strict schedule and I have one hour of game time a day.  Two weeks I wasn‚Äôt able to play do to family and work.  I appreciate that some people struggle more with the SCORE, however with my build I was able to finish early.  However, I can‚Äôt prove that to you as you weren‚Äôt sitting next to me.  I apologize that you find me untrustworthy
---
Exactly
---
My gf started the last run 3 weeks late and finished last week. She didnt even play everyday. Also no NW. 
---
The legendary run is totally doable for everyone.
---
Can we get text chat now?
---
Cannibal here, i love to eat people, it's free food that doesn't spoil and it's found everywhere
---
I always come away more ammo than I spend... and I go wild against the wendigos üòÇüòÅ
---
I could count dozens of broken or false advertised offers we had in the atx shop. 
---
You are wrong anyway, since who do you think is coding and modelling the atx items? It's true that the atx shop is outsourced, but only the managing part. The content itself is still from the dev team. (where else?)
---
Oh sorry you wasn‚Äôt referring to me! My bad I‚Äôm a reddit newbie ü§£
---
&gt; Nah your background still doesn‚Äôt matter to me
---
Ok ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
&gt; I followed what the game said
---
No you didn't, you skipped the main menu's notifications *numerous times*, didn't double-check Zorbo's position before going to bed and chose to waste your time stuck on the 99th slot instead of simply buying your rank and be done with it as soon as you could.
---
Yet you're resourceful enough to come complain about this on reddit *or* to google the Deathclaw's spawn locations.
---
You're just an inconsistent and contradictory mess lol.
---
&gt; keep trying to impress Redditors though
---
I'll call a spoon a spoon. But sure.
---
It was updated and needed to be agreed to again on ESO, so likely company wide update.
---
Did they remember to change the text?  Last time it was up, I was bored enough to really glance at it, and every game specific word was ESO's.
---
The buff maxes at 100% increased xp, so if you use 5, you only get the effect of the 5th for the time at the end of the hour between using the 4th and the 5th.
---
Every time I did a ‚Äúreset‚Äù I scrapped it and didn‚Äôt store it. Also, i set the item right at the edge of my CAMP when they were spawning stuck outside the boundary. Nothing was around it. They still wouldn‚Äôt move. Now with the Commander spawning under the floor I have to place against a wall with nothing around it. Of course this is after trying different allies again. They just all spawn under the floor now instead of outside the CAMP boundary.
---
My bloodied Gauss Minigun is probably doing too little damage then.
---
It‚Äôs all over A Colossal Problem I‚Äôve noticed
---
We will have to look at watch they change and adapt.  Seems like they‚Äôve already altered some of the SCORE.  I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll figure it out though
---
Yeah but hey I‚Äôm still gonna play the game since I still have fun, and honestly am still happy that this BP was free to begin with, truly pleased about that.
---
If you're paying a monthly subscription just to play this game I have some bad news for you.
---
It doesn't say anything about the brotherhood items being available until sept. 8
---
"fueled up" obviously referring to the red rocket icon.
---
Right under the part you quoted it says the collectron will be available until sept. 7 and by now everyone should know that they mean until the morning of the day.
---
The path leading up to the Wayward is my dumping ground but I have no idea if anyone ever picks it up. Could be beverages from Atlas, random ammo and a whole bunch of plans.
---
Just remember it's not the first of every month it's the day of the month you pay for service originally
---
Nothing compares to The Simpsons Tapped Out.  Donut mining is a GRIND
---
If you want to increase STR to carry more, you can do things like:
---
add motion assist servos to your PA (+2 STR),
---
calibrated shocks on both legs of your PA (+50# per leg),
---
get shielded SS underarmor (+4 STR, + 4 and +2 on 2 other specials).
---
roll for armor that has + STR as an attribute,
---
Equip a a weapon with + STR as an attribute.
---
Marsupial adds STR.
---
Additionally, you can:
---
roll for armor that has WR as an attribute (aid, weapons, junk, ammo) (and they stack)
---
get the High capacity mod for your backpack.   (be aware you will take an RR hit when you equip it.)
---
I have the same problem all the time.  My favorite is when his dialogue thinks it's not my CAMP and he tells me that he's not the boss, so keep looking.
---
I think that area was the chinese spies trying to hijack the motherload
---
I soloed my first nuke and found out it was way easier than i remembered. So i launch lots of nukes now and end up with a ton of missiles
---
A month long event and the rewards are only up for a couple days is so fucking dumb
---
The bonus seems to be for the XP from the completion of the Ops. As long as you‚Äôre in a team you should get the bonus, just like the Events teams bonus. Though from what I‚Äôve read from players on the PTS that have actually played these Daily Ops you probably don‚Äôt want to take them on by yourself.
---
I checked Zorbo‚Äôs position and did hit up multiple Deathclaw spawn zones but you think I‚Äôm lying to protect my reddit pride so get on with your bad self.
---
The communication finger
---
Cheers, hopefully I can run into it in someone's camp before commiting earned ATOMs to it...
---
I needed a vacation
---
Awesome, thanks! :)
---
Yes..... exactly 175 million of 175 million. Way to pull us through Beth employees. Not a suspicious number at all.
---
That sucks!  I‚Äôm sorry you got banned
---
What this guy said. Junkies &amp; bloodied overlap in damage at 50% health. Lower than that Bloodied is superior. Higher than that &amp; it's Junkies.
---
1. done
---
2. working on it
---
3. where do i get that.
---
4. ok.
---
5. got that.
---
6. have it.
---
7. ok
---
8. easiest way to get possum badges other than world challenges?
---
No idea he got lots of friends or something lol or maybe just a lot of those guys with mics who scream in public chat when they see someones on a tent saw this thread.
---
Just opinion on both sides. Personally I've never seen a pattern to the queens behaviour and I been playing since beta.
---
Her pathing just never worked right.
---
My wife wasn't online because we get gummed up when anything we both play has an update.  Neither of us was too thrilled that it was gone before the refresh today.
---
login, check the friends list, join their session, then send a system/console level message saying something like "I'm on your server....."
---
Defend events at the workshop in Bog Town, Mac's Farm and the Cranberry Glade.
---
I bet it is a real serious weapon with super damage!üëçüí£ mine is a shotgun build so this is why I concentrate on the spawns trying to get them off the back of heavy gunners in ACP.
---
I run blocker, fireproof, nerd rage, serendipity and lone wanderer (unless im in a group)
---
Nope
---
What about taking one for the team does it work playing solo?
---
Craft them?
---
There is datamined unreleased teabag emote, where you put teabag in a cap of tea with a sadistic face, i need that one lol
---
Any way to flag bethesda? I think they would be sympathetic to this.
---
Just ask them to put all the rewards back up for like a week after the event ends, hopefully no more evacuations.
---
Bethesda openly admit its just not a priority for them, even though they acknowledge it is the most requested feature.
---
deathclaw island, server hop if it does not emerge from the ground when you walk by.
---
For sure.
---
H-t- explained it well - there are a lot of ways to increase DR as much or more than Ironclad. My recommendation would be the armored backpack, as a set of Uny armor gives you a ton of carry weight already.
---
Bcos of console players
---
well said I'll pop open a nuka-cola to that brother
---
This is the way
---
Something that pissed me off is not having the shadow prime power armor even though I bought the bundle around July time
---
Not sure. They are pretty rare, best of learning the plan and crafting/scrapping
---
I've scripted like 100 of those rifles, only gotten like 5 or 6 mods. It have a very low rate.
---
I get them occasionally as quest rewards, but most of mine were crafted.
---
Wasn't it like that all the time?
---
I can remember a few weeks ago where almost no one knew that 1st discounts are a thing, since I have 1st on my main and not on my mules I recognised this a while ago, and your concern isn't new.
---
Nevermind. Really weird that it didn't show up until almost 3 hours after the update, but it is Bethesda code after all.
---
This is persistent, also my allies never give me dialogue as though it‚Äôs not my CAMP. They know it‚Äôs my CAMP they just don‚Äôt move after setting their object. After another test they seem to spawn inside their object. After moving it and re-logging they then spawn under the floor of their object if it is placed on a foundation.
---
This is bizarre and frustrating.
---
Has it not ended today after reset?
---
Man I tried that and when that didn‚Äôt work I tried above the Red Rocket workshop, the Abandoned Bunker, power substation by Watoga and that one spot by Sludge Lake, I was just really unlucky but it‚Äôs all good.
---
Outer Worlds DLC releases tomorrow I think üòÅ
---
I‚Äôve been on vacation since I finished the run a month ago... What I really need is atoms. 
---
(As much cool stuff they‚Äôve released lately, I have Fallout 1st and even I‚Äôm struggling to pay atoms for stuff... Can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs like for the people who can‚Äôt afford Fallout 1st, they‚Äôre the real victims here.)
---
I guess I‚Äôll have to start doing that, but I‚Äôd much rather just buy them then spend all that time wandering the countryside looking for blood leafs and whatever else is in them.
---
Yeah, good thing I‚Äôll never be able to peer beyond the confines of my subjective experience
---
You don‚Äôt earn atoms during seasons but you left way more stuff than you could buy with atoms during the same time period. I see no issue offering atoms during an off week vs absolutely nothing now.
---
You do need to be on a team. However, with public teams, that should be easy.
---
Not useful for console players.
---
&gt; but you think I‚Äôm lying
---
I don't think you do. You asked why you would lie and I told you why one would on a forum built around karma points. Whether or not this applies to you is something else but clearly you took it personal lol.
---
We've provided you solutions, explanations, insights, tools and you refused all of them while arguing you felt "cheated" by the game's system either way. Whatever we've told you, you always came up with an excuse, or a justification to *not* do it.
---
So you **do** give the idea that you're too prideful to face your wrongdoings. I mean, if you really agreed it was your mistake, this thread wouldn't exist (nor at least be named the way it is).. You made this thread because you felt bummed of something you brought on yourself, how does it even make sense?
---
As for Zorbo's position, on my side (and this was confirmed by others) it was on 99 before I went to bed at 10 PM EST. There's no way for us to verify but his ship's position has been steadily following a pattern since the beginning of the season back in June.
---
&gt; I did hit up multiple Deathclaw spawn zones 
---
And when you saw this wasn't working out, why didn't you just buy the rank? You went to bed with an unfinished task. This is counterproductive however the angle you look at it :-/
---
I read "Have a nice day" like the DMV bot lol
---
Damn, I was looking forward to that statue.  You just knocked the air out of my sails.
---
They made it sort of sound like just doing weeklies might be viable.
---
I hope so. I only log in a few times a week unless there's new content.
---
Hasn‚Äôt reset for me...
---
This wasn‚Äôt working for me a week ago either
---
It's funny that you ask that, with their new CoC that you had to sign.
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/715779912304296049/752962256500949122/Screenshot_7.png
---
It mentions text. OMG... well it probably just means they were being lazy again and copied the CoC from ESO over to here.
---
Go to train station and read the 3 posters regardless
---
Official forum. But I highly doubt they read anyway...
---
If there is a double exp weekend, then it's a done deal.
---
The commies repurposed a Motherlode. Hornwright was probably too preoccupied with being an asshole to help the Chinese agents.
---
Badges are a possible reward for daily quests Operation Tidy, Stings and Things, and the event Campfire Tales
---
Need a "need text chat" followup emote.
---
I'm still waiting for my Black X-01 paint. You know....the default color?
---
The event burns ammo like a nuke through a shanty town. You can make up *some* of the difference by looting wendigo corpses.
---
The drops are not mind blowing, but some people love certain pieces (I for one love the miner mask and the meat piles) but they aren't widely crowd pleasers. Even the people that do love the rewards will eventually get them and the thrill of the hunt is over.
---
So why do it? Subjectively, its different and fun. You have to practice awareness and change gears. There's a fear mechanic that spices the action up. There's a certain mildly Dunwich Horror vibe. Personally I enjoy it a lot more than the glorified skeet shoot that is SBQ. It's not exactly Battletoads, but it's a square dance in the right direction.
---
If you're just in it for guns and ammo, this might not do anything for you. It might not be your bag and that's ok. But I would caution you against a mindset which has a lot of potential to lead you down a winding path of malaise.
---
Honestly my chief complaint is the lukewarm story. Fallout stories used to be so alive and entertaining. The characters of Fallout universes of the past would trickle in doses of surreal absurdist humor alternating with profound heartwarming cuteness. Earl's daughter has all the personality of an emotionally challenged child trudging through the lines in a school play they are being forced to participate in.
---
Otherwise, I dig it. You may not, and that's all gravy friend.
---
Yes.  This is nothing new.
---
I do appreciate that we're getting fewer posts whining about discounts not being provided to Fallout 1st members these days.
---
I like the chat on Xbox and you can do parties as well if you feel like.
---
OK.
---
Are you placing the ally item on bare ground as opposed to on foundations?
---
I know it shouldn't be this difficult. Unfortunately it's Bethesda. üòÇ
---
Blocking is for lame-os lol
---
Yeet pack is a must in aby PA. So fun and helpfull.
---
Yeah, it sucks how they tell us these things several different ways... I mean you want something, and never bother to check the official site for when it will be available.
---
The bundle was available to everyone before. They brought it back as a discount for subscribers. This is not a new thing.
---
Turning normally available items into sub exclusive items is bad.
---
Given, lack of content had made me stay away from the game until somewhat recently, and lack of appealing content has made me play a little as possible, so I wasn't aware of any issues with FO1st since I didn't use it. I haven't played since well before wastelanders.
---
But I was only shown the fact that normal items are now being placed in sub exclusive territory today. The only skin I want for the PA was the RR one, and my friend had purchased the sub for the scrap box for a month. He told me of the skin bundle, so I logged on to buy it, in anticipation of the legendary perks finally getting released next week, but only getting my hopes dashed as the skin is now only available for FO1st members.
---
A sense of arrival within the context and limitations of this game can be as simple as orienting your camp or at least the public parts of the camp towards the visitor. First of all, you need to determine where people arrive when they FT in. Hint: It's typically north from your CAMP device, but FT yourself to double-check.
---
Next, you want to either orient the "front door" or the public amenities (vendors, crafting tables, etc.) to face in this direction (your door can be more privately located). This saves you from have to rely on lots of cardboard cutouts to point the way or visitors arriving at the back of your camp or in the middle of your garden. Lastly, the place you want visitors to go should be well lit and decorated...its where you show off.
---
Season 2 really missed the mark.
---
What S2 really needs is shoulder mounted cannons for power armour u/valseek but with a new mechanic, to fire the shoulder cannons the player must be yodelling over voice.  
---
I need to witness a SBQ fight with this mechanic.
---
To get the SS underarmor, complete the vault 79 raid.  Acquire bullion/treasury notes, then buy the underarmor plan and shielded plan from Regs.  I dont remember if it is 500 or 750 bullion for the pair.
---
Theoretically, campfire tales and one of the other scout leader dailys have a chance to drop badges, but from what I have read, doesn't happen a lot. (I did the required challenges.)   BTW, the high capacity backpack holds 120#.
---
oh, and healing factor mutation will cut down on the number of stimpacks you think you need to carry.
---
Your problem is going to be when you get in (excavator) PA, all the WR armor and backpack will go away.  You will gain a large amount of weight, and may lose the ability to FT, and will start burning AP to move quickly.  to that end, might also want a piece of armor with faster AP refresh.
---
Thanks for this idea!
---
It's new to me, sorry.
---
It doesn't make it a good thing either way.
---
The point I was trying to make is that adding hairstyles to the atomic shop isn‚Äôt going to cause any more problems than other stuff on the atomic shop so your point is invalid. Yes they could and probably would screw it up but that has never stopped them before and it‚Äôs obviously not the reason for the lack of hairstyles.
---
*sees 16 weapons for sale on icon in a high level area, gets there and none of them are legendary.*
---
Hate it but it's an effective way to bait me into teleporting over I guess.
---
üòÇ
---
Dude, that's not how you sell yourself. üòÇ
---
I'm on Xbox but I'm probably too old. I'm a mom. üòä
---
I'm sure you'll find people you can hang out with.
---
I don't care about the discount, the item being sub exclusive is the problem.
---
It's usually because I spawn in stuck under the foundation.
---
I'd go X-01 just because some of the important mod plans for ultracite armour are pretty rare.
---
As lowlvl stick with the x-01.
---
With the vanilla main quest you should get a full, free ultracite armor at lvl 50.
---
Game is gonna be buggy anyways, NEED ME SOME HUURRRRRSTYLIN‚Äô
---
In general, its much easier to get the mods you want for the X01. Ultracite mods (plans) drop from the SBQ, and they're random. If you ever want calibrated shocks, go for X01.
---
"Hey, you bought this stuff in a bundle last month? Well here's a brand new bundle of all that stuff again, just with 1 new item not available individually!" I'm looking at you, greenhouse.
---
I recomend to use only one. If other player use one near you they stack.
---
Well the Legendary Run is over, so you can't proceed with it any further.
---
You nailed it more succinctly in three sentences than I grasped at in three pages. Well said and I agree.
---
For some reason the roaming robot vendor had both of those clock plans for sale yesterday, but it said I couldn‚Äôt buy them due to my inventory being too full or something.
---
I have that glitch too! I started when I was trying to get the last level of rep for the gauss shotgun which made it super easy.
---
I have had those issues as well, but the most recurring is the not knowing me thing.  Altogether everything is seemingly getting more effed, and while I'm not going to bash, I seriously wonder if there's something going on we don't know, because it seems like they're gradually pissing off more people in more ways.
---
2?? I know about ACP  Earl.. who is the other boss??
---
As someone who has played for 2500hrs without a mic, thank you bethesda!
---
speed demon already maxes your speed bonuses. do you have speed demon?
---
Artificial scarcity has been the cornerstone of the atom shop since it's inception. Just wait until it's brought back to the regular store. Like everyone else has to wait.
---
got it thanks
---
The impostor sheepsquatch??
---
wait the high cap mod doubles lvl 50 backpack?
---
3-4 hours a day every day is extremely unhealthy
---
Which is a dog biting its own tail. If you don't try selling new good hairstyles,nobody will buy them.
---
Judging the hair income efficiency by using the nuke hair and marge simpson, would be a terrible strategy.
---
We need real nice hair for both genders. I'd sure buy them.
---
Bethesda are such idiots for putting wall decor under wall decor. It should obviously go on a separate tab called OVER HERE, RATRODDADEO
---
It's not artificial scarcity. The item is only available for FO1st members now. That's the problem.
---
Junkies would be good. Especially since the prefix has been dubbed "magic" on shotguns and heavy weapons. 
---
You can run full health or low health and prett much any armor you want. 
---
Your level 80 should be fine. The only difficulty would be if you had to respec. 
---
You start at the vault 76 and meet the new npcs there. 
---
There's a few rewards you can get locked out of dependent on your choices. 
---
Do both faction quests up until you have to decide. 
---
I strongly recommend splitting the end rewards. People say the gold grind is hard, I strongly disagree and say the rep grind is far worse.
---
Thanks!  I really got into theme builds and I'm trying a museum right now, so this is great!  
---
Few questions:  North of where the camp device is currently located, or were it is initially located when you set up camp?  I've heard some people say that camp owner spawn is different from visitor spawn, does anyone have a definitive answer?
---
I dont think im gonna play the game every month in the next, subbing for a year is not really attractive to me. But even at 10$ per month is still too expensive, but thanks for the information.
---
Also that's some expensive cup of coffee, just saying. Better be REALLY good.
---
We had such a bug a few weeks ago where the two new outfits coming with the mole miner chests. Their headgear blocked the hairstyles making you bald without a beard. 
---
It doesnt matter if these outfits or hairstyles came trough atx or for free, the creators are the same and adding new hairstyles would force them to adjust ALL outfits and headgears we currently have.
---
Can't you understand this or do you just don't want to?
---
You do earn atoms as rewards on certain ranks of the season gameboard. I think it was around 1,500 atoms if you unlocked all 100 ranks. People ran the numbers early on that you could normally earn about 2-3 times that amount if doing all challenges under the old system compared to the season.
---
I'm not going to argue the value of the unlocks versus the atoms themselves since that is obviously going to be different for every single player. I played for over a year and spent less than 700 of my free atoms in that time vs the people that have spent thousands.
---
&gt; Meaning anyone without the sub are unable to purchase it at the moment. ~~At all.~~
---
There, I fixed that for you. It will still continue to rotate in and out of the shop just like every other item. It's just available right now for 1st members, save your atoms and get it when it comes back if you have to have it that badly.
---
Favourite and equip them to make your guns reload faster üòâ
---
I never considered what we were doing as an argument to consider it that would be an agreement that we both feel strongly enough to be opposed about that topic at hand, all I did was reiterate what I said multiple time to only be met with people trying to provide ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù when I didn‚Äôt want any, to consider others wanting your advice without requesting it IS to be prideful I simply just don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs a minor inconvenience to me that it happened but I got what I wanted and was happy that Bethesda releases a free BP full of great goodies on top of a great update.
---
I‚Äôm not sure why Zorbo‚Äôs position was different for me, might have to do that I‚Äôm on console maybe? Again not sure and I‚Äôm curious if others have similar experiences. Due to this I thought I had an extra day of trying for Deathclaws which is why I didn‚Äôt buy the rank as I only needed one more and I thought I had a full other day if I didn‚Äôt hit the mark. Either way it happened and it‚Äôs done I‚Äôm fine with it and am looking forward to the next one but people obtained a narrative from their own assumptions and I‚Äôm just riding the wave out because it doesn‚Äôt matter if I get downvotes/upvotes they don‚Äôt pay my bills either way.
---
Lmao me? Talk to gramps over here. He hasn't seen human contact in weeks and pounces on the first teenager he sees. Tell him to wipe the cheeto dust off his face
---
the bethdrones on this sub would tell you that you knew the risks involved with going to live in california and it's your fault only and bethesda and todd howard are NOT to blame
---
I actually really want the weight lifting bench for my camp.  I‚Äôm excited about that
---
sadly yes. Had that happen 2 days ago and Bethesda really doesn't reimburse the lost score points ):    
---
I did however manage to get to where I wanted without those points as well. Which was nice
---
I guess this makes some sense, I may even do it.
---
WTF?! $2.50 for a good cup is expensive?
---
&gt; Your level 80 should be fine. The only difficulty would be if you had to respec. 
---
This is why I was looking into builds, to determine if I should respec or if I can make what I have work
---
Sloooooooth.
---
Shit. Yeah, I do. So I just wasted 500 gold didn‚Äôt I?
---
Bah, I never liked Ward.
---
Former raider but talks about how he's suspicious of new people. Kind of makes him seem like a hypocrite
---
Cheers, wish I knew that during primal cuts lol, just stored them and forgot about them.
---
No.the chinese just hacked the motherload.
---
If you don't follow the raider quest line,you can still use the motherload to fast travel from there to the savage divide and back. Not sure if this is a cut or incomplete feature.
---
I‚Äôm a 94 baby js, üòÅhonesty is the best policy my set up is ‚ò†Ô∏è but I enjoy the game.
---
You have to make a shit ton of radium rifles to get the mods. They drop from certain events/dailies in the Cranberry Bog. If you want to keep it but want it auto and on ps4 ill mod it. If not ill buy it.
---
If you had a piece with that legendary and equipped it with your LMG it could unlock the magic damage aspects.
---
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre making it personal I‚Äôm just arguing my point. I‚Äôm not going to continue arguing anymore because I can‚Äôt really be bothered but I appreciate your effort.
---
  Yes, but at the cost of cutting your RR in half.  That's the tradeoff....Which is really bad if you get attacked by ghouls when you are not in PA.
---
My laser rifle reloads in less than a tenth of a second while I‚Äôm doing this and the handmade loads in about a fifth of a second rather than about two.
---
I support your opinion.
---
There are alot of monetary decisions i cant understand or think they are unfair. But things are like that and we can't change it, even with a big shitstorm nothing happens. Complaining about such minor things are not worth the effort or hassle.
---
Silly question but I'm just trying to weed out other possibilities. Is your build menu filtered to only show the items you can craft? For the chicken coop you need corn (just go to the wayward, there's plenty next to it). But even without corn, you should be able to see it in the menu if you filter by all items...
---
From an economic point of view ,he was a brilliant entrepreneur though.
---
Expeditions?
---
Caravan to Megaton. Yeehaw!
---
Mine arrived on the monthly anniversary of me joining. Check your email for your original Xbox store invoice. That should at least give you a date to work with.
---
I found another one of us!  Filthy Casual here myself, spreading the word of the Filth!  Glad to find another one of us!
---
So you don't want to.
---
I don't get it either.  I had planned to travel to the beach over labor day and was going to miss the window as well.  Instead I grabbed my old XBOX and packed it for the sole reason of buying the collectron when it went up for grabs.  It would have been nice not to worry about it until I got home.  A 2 day purchase window sucks Bethesda.
---
I can't buy it. At all. Not unless I'm a FO1st member. I do not have the option anywhere in the store to purchase the bundle.
---
How does that mean I can buy it?
---
afraid so.
---
Youve been Slocum Joe'd
---
I used to think text chat wasn't important, then one day I teamed up with some players I don't know (because of the new public teams). So we were chillin and killin ya know and since they were newer to the game I asked if they needed anything. One of them didn't talk, and I asked his friend if he had a mic. He said his friend was deaf but he could text him (they knew each other irl) and I felt bad when I realized he couldn't participate in the convo. A while back my headset died while still under warranty and for the weeks it took to get a replacement is was frustrating not being able to talk to the other players and my friends. So in that moment I could only imagine how much it must suck to not have a text chat for some people.
---
&gt; all I did was reiterate what I said multiple time to only be met with people trying to provide ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù when I didn‚Äôt want any,
---
You complained and said you felt "cheated", what did you expect?
---
If you just wanted an echo chamber and to vent, there are better places to do it lol. 
---
This is reddit, people use it to discuss. You started a new thread, people reacted to what you said. You can't really blame people for trying to explain to you how to *avoid* feeling cheated, can you?
---
Answered my own question logging in.  The 76 TOS doc is not changed and still refers to ESO not 76.
---
Well, at least I know now, haha. Thanks for the info bud!
---
I do this IRL.
---
It‚Äôs worth trying at least once. I‚Äôve tried it on both of my characters but the legendaries I got were underwhelming. If your looking for something new to try it can‚Äôt hurt.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. Just trade on the market sub for junk. You can easily get thousands of all kinds of junk on there for caps or whatever to have to trade.
---
You‚Äôve been playing fo76 for 6 years? üò≥
---
Edit: Ohhh you meant Destiny huh...
---
I do hope the Rain Water Collector comes back too.
---
I mean sometimes we can make a difference with enough of a shitstorm though.
---
Star Wars Battlefront 2 got a big change.
---
The actually did a lot of work on no man sky.
---
They actually took out the real world ads in ufc21.
---
It's beginning to show that if we actually speak up, they will change.
---
by the time he says that im alllready in the mine kekw
---
I ended up hard booting again and it finally went through, just in time for 2 nukes and 2 SBQ fights!
---
Gave some presents to a level 50 player as a gesture for picking me up right before Earl Died. He then continued to message me and follow me for the passed 3 weeks asking for some more.
---
It was going to do shiny and my camp allies were going to be required to throw themselves at its feet three times a day.  Oh well
---
Also it wasn‚Äôt me that downvoted you. Just so you know.
---
I only get truly disappointed/worried when I see its over a cliff or super tall since I then have to be weary of it being a trap CAMP.
---
Honestly, I go to CAMPs for ammo and junk so I'm never too disappointed with whatever I find. If I find a nice legendary or a plan I don't have for cheap its just a neat bonus.
---
Nice! I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be the only one üëçüèº
---
If your weapon is classified as a Heavy weapon, the perks will always apply. Regardless of the legendary effects.
---
Honestly I wear an outfit constantly. Dont notice the bad paint job. I like paint jobs though because it hides them from scrip machine
---
Nothing. I'm waiting for the instanced bunker we're supposedly getting and planning on going hog wild with that.
---
I just wanted to make a fun post, what type of hair would you like to see in future?
---
This thing got me killed in Nuclear Winter.
---
Someone did this for me during Meat Week and it made a huge difference!
---
anything important?
---
Only available right now, but it was available to everyone else before. So like I said, wait until it comes back like every other item that rotates in and out of the store.
---
Also, hilarious that you're downvoting everyone who doesn't agree with you.
---
You can submit a ticket but unfortunately Beth support is...well, bad
---
True that my friend
---
North of where the camp device is currently located, I believe. In my experience, I FT to my camp slightly east from where everyone else does. I first set my camp down to get the build circle where I needed it, then I moved the camp device to the north side of my building, and people seem to arrive outside my build circle, facing south. You can keep moving the camp around, just keep tabs on where people arrive, and be careful with cliff top builds.
---
Will it be a 1 or 2 storey museum? What will it be a museum of?
---
Were you running heavy/rifle/shotguns before? 
---
I have yet to start a junkies (I have a ton of junkie weapons om my mule) but I really don't see any modifications to a build like bloody requires. 
---
The chem perks kick in when you're on chems but you need to be in withdrawal to get the junkie benefit. 
---
The big choice is which specials you're going to debuff with which addictions (up to 5 addictions)  This won't affect your card load out.
---
Love a free emote. Thanks, Bethe!
---
Or just have it atoms like everyone wants and it used to be?
---
This been a issue for me as well.all the other fallout games I could use a laser rifle as a main for a while but on 76 they are just plain bad.just makes no sense
---
Is it a bunker? All I've heard was that there would be "instanced interiors."
---
And there in lies the reason.
---
The consoles have an existing chat system. In order to have it for PC, they have to develop one from scratch, and it will be something that the console players won't use. So development for something only part of the user base will have access to. That is why it is not a priority, and will only come if one of their developers gets bored or doesn't have enough on their plates.
---
Overall I still prefer the queen. 
---
Earl is nice for ammo and screws and the treasury notes. But I get less flux,no repair kits,no meat, and at this point all legendaries are scrip to me.
---
I have done both. I even just retested this with multiple allies. I placed their items on the ground outside and then inside on a foundation. If it‚Äôs on a foundation they will spawn inside it when you relog. If it‚Äôs placed on the ground outside they spawn within their camp item.
---
They still will not move at all, but you can interact with them (when they‚Äôre not inside your foundation). Their legs go all ‚Äújiggly‚Äù like they want to move.
---
I‚Äôm very curious as to what caused this. The most I did was move CAMP locations. Even then when I initially placed their item it was outside and unobstructed.
---
Do you have proof that it will come back?
---
They never said anything about bunkers
---
Bethesda constantly rotates things in and out of the shop. Right now, the bundle is only available to 1st members, but it will be available to everyone else again eventually just like everything else.
---
Laughing, a ‚Äúdammit Bethesda‚Äù one, a thank you one
---
Why‚Äôd you sign it like bethesda is actually gonna read your post or something
---
GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!! WE DID IT!!
---
Also low salt diet üòé
---
They probably don't want to deal with RMT (is that even possible with 76?) and hire people to moderate things is still my guess. I think it's not there because they don't want it to be sadly.
---
We'll probably still get "highly requested but not in the plans" comments another year or two from now.
---
2000 atoms from the season. 
---
And yes... you could earn atoms the other way... but you wouldn‚Äôt get nearly as much stuff. Based on my estimate of what I valued stuff at it was over 14k from season 1
---
Yeah, I‚Äôll be shocked if I hear back from them. I‚Äôll be even more shocked if their message contains anything helpful.
---
I got the impression that it would be bunker-esq. Like our own personal vault.
---
Xcloud streaming from my Xbox has been the only way ive been able to consistently log-in due to traveling. Idk why the rewards arent just given to us if they can obviously tell we participated
---
Yeah they were referred to as ‚ÄúShelters‚Äù I believe so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they ported some mechanics over from their shelters game. Maybe getting an above-ground vault door which grants entry to an instanced interior which u can expand by getting rid of rocks and whatnot. Then hopefully you‚Äôll get the option for more dwellers too.
---
Doesn't it show "FREE" next to atom shop if theres something free you haven't claimed in there?
---
no eyes too
---
To my be fair fast traveling to my camp has a good chance of giving you a disease. It's in the middle of the lake by  Thunder Mountain and I contract parasites pretty well every time I log in or fast travel to my camp. 
---
I try to make it worth it though. 1c plans (any plans. I don't care, if I know the plan already its of no use to me and better to someone who can use it or needs to caps) , heavily discounted ***legendaries (nothing over 1000c. Again, if it's something I'm not gonna use I want it gone.) and of course 1c ammo and meds, occasionally 1c serum sales.
---
All your mentioned games aren't from the team at bethesda who are in charge for fallout 76.
---
We already got so much shitstorms around fallout 76, the only thing that got changed was stuff they got sued for. Such minor things aren't worth anything since the game has way harder flaws like hackers in the battle Royal, dupers and exploits. Also bethesda don't care at all like we saw it so freaking many times now since the early beta.
---
Fallout 76 isn't a game that's intended to be good, it's more a testified for bethesdas upcomming prestige projects to see which ways of low effort and cash grab works and how much shit they can do.
---
Thunder pipe is the way to go for sure. It's got the retro look but still looks modern. Best skin in the game imo
---
I mean, I dont see it as being available to everyone else. I also can't find any evidence that it will be available later for everyone else. No post or announcement or calendar or anything.
---
As it stands, the skin is a sub exclusive. I can find no evidence otherwise.
---
Dang. Wasn‚Äôt working last week either.
---
Ive noticed this has been a visual bug for me? 
---
My ammo counter reachers 0 then when the reload starts itll jump up to 6-8 rounds.
---
Although i havnt paid enough attention to my before and after ammo count to verify this
---
Lol, way to pre-void unenforceable TOS for European players.
---
But I enjoy the challenges.  I‚Äôve really built up my camp, which I ignored for almost two years due to the challenges.  Plus even before the seasons I would log on, knock out a quest or two and then split.  I feel like a get more out of it this way.  Maybe it‚Äôs just me
---
You'll be able to purchase the chicken coop for bullions once Patch 22 hits, so I would ask for an outright atom refund if you get lucky enough.
---
"Shelters"
---
Ok, that's the word I'll use from here on out. It better describes what I was trying to say.
---
They also talk about "spamming in chat" and such...while we in 76 don't even have any of the features they mentioned.
---
Pacifist mode?
---
Don't start again and waste your progress. I rather change the build instead.
---
Yes, this, you deserve all of the upvotes
---
I tend to play no mic/eyes closed, so this will be heavily used.
---
I notice details, and actually at least skim "I agree" statements.  *shrug*
---
not even alot
---
every 5 levels 150 atoms?
---
seems fair right.
---
Their business model is to sell ATOMS for money.  They aren't going to cut into the profits by giving them away for free.  That's why they stopped doing it in the first place.
---
It wasn't a harsh comment, I didn't take it as such.
---
As I said previously this game will mean something different to everyone and I think what you're hoping for is consensus but you're not likely to get anything near to it, just look at the discussion boards around the upcoming damage nerf, some think it's a good thing, others don't. The player base is a broad church and just about everybody I'd wager wants to play the game their way but I truly believe that Bethesda tries to accommodate the wishes of the community. For example changes have been made to the daily and weekly challenges in the next season to better accommodate casual players who felt a little left out in the cold on the last one. That's a real positive step that I think will benefit everybody on the next round and should be taken as evidence that Bethesda does listen... occasionally.
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but, wasn‚Äôt this bundle already in the shop like last month or something?
---
Am i The Only One Waiting for Screaming Eagle To Come Back (Handmade Skin)
---
While I appreciate it because I do, in fact, use a Bunker Buster, it is annoying.
---
If so, that's awesome. My CAMP location is already set up to add that.
---
Holy cow I want new hairs since launch! Idk if you're into fallout 4 mods, but there are so many awesome and great hairstyles available. My personal favor would be something with longer horsetails or a variety of shoulder long hairs, at least some new styles so not every character looks similar or identical.
---
I had 3 characters, but 2 main ones 1 rifle, another heavy/shotgun the 3rd was pistol but I didn't find that as fun.
---
I agree with all of this and thank you for posting it. Way too many people drove themselves and others crazy during the legendary run due to FOMO and bad math.
---
NPC.
---
Wastelanders.
---
They changed the game and added in npc to the game after a fairly large backlash about their being none in the game.
---
Considering one of the main selling points was that there wasn't any npcs, and that you could be the raider, or the settler, and that got changed, I would say quite the opposite.
---
There was backlash about npcs, so they changed the game to add them.
---
lol who da f wants a pioneer scout badge anyways
---
Do you mean in 3rd person? Yeah I don't know why it's like that, same with xbox controller, but it's different/correct in Nuclear Winter which makes it doubly strange
---
Ammo converter.  They are worth a decent amount of points, just collect and turn them in.  
---
Just like arrows and crossbolts in most peoples vending machines that are 1c each and are worth 6 points each.  Buy and convert.  Haven't made ammo in 30 levels now.
---
76 doesn't have a lot of QoL type things ESO does.  I'd love to have my lowbie I'm going to side with the Raiders be able to access everything in my main's scrapbox, for example.
---
Not really worth it, still fun to kite all those wendis though ü™Å
---
from my experience, PA is not enough
---
What's the big deal?  Unless you're in an event it's not a problem, and you have to redeem it to get the helmet everyone was bitching about no having
---
Have you noticed how a lot of things in the shop say "X days left?" When that gets to zero, those go away, and new items are added in their place. The Slocum's Joe bundle for example, it was first added to the shop a couple months ago and has since left and came back multiple times. One of those times, it was for 1st members, and now it's back for everyone again. That's just how the Atom Shop works.
---
Edit: sorry. I don't know why I fixated on junkies. 
---
The proceeding question still stands. 
---
The only cards that have been added are for bows so your current build should be valid. 
---
I mean other than you probably don't have a full fleshed out build yet. I still need certain cards for all my characters and all of them are ober 100.
---
When does Season 2 start?
---
Emote would be better if had no mouth instead of dumb cringe eyes.
---
&gt;The seasons do make me feel like I have to play (sure I'm doing it to myself).
---
Doesn't qualify as doing it to yourself when the system is designed by bethesda and like every other developer they are well aware of the psychological impacts
---
I've definitely distroyed them
---
This and there are not so popular mods that can do text chat for PC.
---
I know that they add things and take them away all the time. But this item is currently in the store.
---
But only for subscribers. Not for anyone be else.
---
1. It's a "long journey" because bethesda made it that way
---
2. No, people should dive into the math, especially since that will be crucial in revealing any progression rate changes bethesda tries to make
---
3. But the shills say bethesda/zenimax can't survive or keep servers running without microtransactions!
---
6.  Lmao, no, don't buy into the fanboy/shill threads that try to pass off this battle pass grind trash as in any way acceptable
---
7. Made possible through catch up/bonus events bethesda got pressured to hand out after all the shit they got for the auto complete bug (that they never fixed)
---
8. "Natural fomo"? There's nothing "natural" about something artificially placed in the game with the entire point being to pressure you to spend money for time savers/progression.
---
&gt;don't turn it into a job.  That's not bethesda doing it to you
---
Funny, what a disingenuous statement that denies what these battle/season pass systems are designed (intentionally) to do to you psychologically.
---
All tips on informing people how to maximize xp gain/progression/etc are always good though and really are the only good point made here.
---
You could make a lot of these arguments atleast remotely workable if bethesda agreed to have all SCORE challenges be ALL/only weekly based so that players would have a lot more flexibility for playtime with their schedules instead of always feeling pressured to log in daily.
---
4a.  If you see challenges to place your CAMP 1-3 times in a NW match, do those since you just have to log into the game, and throw down your CAMP the required number of times (open Pip-Boy, place, open PB, move a little to one side and place again, open PB, and place your CAMP just a little to the side again).
---
If you're okay with spending a little time in NW to try the other challenges, look up info on how to complete the challenges asked for.
---
\--lockpicking: on the Morgantown map, there is a safe in the large crashed airplane at the airport, and a safe in the wall behind the front desk at Bolton Greens
---
\--use stimpaks: try to pick up as many stimpaks as you need and then find medium-height cliffs or other high places to jump off of or a creature to fight against, then stim to heal
---
\--kill a creature: you can VATS creatures in NW so just get as close as you can to a hound/mongrel, ghoul, bloat fly, or something else small, and VATS away!
---
The hardest challenge for non-experienced players will be to kill a player.  This is the one I and most people tended to skip last season.
---
Np, me neither. I don't care about interenet points or having only happy and friendly conversations. My idea of reddit is a platform to point your opinion, facts and controversial discussions.
---
Okay? Then they can take a rest. No one is forcing them to grind. I'm just saying it should have gone literally this extra week until season 2 starts, would have been nice for those people who were only 10 or so tiers away instead of cutting it short for no apparent reason
---
Console players already have versions of text chat. Not sure the ratio of PC vs console players, but I assumed that it only really benefitting 1/3 of players, as why it was never a priority.
---
I would have to rearrange some things at mine (just up the hill from the Welch train station, with Murgle the cat) but I think I've got the space for it.
---
I was?
---
1. they are heavy
---
2. fallout 1st gives you infinite storage space (for a small price of 9,99 a month)
---
can you do the math?
---
TBH, I do.  As a VATS build, the AP refresh could be hiding behind almost anything so I have to read Every. Single. One.  Trust me, the only person more bothered than the guy behind me is me.
---
1 and a half:  mainfloor museum, top half floor personal "employees only" area that will still be accessible. I tried 2 whole stories and it was just too sparse.  Smaller camps tend to work better visually.
---
Real life Battle of Blair Mountain is my theme.  I might have to wait for mannequins to fully do it, but I've got a whole King Coal - Company Store - Matewan Massacre - Miners March and Rednecks represented with displays and signs.
---
This is very useful info.  Thank you for this wonderful contribution
---
now that you say it, every time I pay nw I think it somehow feels better. I almost never play nw so it didnt realize that the controls work better there.
---
An echo chamber here at reddit where one of the most synonymous things with it is the term ‚Äúhive-mind?‚Äù Reddit is used for all sorts of things to limit it down to only a tool for discussion is like saying that YouTube is only there for Jimmy Fallon, I don‚Äôt use reddit but I see why others do as it‚Äôs a sinkhole of information that those with a lot of free time can get lost in and escape reality for a couple of hours.
---
People can respond however they want but when they get invested in it is when it goes from downvoting and moving on to trying to prove a point where there‚Äôs none to be made, you can argue that you can try to make one but when you can‚Äôt get frustrated when the person doesn‚Äôt want it and just repeats the same thing at you. Like I said, and I‚Äôm not saying to take this personal, but I really don‚Äôt care.
---
Yeah all the new players i befriend are shocked when i eat a dead body after helping them and giving them stuff. Cannibals aren't bad people
---
Because they just ported FO4 energy weapons, they were pretty bad in that game too. If you didnt pick up the perks for energy weapons. And since the science perk cards in 76 only allow you to craft and mod energy weapons instead of boosting the efficiency and power of them you are left with lack luster light show guns.
---
Won't happen.  We'd just bomb through the board on day 1 using atoms (they indicated this will be possible going forward) and spend the rest of the season farming more atoms.
---
Looks like criticism isn't very welcome in this sub.

so my instigating, 40% PA damage, 1+ str DCG is a legacy, sweet
---
I don't know how many different ways I can explain it, dude. That's just the way it is. Keep your Atoms and buy it in the future when it becomes available for non 1st members, or don't.
---
No filters on the menu.  Tried while holding a bunch of corn too just incase.  Nothing.
---
Isn‚Äôt this a big deal, Zeni runs ESO, and Beth ran FO76? What does this portend for the future?
---
Dsmn.that makes a lot of sense.
---
Really like that camp bundle. The table and chairs and fireplace all look great. No problems with them either, they all actually work.
---
Don‚Äôt worry my hoarded recycling will get us over the line
---
Patch 22 can eat a fat one. Short sighted nonsense.  ‚ÄúBalancing is complicated‚Äù oh please bethesda, i can name a dozen online games with far more complicated damage models, they‚Äôre just lazy.

This changed recently...I was logged into the PTS the other day and there were 3 daily and 3 weekly challenges related to Daily Ops.
---
Unless you have some sort of schedule to show it coming back as a normal item for everyone, I find it difficult to believe it will return as a non sub exclusive.
---
2.9 - The best as for me.
---
Nah its definatly coming out with either patch 23 or patch 24 whenever the brotherhood arrive in appalachia. Gonna be an atomic shop item
---
Right now the 15th
---
Saving atoms for mannequins and power armor displays.
---
What you are talking about is only visible to the other people on your team. Sometimes other people may try to talk to you that aren‚Äôt on your team and can‚Äôt see that little icon you described.
---
I think u need all 3 to get plans
---
Ever use vital junk resources to ‚Äúrepair‚Äù about 50 of those cameras before learning that you can‚Äôt sell them or give them away? ::uneasy laugh::
---
Hmm... I thought that location was part of Jen's quest.
---
Scouting for areas where I won't need to worry about Lv. 100 Mole Rats.
---
They haven't addressed this in the upcoming rebalance at all.
---
You compare lacks in relation.
---
Sure, huge mayor requests which even got mentioned at certain gaming magazines are a thing, but such small minor stuff like sales for subscription accounts are not. 
---
Also wastelanders was planned from beginning, if you knew the history of fo76 and its rushed release along all the cut content we know its still an disappointment. The marketing hype from wastelanders was overwhelming fake and disappointing. Look at the official wastelanders trailer, its all fake. No gauss minigun for the quest line available, heck not even the jetpack they showed is Ingame (check the scene in front the wayward, its a different as we have). Its fair to say that wastelanders is just cut release content they added later on.
---
yeah nobody really cares that your AP/honors and your not that special because you work out really at this point your bringing up claims that most people can relate to and that doesn't make you special.
---
my point exactly
---
Ah good I'm not the only one that immediately thought it was the bloodshot eyes.
---
Fair enough. üòÇ
---
I'm level 233 and still figuring things out. Like changing perk cards around and what they do.
---
Sounds cool! Remember that your second floor doesn't have to have the same footprint as your first floor. You could make the main museum a wall and a half tall to make it a grander space (barn and contemporary sets have half height walls with windows), and then stack an info desk &amp; stairs under the living area in a 2-storey block.
---
I put my shower..... In the bathroom
---
With sink toilet and bath.
---
Weird huh
---
Yes, I had to scroll though and read all of it, I then completed the exam afterwards. I had a team of Zenimax officers at my door soon after to search my apartment for duplicated items. They only found a case of nuka cola but confiscated them üò¢
---
Once they finished the body cavity search they left, not sure I want to play FO76 again, I feel so violated.
---
I know,  yes.
---
The weeklys and dailies are probably tied to the live servers, but my concern is more the new repeatable challange. Public events are capped, they dont spawn frequently and only offers half the score.
---
it wasn't the guy with the DCG. it was probably someone with a magic weapon.
---
they're bugged and can kill bosses like that.
---
I'll admit, the difference between such a large scale amount of content and a simple sale are fairly different, but my point still stands.
---
If you push, and you make a shit show of it, they will change. It's up to the players to decide what is and isn't a big deal. Not the devs.
---
Im not sure if that is a statement of understanding for my position or questioning for me even stating it at all. Regardless I agree.
---
Sorry to hear this but thats Bethesda for you. I signed up for a month of 1st a while back and they billed me right away but took 4 days to activate my membership (Remember back when they had the issue when everyones 1st went down for a day?) cuz of issues. Of course my membership ran out 30 days from when I PAID not when it was activated, I lost 4 days. Typical.
---
lmfao
---
I get the feeling it will be something like the prefabs they already have, maybe similar to the bunker, but it has a cellar style door inside somewhere leading to the interior cell. That‚Äôs kinda how i see it working most likely, I don‚Äôt really see them giving us a vault style door. If it‚Äôs a bunker it would only work going straight down
---
On PC and had it just come up.
---
I've seen that jiggly leg thing.
---
I'm not sure what causes that.
---
Sorry dude. It's very frustrating.
---
September 15th
---
It‚Äôs coming next week, pay attention in school Edit: clever award
---
Yes many did apparently.
---
See what‚Äôs funny is that I can‚Äôt even joke around. Ya‚Äôll are tight asses.
---
I figure the "Deep" will be fleshed out in a DLC somewhere down the road. Jen's Mom was pretty clear that there were other agents in the area....more dangerous ones.
---
No text chat option makes no mic a hard sell. Once you go mic you cant go back. Give it a shot!
---
Everything rotates back into the shop eventually. Play long enough, and you'll see it at some point. If you don't want to believe that, that's on you.
---
For me vats has never work
---
Thank you, I have been. I was checking during our five minute breaks.
---
Psst I‚Äôm quoting the game...
---
Well slap my ass down with a burrito filled with Cajun Rice &amp; Beans, Ribeye Steak, and Boneless Grilled Radstag, another week where I can save my Atoms until that Contemporary Bundle returns.
---
Me too, more people coming along to public events sounds great, especially if it means some of the trickier ones (encryptid, project paradise, radiation rumble) actually get decent turnouts. I hope that is indeed the repeatable for season 2. Treasury notes, scrip and SCORE all from the same event would be really nice.
---
I do get that it might mean less SCORE for those who had 30+ intelligence via unyielding &amp; assorted buffs to grind XP as fast as possible, but folks should remember that not every player was doing that. Only Bethesda has the data on how many people were doing what, but I can't believe the 10,000 XP gain in 2-3 minutes mentioned above was the norm in the playerbase.
---
I thought Casual teams were being switched to be like the Building teams since no one plays on them?
---
Yes, welcome to the atom shop.
---
Oh no I‚Äôm talking about all the downvoters lol! Your cool man
---
I'd suggest something simpler - if you're wearing Mothman Cultist clothing/mask have the Mothman Cultists be non-aggressive to you.  After all, if you're wearing the uniform you likely are a cultist?
---
Alright man. Take the side of the 30 year old neckbeard. Geez, and I thought redditors didn't like "nice guys"
---
Just wait until November 8th, this game will be a ghost town
---
As it stands, I'm looking at a shop item that is available to only subscribers that was once available to everyone. And no one can show me when it will be available for everyone again.
---
Aw someone jealous? Did I strike a nerve?
---
I have an instigating limb beararms, 2-3 hits and the queen rips.
---
Could be any magic weapon aswell for sure.
---
One wastelander nerf will hopefully nerf this shit abit.
---
why didn't you buy it yesterday?
---
Don‚Äôt worry, all the Enclave kissasses downvoted me too üòÇüòÇ
---
he most likely had an instigating deathclaw with a sneak build.
---
It'd be interesting to have an "Overflow" reward system now that the repeatable has been changed.
---
dude, you need to stop, you replying further is just proving my point even more
---
Rule 3.
---
There are many other fallout related subs to post memes. This is none of these.
---
Its not ‚Äúfree shit‚Äù when youre still playing a shell of a game 2 years post launch.
---
Good idea what do u think the most wanted serum recipes are?
---
Ward is only literate in lying, glitches, and bugs. The mistake was on us assuming he was literate enough in English and other languages.
---
It begins...
---
Dude fucking agreed!
---
You could try tagging the community managers!
---
I missed a bunch of days including the first double score week and still managed to finish.
---
What time is it there now? I‚Äôm eastern USA time are you +4 hours ahead?
---
Nice...will work wonders for my Fixer and modded shotgun. :)
---
you lose some you win some sorry that happened to you, TBH though it's just a reskin of the raider one with new lines. that's it no big loss unless your camp is just UNCOMPLEATE without it.
---
Yeah, those blood eagle flame birds and people placing those tone generators. Side note: put your vendors in a visible easy to find location.. Not up 10 flights of stairs behind a secret wall under a tree stump.
---
The run ended about 4 hours ago.
---
Maybe not, but he got behind earle before I was within shooting distance.
---
I dislike having to play "where are the vending machines hiding in this camp?"
---
Proving what? If fat soy men are gonna start shit they better expect a fight. Not just gonna sit here and have people insult me
---
Also Valley Galeria and Wavy Willard's.
---
time gate= no new players getting the things us high level worked for.
---
Magic weapon? Im sure i have one but what effects do i need for it to be "magic"
---
&gt; Reddit is used for all sorts of things to limit it down to only a tool for discussion is like saying that YouTube is only there for Jimmy Fallon
---
What--?... A discussion is literally just the action of replying to something that somebody else said and being replied back, which is exactly the features offered by Reddit. Whether it's a video, an article, a debate, people reply and discussions ensue regardless.
---
The fact that in order to post in a thread you have to **reply** to someone (or the original poster), that you can *quote* and whatnot basically screams "discussions". The minute you post something, people can react.
---
For a reddit thread to be something else but a discussion, redditors would need the power to lock their own thread to prevent people from replying... That or for you to *not* reply to people.
---
If you want a place where people can't respond or react to what you say, you can make your own personal subreddit though... But as far as FO76's subreddit is concerned, discussion around the thread's subject is basically what it boils down to.
---
&gt; but I really don‚Äôt care.
---
You keep saying that but your actions say otherwise. You cared enough to question if I was part of Bethesda and to continously reply in this thread. 
---
If you were true to your words you would have stopped responding a long time ago, by yourself. But you keep replying and repeating you don't care. Over and over again. It's a clich√©. "I don't care but let me tell you why I don't care so you can really see how I really don't care" is how you sound.
---
You're not too different from the people who responded to you. A true redditor :-)
---
i didn't log in and i assumed the week when there is no season events they would give a chance for people to rank up, as the majority would not spend atoms for the first levels as they are easy, logically you would keep for the last harder levels.
---
is it a legacy BE?
---
Yeah its not the wifi is straight up the HDD optimization for the game. With a SSD it doesn't happen.
---
Thanks as always and it looks like I'll be dropping a grand tonight!
---
Still no space cat or garden cat
---
LOOOOOL my dude if you were enough of a chump to "work" by donating scrap you could have used to "the brotherhood" then I thank you. I got AAAAAAAALLLLLLLL the rewards and didn't donate a thing.
---
instigating  ( maybe limb damge also , but im not a wizard) and a sneak build with the required perks
---
I bought extra atoms, i did not even like the power armor üòÇ
---
So basically you're calling your self a fat soy man, you need to chill, and your ego is too big for your own good? Seems legit.
---
Because no one here works for Bethesda. We don't know what is going to be available when anymore than you do. If you really want confirmation that it will be available again at some point, open a ticket with support. I doubt they'll give you a concrete date, but you might get a, "It'll return to the store in the future."
---
what do you mean?
---
I started when it came out the didn't play it in till about a week was left. Oof me
---
That I'd be cool with. Although, just having a door frame we could build around would be slick too, giving us a little wiggle room for individuality.
---
It's sad that you didn't get to finish but you've had several weeks to buy ranks. And you've known the end date (i assume you knew the end date and if you didn't why not?) for longer than that.
---
instigating, junkie's, stalker's and/or 33% vats, limb, bashing damage on high rate of fire weapons. it's tied to your framerate and latency as well it seems.
---
I care about what I have to say not much about what you say, you call it a cliche I just call it the truth it isn‚Äôt baffling that I don‚Äôt care about you, don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre saying I downvoted you I don‚Äôt care enough to do it but I do find it funny you care enough to look out for that, I did take a gander at your history though. Fun stuff
---
I'm not going to message support, just so they can tell me it's now a subscription exclusive.
---
I wouldnt mind this at all.
---
about 5 hours late.
---
Oh, nice.  I wasn't sure, so I broke off just in case.
---
Damn I thought they would do 1 more day. Is the purveyor sale live?
---
I thought I saw somewhere that Bethesda was going to offer a lot of the SCORE rewards for purchase with gold bullion in the game.  Isn't that what you're looking for?
---
same I didn't donate anything after I donated 1500 steel only to realize that the crates were just re-skinned present's I gave it up and nuked it three times and went to fallout 4. I did come back for the rewards though
---
Fireproof was never a straight immunity, only a 45% redux.
---
PvP
---
Congrats but nope, the real grind is rolling a full set of SS armor with the right legendary perks on it...
---
You don't get the year's worth lump sum of your subscription all at once, assuming you bought a year-long subscription. It will be paid out incrementally, once per month, on the day you started your subscription initially.
---
BE Gatling gun
---
It happens to me everytime I am in the Earl fight, no other time except for earl
---
you're
---
then I'm guessing it's what the other guy said. plus it stacks with dense on your torso, have you changed your armor recently?
---
The in store description makes no mention of it. Open a ticket and ask for a refund since the website is advertising something not available with it.
---
no not really I work out and I am in honors too so uh yeah I don't put myself infront of others saying I do better then you so i'm right and at this point your just being a dick
---
Ok.  Something has changed.   I have been immune to explosions and my gun and exploding sentry bots for months.   Thanks
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. You don‚Äôt need to even see your team mates. I only see mine if they‚Äôre at their camp while I use it for cheaper/free fast travel.
---
Building an underground camp beneath the sparse sundew grove with my alt. Loving how the particle effects from the plants are taking over my underground shop. Basic layout is built, just need to decorate everything and run wiring.
---
I do that every time when i hit 30k :,) Burning money can be productive and wholesome ‚úåüèª
---
Then continue to complain about a non existent problem, get mad at the game, move on, and miss the bundle when it's available in the shop normally. Or play the game if you're having fun and save your Atoms to get the bundle you want in the future like a normal person.
---
They made many posts and notices that today, at noon, that would be the end.
---
In which way it would keep the inflation low? It would cause the opposite effect.
---
Dupers with millions of holiday presents or mole miner buckets will dump them all into their capstash, resulting they will have millions of caps instantly. Also without loosing caps there will be even more caps around forcing inflation.
---
Dude. Seriously, go read the news on their site. Reddit isn't the official place for official news.
---
Yes I have changed it but I don‚Äôt think I was wearing dense.   I guess I‚Äôll have to experiment. Thanks
---
i didn't buy ranks before because i wanted to spend atoms only on the last levels as they are the hardest, and you're right, i knew the end date and that there would be a "cooldown" week before the next event so i assumed wrong i thought there would be a last chance to level up my rank, it wouldn't be the ned of the world if i don't get the remaining levels, and it's my mistake not Bethesda obviously.
---
Starts Thursday, as always.
---
Wait, seriously? RIP to me then as someone who mains plasma weapons
---
I was just asking a simple question to a fellow Reddit or no need to get hostile my friend.
---
Well. you know for next time =0 
---
ALTHOUGH i think they should add in maybe a day or two for people to buy levels. because at the end of the day some people may actually spend cash on atoms.
---
If you can only take 10k out once a week or so from an extra 30k idk how that would jack inflation up more. People already want astronomical amount of caps for items. And the presents can all just be removed from players if they have more than a certain amount.
---
If you do get stranded somewhere, you can always travel back to Vault 76 for free, as well as your CAMP.
---
I know that if your friend has something (like a rad barrel) and you don't they can build it at your camp. Can't the same be done for the BOS Collectron? Its at least a decent second place
---
Still scheduled for September 15th, like it has been.
---
Actually I went from an unyielding chest to Vanguard to try it out.  That has to be it.
---
If it's ending on a specific date wouldn't one complete it Before the listed end date? Expecting a different outcome just seems unrealistic to me. You had weeks to complete it, you skipped the last day, and now you're upset you can't go complete it once it's over? C'mon.
---
This reminds me of last night, someone launched a nuke for queen. Well the majority of the server got there and then some dude one shot the queen (or close to). Noone got shit, some chick just screamed "WHO THE FUCK ONE SHOT THE QUEEN YOU ASSHOLE". I was sad I missed out on the queen but it still made me laugh.
---
Lol same
---
I've always wished for access to this info. They know it but likely won't show it. I imagine of the chains are lifted from this game and you can do private servers you'll see this info on said server. For now though there is no access to this info
---
I really enjoy my legendary ultracite gatling laser. Named it "Toxic Jim"
---
I'm a BE heavy/shotgun user, and I think i'm immune to damage when it comes to my ballistic weapons, but the Gauss Shotgun and Gatling Plasma kill me instantly. I'm pretty confused on the whole fire proof thing as well because I find myself immune with everything else except my explosive energy weapons
---
Quad doesn't increase damage, it increases dps (damage per second), just like it always has. The way it does this is increasing the ratio of time you can shoot versus time spent reloading. As such, it is multiplicative to damage dealt over time. Currently, so is bloodied, and very few weapons get +80% or higher dps from quad, so it's a no-brainer. But post-chages, bloodied is additive, whereas quad wont be. 
---
Two shot, on live, fires off two rounds that each do 37.5% reduced damage, netting a total of a bonus 25% (62.5 + 62.5 = 125) again, currently the damage reduction is multiplicative on live. Again, post-changes, its additive. So in the above example if you were doing 460% damage with the bloodied build, if we remove the 80 from bloodied and the 37.5 from two shot, you get two bullets dealing 342.5% damage. Which if they both hit, is more than 460.
---
As for stealth. Currently it's bonus is multiplicative.  Post changes, its additive. On live, you lose about 60% total damage when you drop from stealth depending on your sneak damage perks. After the change, you just lose the 150% additive damage. Again, from the above example, it would drop from 460% to 310% damage. Much less than 3/5 of your total damage.
---
Please dont comment on how the changes actually work anymore :D
---
Won‚Äôt work here unfortunately, this is an atom shop freebie.
---
Because BGS says so....personally, I think Ghouls would make sense - since there are already non-feral ones around.
---
I'd
---
I haven't had that since I started using a wired controller about a year ago. I thought it was this game bugging till I started getting it in other games and found out there's an issue with microsoft's bluetooth drivers that cause it.
---
Camp plans are $11.  Recipes are $5.   Weapons/armor plans are $50.    Mr handy Buzz saw and mole miner gauntlet go in the trash.   Still drowning in plans.
---
I missed a week and a half and possibly another week's worth just for ignoring a month or so of "Join a group" and "Complete an event in a group" dailies. I still got to level 100 with a few days left. I must have gotten the XP bonus maybe a dozen times too, didn't bother grinding.
---
Creating a new character to level up and double SCORE helped a lot.
---
Too bad I don't build my CAMP and I rarely use skins, but it was that FOMO.
---
It‚Äôs not a huge loss. Just annoying as I‚Äôd been waiting up for it.
---
u/Ladydevann seriously there's got to be a better way.
---
&gt; I care about what I have to say not much about what you say
---
lol, sure, keep lying to yourself about this. You keep replying even three hours later. So much for someone who doesn't care about what I say.
---
Either way, you should have said so in your first original post, would have saved you (and us) lots of trouble and time.
---
Speaking of truth, your entire thread and this latest post screams "narcissist", but what do I know really. ‚òú(Ôæü„ÉÆÔæü‚òú)
---
Or instead. Offer classes like every other mmo
---
Finally I can use my nocturnal rolling pin (Napoleon dynamite YESSSSSSS)
---
you know that mission that came with wastelanders where you had to use the assaltron head, you know the legit worst weapon in the game. I feel like they did that early on to get new players to think, "Oh boy this weapon is amazing" so it would be used and not cast to the void. they try doing the same thing with the missles in your inventory, low levels get them, have no idea that the weapon they go to is worthless, then the low level gets the weapon sees in his inventory that it does 405 damage he get's happy but then wonders why he can kill a tick with it.
---
they do it to bring attention to the fact that there are more weapons out there to use, it's kinda like a manipulative trick, but what ever
---
But this didn't happen yet and probably won't. Bethesda don't remove items flat around all accounts anymore.
---
Let's say you can draw 10/30k each week, this means stuff will become even more expensive since you are able to spend 40/60k at once.
---
We should need something to sink our caps into, but that won't work aswell since people are greedy natural.
---
There‚Äôs always dicks on anybody‚Äôs comments anymore. So I‚Äôm sure he was just doing that. Sorry for what you had to deal with. Hope everything works out for you.
---
What? Actual ammo on the wendigos of your type being used?
---
Am I the one running Dodgy?
---
Sadly the run ended a few hours ago, and the sale starts on the 10th and ends on the 14th. Not sure why all the people on here are upset with you and being rude :( not everyone checks up on the news so I understand, good luck on the next season though, hope you complete it!
---
Damn son you sure you can handle all that raw power 0_0
---
Effort.
---
If I could somehow give you one, I would.
---
how is 20 minutes of a 2-3 hrs playtime grindy? 
---
Fuck if it was WOW id say yeah sure grindy AF but eh
---
If you use chemist and super duper you can make a a LOT of diluted stims to sell. I find myself not even needing to do that though because since ACP I find myself regularly over 150 stims and almost 100 super stims. I can clean out the vendors from their daily caps without much issue.
---
Thanks man
---
Backwoodsman #3 and Science Expert Level 2 both reduce material costs to craft.  If you do both setups BW3 &amp; SciEx2 then G&amp;B5 &amp; Scrapper, costs 22 steel and scraps 22 steel. RIP all those circuits &amp; Nuclear Waste though.  I'm at 44/45 Radium mods, twice a month I craft 100 and get zero mods still.
---
You‚Äôre welcome. Again sorry you had to deal with that shit and I hope Bethesda brings stuff back.
---
It does make me wonder why they didn‚Äôt make the story more like elder scrolls where different races and species are available. 
---
Like I get that they wouldn‚Äôt be in the vault, but they could easily added some sort of cut scene to explain what happened. 
---
Obviously making new perks and new character styles would take much more resources, but I do agree they missed the mark with that.
---
that would be also great, but if this week when there is no season challenges it would be nice to keep the ability to rank up with atoms until the next season starts
---
Oooo baby I like it raaaaaw uh shimmy shimmy yaw shimmy yam shimmy yay
---
Only there have been many many posts on this this. Do read Reddit? If you don‚Äôt then again. Dude read. 
---
Gamers complain about literally everything. And the majority of time they have no real reason.
---
In your case it looks like you spend most of your time in the market forums and porn Reddit‚Äôs. 
---
So yeah.
---
honestly, who's completing that quest, every time I see it gets completed I check the cranberry bog only to see that it's deserted.
---
Not hard for them to use the same setup like eso. Have a universal stash box for any of your characters to grab and add from. Also a bank to store currency for any of your characters to take from and add to but Bethesda being stupid hasn‚Äôt thought of that.
---
XD
---
What rank were you before auto completion?
---
and it actually looks good
---
Hell my girl and I nuked it last night for the first time(xbox) and we spent the whole time waiting for him to come out of the ground or to stop floating 10 feet in the air being stuck in the ceiling stomping around like that. We failed obviously and it ruined our session as it was late and to say it pissed us off was an understatement.
---
**Finally**, now you're being coherent.
---
I dropped all my plans to 100 caps or less.  Ranging from 10, 25, 50 or 100 depending on how much I think it's worth.  All food recipes at 9 caps.  Alcohol / chem recipes from 19-49 caps.   I may be selling some too low, some still to much.  I never know.  I'll see what sells and what don't.
---
I used to keep 3 machines full of plans, but I was just so overloaded that one day I dropped one plan of each I had to a new player and dropped the prices and now only one of my machines are dedicated to plans/recipes.  I keep a spreadsheet of what I have in my machines and when I put them in, so I can keep track of what doesn't sell so I can either drop the price or pull it from the shop.  
---
I also completely stopped selling mods because I've never had anyone buy one.  And you won't ever find a mounted plan in my machines.  They're everywhere and always overpriced.
---
It 9pm over here. I will be on at 10pm my time in an hours time. Will you be on then?
---
There‚Äôs really only perks for Bloodied bc Junkies just requires addictions to get the buffs. Sure, Chem Fiend and other chems related perks could help duration and a little damage but mostly the addictions is all you need.
---
For Furious, you can run anything... You could even use Furious with Bloodied Perks or Mutations and you‚Äôll be good. Furious itself is like a perk because it stacks with every shot.
---
Heavy gunner will help with your gauss mini gun.
---
Commando or Rifleman (if the handmade is automatic or not) for the handmade or fixer  
---
The problem is that the perk are in 2 different SPECIAL categories, if you want to use 9 points in each (9 in Strength and 9 in Perceptions for each full levels, regular, master and expert, of the perks)  you will need to keep other SPECIAL points to lower levels.
---
So I‚Äôve got two fixers and I go in and shoot earl when there‚Äôs no minis around and then when they come I switch to my prime one and focus on them. It‚Äôs not every one that drops your ammo (50% ish I feel) but it‚Äôs one tap to kill them and they drop around 30 plus minus rounds
---
uh what?
---
I don't know why they don't add it for everyone, ESO has it. Its better than nothing on Consoles
---
* 9 If you have to make a post like this to defend all the possible short comings of seasons, you know something is wrong.
---
Do you have proof that it won't? See I can do that too.
---
The season is already ready and nothing will get changed without massive poopstorms.
---
I already posted the new repeatable challenge got nerfed. We are no longer able to collect 100 score for 10k exp, we now get 50score each public event (half the amount for something you cant farm).
---
Yep three letters should be easier to read for you, now are you gonna keep going or?
---
totally  agree, well next time stupid me will never assume anything and just stick to what they say
---
Jesus you are clueless..
---
I‚Äôll prob be eating dinner but as long as your on for at least an hour it‚Äôll be good I‚Äôll be on around 11pm your time of that works for you
---
I started Season One way, way late. I still made it up to the Bugs in a Jar lamp. Not sad about not getting the rest.
---
I know, I have a bloodied LMG. I meant  that I don't think they're rare.
---
Riley, how does one wasteland impact pvp?
---
They could figure out a way to balance it somehow, they figure out the cap limits, I'm not the best with math so theres sure to be a way making it really limited but still viable. And if thwy had taken care of the dupers hardcore the first time and after it wouldnt be as big of an issue. Just doing a whole IP ban for the players account. And its also impossible that bethesda would ever give us an actual cap sink. If they made scrip purchasbale with caps and increased that limit a little maybe. Says 1000/50 and bump the limit from 150 to 200. Or put in a machine to reroll one perk on a legendary (and only ever that one perk) that gets more expensive each time and start out at a couple thousand
---
Well I‚Äôm at least happy that the 10k xp is gone, grinding events is much easier
---
I noticed that after i purchased it, I should have double checked the description in the atomic shop! To be fair I thought I was safe to assume it was included because of their description on the website. I opened a ticket so here‚Äôs to hoping they remedy the issue ü•Ç
---
This is correct, I don't think I do :) especially taking into account legendary perks? which I need to research more.
---
The only reason I played for any amount of time recently was because of the atlas event. Then the community showed me [why that was a bad idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ibut8t/i_tried_i_really_did/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and now the company is giving no reason to shop here.
---
The only reason I still hold out hope is because of the legendary perks. I'm just glad they are finally coming [next week](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/43yHXVVJpIawuxYldcXIvi/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-season-2-preview-new-s-c-o-r-e-board-rewards-and) so I might actually have a reason to play again.
---
I was actually thinking of buying FO1st for the release of the perks, but now I would never buy the sub.
---
Meme weapons. Do a nocturnal rolling pin
---
Cheers, I‚Äôm kinda a heavy/commando build but it was more about the furious legendary effect for the weapons. If there was a perk card that helps when using this type of legendary.
---
The backpacks are usually skins and require the ingame tadpole or possum backpack to be unlocked.  I‚Äôm assuming you have already unlocked regular backpack ?
---
Yeah, the fact that it's currently in the store as an exclusive purchase for subscribers to FO1st.
---
&gt; Yep three letters should be easier to read for you
---
Coming from someone who couldn't read the game's news on the main menu HA! Good one :-)
---
And yeah, I'll continue to reply because unlike you I'm not really a hypocrite with my intentions.
---
Because of 76 I actually want a mic just to decline people's item offers and if they make remarks in NW.
---
Thanks for this.  I made my chest dense and now back to zero health movement on the bar!!
---
Fireproof plus Dense (or Padded) on the chest piece should protect you just fine. Have you changed your chest mods recently?
---
Too late
---
Still waiting for the day I open the shop to see Mr.pebbles backpack
---
I grabbed the icon then changed back to the SS on, you know the one I earned, feels much better than those half-assed ones the keep adding in, like honestly what is the point of having so many?
---
it might seem strange but i like supporting companys that make a good product, i bought F1st when i looked back into the game and found it well rounded so far, a propper fallout etc
---
I will be on till 11pm my time as I‚Äôve got fifa games tonight also.. I will be on for an hour between 10-11. So if your on I will help you if not I can always help you tomorrow
---
ah ok well good luck with what ever comes next IDK
---
am not upset or complaining i know it was my mistake, but it would be nice if they give people a last chance in this "cooldown" week, and it would only benefit them as people will spend money on there game, my post was for them to take this in consideration if not this for the season, next season it would be also great.
---
Is it? Well, good luck "grinding" public events that wont spawn or no one cares about like radiation rumble, arktos pharma and so on...
---
Ammo count in the thousands, two to five caps each.
---
Forgot when night starts but it ends 6am. Maybe someone else can tell you when it starts.
---
Dang you got me! Good one bro, love the emoticon but sure I‚Äôll spare us both and block the defender of the Last of Us 2, sucker of Neil Druckmann‚Äôs taint. Keep asking ‚Äúwhy you‚Äôre getting downvoted‚Äù :^)
---
Not a problem if I can get on earlier I will if not let‚Äôs get up tomorrow my gt is ProzacPromises shoot me a message when ur on and I‚Äôll add you
---
It's for ANY public event. Not just the Treasury Note ones.
---
I thought it was 9 pm to 6 am. I believe it says on one of the perk cards
---
That's good info, thank you. I never really messed with the magazines until I heard I could "quickly" level up an alt account by crafting meat cleavers and using that magazine to get all the mats back from scrapping. It turns out it takes an actual eternity to level up this way but it was worth a shot üòÖ
---
I'm going to make it work if it's the last thing I do. Might do that today If I can find one
---
&gt;  block the defender of the Last of Us 2 sucker of Neil Druckmann‚Äôs taint
---
... I hate the game lol
---
You couldn't even get that one fact right about me :-(
---
Here goes another parent that still behave like a kid.
---
They are, Casual is now going to be what Building used to be. The void left by Building is going to be filled by Daily Ops.
---
And this can include ultracite rounds? Also of my specific type being used?
---
X-02 / APA skin (however you wanna call it):

Both are work in progress.
---
Inspirational for xp buff, bodyguards if anything. Strange in numbers will buff food... Buffs. So the trick, the new meta trick that prolly wont get patched, is to run herbivore and herd mentality, and have super quick ap/hp regen w dodgy and be low health but with like ~260 hp cuz of herbivore + strange in numbers, and what else? The well rested perk, rejuvenated I believe.. With herbivore you get poison resist as well, and if you got absestos lining on torso, lead lined (for the radiation resistance) backpack, and fireproof max, you can pret much stand in the falling embers at CP, ntm the born survivor subsitute.
---
However, of course, if you are low health sneak you already have high agility and max sneak and escape artist, and can minmax dps without much defense, save throwing three in blocker, for examp, when in CP, so the wendigo bitch slaps dont do diddly dang nuffin.
---
I might be leaving out some other info, but mr. Angry Toitul covers a great deal of what I'm paraphrasing here. Overall, more health is better than more DR.
---
6pm to 6am is "night." Whether the perk actually works correctly is anyone's guess, but that's the timeframe it's supposed to.
---
It is not creating a  itemsmod.ini  for me. It says its opening the mod when I press "O" but no file in /data... I have SFE installed and other modes that uses it works. What am I doing wrong? :)
---
Night is considered 6:00 P.M. and 5:59 A.M. in your pip boy under the data tab, that's when it works.
---
every one playing fallout 76 is stoned, I know because I always have my mic on area and you will be surprised by the crap I have heard, drug calls, babies crying, angry wife, etc it gets loud
---
I‚Äôm calling to police, we have a homicide here
---
I got rid of most of my common plans, now I  spend a few hours on the weekend finding rare outfit plans like the civil war uniforms hats and clothes, which I sell for 3000 caps each. I only need to make about 6 sales and then I can buy a new serum plan.
---
It just works and I  only open my vendors for a few hours a week now. So much more time to explore and kill things
---
No man i run with 1 strenght for bandolier and with maxed stealth perks.. so melee attacks aren't a problem for me, they never see me
---
I'm going to say it, the Imposter Sheepsquatch is overpowered.
---
I'm just trying to save for the contemporary bundle
---
Ok will do. Will add you in an hour üëç
---
My atoms are safe and so is my time. Not even feeling the need to log in for once. Thanks Bethesda!
---
Yeah, no one plays together. I wave at teammates when I see them at events or in passing and that's it. Don't let introversion/social anxiety keep you off of teams. Join up!
---
I think you‚Äôre absolutely right.  There‚Äôs a clear push to maintain forward motion, and bug fixes are lower priority than new content and revenue.
---
I wish they‚Äôre take our suggestions seriously this is an awesome idea
---
Thats not the fucking point... the OP is whining that they deserve more free shit, this guy is backing up that demand by rationalizing that they do deserve free shit because they're paying a subscription to play the game... no one is paying a subscription to play this game.  Thats not how 1st works.
---
The fundamental problem is you want to provide more caps to players. Having a higher amount to spend for everyone is literally the definiton of creating an inflation. 
---
Sidenote: they already use ip bans for rmt traders, but since vpn is a thing...
---
We have a capsink they tested out with sunny who grants us goldbullions for caps, but bethesda noticed that players are mostly too greedy to use it or they dont care since its too expensive.
---
I only use 3 magazines, Backwoodsman 3, Guns &amp; Bullets 5 and Tesla 5 for bosses. I have 10-20 copies of just about every magazine, I usually give them away on PS4 to help players complete their collections.
---
xbox here Todd#6521
---
Yes Please!
---
I built Ultracite first as I had access first. Then decided to swith to X-01 for the jetpack. Defense-wise there's not much between these walking tanks.
---
Platform?
---
ü§î
---
That literally makes no sense. It's like you're immune to seeing how flawrd your logic is. Until you stop blaming the environment for your own lack of ability, you won't succeed. Get good scrub
---
You dont just give shit away anyway? They can't use the equip but everything else I just kinda dump.
---
Then we dont have an actual capsink people want to use
---
&gt; flawrd
---
No, not legacy, just rare. You can still get them from doing a 3\* melee roll at the purveyor. Just not from mobs, events, or the mystery pick.
---
with the trade off of not having all 200 fire rate weapons be magic (no 15% block), no plus 15 to all stats, no life saving, power armor needs that to compete with SS armor
---
Because they have said something about it?
---
It's consoles fault.  They've directly come out and said during a past interview that the majority of people playing the game are on consoles rather than on PC and consoles already have their own native text chat options and console players tend to prefer voice chat.
---
Yes keep thinking they are trash and giving them to me for free yessssss, laughs in bloodied missile launcher!
---
Unfortunately... learn the difference. 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/wRbFs3isUcOl1cZlp3ulb/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-public-events-preview
---
I also did the pts testing. Only public events count, like it says in the pts repeatable weekly challenge.
---
Never feel obligated to play a game but if it helps I missed the first 2 weeks, another week while on holiday and was busy during double score weekend and I still made it with only buying 5 or 6 levels right at the end.
---
I know, Doctor Lecter is one of my heroes üòâ , an incredibly intelligent and sophisticated character.
---
true but still.
---
The camp skin was a Legendary Run award.
---
I think the legacy explosive energy weapons are just more powerful.
---
This whole thing is very true. I am a herbivore and eat lots of cranberry products. Between that and a few other mutations and chems and whatnot, my exp output was enough that I finished like, over a month early and then I was bored for a long time.
---
You spam stims in it. No cooldown. Add in team medic and you become a healing beacon.
---
Like I said above yes ultracite of what you‚Äôre using. Not plasma cores though. Prob fusion either.
---
Honestly if they allowed this period between seasons for us to buy levels and earn atoms I would finish. However I can't lol
---
I was advised to take the marsupial serum then apply the level two starched genes perk but it still only lasts for an hour
---
As far as I'm aware, it's 6pm to 6am.
---
They changed the day-night cycle to make daylight a bit longer, but deliberately did not adjust what counted as "night."
---
We don't need a higher cap limit, we need more cap sinks.  QOL cap sinks would be great.
---
There would be no point in them setting and end date then. Their cash grab was the last couple of days before it actually ended.
---
Because instead of having classes you're allowed to already pick whatever weapons, gear and skills you choose to use?
---
You would seriously prefer having less choice over your own play style and be forced to conform to a specific build?  You pick "warrior" when you create your character and you're stuck with high Strength and piss poor firearm skills for eternity?
---
Ok thanks everyone.
---
Nope the best thing is to get one Power armor user to grab all 3. Equip first aid 3 and the team medic card that causes stims to spread to nearby allies and you can just spam stims. While also being a healing beacon to help allies tank the boss. Usually it'll only take 15-20stims sometimes less if you have good teammates.
---
Get the scrapper perk. Kill stuff. Pick up weapons. Scrap weapons. Repeat.
---
I‚Äôm sorry that ppl messed up and thought they could but seriously ppl asked on reddit for two weeks when the end date was and that they needed to buy ranks before today and I posted on multiple ppls post that they clearly said to claim or finish the run before today and I guess no one listened because this isn‚Äôt the first post today about it
---
Im level 16...
---
Line in the sand. Loot everything. Scrap all with scrapper perk. I net around 1100 steel scrap every time.
---
Oh yeah I‚Äôve had it for ages!
---
Go to locations which spawn lots of enemies who carry weapons, pick up all of them, and scrap them with the scrapper perk
---
Yeah I think maybe I argued with you a while back about the atom nerf not being that bad, but really it's just that it wasn't bad from my perspective. I didn't account for the fact that I was hardly doing half of the atom challenges because I had 1st atoms coming in and didn't need to do all the challenges to buy everything I wanted from the shop at the time.
---
Now with this new system I'm still able to buy 90% of what I want without buying any more atoms, but there's been things I passed up because I won't buy more atoms than what comes with 1st. Having the option to get that last 10% of stuff I wanted by earning atoms in the game would have been nice considering the cost of 1st should include enough to buy whatever I want from the atom shop but it doesn't.
---
The people without fallout 1st really lose out though, because you can't even buy one atom shop bundle for 1500 atoms with what you get all season.
---
They really need to add a few atom daily and weekly challenges back in that run all the time.
---
I used to do that grinding West tek during the legendary run, usually got about 500 steel per run, might start that again
---
Upvote for brutality
---
Certainly much faster than server hopping for cans?
---
This. Do the walk of shame with 1500 pounds of loot on you to the top of Fort Defiance. 1-2k steel every time. Got 2300 last night
---
I left a paper bag with a single fertilizer and Molotov on the doorstep of the guy who was selling legendaries for 5,000 to 15,000c. They weren't even great 3 stars.
---
Grahm and Gail would be good allies too. Ra-ra with Bunnabunn would enjoy the action too.üòÅ
---
Who said anything about not being able to choose? Ffxiv does a great job with this
---
For duping?
---
XB1
---
Not gonna lie, I mainly do it because it's easy and there is a nuka cola machine which is always loaded because no one loots it
---
Because it's more complicated than you think?
---
If you choose to be a super mutant how would you feel about only having access to specific cosmetics designed to fit a super mutant's model?  You'd fucking hate it.  So instead Bethesda would have to design additional cosmetics to fit whatever body types you have for any "races" in the game which means more development time and slower releases.
---
Also how exactly do you think playing as a super mutant would work when interacting with npcs for quests and missions?  You think you could just saunter into Foundation as a super mutant and ask Ward what's up?
---
Even playing a ghoul would be complicated, as Eugene puts it "Folks would rather shoot us on sight".
---
...
---
yeah they introduce the premium feature system of ESO (while even still missing some parts of it) for the same price as the original version in ESO and don't deliver any of the game's QoL features like being able to increase your general stash space, shared stash or even those storage boxes that don't count towards your stash...or at this point even text chat.
---
No I run all of those except Iron Clad (which is a waste) and lone wanderer  which doesn't work when on a team.  I run in a team (even alone on a private server) so I replaced lone wanderer with strange in numbers and Suppressor rank 3.
---
I love fish n chips! Or is it lore breaking?
---
Just the image, they've made a habit of showcasing items that aren't included.
---
Uranium fever is bad either for steel.  Definetly Line in the sand.  Westek run but go a little slower and grab everything else along with the weapons.
---
 ‚ÄúAnd some **things** that should not **have been forgotten were lost**. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, Barrens Chat passed out of all knowledge.‚Äù
---
Do you know how many mods can you apply to your chest piece, especially if we are talking about the SS armor? I would like to have dense and asbestos at least.
---
Very kind.
---
I assume they count as containers, you need to loot 60 containers in another area to get the first ones to respawn.
---
We also have Grahm and the other Super Mutant at the Crater
---
If you need any help/ supplies, a new gun or armor etc... don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out, been playing since day one on XB1 
---
GT: HotDropDaddy
---
September's fallout 1st item is the armor workbench skin, not a camp skin.
---
No, because now people are whining that there aren't any challenges at all and how they DESERVE a week of challenges that give free atoms.
---
It gets old after the 1000th time.
---
Yeah dodgy only works well if you don't use VATS or run. If you play bloodied heavy guns with power armor or sentinel armor dodgy is good.
---
I tried it once on a bloodied commando vats character and was frozen in place with no vats the first time I came across a scorchbeast because it drained all my AP.
---
Whenever I hear it I'm always reminded of my mother.  Thanks FO76
---
How about something like a nw briefcase for a instant nuke to buy for something about 10-15k caps?
---
Perks apply separately to the ballistic and explosive damage portions, if I recall correctly.
---
So the heavy gunner perks will apply to the base (ballistic) damage of your weapon but not the explosive damage.
---
Similarly, the demolition expert perk will apply to the explosive damage, but not the ballistic damage.
---
They will stack together as well.  That said, the explosive damage is 20% of your weapons base damage, as I recall.
---
So assuming a base damage of 72 ballistic damage for a max level gatling, you should be getting \~14 explosive damage. (I do not recall if it rounds up or down, as the actual number is 14.4, so I round down to be safe)
---
This means, with no perks equipped, your gatling should be dealing around 86 damage per shot on your paper doll.
---
5 points in demolition expert nets you +60% damage, while all three Heavy gunner perks (9 points total) give +20% to non-explosive heavy guns (not counting the explosive legendary trait) for a total of +60%.
---
This should net you \~115 ballistic and \~22 explosive damage per shot before resistances and DR come into the calculation.  Again, I assume it doesn't round up.
---
I think it's a nod to the O'Mahony style restaurant that was built to be sized and shaped the same as a train car, which was how they were shipped. A complete diner setup, just add food. Built by the O'Mahony Diner Co from 1915? to early 1950s.
---
I have been changing things around yes.  I just learned about the dense working well with fireproof.  It‚Äôs all good now. Thank you!
---
Whitesprings, wavy willards and valleria dont give enough Rice and Beans! I want more and more and many many more. Cajun Rice and Beans is life and is all i want for Christmas
---
My camp.  I built it by a steel node, so I just empty it whenever I go back, and make ammo when the stash gets full of steel.  I don't have to farm and carry around weapons then, and switch perks to scrap them.  Sorry, it's locked though.
---
Yes plx!
---
Apparently in Bethesda's world deaf or mute people don't exist.
---
*Youereerrrerrree, atckually
---
I saw a post someone had to change their ports on the router to get it to work. Crazy.
---
To clarify.. do you mean changing your group type to event... or switching to an event team.
---
Cause switching right at the end does nothing beyond like 25%.
---
Switch as you start the event to give the system time to sync (that lil blue bar) so you get full bonus
---
When we get the ability to cripple her again, the battle shouldn't drag on like it currently does.
---
But she's still a sad excuse for a boss, especially after Earle.  Mostly because for 95% of the battle, she *doesn't do anything*.  Think about how often she actually attacks a player.  Any player.  Most of the time, she just flies in lazy circles around Glassed Cavern, oblivious to whatever is shooting at her.  She is the world's most uninterested final boss.
---
I hope it's an actual standalone power armor rather than an atomic shop item
---
Perfectly said. If I had gold it would be yours.
---
EGG HEAD and HERD MENTALITY with level 3 Class Freak helped me finish with almost a week left after Bethesda suspended my account for about 2 weeks during the ban wave!
---
How am I calling myself that? Are you illiterate? How is my ego too big lol. Im literally defending myself
---
someone's salty. What about AP/honors classes you said you were in?
---
Oh... I didn‚Äôt realise that was a thing
---
All items you can pick up (excluding stuff from container) have an shared amount to respawn. If you pick up 180 items after you picked the flower it will be there, if you are too close to the spawn switch servers.
---
I farm wood this way, it doesnt matter how long you wait, its all about picking up 180 other items.
---
Oh okay sorry, thank you for helping me be not blind
---
No youre not and no you don't. Youll never be like me. You're weak.
---
They said in their last AMA after the steam migration most players are on PC now.
---
Again... you're asking for LESS choice...
---
You don't have to pick whether or not you're going to be a Warrior or a White mage or whatever the fuck else you want to be at any given time.  You want to help heal people?  Equip those perks.  You want to focus on pure damage?  Equip those perks.  You want to do some of both at the same time?  Do you see where this is going?
---
Since the challanges are down on live server, and the only ones available are ones exclusive to the pts, then maybe we will have 2 repeatable options. I wouldn't start hating now. Wait till live servers are updated and you see how it is.
---
I knew about that, I was thinking of a different item, thank you though
---
Idk but if you correct peoples grammar on the internet there is just no hope for you in real life.
---
That's such a perfect skin for those who are into the NCR and they tease us with it. Wow. Thanks for the info.
---
I kill raiders on sight. Sometimes i kill scavengers if they talk funny. Boy am i waiting to kick some metal asses of BoS
---
Glad to help.  I'm one trophy away from platinum myself.  I just need someone to stand in front of me and allow me to kill them 19 times.... I suck at PvP.
---
They really want people to buy that spring bundle
---
Changing group type to event
---
Sure, I hope so aswell.
---
Why do you think I hate? I'm just concerned since I belive bethesds would do such a stunt without any doubt, but I didn't hated about it.
---
They just fixed the wording on the site, BTW
---
I‚Äôd love to take down large mobs/hordes of enemies with a friend or two. It would be cool if we could pick from a range of difficulties and load up an instanced session with our group and the rewards would scale by difficulty. Kinda like if they were rai‚Äî-oh wait.
---
Bait.
---
do we have a release date for season 2?
---
Site says it as been unlocked
---
damn bro, just tryna help you.
---
No youre not lol. Seethe. Youre most likely the other dude on some alt account lol
---
Nah i see an incredibly passionate person arguing about something completely pointless Lol.
---
Yeah, they updated
---
AAAAMerica!!!    
---
Tag it in something you need it for and use common sense. There's usually some steel near every workbench.    
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Steel\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Steel_(Fallout_76))
---
I probably read your comment with the wrong tone in my head. Happens to me all the time sorry
---
Relax, dude. I am asking because I can get those 2K with a Bloodied lever, but not a Bloodied Fixer. 
---
2000 is too much, even with multipliers, for a single shot with the Fixer. I don't want EVIDENCE, I want the multipliers you are using to test it myself. Having all unyielding SS doesn't make a difference in terms of final ranged damage, btw.
---
Because Bethesda doesnt want to invest in mod√©rators for this game ?
---
I use an AA shotgun 33 vats with 3 in con fire and suppressor for stealth. If you can make it work for longer range, I'd say keep it. Havent messed around too much and observed from more than mid range since i use my long scope out of vats and found i can snipe headshots with the shotty that way too
---
bubble up as a result of being boiled?
---
thank you I agree
---
I was done with the run probably like a month early and that's including the time I had a whole week of challenges auto complete. Along with a full day of dailys. 
---
Its a grind but its a slow manageable grind that isn't hard.
---
When you finish early is when it feels like a grind.
---
NEVER A DOUBT, GET 'EM OUT!!
---
Ofc, there isn't an option we can't beat the goals, even if not a single person ever donated anything. What a community challenge would it be for such a game that shows how much the community screws the events they make up...
---
The whole event is set up. People donating more then 120mil of one resource and upload a time-lapse spamming the button for hours while resupplying each few minutes and the bar didn't show it for days.
---
I for one crave some variety in my complaining. (That said I was very sympathetic to the poor player that missed the BOS collectron cause of wildfires and they should bring it back for them)
---
I was hoping for the PA display racks.
---
What?
---
Ah yes finally something good from the atomic shop! And it‚Äôs free!
---
Not only you... xD
---
Bloodied unarmed build 100%
---
I sided with the Settlers initially.  Now I hate them thanks to that bastard Ward.
---
Here's a note. Burn in hell Bethesda.
---
I am completely relaxed. I simply said I will show proof of it so you can see for yourself. When I hit a ghoul it‚Äôs 2k but not all the time. I will put my build on here when I get off work. I don‚Äôt get why you have to keep spelling things capitalized, maybe you need to RELAX!
---
Yes, two coins per rank.
---
I just do what I normally do and get whatever rewards I get. I‚Äôm not busting my ass to get something like Ghillie armor that looks like trash
---
Concentrated fire in vats also adds increasing damage per hit.  I use it with a furious fixer.
---
Thanks for doing what I'm perfectly capable of but won't anyway
---
I want a Secret Service outfitt
---
I recently attempted to run an explosive build for shits and giggles, as I run a heavy build normally. (no reallocation of special needed)
---
It was triggered by me getting a two-shot missile launcher.  I threw on a targeting scope and quad barrel...and actually had fun with it.
---
Not an "oh my god this is incredible weapon," but the targeting scope essentially negates the accuracy penalty for two shot, so I was able to hit things with it at a decent range.  And paper doll damage had it at 1150 damage...so not too bad.  Unfortunately the durability was absolute trash and I found myself relying on a broadsider for anything that I didn't want to absolutely destroy.
---
That said, firing it at the feet of a horde of ghouls and watching them evaporate was *VERY* satisfying.
---
If you're going to passive-aggressively bitch about a service, at least try to be right about it. The infinite storage that 1st gives has nothing to do with ammo.
---
Yeah, and having atoms as an overflow reward introduces a whole bunch of problems making players think they HAVE to rush through the SCORE board as quick as possible to optimize their play creating a worse skinner box than we have now. Having non atom rewards is nice and not going to make or break how you want to approach your SCORE journey.
---
Not for ammo you loon. 1 + 1 doesn't  equal 9.99$
---
I had a sixth sense to check the board last night, even though I've been done for a couple weeks.  Sure enough,  one of the spots was unclaimed. Always good to check that shit
---
you're and you'll don't forget those apostrophe's and commas dude.
---
 No you're not and no you don't, You'll never be like me, You're weak. 
---
I might be stealing this but doesn't seem like your in AP classes, And ruining someone's self esteem does not seem like a smart thing to do and if your going to attempt it try harder next time because quite frankly you suck ass it.
---
I just need around less than 200 script so both my characters can have 1,000 script. 1,150 when I turn stuff in.
---
So tomorrow I'll be getting around 46 total weapons haha with probably if I'm lucky 2 good rolls and 0 God rolls haha
---
Too late.i already finished second season.honky tonk man at the wayward hooked it up for some caps.
---
I was a concentrated fire level 3 for 200 levels, and one day I decided to start dropping stars.
---
Now I am concentrated fire level 1, and there is no real, tangible difference.
---
I can feel the burden being lifted from here
---
Seethe: "Verb: (of a liquid) bubble up as a result of being boiled. Example: The brew foamed and seethed." is that not what you meant?
---
Huntersville &gt;West Tek&gt; array&gt; Harpers ferry. They‚Äôre all close together and usually have super mutants, sometimes scorched in HF. Loot all the guns and keep scrapper perk equipped for the random workbenches you find. If you reallly wanna streamline it, get a set of full Weapon Weight Reduction armor so you don‚Äôt have to stop and scrap. 5 pieces max out at 90%WR
---
Yes, almost all of them.
---
I dont use proper grammar on the internet man. Im not trying to compensate for being an utter tool like you lmao. I am in AP and all honors. Sowwy if I hurt your feelings on reddit . Com
---
Seethe means stay mad
---
Hard to find true newbies on a forum. I do wish you luck.
---
I walk longer, until I reach the entrance to the tunnel. That asylum is creepy.
---
He phrased it strangely, no punctuation. If he‚Äôd thrown a couple periods in there it wouldn‚Äôt require a re-read.
---
Non hostile super mutants were the exception to the rule.
---
Somebody from bethseda replied to a similar post a while back and said they would bring it up to the team about new hairstyles
---
Furious is good only with VATS and Concentrated fire because after a while you won't miss any shots especially if you have high AP and roll a -25% vats use. Unless you never miss.
---
Order of power goes: Bloody, Junkie's, Berzerker's, Instigating, Furious, Anti-Armor, and the rest.
---
? what dictionary are you using? im using the Oxford one.
---
I like how you had no argument to the counter from the guy so you went ahead and said your idea was pointless
---
If it's any consolation.. it's kind of a passive aggressive dick. Str 15, calls me weak. Disses my camp. Keeps crying about stepping in ghoul guts.. I earned that meat pile and I'm not removing it pal!
---
I've never been able to consistently get spawn points work right.  I wish they'd figure out some way to allow us to use the spawn mats again in some way that can't be exploited by griefers.
---
Because it is really. He is right, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that at the end of the day this whole conversation has no purpose.
---
I just saw someone else said it happened. I only play 76 like them so I wanted to give that a try
---
Damn I didnt notice that seen lots of screws and random junk but nothing .
---
Slang: type of language that consists of words and phrases that are regarded as very informal, are more common in speech than writing, and are typically restricted to a particular context or group of people.
---
I had to double check as someone killed me in a workshop today. That only happened during challenges. Now I have no idea why they did it. Other then to be a dick.. "Oh no, not my junk and 50 caps! How could you!!! Oh well.."
---
I sell all my plans for 10 caps. I don‚Äôt want them so I might as well get rid of them. Chems and serums are my caps makers. I am even selling the ACP plans for 10 caps. Just don‚Äôt want them in my stash anymore.
---
They need to make the dallies harder even if I get the same amount of score/atoms there just so boring you get them done in like 45/60 minutes tops
---
I've soloed it in 51b with aa handmades used alot of stims but got it done cause no one showed up to do it rip.
---
Such helpful tips, thanks. /S
---
It does not appear for me.
---
I have triple checked, every category in wall decor, frontwards and backwards.
---
 Can someone please tell me which category in wall decor you see it listed in ?
---
nah you didn't hurt them, anyways I'm gonna go do some work fixing things if I'm a tool so see ya later. sowwy we can't keep talking
---
Every way is more efficient than that.  Do events like Uranium Fever, Jailbreak, Radiation Rumble, and Line in the Sand.  These events all have lots of enemies that drop lots of weapons.  Put on the Scrapper perk and you'll be swimming in steel in no time.  Move your camp to a steel resource node.  Take workshops (have you heard of Grafton Steel Yard?).  I suppose you could even put on an excavator PA and go mining for steel ore but really, with everything else available, that's only slightly more efficient than picking up a few tin cans and server hopping.
---
"restricted to a particular context or group of people." there is no context as to which meaning of the word "seethe" we're using here, so you using the definition of slang to prove your point doesn't really work here. Anyway, I have better things to do with my life than to waste it arguing with a fucking dumbass child like yourself.
---
Sell it to a vendor bot for them sweet sweet capos then scrap‚Äôem
---
Yeah, I spawned in the foundation and had to port back to my camp.
---
Alright man
---
Keep seething
---
Interesting username....
---
Lmao seething
---
Exactly. I‚Äôm pretty sure someone can peg me on those ToS because of my GT.  But if it‚Äôs fine by Xbox, then it should be fine with ZeniMax. And I already have a salty downvote bot/baby.
---
It would be nice to throw missiles and mini nukes like grenades, as suggested by u/Mondraverse in this thread.

Less damage, more mess than if using a launcher weapon, but I would gladly carry them with me in that case.
---
The first soup is always free....
---
You should try the corner screen trick. Aim a half screen away from the target (in 3rd person) and fire.  wait a split second but fire right before the cursor hits the target
---
I feel like the legendary special cards do this, in a roundabout way. I‚Äôm able to use 5 extra perk points once fully maxed out. So if I use that on intelligence, it lets me move my perk points to charisma. Now instead of 4 charisma I can have 9. I‚Äôll be taking the 3 point team medic (your stimpacks also heal teammates) and 2 point field surgeon perks as a heavy gunner. Since I now have 9 charisma I can share the 3 point card team medic. This allows for everyone to constantly heal each other in hard situations like earl fights. Sure we can just stack fire and poison resist if we want, but this will save the lives of those lvl 18s who wander in. Not to mention my own since I play bloodied.
---
Totally worth the atoms
---
I will keep stay madding just for you buddy.
---
It‚Äôs definitely NW. I also have more success breaking out of Appalachia after NW.
---
Yep got a bloodied 40PA +1A Deathclaw gauntlet a few days ago. Couldn't get a single offer for it on a popular trading website, which I found quite shocking.
---
I usually wipe out the SMs at the prison courtyard, dam, and steel mill. Takes maybe 20 minutes and I can do it with a pistol. Lots of hunting rifles. The prison exterior's workshops have a bit of steel as well while you're there.
---
I‚Äôve always loved the raider outfits and still use raider gear outside of PA. Usually 3 star raider chest pieces which I like the best. To me it looks more post apocalyptic than most of the clothing, especially the settler type clothing. 
---
I don‚Äôt kill settlers on site because sometimes they give you stuff, so I use them for that so technically I‚Äôm neutral but really just an undercover raider. I look forward to stabbing the settlers in the back one day when it‚Äôs worth it.
---
I second this! You should try sending a ticket or something. This is just fucked
---
If the best you can come up with is pointing out a typo, you really are hopeless.
---
How many perk points does it take to fully max one out in the current system?
---
I just waddle inside to the elevator and hit the 4th floor. Nice and quiet.
---
can you get it for atoms? I think it might be offered for bullion next season.
---
I missed it too, I took a break for about 4 days and came back last night thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs still there‚Äù and nope, it was gone. I donated for it too.
---
And your gun ain‚Äôt suppressed so now everyone within 100 yards knows you‚Äôre there.
---
Can I just have a floor/wall bundle?
---
Finally, someone with the guts to mention this.
---
Knowing bethesda and their inability to program anything properly , this is most likely an unintended side effect.
---
The invisibility effect is kind of pointless and doesn't really do much as far as enemy detection. Unyielding armour or a sneak build will make Chinese Stealth Armor a glorified Hazmat suit and nothing more. Unless you just enjoy being invisible. There are no others Armors or clothing that have the same effect
---
Is the Drifter Outfit just a recolored Blue Ridge Caravan Outfit?
---
Nope. AFAIK no armor will make you invisible while moving other than the CSS.  Chameleon only works if you stand still.
---
Thought the same, let's hope not :-)
---
Welp, that's some BS. Just realized I missed it too.
---
I‚Äôm sorry to hear you got banned
---
Yes, exactly!  And since the ring of Mara toggles on and off marriage benefits would be exactly the way to integrate actually being able to get a buff playing with, say, my actual spouse.
---
(Not having to roll a new character for when we're both playing there makes me both hopeful and worried about One Wasteland)
---
Are they even live yet? I know most things don't work right but usually they are released before the pitchforks come out.
---
Thanks! I was more upset than I would have expected
---
I'm confused. They said it's only public events then you said learn the difference and posted a link about the public events. Am I misreading?
---
Happened to me and another buddy of mine that I was playing with at the time
---
It starts Thursday - you may need to burn some ahead of time :)
---
 You might be able to get something for a non legendary radium rifle.  I've purchased those from people before.
---
They said they'll eventually do that, but it's anyone's guess when that will happen.
---
How about a ‚Äúsorry, trade glitch‚Äù emote
---
How do you change the group type?
---
Where's the "I have a mic but don't feel like being social.... Ever" emote
---
They'll keep doing it because it works. No reason to change when it's free and easy money for them. 
---
As long as people are still playing the game, they're also perpetuating the problem.
---
Did line in the sand last night, came away with almost 1100 pounds of weapons.  Did the walk of shame to Watoga train station and made bank.  Will head to the vendor when I get on today to sell the leftover
---
Yes, it goes up when you miss, making it more likely to hit the next shot.
---
Suck on these irradiated bollocks!
---
Yes. Yes. I must have this emote too.
---
This game DESPERATELY needs a hairstyle update!! And personally, I would appreciate hairstyles for women that don't look like they came out of a circus act. 
---
I don't care what century we're in, women will ALWAYS wear bangs and a pony tail...come on Bethesda, show us some love here!
---
And scout armor skins to Thorn armor!
---
" ‚Äú*The act of selling, trading or sharing your ZeniMax accounts or content acquired with the account is a violation of our Terms of Service.* "
---
The vending machines in game AND the player trading mechanism clearly break this.   Clear out your vendors, boys..  The sheriff has spoken.
---
Seriously, they need to update this clause.
---
Dang. Hopefully it's sometime in the near future.
---
I absolutely love my AAE Fixer. 
---
I keep thinking about trying to find a handmade with the same prefix.
---
Also let us have the back when we kill wendigo spawns!  It's a travesty that I get all other ammo back but them...
---
Indeed and iirc there is also less gear degradation in the ops,so we can go wild.
---
Glasses cavern......if you know. You know
---
No, nobody buys them
---
Huh! I didn‚Äôt know that, thank you. I do enjoy being invisible though, if no other reason than it just feeling nice and for RP reasons of a stealth build. With almost all of the stealth related perks, my stealth build is extremely OP, but dangerously weak in end-game events where there‚Äôs so many enemies, so I may have to invest  in another build I can switch to for those. Thanks again.
---
Homeboy, you're not worth my best. 
---
I'm not arguing with some vehement little fortnite kiddie about balance and how netcode was tacked onto a 20 year old singleplayer RPG like this shit's somehow the epitome of well-balanced gameplay and a standard of design integrity. I've seen a lot of heated shit-talk from a dude who can't spell so it's clear you're more busy looking for a fight than a discussion.
---
Or "I like talking to people, I just don't like talking to \*you\*." :-)
---
Wow...
---
Create a level 1 alt and then give them intelligence buffs seems like an easy way to do that.
---
I thought I had until today to claim it. It said Sep. 8th. Thats kinda dumb to end it less than halfway through the day. Why am I going to log into a game before I go to work?
---
Even if we don‚Äôt they‚Äôll just give it to us like they did with concrete
---
That is clearly an unintended side effect. It's not even mentioned in the description.
---
I have the Stealth Boy on my T-65, I think that will do it.
---
Yeah. Exactly same scenario. I missed out on 5000 caps
---
The bar didn‚Äôt show it for days because it was manually updated. They didn‚Äôt have it to automatically update every time someone donated
---
Yes they are. I know this as I sell them at that price regularly. All other ammo I sell for 1 cap mind
---
&gt; Enjoy the event, don‚Äôt turn it into a job.  That‚Äôs not Bethesda doing it to you, that‚Äôs you doing it to yourself 
---
It took a while for me to get this. When Season 1 started I played as much as I could (which basically boiled down to Saturday and Sunday, but still) and tried to get as much score as possible. But I noticed that I wasn't looking forward to my weekend gaming sessions any more. So one weekend I decided to just play some other games instead. It almost felt like overcoming an addiction.
---
In the end I managed to get far enough to buy the Handmade Blood-Eagle skin which is what I set my sights on initially. I think I bought the last 3 ranks using ATOMs though, but I hardly ever spent those anyway.
---
This season will be even easier for me to let go of the FOMO since there's not really anything on the board that interests me, but still, you've got some solid advice in your post there.
---
The best part of teams is join them for free fast travel.
---
My suggestion (that has probably been suggested before I've just never noticed it) is to just let score continue accumulating and let us roll it to the next season. But, I can see how that could get "unfair" with people building up enough to finish the next season on the 1st day.
---
Your on my timeline! I like ur style
---
They always say soup is a gateway meal.
---
Are legendary perks out yet?
---
I thought that sounded familiar.
---
It said it was ending on Sep. 8th but it didn't say it was ending at 11 am. Thats less than half the day and most people sleep until a few hours before that.
---
One person's claiming a workshop to keep and maintain, is another player's griefing,  
---
These rules are worded so loosely anything could mean anything
---
Watch Angry Turtle's video on magic weapons for a better explanation but in essence weapons with specific legendary traits combined with 1 piece of armor with "15% in dmg while blocking" as a trait do extra damage.  If you have say a bloodied limb damage Lmg and that armor you should melt the SBQ especially if the server is laggy
---
I play 3 bloodied build characters. On each character, when i show up at Encryptid I wait 2 minutes to see if anyone else will grab all 3 pylons. if not, I get rid of my rads and do it myself. It's easy to do if the pylon holders just don't die. Usually I end up hidden down the hill a bit so I never get discovered and just let everyone else attack until it dies. 
---
Cola Nut rank 3 and Nuka Quantums. 1200 hp healed and the speed it heals counteracts the damage over time from the pylons for a long while.
---
Do the nuke silos have laser turrets? I cant remember, that would be reallllll nice tho
---
I'd say there is a chance some people may buy Handmade rifles, I've sold a bunch in the past. They buy it because buying it's plan from vendors for crafting is level restricted to lower levels. As such some high level players may buy it just to unlock some mods for it.
---
Every time I give FO 76 another chance the dev team disappoints me.
---
Even their legalese is a joke. But hey, at least scamming is against ToS.
---
Aw, that was great! I loved the cheesy Halloween music! You put so much detail into this, it's wonderful. I'm on PC, otherwise I'd definitely come and visit.
---
Yep, I missed due to labor day activities :(
---
Did they make a bot to do this?
---
Ya when ever I start at my camp. Oh wait....
---
Whatre daily ops?
---
wasn't there a 5 character slots limit? also i'd have to level the guy up to lvl 13 for even a chance at getting the scrapper perk
---
Many times i get stuck in camps I fast travel to people creep it simple use a bunch of Defences and place your workbenches down no need for a big tower
---
That order is about to change they say on PTS. They said it‚Äôs B,J,AA for the top 3
---
Its over already. I was 3.2k from finishing I thought I had a day left to grind.
---
Are meaning the garage doors, or the entry doors with the flip switch on the side of the door?
---
To do what? This post? No. Make the ToS? I would hope they hire actual lawyers to write this but it sure don‚Äôt look like it. Plaster the ToS on certain accounts that may or may not have exploited? It‚Äôs a theory. For the record I was punished for duping already and I‚Äôve played clean since.
---
You get about 1-2 points per scrapped card. You need about 1000 to max one or two out.
---
Same. I never experienced this until Earle.
---
Well you didn't read the entire post. No mention of junk. But ah well. Reading comprehension is hard.
---
I did not know that, nice.  Makes sense
---
I just wish for how rare it was that it abducted you or was a surprise boss battle or something
---
Has season 2 started? I‚Äôm away at the moment and seem to be missing a lot of things -.-
---
No, but just making recommendations for when the update does come out. If they make the system wobbly I might not even bother.
---
Get a PC and enjoy a solid framerate.
---
I'm in sort of the same boat. Been playing every day but then a storm came thru and knocked the power down in my town for 4 days. Logged on yesterday to claim the collector and was pretty surprised to not find it.
---
Why they don't stay up forever is a mystery to me.
---
Yep, I missed due to labor day activities. It's total BS
---
I harvest them once a day with my characters. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yes!  Slocom Joe's Bundle is back.  I wasn't able to accumulate enough atoms last time, but this time I'm ready!
---
Well, I'd start by watching Fox news for about an hour... joking aside, it might be easier to start a new character depending when the scrapper perk unlocks. Another option if you have the legendaries for it is to use unyielding armor at different health levels (each piece would give 1-3 intelligence depending on health). If you have 3 or 4 pieces you could easily give yourself anywhere between 1 and 12 intelligence bonus.  
---
I don't think you necessarily need to get your intelligence all the way down to 1. I think the scrap increase scales the same no matter your intelligence level... so if you figure out the scrap bonus from 8-15 intelligence you can extrapolate what 1-7 is.
---
2.	Don‚Äôt post about math and SCORE totals required to finish in the beginning. Clearly this subreddit struggles with
---
The math wasn‚Äôt bad. They introduced an extra daily after people complained. And who knows what else they did after complaints to resolve them.
---
There is nothing wrong with complaining. Plenty of things wouldn‚Äôt be improved without it.
---
Enclave Stealth Bois with the secret agent perk last like 5 minutes
---
Yep, standing right next to a bot using a Gauss shotgun and miss with everything. What‚Äôs worse is VATS is the only way for me to one shot anything. Another bug takes means I only do a slither of damage.
---
Yeah, If you've filled them up you could get blight and buzz brain diseases to lower it to 1 with your marsupial reducing it already by 4. Then use food buffs and increasing ranks of class freak to fine tweak the amount up.
---
Next week on the 15th
---
September 15th. Bethesda announced it last week.
---
Will be the first perk I get as a food build, that is crazy
---
Ok cool, thx
---
I am on PC, thank you for the offer. Anyways I have a bloodied 50 cal from colossal problem drop. So I'm good :)
---
Takes longer than that.  Takes that long at least to level up.
---
It means actual money. RMT.
---
Its hacked.
---
There already is (was, I guess) a black SS backpack skin (called "clandestine"), and it does look like that (the plain version.) 
---
Goes great with the CSA.
---
The charisma team goes away and gets replaced by a 'daily ops' public team
---
2 atoms have been deposited into your account.
---
When is season 2 supposed to release?
---
Scrapper has lvl 13 requirement, which sucks.  
---
Also wiki claims it's 0% bonus for lvl 0 and 20% for lvl 1, and then diminishing returns from that point onward, so no extrapolation. If i were to verify claims on the wiki I would indeed need to lower it down even further than 1
---
is it tomorow? i will be buying 138 ranged legendary.
---
Like a suit?
---
The weapons had the primary legendary designation as "bloodied."
---
If I had to guess it's because that is the name of the legendary effect
---
Bloodied is the prefix on legendary weapons that increase the weapons damage the lower your health is.
---
Stay Calm, Do Drugs, Have Fun.  Got it.
---
I thought it was extremely weird in two regards:
---
(1) Mentioned "conspiracy theories" as against ToS.   What the hell?   If someone thinks  we didn't go to the moon, who cares if they talk or text about it?   If I state I have a pet unicorn in my backyard, who cares?   On other issues, who gets to decide what is "conspiracy theory" versus simply asking questions and pondering different things?  Note also that it leaves zero room for a sense of humor.
---
(2) Anything affiliated with "hate groups" is banned.   Whose definition are we going with on this?   The Right?   That would be Antifa and BLM.  The Left?   That would be anyone pro-Trump and Christians.   What I'm saying is that no matter where you fall on the political spectrum, you should be able to talk about and reference these things without an authoritarian-friendly boot on your neck telling what you can and cannot reference and discuss.  And what's more:   what are they going to do?  Monitor text and voice chat?   Wait for players to turn in other players for having, "BLM" or "Trump 2020" in their camp?  Ridiculous.
---
Such a big amount have to be noticed. Yes,  it is done manually but randomly picked from someone in charge, not what the servers are telling.
---
oh god. here we go again.
---
Cast it into the fire. Destroy it!
---
didn't think of getting  diseases  might try that later
---
Yes I know but why is it called ‚Äúbloodied‚Äù? Is there some sort of story behind the name? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to ask
---
You rock!
---
I keep trying to be nice and put stuff in my machines for no caps so that new players can get a boost.
---
The comes along someone and takes all the stuff.  Time and time again.  Ugh.
---
We need a limit 1 per customer =)
---
1730 with my charisma being so high I‚Äôve got like 76 of them. When you get so many caps there really isn‚Äôt anything to spend them on I just buy the recall cards and junk to keep my vendors open.
---
I really enjoy reading about your P.E.N.I.S
---
Memes all the way.
---
Que?? When was this? I‚Äôve played the game constantly since wastelanders dropped and never saw that backpack. Do you have a picture of it?
---
Well, BGS named the weapons that way &amp; since you needed to be low health to maximize the efficiency of the weapon, people just started calling it a "bloodied" build.
---
Don't feel like doing the math but it take 1800 points to max out 6 legendary perks
---
You are right... however I do not think that it was ever intended, inb4 they 'fix' it so the stock does not reset upon server hopping.
---
You get 2 coins per perk card scrapped. It costs 300 coins to max one out.
---
I‚Äôm guessing maybe it‚Äôs because if you are bloodied it‚Äôs because you have lost a lot of blood so then your health would be low. That‚Äôs the only thing I could think of.
---
Lol shhhhh
---
what's the point of 7 day break? they could have let people still farm score for the season 1
---
It‚Äôs called bloody because only women need to use those weapons. Aunt flow, is the only excuse lol
---
I don't have a problem with the scamming one. Scammers are trash. Period. Try to explain it however you want, if you support one person scamming another, you are garbage. IDC about the issue at all. This is also why I use couriers for all non cap trades. 
---
The griefing thing sucks, I am still confused as to why they changed pvp to begin with. It's like they forgot they have this thing called pacifist mode. Enable it on by default. If players choose to not want to pvp, they leave it enabled. If you wanna pvp, disable it. There was already a setting in the game to stop people from getting killed from others, why is it my fault if they don't choose to use it.. ..
---
As for work shops, I don't think that would be an issue as before you claim the workshop you get a notice that it makes you eligible for pvp and you have to acknowledge it prior. It's like me having you sign a waiver that says if you pet my alligator, it may bite you.... Then getting pissed that it bit you. Don't want to risk pvp, go into a private server or don't take a workshop. Don't like that answer, rough, go to mines and other places and scrap for your junk.
---
The one about alt accounts I don't think is that big of a deal either. You have the ability to have multiple, I believe it's saying you can't use them to do things like boost the others etc. from how I read it.
---
I don‚Äôt know for sure about the possum challenges, but they have a new challenge for that event under Complete Different Events.
---
Sometimes a team mate particularly low level will follow you around and sometimes people jump teams for big events so that the heavy hitters will be on the same team together so you can loot from the highest amount of enemies
---
I‚Äôm not 100% sure why you‚Äôd discuss real world religion or politics on a gaming forum to be fair. But they shouldn‚Äôt restrict stuff like that just because it goes against their narrative - it‚Äôs healthy to hear both sides of an argument.
---
They do, but they don't trigger the perk.
---
Not in game yet
---
Oh ok
---
I replied to someone who claimed all events work.
---
There is a difference between events like manhunt or leader of the pack  which are intended to complete solo easylie or public events like campfire tales or scorched earth which are intended to be completed only with several peoples.
---
Public events are marked with an ! On the map aswell with an picture and a description what to do there. Common events are only a yellow marker without any preview.
---
It's in there for liability reasons. In practice they only care about cheat mods.
---
not for me im doing the robotics challenge
---
I know, hate it
---
Why would they let people farm score for Season 1 after it's over?
---
Quite recently - all of the additions from Wastelanders that you can buy from Samuel, Regs, and Mortimer, plus the bow plans from Sunny and the Pepperoni Roll plan from Molly.
---
* 0 for first rank
---
* 50 for 2nd
---
* 100 for 3rd
---
* 150 for 4th
---
300 total per card.
---
Seriously. One of the best rewards so far and they only let you collect it over a holiday weekend. Par for the course I suppose, I'm sure they will sell it to us later for 1500 atoms.
---
it's more of a fixer-upper
---
I think that they also made using "magic" weapons a banable offence. As well as talking about fake bugs, like the frog dupe.
---
Edit: I mean, downvote all you want. Just read the fucking thing. It says those actions are FORBIDDEN. I'm not saying people are going to be banned, I'm just saying the wording is such that if they *decided* to ban, they could.
---
My precious
---
why would it end before season 2 starts? i feel like it should have been a smooth transition from one into the other
---
Never heard of any deep reason behind it. Bloodied is just a good word to describe something that has taken a beating just as much as it‚Äôs given one, and Bethesda already had a berserker(which in most other games a bloodied or something like it is called a berserker). 
---
At some point, someone saw a bloodied weapon with the right perks could become a fun build!
---
Right now: just poison and fall resist
---
Next week with Daily Ops: *All of it* + vampires on standby
---
It makes hacks forbidden, but gives them discretion for things like the perk loadouts. So technically yes most of the mods are against the ToS, but unless they force integrity checks like in Nuclear Winter they'll likely only bother doing anything about people who use hacks, bots, or any other 3rd party software.
---
I'm more interested in why this is coming up now. Was it not against ToS to do these things before?
---
Do you mean that they didn't intend for it to reset on a server hop?
---
Gah fuck!!! I'm sorry. If you're gonna hack a ring, it should be 'Cursed Ring', give you Chameleon, and make you stare inappropriately long at your man friends.
---
Frodo.
---
Sam.
---
precisely
---
I feel the same about my Junkies  Gauss Mini!
---
It said that before, effectively.  5.1 (the part you're referring to) is the same as the previous version.  5.2 was expanded a bit, but doesn't apply to mods directly.
---
I would assume because Season 2 is part of an update that includes other content, and some of that content is still being worked on.
---
You're welcome
---
Another option is to create a character daily, get it level 3 to complete the challenge, then delete it to restart tomorrow
---
I'm thinking this will get changed very quickly, there is no way Bethesda meant to neuter robots damage
---
Yeah that's what i think too. 
---
buying 5 at a time was maybe ok back when you could earn it from the raids. But now there's no raids, we should be able to spend 1000 scrip at a time if we want to.
---
On PC there's a text chat mod, it's not good as an official one but does the job. Maybe they will implement it in the future, just like the 'know' plans, which was a mod
---
Doesn't booze drop your Int also?
---
I think I might have one or two of those knocking about (couldn't bring myself to scrap them or let them go at vendor bot prices), but it sounds like generally, the player vendor market doesn't really want non legendary stuff.
---
Back on the beat still spawns but I've seen it maybe 3 times in the last month
---
Nailed it.  üëç
---
\&gt; Maximize your intelligence and experience output with drugs 
---
More great advice from r/Fo76!
---
That was not out of nowhere, that user had a display bug doubling the weapon, and he decided to drop one, got disconnected and ended up having zero.
---
Cool thanks
---
If I remember, they were toying with the idea according to the concept art.
---
Even if one day some guy comes by and magically says give me all your non legendary weapons please, I‚Äôll pay 30k for all of them. It‚Äôs not worth the weight of keeping them around for who knows how long.
---
If I'm correct it can only fit on the bunker itself, sadly
---
Glitchy game is glitchy.
---
ACP ate my T-65 armor off the frame yesterday. So... yeah. Loosing shit is always a possibility.
---
So this is an SCP and soon we shall have the foundation
---
Technically, if you have the xbox app on your pc, you can text chat with others while playing.
---
I started in the last 2 weeks and still got to 42 out of 100
---
How the second style is clearly a door and would not fit the size of the bunker door
---
It's definitely much better now than compared to BETA. Still needs work but it's almost night and day since release. The game still definitely needs more work but there's much more promise now.
---
The special cards don't let you share more. You have to have normal ranks in whichever special you want to share. The extra 5 dont count.
---
Does quitting out and reloading back into the server help?
---
When I first noticed there were no challenges and saw post about people, I agreed that we should've instead had some atom challenges, but then again, they're giving seasons for free (yes you can pay for them, but it's not really hard to grind them).
---
Afaik the only way for them to make money is by people buying skips for Seasons, or buying stuff at the Atom Shop, no? As crap as Bethesda has been for a long time, in this case, we're he ones being greedy. Not only are we getting free content and stuff, but we also want them to give us more atoms like it was before the big update.
---
We need a please shut the funk up emote that we can give our random team players.
---
Does it?
---
It's gonna be interesting without stealth. I'm looking forward to removing all sneak and swapping in every resistance and damage boost I have. Gonna go ahead and flick that ol' fire selector to fully auto on the quad handmade.
---
Seriously does anyone else spend 90% of their life on the perk card screen between each major event or engagement. Even my wife pointed out I have to play with perks way too much for optimisation.
---
[No](https://ibb.co/Ht0KzZn), I use the "[Powered Door](https://streamable.com/e97wfh)" connected to a switch.
---
Notice that I said take the intelligence special card so I can swap normal perk points to charisma
---
Still available... seen it 3 times today - didn‚Äôt do it once
---
Back when there were raids you couldn't buy it, and it was much harder to get than now
---
Dam
---
My apologies.  Misread that.
---
Or just a matte black or urban camo would be nice.
---
I will buy radium rifles for 200 caps, just to scrap them.
---
Exactly, just to bypass the silo entirely, I'd be happy to pay that amount
---
Just checked all generic alcohol items are -1.
---
Then we go back to my initial question of why not leave season 1 active
---
I feel you I just got my internet back and didn‚Äôt finish the run or get a hog that stuff
---
Great thanks
---
Because it would encourage toxicity in the community and spammers. Have you seen text chat on every other game in existence? Nothing but ‚ÄúXxXx BuY CuRRenCy CH3aPz FreE LegUnd4rY w/ EvrY $20 Sp3nded!!!! xXxX‚Äù ‚ÄúG3T MAxX CAPZ‚Äù
---
I use serendipity, nerd rage, and full set of unyielding SS armor. I use fireproof instead of ironclad due to my explosive handmade and it helps against the queen. Only use bandolier in str. I have plenty of resistance.
---
Yeah, I don't see why you would either--like can't we get away from these issues anywhere and just play the game?--except sometimes conversations drift in voice chat with people you've played with for a while.   I've also seen political stuff in camps.  
---
And the "conspiracy theory" thing?!   Really?   Like has anyone ever ran into this in any way, shape or form in the game or even in forums?   It strikes me as bat\*\*\* crazy on their part.   I have to ask myself:   what have they seen and/or what are they afraid of?
---
I would have been too.  I‚Äôve been playing since beta and have over 10k in screws. Every time there is duping bans I worry they will wrongfully ban me
---
I feel you!
---
Totally agree with this.
---
Blueprints don‚Äôt matter either because it never lets me place ‚Äòem :|
---
It‚Äôs all good. It‚Äôs a wall of text anyway.
---
Hardly - imagine someone being banned for using a "magic" weapon not even knowing that's what it is or anything about magic effects in general.  I'd imagine that would be a lot of bans
---
Its the same nonsense I've heard about people being worried they will be banned because someone gave them 100 stimpacks and they might be duped.  What if someone gives you 2 stimpacks and they are duped - how were you to know?
---
No there was another guy who lose their weapon out of nowhere
---
Nah I really do want atomic camo so my armor can all match in color. I'm not a fan of the gillie skin.
---
Oh I see. So it's always been wank.
---
It doesn't destroy anything though. Just moves it. It blueprints and keeps you stuff. So the fear is really just losing caps and placement. My biggest grief is accidentally button mashing and losing my weapons. It's happened multiple times.
---
IT'S AN ESTIMATE
---
Did you had a skin? on it and how did it eat it if after 60 seconds you get it back in your inventory?
---
Thank you friend, I hope more people will enjoy it too!
---
Yeah-the leaves look plastic almost... not a fan.
---
I can verify it does.
---
But then I have to deal with hackers.
---
God bless OP and everyone here for acknowledging the truth about the CSA.
---
I draw epic down votes whenever I say that CSA can't compete when it matters, and is a gimmicky rad suit.
---
And a 'wow' emote please

Shoot other lvl 16s.

That I missed, can you link his post?

For me it‚Äôs worth it,8 notes at a time ,only another 13 earl fights to go and I‚Äôve got my last two mods lol

Look at it this way. You can use those 8/10 round ones (mine are usually like 3/4) to craft ultracite cores. Then you don‚Äôt have to use full ones üòÄ

Hats aren't rare, only dresses are. The rarer ones are Red and Forest

Thank you my friend!
---
because it was a 10 week event and the 10 weeks are up. really not bothered by it.
---
Ah that‚Äôs just the normal SS backpack though? It matches the normal grey color of the SS armor, I‚Äôve got that one.
---
(I meant a black version of that backpack.)
---
It ended hours ago would be the reason you can't purchase them.
---
It wasn‚Äôt reddit so I can‚Äôt link it but I seen a few post about it so now I‚Äôm afraid I can lose my weapons
---
Can you send a imgur link of a screenshot of the door, because it's not in the camp menu anymore for me(I don't own it)
---
Just give us stimpaks or water or something we actually use!
---
I always thought scammers were shitty pieces of cuntflap from that failed abortion working the street corner but I never actually knew it was against the ToS to scam. But that and the bit about exploiting/reporting bugs are the only parts that are clear as day. And are you not technically boosting by using them as storage for your main?
---
Not sure if this is just coincidence, but I tend to find Back on the Beat when the server is late night. Not sure why. But it definitely still exists.
---
Can't really help you. it was never "a mess" for me.
---
Oh, I thought that was black.
---
I guess you're looking for *slightly darker black* hahaha
---
I got it too, I play normal and straight forward. Only exploit I‚Äôm guilty of is my tent at fort defiance. Maybe it‚Äôs just an updated TOS?
---
There would still be people accidentally moving their camps. Bethesda can only do so much to protect people from their own incompetence.
---
yeah it ended this afternoon like 4 hours ago
---
Welcome to mordor,  sauron awaits you
---
Can you confirm if party boy/girl affects the int loss? Cause if so then you just gave me a perfect solution of negative 3 int
---
I guess not, there is no way to confirm since there is no nw on pts.
---
My assumption is that legendary perks won't be active in nw since there are flat damage modifiers aswell with defensive perks. Imagine the auto revive in power armor would work, making them even more powerful in nw.
---
Dude he never complained and literally just asked a few questions?
---
You're better of using barbarian for DR than iron clad. Rank 1 Barbarian already gives you 40DR if you use full unyielding gear
---
Ah, people hatin' on you. Bad jokes need their air time too!
---
Do you know the rarity of the uniforms? I can provide a rough price guide if needed
---
"You will not intentionally use or share any bug found within any ZeniMax game, real or fictitious, regardless of whether or not it grants and unfair advantage."
---
The damage made by magic weapons is a bug. Using a weapon that has that bugged damage intentionally would technically fall under that. If you know it's a bug, then you are violating the new Code of Conduct. If you didn't know... then why would you use them? Do people really think they should be one-shotting behemoths with shotguns? Or killing the SBQ in 20 seconds with an LMG?
---
And this would *technically* cover any bug, like CAMP bugs with making double-sided walls.
---
This, exactly!
---
The closest I come to interacting with my teammates, is using them for a free fast travel. Most of the time I jump from Crater, down to someone in the Cranberry Bog, and then again to my nearest daily quest target in that general area.
---
Yes please
---
That's taking things a bit too far I think
---
I‚Äôm also technically guilty of of Fort Defiance tent glitch, but my tent was there before this was a thing so fuck them. I‚Äôm not moving my tent just because they can‚Äôt build their game right and I‚Äôm forever running around in the Bog clearing Sierra Bravos and their little foot soldiers. I‚Äôm also on the elusive hunt for that red asylum outfit.
---
OMG your first sentence actually has me laughing out loud!!ü§£ü§£
---
That was awesome!
---
I‚Äôm going to move mine closer now.
---
Those have been in since launch
---
It‚Äôs possible... The other day (within the last month) I was doing Guided Meditation, and picked up a 2-star Medic‚Äôs Hunting Rifle from a legendary afterwards... I was running low health, and a stray ghoul came up and smacked me in the back of the head shortly after... I respawned, came back and continued looting, picking up some loose objects on the ground as well... One of those loose objects NOT in a loot bag, was a 2-star Medic‚Äôs Hunting Rifle. Checked my Pip-Boy and confirmed that I had only ONE, 2-star Medic‚Äôs Hunting Rifle.
---
Of lol just being stupid then I'll take the post down thanks though
---
It could be because there person doesn't want to scrap a seemingly "useless" item by mistake.
---
I have 1x 5.56 round in my vendor so that my camp shows on the map to make it easier for players to find me when I am trading.
---
You need 900 spare perk cards to scrap. Leaving you the cards you normally use in your deck. I‚Äôd say at least 1050-1100 cards are needed so your character can be versatile and switch out cards as needed for crafting and repairs.
---
To be fair, if they didn't add 4 more dailies, more weeklies and more double atoms/exp events it could have been a lot harder, all those were added because people complained how grindy it is so.....
---
It happened to me when I had that skin on the C.A.M.P thing from the legendary run. Removed the skin and they work now. Both were stuck outside of my boundary as well.
---
I hope you're the only one, because that's about the biggest non-issue I've ever heard of.
---
Yeah he did. After I said he should read the official news rather than relying on Reddit.
---
How can anyone cone to Reddit and not see the very answer he was asking? There‚Äôs post after post about it. 
---
So does he not read? Which is my point. This info was in game. This was on their website. And all over here.
---
It‚Äôs clear froM his Reddit history, he‚Äôs not interested in keeping informed. Just selling game items and porn.
---
Gauss Shotguns and Secret Service Armor.
---
Just the kind of fool and their money Bethesda is hoping for.
---
Looks like a bug. I hope they keep it, because the clearly intended effect isn't legendary.
---
I want to know how well it works against the impostor sheepsquatch.
---
If you couldnt return the favor, pass it on to someone else.  I have been gifted several great items when I was a lower level and now that I am able to, I will stop by Vault 76 and give new players some plans, outfits and ammo if I have any extra to spare.  Its not much but I like to think it helps at least a little.
---
I agree. That's why I brought it up.
---
Haha, no you don‚Äôt!
---
Ammo because I need it to live and super duper procs at weird intervals sometimes giving me drastically more than I ever conceived making
---
I would like to see what's in the vending machine before going. Like I saw a guy with 230 plans, 45 armor and 33 weapons just to find out that all he has are mounted head plans, golf skirts, miner uniform, 1* 10mm pistols and lead pipes. Hahaha. Biggest disappointment.
---
Pretty sure they use this as a glitch...the item has to stay in the vendor for the glitch I‚Äôm thinking of to work so they put toilet paper for 30k knowing no one will purchase.
---
Awww man I had that happen to me once and it sucked! The vendor was selling Faschnat masks for a pretty good price and I missed out on the Faschnat event so I wanted to buy all that I could, but the player left before I could.
---
No, he didn't. You said to check the news, and he said he was just asking a question and there was no need to get hostile. No need to do a background check, if you're not going to answer the question then move on, no point in insulting.
---
I've seen it with notes and dumb weapons like the commie whacker a ridiculous amount of times. I can understand doing it for that reasoning, but it shouldn't just be you listing items for max caps because you can, which is why these people are doing it. 30k arrest warrants. 30k perfectly preserved pies. Its a waste of time and a waste of my caps for even fast traveling there just to see that nonsense
---
Duchess' Dram gives you -2 INT. If you want to be dumb, that's the best alcohol.
---
Are you sure it's an integrity check and not a check if the custom.ini exists?
---
Because one way to cheat was/is to unpack the ba2 and replace the content with modified shit.
---
I do, actually. Trying to improve my setup, even though I love my current Shotgun.
---
I'm going to have to stop picking up and making things for people till I get rid of a lot of stuff.  
---
People tend to want super awesome mega gear straight out of the vault. I don't want stuff sitting for months and taking up space.
---
This. 
---
And also some People like to show of certain items. Like the pie for an example. 
---
Useless item but shows a lucky roll.
---
You can ‚Äúrepair‚Äù the helipad if you claim the workshops üëçüèº

I haven't started rebuilding my camp since the future tech skin debacle. I'll probably try to make a new pinterest/modern mansion with the use of the glass wall of season two. So I need to reach rank 99 first ehe.
---
BOOM. Roasted.
---
Throwing in my two cents, there‚Äôs no commitment to even look in your teammate‚Äôs direction. I don‚Äôt even have a mic.
---
Lots of content. New season starts a week from today.
---
Then make it sound more Sincere and not come off like you where messing with him. If you had to be away then yeah I feel for you too. I don‚Äôt come to Reddit to be a asshole like most ppl. I come to hear stories and find new things about games I like. I try to help ppl, some ppl just come to start crap with others. So again I wasn‚Äôt being a asshole. Just figured you where being one to the poster. So my bad if you were being sincere.
---
I mean unless we‚Äôre talking about the start of covid.....than he probably sell out...
---
Unless this is provided to everybody and is permanently free, I don't see any reason why people should be cheering for this. It's an emote to convey something that should be considered extremely basic for a game that has a severe lack of communication options on PC particularly. 
---
It's hardly a 'better late than never' fix, since it's only a bandage fix on a first come first served basis assuming it's not free forever.
---
Yeah, but there's a number of nice, high-level perks which are associated with it, especially if you're doing a power armour build. I have high int on my main character and typically equip some combination of explosives expert, first aid, stabilized and batteries included.
---
I had this happen for the first time today while shooting Earle.  Got scared by him, turned around and the gauss mini was firing on its own.
---
It was a dreadfully laggy server, so that may have been the problem.
---
I actually bought the game in August and managed to max it out without NW so it's definitely possible
---
The other day I found 2 forrest dresses in a vendor for 1000 caps each one, where they good or too fancy?
---
Power armor. It's great taking all the mats and flux I've gathered, slapping it on a chassis, and giving someone a walking tank in their size and style. üòÅ
---
Its a waste of time and caps and it's dumb to list shit at 30k. Use the vendor properly. Not that hard
---
extremely, been playing since beta as well and a lv. 225, and so far there's been a few bugs still here and there but it's been way better since beta (don't remind me the time they added weight to Bobby pins cuz that was a nightmare x_x)
---
Holdover from the beginning of the pandemic, started as a joke because nobody could find toilet paper irl and people were selling it on ebay for crazy amounts, there was a news article on both but now its just dumb and people still do it probably thinking there was an actual reason in the first place
---
Nice, I'm keen to see what new content there is. What are the seasons for exactly?
---
This. Its the first thing. It's the only way to be sure that some junk you may want to display later isn't scrapped accidentally. When and if they add the ability to protect things from auto scrapping, things like this will stop happening.
---
I don‚Äôt know what the point of adding all this stuff for our camp when we can only use a quarter of it
---
Feel you!
---
Can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve accidentally pulled out the camp from my pip boy. 
---
I go in total freeze mode when this happens.
---
Does it give-6 with party boy/girl?
---
I really hate any crafting because there‚Äôs no way to batch craft even though I have tons of scraps. My thumb hurts af after crafting only 20k .45 ammo.
---
Yes, like I said, a complete non-issue.
---
That‚Äôs awesome!! I like being able to just do my own thing. I‚Äôd also be willing to help a teammate if asked, but getting the benefits while still being able to explore or do quest lines alone is great! (I‚Äôve only been playing for a week now. This is my first FO. I‚Äôm already addicted.)
---
Exactly it's a huge bummer and a time waster when people just put garbage in the vendors and have the audacity to list some of it for max caps lmao
---
I can‚Äôt find the emote on my wheel.
---
Items in Vendor are not used for ‚Äúscrap‚Äù, so my items for ‚ÄúStings and Things‚Äù are Kept there ... the 30K is so nobody buys them ....
---
Others do it as a joke
---
Lmao üòÇ
---
I would like to see longer hairstyles for women and men (maybe some that reach as low as the waistline). Its not like modders havent figured out how to put them in Fallout 4, so I guess the only real work for the devs would be in making sure the hats and helmets displayed them properly.
---
I thought I would be seeing you here. 
---
I dropped you a keycard but I guess you didn‚Äôt want to nuke me after all.
---
A simple confirmation window would protect me from mine üòÇ
---
Oh, forgot about the LMG.  I haven‚Äôt used it in ages.  Thanks for the heads up!
---
Just a way to keep people interested in the game.
---
Yeah fair points
---
thank you very much OP, but why .png? ;(
---
I stopped going to player camps being it‚Äôs most of the time useless stuff. I got so tired of the mounted head plans that the ones I did have I dropped. I barely find any good weapons so I just stopped and do my own thing. The most I do is goto my team mates camps to see if they have anything. I found a junkies pole hook 40%power attack ad +1 strength. That was by far the best weapon I‚Äôve found
---
If I'd have seen it I'd definitely have taken your keycard. Probably dropped it as i fast traveled. Thanks for wasting my time tho
---
I like to craft chems and booze daily, I have my regular routes to gather supplies that have me pass through random encounters. I like crafting them because they‚Äôre shelf stable, easy to sell in a vendor, and they require ingredients that give me a good excuse to wander and play events I already have the awards for (nuclear material from the ghouls at Radiation Rumble, kaleidoscope flowers at Project Paradise). Plus I‚Äôve done some home brewing in the past and I enjoy the process of crafting and fermenting booze. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs just a fired up Tuesday. Stay safe out there
---
i spent 150 hours inside that asylum trying to find a red uniform and these prices are based on what i sold mine for and what i've seen others go for.
---
White dirty/Withered - worthless
---
White Clean - up to 500 caps
---
Brown - up to 1k
---
Blue - up to 5k
---
Green - up to 5k
---
Pink - up to 12k
---
Yellow - up to 15k
---
Forest - up to 25k
---
Red - trade only. You can pretty much trade for most things with one of these babies
---
You're wrong but ok
---
ammo to shoot mobs in the face to death
---
food to eat for buffs
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one, even if I‚Äôm taking massive damage my fingers stop moving... couple of times my fingers didn‚Äôt stop moving I was luckily somewhere where I couldn‚Äôt place my camp anyway
---
What ever happened to the other ranger outfits
---
You sweet summer child - check eBay
---
I heard people say to dump at the blue suitcase outside white spring train station but I've seen stuff at all train stations. Would be nice to be able to sell to vendor, even if it was like 10 caps each.
---
So would we have to reach lvl1000 to max out 6 cards or is their other ways to get more perk points.  Seems like an insane grind for just a little boost on certain perks we already have
---
Stings and things? What's that lol. And yeah it's not funny though it's just annoying at this point. Gets old when I'm trying to find cool tuff in vendors and its just useless garbage at 30k caps
---
Marine Tactical Helmets. They use materials I have absolutely no use for and are a nice quick flip to clear caps on the days I don't feel like playing. I've relied on this tactic at least 3 times this past week and likely to be at least another 3-4 days this coming week before the next season starts.
---
Agreed but Who the hell downvotes this
---
Puncturing Power Fist.
---
Wait? You can't apply dark matter skin on a fixer? That's BS.
---
It *was* available to everyone. You have to claim it.
---
Do you have it equipped? And it should be in your team up section of the wheel
---
No u
---
The 30k whacker was a joke dumbass, get a hold of yourself.
---
But you should remain clear while the bells ring
---
They also reserve the right to NOT act in the ToS.
---
Double sided walls and magic weapons probably won't raise to that level, aimbots and dupes probably will.
---
I've found a couple cool weapons and when people have cool camps I like to check them out and see the work put into them. But it definitely makes it feel pointless when people list useless shit for max caps and the rest is all garbage too lol I feel that.
---
I second this opinionüëçüèº
---
You got 10k caps for 2 chally backpack plans?  Holy shot I'm selling low!
---
This is one of the saddest posts I‚Äôve read. You were soooo close.
---
Damn, this guy is good.
---
If only it was funny, then it could be considered a joke
---
Yea can confirm/agree my bloodied powerfist does 1010 with no perks.
---
Maybe because they don‚Äôt exist to serve you and are still learning to play the game. Not every player is hooked into the market and not every player understands pricing. They‚Äôre trying to make caps of their own-and there is a learning curve associated with that. 
---
And if your time is that valuable maybe hold off on vendor hopping? That goes with the territory I‚Äôm afraid. When I vendor hop I don‚Äôt feel entitled to non ‚Äúuseless‚Äù items-I consider it a pleasant surprise when I happen across a rare find.
---
Maybe, I buy power armor and laser weapons if they're not too expensive (100-300) just to scrap them in order for the my active atom challenges.
---
Sorry dude. Next season keep this in mind; ends at 12pm EST on the last day, so you don't get the whole day.
---
I kill SBQ in 20 seconds with a Fixer and down Behemoths with a couple of bullets...so...should I be assuming that should not be possible and there might be a bug with the fixer that I am unaware of and expect to be banned?
---
Your saying that if someone didnt know it was a bug, then why would they use them - Sorry but if a casual player comes across a weapon that puts out insane damage- why wouldn't they use it?  
---
How would they know it is not designed to put out that kind of damage? Why should they care. Its hardly on them to worry about such things.  
---
Come to think of it - has Bethesda come out and acknowledged that magic weapons are bugged weapons that should not be used by the playerbase?
---
Definitely marsupial,  the rest is pretty build dependent
---
We may disagree on some things but I can't deny we both have masterful argumentative techniques.
---
10k each. So, this dude blew 20k on two backpacks. I set them up as the most expensive items in my stash for lols (body 10k, head 10k, backpack 10k) in the joking hopes some dude with 30k wanted a full set. Instead, he just bought the two backpacks.
---
It's essentially like a battle pass that doesn't cost anything extra, therefore everyone has the chance to unlock everything. There's no paid vs free unlock path.
---
I don't need to sound sincere cause I believe if you wasn't there when it was available, then you blew your chance. I don't expect Bethesda to bring those items back and I don't feel too bad about it. But If Bethesda is to cater to all these demands, then they better bring back all the exclusives cause that's the right thing to do. But look at all the downvotes. Demanding collector bots is taken seriously and demanding elite ranger armor is being a troll? Make up your mind people
---
Username checks out
---
I just got it for the t65 to put a jetpack on the arm.
---
No it wasnt
---
I ask the last part because Bethesda has had ample time to remove the offending weapons from the drop pools, but they are still dropping.
---
Alright dude whatever. Have a good day
---
Blah blah blah shut it.
---
You‚Äôre just another market place poster.
---
Lol took me a second. For a while i was just a lurker here on reddit. That's changed
---
Corn Soup = +3 AP Regen
---
Carrot Soup = +2 Perception
---
Cranberry Relish = + 10% XP
---
Mothman Eggs = +2 Charisma 
---
Glowing Meat/Yao Guai Ribs = +5% Melee each (stackable)  ... 
---
Mutt Chops = +2 End
---
Isn't VATS a factor as well? I'm not 100% sure, but I think VATS makes magic lethal.
---
Yeah I'm not familiar with the term either
---
Yeah nah it's obvious you shouldn't list items for 30k. Idc how new you are. If I see a new player with some stuff that's overpriced I may even buy it just to help them out, but 30k items in vending is trash
---
The mothman draws us all into the light sooner or later
---
Infinite storage for junk. Ammo has naught to do with it. Keep the atoms, I am already blessed in the glow.
---
But that would be consumer friendly
---
Child of the atom here.
---
Ha. Only thing I might could see if the "overflow caps" had a weight but yeah dude just needs a mule or buy flux or invest in meta weapons
---
You get 90 cards per 50 levels. Take into consideration the perk packs in the legendary run. You should be looking at level 700 to have enough points.
---
Post is about the Fallout first Atomic Camo paint for normal armor.
---
I have a "You've been Insulted" note for 30k in a Vendor behind a locked door - does that count as useless? 
---
Why? To piss off the people who make a big deal about locked doors in others camps. I do wonder if any, after finding the note, bother to hunt for any others hidden away...
---
Thanks for being a dick
---
Pics?
---
I think he's drunk on cranberry moonshine or whiskey. Look around his trailer and you'll see the bottles
---
Never carry junk on me while shopping because of the traps camp trolls who's camps are very obvious to spot because they clutter their trap rooms with so much crap to try to get you to fall down their obvious hole in the floor to land on radiation traps...if I could knock these kids teeth out irl I most definitely would, Fukn low life's trying to steal from anyone trying to give them caps....get lives you pieces of shit...
---
Please, tell us more of how we can play to make your gaming experience more enjoyable.
---
Okay and? That's all I downloaded reddit for was to trade for this game lol, anyways have a g day
---
Yeah, you don‚Äôt.
---
I've never tried, but it is alcohol, so it should behave as party boy dictates. Good luck!
---
Very true.  Good point
---
Ah my bad. I misread your title.
---
I honestly have no idea why they give them to us lol
---
Thanks for the Info.  That's still nutty to grind out.  I have 400 hours and I'm lvl 203 lol.
---
Oh and you know it better for sure without any evidence. Lemme guess, you're one of the guys who belive everything without asking or consider to ask about the circumstances? Bethesda said so, so it must true.
---
Nice thank you
---
Yes-but you‚Äôre not entitled to anything. They‚Äôre not wasting your time if you decide to go to their vendor. Like I said-other players don‚Äôt exist to serve your vending needs lol.
---
Even better than extra claw deathclaw gauntlet?
---
I think I have no idea what NV is, New Vegas maybe?
---
Yep. Can't have Intelligence used for weapon boosting.
---
The pie can be easily obtained without the machine. It has a spawn, and it's where I got mine and put it in a display case which is made to show things off, unlike the vending machines
---
So we have something to sit on.
---
Most people should ask for an AFK emoji
---
No worries
---
Which specific booze and chems do you craft?
---
OK. Guess i need a Bss+1s power fist, not a Bss+1s bear arm. My bad
---
Damn that's a good question.... Honesty don't know (stuck at work) but the perk card does day Tripled and doesn't specify if it's positive or negative.
---
Nuclear Vinter?
---
New, repeatable missions coming with the One Wasteland update
---
Bear arm is good as well it‚Äôs really up to u
---
I hope you, your family, and property are safe amigo!
---
I know. But that does not at all feel the same as getting one from the machine. 
---
Maybe a bad example. My bad.
---
This is beautiful man!   Nice work.  If I stumbled across this camp I would be in awe and spend some time checking it out.   What did you use for the brown beams/columns?
---
Spoken by someone who has clearly never actually tried a bloodied build with the relevant perks
---
It‚Äôs a repeatable daily, used to get a chance at Possum Badges,,  awards insect repellent and Pemmican and random Mounted Plans .... along with ‚ÄúOperation Tidy‚Äù for another chance at Possum Badges ... more Pemmican and insect repellent
---
Sorry. Just remember for next season, it ends at 12PM EST.
---
Yeah that's petty useless and idc about locked doors, just people listing dumb shit for max caps. But at least the you've been inulted note is actually funny. Most of the time it's random garbage and isnt funny
---
I have three "junk" items in my vendor at 30k, for whatever reason our overlords at Bethesda have deemed that I can't display them like my other other items, so it's the only other option to prevent auto scrapping.
---
That said, preserved pies and toilet paper at huge prices are both getting old.
---
A series of challenges with incremental rewards. It's a fair mix of camp items, skins, and currency.
---
Man I sold for 1k. I need to raise prices!
---
I‚Äôm on pc, I had to buy a keyboard I could set up to auto press buttons. My thumbs couldn‚Äôt take it anymore.
---
I was confused as well since it is on the same tab as the bunker door, im guessing you bought the slucums joe bundle thing as well, it adds a train cart and im pretty sure that door connects to that train cart
---
I wonder if an ini file got corrupted. I think in one of them you can toggle the HUD, but I'm not 100% sure. Are you steam? Try to validate files and see if it fixes anything for ya. If not steam, I'm not sure what you can do. Maybe some heavy research into the ini files. Modder forums can help with that.
---
Isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhate groups‚Äù defined in actual terms by actual institutions like the FBI &amp; SPCL. 
---
I‚Äôd rather go off their formalized thought out definitions then an ambiguous and subjective ‚Äúleft / right‚Äù approach.
---
In addition to the things said previously, the XO1 looks way cooler
---
Yes the armor pen is better
---
FO 1st has absolutely nothing to do with challenges.
---
Oh lmao that makes sense
---
I personally keep a rad ant lager on me at all times. It gives you a +50 carry weight for a few minutes. Enough time to fast travel home and scrap it all.
---
The Fireplace Door was one of my "must-haves" for Season 1.
---
Thanks so much man appreciate it. You talking about the metal beams on the white walls?
---
for the record i never found a red =0
---
I totally read this in bot-voice lmao
---
Some other guy mentioned that Duches brew lowers it by 2, assuming that the party girl works we are at negative 15 int from everything xd
---
Does the jetpack work though? the only post I could find talking about the glitch said that it doesn't give you a jetpack but just renames the piece.
---
If you‚Äôre on PC I can hunt for you!
---
I have found every dress but red and yellow but yeah hats are fixed spawns. It the dresses. I have 2 forest but on market ppl act like it‚Äôs only worth caps but somehow the red is worth legacies or bloody fixers with 2525 prefixes
---
There are different ways to play bloodied of course but in my mind bodyguard is a dead card. If you're in a situation where you need it, Personally I think you failed as a bloodied.
---
&gt;Overall, more health is better than more DR.
---
So why bodyguard again...? 
---
Strange in numbers is just another xp (at a minimum) boost. Xp is the new meta given how legendary perks are.
---
I am always looking for best. Is power fist the best?
---
&gt; How can people seriously be THIS entitled?
---
People like that make up a huge portion of this sub. They seriously think that they should get enough free atoms to buy everything they want without ever having to even consider buying some with actual money. It's incredible.
---
I'll have to give it a try. Went heavy guns but I still got my 15 str so i can flop back
---
It seems not. If you want it separate you should file feedback now before t season drops.
---
To some, they are using the vendor properly, in a way that works best for them. Its really not that hard to understand.
---
Let's say they listed the items at 1000 caps - would you have bought them then? You said they are listing "shit" so stuff you would not have bought regardless?  See how its a non issue?
---
I don't give a fuck about b2525 meta crap. Need to know if anything else is worth it.
---
It's not going to happen.  I've seen MUCH better games with MUCH better designed storefronts and the only way they've managed to do it is on a person by person basis through a MUCH better customer support system requiring you to just buy the bundle and then get refunded for what you already owned.  And even then it's on a case by case basis if they even agree to refund you and don't make you live with the loss.
---
Either way the vending machine isn't a display case is my point
---
It could really only be easily implemented for PC, doing it for consoles would be rarely used for anything other than shit posting and trolling and it would be a lot of work to build it into the current UI in any reasonable, non-obstructive fashion
---
Look at SH games new vid lol. Like 5 killed him and made him run out of Stims lol
---
I realized I needed to craft some ammo the other day and pushed the button a few times... I made 12.5 k
---
Yeah dude. I realized awhile ago that there are certain people out there with a bunch of caps and a completionist mindset. Most of my stuff is completely reasonable, if not underpriced, but certain event-based gear I RnG'd my ass off for and acquired a couple extra plans, those I'll sell to someone with more caps than sense. I still sell each Faschnact mask (started at 222, sold a bunch, now that I'm running low, they're 500, the last ones I sell will be 1k each). They still sell. That's why I picked up all the plans/outfits people dropped. My long-term money-making scheme.
---
Such as antiarmor, TS, mutants etc or more along the lines of shit like berserkers and nocturnal gear?
---
Oh true true
---
Hmm well I guess that‚Äôs really up to the player him/herself.
---
Same here. Couldn't log in over the weekend and this morning when I can finally get back its gone. That was the only thing I wanted from the whole damn event.
---
Bullets, radshield, and stable flux, almost always to sell.
---
With a requirement to hold the button for a few seconds to confirm - that would then be me sorted also üòÉ
---
So i do this. And with reason
---
Remember the laggy vendor glitch where mfers could buy all your inv then steal fron your stash.
---
Do the math.
---
I'm looking forward to it. Love season schemes.
---
I have 4 full racks and it takes about 20% of my camp budget
---
Then that makes sense. But yeah 9/10 times it's a pie or toilet paper or something else that just has no reason to be in there for that much lol
---
Right? Gotta make room for bad jokes so you can appreciate the good jokes
---
I mean... it takes several button pushes already?  If you're able to spam your way through opening your pip boy, hitting z (or whatever it is on consoles, and then placing the camp then wouldn't you just as easily spam your way through one additional button push to confirm?
---
Funny thing I actually run a bloodied build just making a stupid joke. Didn‚Äôt think people get so offended
---
A while back they returned lost power armor to players who had been effected by this one glitch. Now note I was on the console, and it turned my BoS Fatigues into a 3 star legendary. Can't recall the effects it gave, but I saw it and I refused to touch it. About a week later it was back to being regular BoS fatigues.
---
I‚Äôm a lawyer and read the entire contract/code of conduct. It is extremely poorly worded in the amount of word usage subject to open interpretation. If this was to ever go to court, it would be a fiasco trying to make sense of anything. 
---
I also have a trap camp, lol. So there‚Äôs no way of knowing what this code of conduct is talking about. Is a trap camp using mechanics of the game now something that my hard earned account will be banned for because it offends?Wayyyyy too broad, unlikely enforceable in a court of law...but then again, who would sue? And it‚Äôs a private mega company. Food for thought
---
What level are you on both platforms?
---
The free item of the week being utility emotes that really aren't even fun to use is getting old. Stuff like this should just be added to the game, not pawned off as a freebie.
---
Oh no offence taken! I‚Äôve just found most people that bash bloodied haven‚Äôt actually tried it. I was one myself until I realised that things like the serendipity perk existed
---
I think to Bethesda deaf/mute(&amp; let's be honest colourblind too) are to regular people what PC's are to consoles - you exist but you're not a large enough market to cater to so you're just not a priority.
---
Sounds especially cruel when put that way but that really is the end result, isn't it?
---
I will sell flux, play on pc same username as here....
---
I have a small collection if magazines and a smaller colllection of bobbles but i make up for it with my larger than both drug habit
---
I assume you‚Äôre on a private server. Go to a near by fast travel spot after launching the nuke. Leave the sever and the hop back on. Then go to the nuke zone and they will all be fine. After you kill them all you can leave and rejoin the server and they all respawn. I can usually get 50 of each material doing this.
---
Why not just send a ticket explaining that you where evacuated at the time due to the fires, hopefully u get someone with a heart and they might push to help you. From some of the feedback it really depends on who u get on the other end to what outcome happens just hopefully luck is on your side. FYI Just do come off as entitled  and use manners and you will find you get a better response üôÇ
---
Now they got human NPCs and actual dialogue choices, there's a new big boss named earl, you'll see people nuking monongah mine to start him, the new season someone mentioned is the legendary run, instead of just giving atoms for daily and weekly challenges you get point that progress you through 100 ranks on a board and each level has some reward, ranging from skins, atoms, scrip, repair kits, caps and the like. I think that's the rough gist of it. Oh and a new currency called gold bullion. You'll need to complete the wastelanders stuff where you need to side with raiders or settlers to unlock it and you can use it to play unique plans.
---
Hey if you buy a Bethesda game at this point and expect it to be bug free that‚Äôs on you.
---
They're pretty easy to kill, just tank the damage and kill them before they do too much damage to you.
---
Bethesda is indeed to blame for the game feeling like a job.
---
Who knows whose definitions they'll use.   My point is that it's subjective, even for those two groups given that they're only made up of human beings who put their pants on one leg at a time--along with their biases--just like the rest of us.
---
Exactly üëåüèª
---
Well done.
---
Thank you so much! Some day I‚Äôll be on pc. Hopefully :)
---
If you‚Äôre missing any of the masks I can check my storage and see what I have. Any extras I may have I can drop for you free of charge
---
Does anyone know how to fix the extreme zoom-in on a weapon‚Äôs reflex sight? I have my FOV set on 120 and when i aim down sights the sight takes up the entire screen.
---
Please come guard my camp, you're an awesome model of robot.
---
vault gang approves
---
Why don't y'all just buy a mic?
---
Dude, that boat sales a long time ago. I don't think it could be considered an insult that Bethesda only cares about short term revenue &amp; gives zero fucks to their reputation &amp; having pride in their work.
---
Im not :(
---
Thanks you tried doing this a while now
---
I play on xbox sorry
---
aim for the legs
---
I love and hate when that happens, one one hand I can fire for days and have some to put in my vendor, on the other i have to hold the dpad down for 10 minutes until I hit the number I actually wanna sell
---
I‚Äôm not on right now but I‚Äôm pretty sure Casual is Luck
---
I prefer a dev team focusing on creating new content, fixing bugs and maintaining a game. Not stressing out on putting out enough cash shop items.  
---
The old system with free Atoms, meant they had to pump out 2 items each week. 1 item that would soak up the free Atoms and a 2nd item to encourage some players to buy extra Atoms. What if one of these two items isn't liked by the players? Someone has to give Bethesda $ to pay their bills.  
---
A game giving you free stuff means there's a paywall somewhere else. That's the first rule of B2P (and F2P) games. Junk Storage is one of these paywalls. The Legendary Run with Fallout First is a decent combination imo. I know what I will spend each month and there's plenty of goodies in return. Haven't needed to spend any extra $ on Atoms. And no I did not had massive amount already from the Atom Challenge period, I started playing in May.  
---
I do agree Bethesda could have experimented with Caps, Scrip, Treasure Notes or Ammo as Daily Challenge rewards in this interbellum. Personally I do not really need an incensive to kill 10 Scorched or to level up. I understand that players like to work for an reward. We all play the game the way we want and like it. That's great about a mmo, we all get our fun out of it, one way or another.
---
I'm not even allied with raiders
---
But I dont want to be casual I want to be building!!!
---
I'm guessing you don't have scrapper equipped. I did it yesterday and walked away with 2.8k steel.
---
I craft all booze you can‚Äôt find out in the world plus Nuka-Dark, and I craft all chems, stims, and Nuka-Scorched regularly. My characters all run Formula P and Whiskey or Nuka-Dark with Party Girl/Boy. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'm not allied with raiders
---
Aside from outfits to sell the only thing I ever craft regularly is brahmin and radstag steaks for the carry weight bonus.
---
Nah i don't hate them. Quite opposite. They are one of the rare enemies in the game that give any feeling of danger. Even if they can be killed in a second or two like everything else. If anything we need more enemies like this.
---
No problem. I usually put my tent down just outside the nuke zone and dump everything. Leave the server and go back in and just rack up materials.
---
wtf is Zenima ?
---
I lost track of the amount of Stingwing barbs (can't remember mission name) and nice junk items I have scrapped in the past.
---
Now if only Bethesda could figure out the incredibly complicated and expensive method of communication known as "text chat"
---
Nope. Big meaty confirmation windows have saved me from losing things on my computer, my phone, and various other games.
---
Step 1: Uninstall
---
Step 2: Flourish as a human being
---
I prefer dodgy over evasive
---
Agreed, but it is a mild inconvenience.
---
Ah of course, the alternative route. Nah but fr tho this is actually like really annoying
---
I just hit trigger and it stops firing and i hit trigger again and it resumes firing
---
On the upside, that is absolutely a ‚Äúformer‚Äù raider.
---
Making favourited items undroppable would fix this, if it isn't a feature on FO76 already.
---
ZeniMax is the company that owns Bethesda.
---
You're pretty hot for a robot....
---
Wow, that is complete and total crap.  You post it for 3 days on a HOLIDAY weekend.  That's really damn low Bethesda.  And I'll bet in a week or so, they'll post it BACK Up with the update and try to charge us 500 Atoms for the thing we were supposed to get for free.
---
Even more easily picked up from a 100% guaranteed world location.
---
&gt; use the spawn mats **again**
---
We've never had spawn mats in fo76. Been playing since beta and that's never been a thing.
---
I'd be satisfied if they worked like they did in FO4, though. I don't care where everyone else spawns, I built my entrances around where I spawn in, but sometimes I spawn off to the side of that.
---
I want a /spit emote
---
I got the same rolls on a plasma rifle sitting in my vendor for 5k caps collecting dust.
---
What you're doing is technically an exploit, so yeah. If it's annoying maybe it's because what you're doing is unintended.
---
I did double check and it is indeed active.
---
Had to quit to desktop and restart the game to get it to show up.
---
Edit: forgot to say thanks!
---
XBox?
---
I want a thanks for the cheap grub mom emote.
---
Sweep the leg Johnny!!
---
fuck, i totally missed it, i was away for the long weekend.
---
Interesting. Is the ultracite laser just the NW one that shoots plasma bolts?
---
I umm uhhh...
---
Well the vendor bug where people can buy unlisted stuff from you isn't a myth, I've seen it happen. However, the rest of it might be? It might even be fixed at this point, though I doubt it.
---
Luckily for me the reset is like 2am and I'm never on at that time
---
&gt; The Monetization:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The  removal of feasibly obtainable Atoms creates obligation to spend real  money on virtual cosmetics. I already paid for the base game and a  subscription fee. Giving players the opportunity to play for Atoms at  the rate they had before struck me as a sign of good will. With that now  gone, it feels like they are trying to milk this community with  overpriced cosmetics that should be obtainable in game. They are  charging for every little thing, even simple poses in Photo Mode. The  major issue is the fact that the achievable Atoms had been integrated in  this game since it launched. Suddenly, they chose to remove that in  favor of this free season pass which, while it does have some CAMP  items, largely consists of texture reskins for power armor, a couple of  weapon reskins, and base game armor reskins.
---
Jesus Fucking Christ.  Do people seriously forget that the ENTIRE basis of this game making money in the long term when it started out was the prospect of PEOPLE PAYING MONEY FOR ATOMS TO BUY COSMETICS?
---
The fact that actually paying money for atoms to buy cosmetics is such an outrage is the fucking problem here.  Free atoms were supposed to supplement and encourage your purchase of atoms so you could buy shit, but instead Bethesda gave out SO MUCH that no one ever really needed to spend a single cent on atoms.
---
Live service games NEED TO MAKE MONEY, otherwise there's no reason for companies to rationalize continuing to fund their development at a loss.  Cosmetic purchases were supposed to be that source of money but Bethesda was so fucking generous they sabotaged themselves.  Instead of being grateful that you haven't had to spend a cent to buy shit you're outraged that  they've actually dialed the system back to where it should have been in the first place.
---
The atom shop is not supposed to be your toy chest, it's a fucking storefront designed specifically for the purpose of making Bethesda money.
---
Any locked doors I come across, I PA glitch them if they're locked and I leave Propaganda Fliers on the owners bed. One time I did this, I found about 15 Ammo Factory Extractors some one had deep under their CAMP. He immediately left server once he found me snooping and stealing his exploited ammo. 
---
I must know what is going on behind locked doors....even if it gets me killed.
---
Err. Not if everything or at least several things are listed at 30k like this guy said. Besides people smart enough to know about that bug list weightless items at 30k so that it's not wasting stash space.
---
That's not what I'm talking about. Did you have the big ammo factories (from the munitions workshop) around your base?
---
Nice mask
---
It does. I don't have full t65 so I just bought the right arm, jetpack and the paint. I wanted to get it before it gets patched.
---
Once your have a maxed out an the bloodied commando build assualterons become nothing
---
Yeah but then it becomes fallout 4 which is just a soulless fallout themed theme park with no life or uniqueness that makes fallout what it is.
---
And you can‚Äôt use the interplay argument because of course they did, because fallout 1 and 2 both take place in the western US within 100 years of each other so they‚Äôre bound to have the same factions but then they also added so much more unique stuff ontop.
---
Fallout 3 and 4 don‚Äôt have that same interconnected feeling that the original games had because they‚Äôve taken so much from the old that the new stuff just looks average in comparison.
---
VATS is required for magic shotguns, but magic high rate of fire automatics work outside of VATS.
---
I fucking spent atoms way long ago because I thought it was ending sooner rather than just now and I regret it immeasurably. I thought the score dailies and weeklies would revert but they didn‚Äôt so I was lost for about a month and a half not getting anything at all
---
You're wasting your breath.  People will not stop insisting that their 1st subscription entitles them to whatever the fuck they decide it does at any given time.  I seriously question at times whether or not some of these people are just trolls that actually think they game runs on a pay2play system just like how you occasionally see people that complain about there being loot boxes in the game.
---
I do not have that issue with my SSD in my PC, but I have had it with the SSD a long time ago (shortly after player vending launched was the last time I had this issue). Again I said it was only part of the problem. Also unless you swapped it, the ps4 pro didn't come with an SSD.
---
I'm stating a fact of the community, not a normative assessment. I don't like cheaters and refuse to deal with anybody who is blatantly one, whether in trading or just teaming up. But this community as a whole is now infested with cheaters or people who idolize cheating. With the latest vending machine dupe, you had plenty of front page posts saying either "omg thank you whoever dropped me 3000 large handmade holiday gifts" and a comments section cheering it on, or asking if anybody has a spare b252525252525 fixer or explosive gatling plasma. I've seen dozens if not hundreds of posts from "veteran" players who take pride in giving out duped god rolls to new characters. Whether you like it or not, whether you think it's wrong, this community is in full support of cheating and bethesda gives zero fucks. Fixing it is about as high on their priority list as adding cross-play. And spoiler alert, they confirmed they're not doing that
---
Well Derick, I find that calling people a different name everytime they talk to me is an effective way to prevent further communication.
---
That'll definitely make your character dumb enough for a proper assessment of minimum scrap values. I wonder what your crafting condition/durability is, as isn't that a factor too? Those weapons will break instantly lol
---
Thanks, wanted someone to confirm before I spent the atoms.
---
It was a lot easier when you could cripple her one of her wings.
---
It can be breeze sometimes if all goes to plan, but then the next time it all goes to shit and you are left soul-destroyed.
---
Considering I haven't played NW since it released, and this has literally never happened to me, I'd like to assume your correlation is correct.
---
You could have mine if I could give it to you.  Ace the raider is the best.  BOS can F off.
---
Alright well I‚Äôm glad it worked out in the end
---
Nope, I've been playing since beta and it's never been a thing. People assumed it worked like that because of fallout 4, but it didn't.
---
I am not too miffed its just some atoms really, but I don't recall the midday cutoff being posted anywhere. I assumed I would have until Sep. 8th as in the full day. This is just kinda...  eh. Like now it doesnt even give me the option to buy the last two. Just... annoying. I planned on doing this today.
---
You are right about more caps than sense. 
---
I did really well on the Fasnacht plans myself. Sold tons at 400 caps each, and still have a few left. Even the basic masks move for 100-200 caps.  The fasnacht man mask that spawns in the train yard north of whitespring and in the asylum sell for 300 all the time.
---
The new plans from a colossal problem have sold for up to 2k.
---
I started season 1, 3 weeks ago missed several days and didn't bother with a heap of weekly quests and still hit 44
---
Yes, sir. I apologize again for being a useless baby who free loads. I clearly haven't worked for all of my own stuff. All of your assumptions based on literally nothing are totally correct, you're very **very** smart.
---
For the record, I don't buy things from other players. I only use equipment I've found myself.

It's like listening to paint dry watching that vid, I didn't know people could fall asleep while talking, someone give him some jet :-)
---
Its worth bearing in mind that it was originally a raid exclusive reward so you could only get plans from raids. If you were doing daily raids you could get 12 vault steel per day. It was a decent reward for those who were doing the vault raids daily. Its just now that they've thrown the plans in with the other gold bullion plans that it's become an issue. 
---
Doesn't really make sense that murmurgh would sell vault steel at all but they had to make it available somewhere I suppose.
---
She should at least sell 10 pieces per day, allowing you to craft at least one per day of you're maxing your scrip limit. Having to wait 2 days to craft another piece of random nocturnal garbage is depressing!
---
Pistol builds aren't in a good place right now.
---
Wait until the new season starts and use that new alt to cheese the level up challenge each day. That's why my alt gained his first 34 levels on days my level 250 would take too long to level up.
---
Probably getting wiped out by hostile mobs. They tend to spawn in either scorched, mirelurk, or super mutant territory
---
I wouldnt call it an ‚Äúissue‚Äù per se, but I agree it seems a little stupid/annoying.
---
Sometimes I get a little curious too. I don't keep a thing in my camp locked, mostly cause I don't live on any resource and I just put a "have a nice day" sign next to my collectoron. I prefer my house on flat plane or floating so resources are a no go from what I've seen.
---
Given how powerful my build is I rarely feel the need to keep things from my fellow wastelanders. If anything I kinda wish I could leave out more valuable stuff for folk.
---
My top toons are 210 and 170 on PS4 and PC respectively
---
Yea I‚Äôm never desperate enough to pay more than a cap.
---
I didn't even notice it.  I'd like to get it.
---
The fact that you say forced instead of incentivized means they won. You don't see an alternative to logging in every day for their little trinkets anymore even though you don't like it. And this is exactly why they will not stop doing it, because it works
---
I don't want an extra button press to ask me to move my camp.
---
I want Todd Howard and Jeff Gardiner to conference call me and ask me if I'm sure I want to move my camp.
---
It's *that* important.
---
It‚Äôs way to late for suggestions for season 2. It cones out next week
---
Power fist is king of unarmed weapons. I have an instigating one, and it 1-hits everything that's not a boss enemy.
---
They say they‚Äôre rare I have two forest and every other color other then red and yellow but some how ppl tell me it‚Äôs not worth anything
---
It doesn't matter, and if you decide to keep all the bullion you don't get any faction rep. So keep it and expect to do more grinding after for the rep
---
Radaways are a reward too
---
Loot you pull out of a dead ghoul
---
I've only played since July, so I can't be for sure.  But I have seen the mats on the build menu and I've seen many people on this subreddit talk about how they were disabled due to griefing - so I'm completely basing it on that.
---
Still yet, my point still stands: there should be a way to control where spawning occurs.
---
They haven't said they are bugged and don't use them. And I never said that they did. 
---
Read the Code of Conduct, it very clearly states that intentionally using exploits or bugs is forbidden. It is VERY obviously a bug with certain legendary effects on certain weapons. If it weren't then all shotguns could one-shot Behemoths. And all weapons could kill a SBQ in seconds. It could be argued that continued use of a magic weapon knowing you suddenly are a SBQ killing god vs what they were using before or what literally anyone else is doing could be construed as "intentional use of exploits" by Bethesda. Again, I'm not saying they will, or that they said they would, or that **literally anyone else said they would**. That's hypothetical. This is a rabbit hole you pushed me down into with your "BuT wHaT iF dEy DoNt KnOw ItS cHeAtInG?" straw man nonsense. 
---
Your use of a Fixer to kill the Queen fast is a really bad comparison, because it's not ONLY the Fixer that's causing all the damage. You need the right gear, perks and buffs to kill a SBQ in seconds. You don't with magic weapons. Just point and shoot an Junkie's FFR LMG and you kill the Queen, and everything else, in seconds. No additions or Heavy Gunner perks needed. But for a Fixer, you need all the commando perks, sneak crits, two or three buffs, a magazine, tons of perks... you get it. That's not a bug, that's a build, working as intended (well, as intended this week, we'll see about how One Wasteland fucks that up).
---
And, what is this community's obsession with people getting banned for using bugs they didn't know about? I didn't bring that up. There's never been any evidence they they banned someone for picking up stimpaks or buying a weapon second-hand that another guy duped. At least none that I'm aware of.
---
I will try removing it. Hopefully I don‚Äôt have to rebuild my CAMP a 4th time. It gets tedious and annoying after a while. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Edit: well of course I have to rebuild it to change that skin even though I removed it in the Atom Shop. Why wouldn‚Äôt I. Anyway, I will update in a bit after I‚Äôve tested this. Really hoping it‚Äôs this skin which seems to cause a ton of problems.
---
I got half way up the far right hand side of the run without trying.  As in, I never looked at the challenges or whatever they are, I never looked at how to optimise my SCORE or basically even what it was.  I just play an hour or two a day.  And if I missed out on something?  I was having fun without it, I don't mind :)
---
I've got a glue factory at my camp (tatos, corn, mutfruits, and water purifiers) so I guess adhesive is what I craft most. I just got fed up with running out all the time.
---
Please remember this. If you have it with Covert ops put it second last and covert ops last. If you dont have covert ops put it last. It will award you the right damage amount
---
I always do all 3 pylons and do everything in my power to stay alive. It‚Äôs a thankless job but it‚Äôs honest work.
---
Oh, fair enough.
---
jfc this has been said dozens of times already...they're bugged, they don't properly benefit from heavy gunner right now in the PTS
---
Yes, but you don't claim season rewards via the atom shop.
---
I've had a couple times where I've killed something just as it was mutating to legendary and got nothing.  
---
Literally nothing.
---
meat 6 days
---
I like the suit, mainly for nuke zones, but it really annoys me that it makes the dot in my dot sight invisible too. Had to put a short scope on it.
---
Also I *hate* that you can't wear outfits over it. I get my character a look I like, and then nope it's gone. Granted mainly only in nuke zones, but still.
---
I always wondered why isn't this live yet. Most games have that automatically added to their shops.
---
I'd say both categories. Antiarmor, ts, berserkers, exc..
---
Ghoul Officer found a better gun to use.
---
It's such a good system. A place where nobody will shun you for talking too much, or not enough. Most will just leave if they don't like it and you are free to leave as well. It's a revolving door. 
---
That said, other players can be a source of information, help, or entertainment if you need it.
---
I helped a rando tame a pet last week, took all of 15 mins and they were super appreciative of the new deathclaw flatmate.
---
I had 76 floater grenades in my inventory today. It's the new missile syndrome.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Recipe:_Tato_salad
---
Looks like it is only found as a reward form the Graham's meat cook event.  Which was a limited time event.
---
You can probably find it at player vending machines as well.
---
Yeah, the CSA doesn‚Äôt do too much beyond being a rad suit with some DR. It‚Äôs still a lot of fun for me to use though, and I‚Äôll continue to use it when it‚Äôs just me doing normal, non boss fight/waves. For the real end game stuff though it‚Äôs almost useless though.
---
I should've put nuisance rather than issue, as people are shitting themselves because I called it an issue but yeah
---
Me too. We are waiting for new hairstyles. Hopefully nothing like the Megatron one.
---
This is correct. I was a skeptic, so I bought the serum and gave it a shot. Private world, only me on a public team, extra to all specials.
---
Definitely worth it!
---
I don't even care about the materials though. It's the hours upon hours of item placement and build tricks to place items that you can't place normally. It also won't let you place blueprints like that because of non standard placements.
---
Don't forget free fast travel! Especially helpful in the early levels when caps are tight.
---
Mentats and berry mentats. I can‚Äôt stop. I have thousands. I think I might need help.
---
Thanks for the information, looks like I‚Äôm late to the party.
---
We should be able to roll for Legendary Power Armor parts.
---
I love not having to worry about radiation from nuke zones while still having some DR. I‚Äôve modified all my stealth weapons to have a circle sight so I can just make out the distortion of it, letting me see with some accuracy that my enemy is within my invisible crosshairs.
---
As far as I know the only place you can get the recipe for tato salad is meat week which literally just passed this year.  So hope someone is selling it or wait until next meat week.
---
As other said, doing Events and scrapping weapons with Scrapper is the best way. Currently sitting on 12k steel.
---
I managed to finish the season on my primary account and almost finish on a secondary one. It was fun trying to get all the "goodies" on two profiles and to try and justify the Fortifying Atlas events. Bum darn it, it was a lot of work... But it also gives me a chance to level my other builds and try something new and "chill" with the different teams for the week. I play on Xbox One and if you want to join me to finish challenges  in other categories, my profile name is SoleSole1264250. Message me if interested and I'll give you as many of the plans I picked up as possible. Or show up at my camp and check out  my location. Feedback is welcome.
---
That'll be 1600 atoms, and part of a bundle as an exclusive.
---
Honestly with public teams now there's no reason not to run Herd Mentality.
---
Just as an update I finally heard back from Bethesda who are asking for a DxDiag File.
---
I get the feeling they‚Äôre getting ready to tell me that it‚Äôs my computer and not their game.
---
Been there. I hate it when their bodies fall through the floor too. Happened twice in a row at West Tek one day. I‚Äôll never know what they would‚Äôve dropped me. Probably a Nocturnal Shovel (SBQ has given this to me twice), but still... the possibilities lol.
---
I thought the stealth boy mod only works if you‚Äôre standing still, like chameleon?
---
In terms of looks, I'm quite a fan of the LMG, deathclaw gauntlet, assaultron blade, 10mm SMG, gatling laser, and gauss rifle.
---
Edit - also the sheepsquatch staff, and cultist blade + dagger.

yes really it is. You can make it just as good yourself for at less than 5th of that price. But if I have to choose between multiple cups of good, expensive, coffee made by wonderful baristas each month and then a 1st sub just to enjoy a game I already paid a lot for.... I choose coffee.
---
But also, as I mentioned, Im not going to dish out a years sub when I know that there will be months where I wont play at all; so really my monthly price will be the 18$ if I have to sub, not the 10$.
---
Some people think that if they spend an hour preparing for the next day, leaving a character at the edge of levelling up and so on, then flat out rush the dailies, then somehow it only took 20 minutes.
---
Cranberry relish for xp buff. 
---
Brain fungus soup for food/int buff. 
---
Berry mentats for int buff and "heat vision".  
---
Company Tea for AP regen buff.

5.56 ammo

Whiskey, sugar, mentats, boiled water, sweet labrador tea as components for above items.

You'll have to rebuild cause you gotta reolace your camp thing to get the skin off of it or it'll stay until you move locations
---
I'm impressed.  I 100% expected them to still have CHORE challenges that do nothing except annoy us, or even caused bugs of some kind.  To actually remove the challenges entirely and not introduce more bugs while doing so, is uncharacteristically competent of them.
---
1st time I joined one I was pretty confused. Trying to take out all the adds and wondering why it wasn't progressing. Then I barely remembered some reddit post I read off handedly and tried to click on the pylons with nothing happening.. then it ended and a couple angry emotes started popping up.
---
2nd time, I died being a good conduit and the event passed. Got the imposter suit.
---
So, some of us are trying.
---
For the love of God, a real "thank you" would be nice. Just make it the sign language thank you.
---
Also love the ones where you just hear constant heavy breathing, to the point where you're not sure what they're doing.
---
That's dense, fam.
---
But everything to do with people‚Äôs perception of the game
---
Ya, just thought it was kind of funny .... aside from the obvious and usual bugs
---
thanks for breaking the 4th wall and ruining my immersion
---
Well said. I started season 1 about 20 levels behind everyone and bought 10 levels with atom to catch up. Finished about 2 weeks ago :). Maybe it wasn't worth it but it was really just a warm up for season 2. Damn straight I'm getting that Appalachian train set. Choo choo!
---
OOF missed that one.
---
I‚Äôve noticed that if the enemy doesnt have the legendary on the quick inventory, if you hit X or whatever it is on PS4 and PC; that it will 99% of the time show there. (Or from my experience)

MEAT WEEK! 
---
Will be happening again , if we donate enough glass. 
---
Planned for Sept 22-28
---
Good luck!
---
There will be a second meat week coming up shortly as a reward from the Atlas community challenges. Sometime this month
---
I mean there kind of is as long as you are away from your previous CAMP build because it asks if you want to spend the caps to move.
---
The PC to console argument doesn‚Äôt really hold water though because ESO has a perfect text chat system on consoles after people begged for years. I imagine the engine is physically incapable of making it work correctly and the ‚Äúlow on the priority list‚Äù is just an excuse not to implement it.
---
Now THAT would be a great Halloween ‚Äúskin‚Äù
---
Yeah I love it for the rad resist too. For laughing off nuke zones and for stuff like getting ore in radiation rumble.
---
With perks it gets up to reasonable defenses so I'm not too fragile as well, very handy on my unarmed character since they're in the thick of it all the time. My stealth sniper pretty much never gets touched so it doesn't matter too much.
---
I used my invisible dot sight for a while but it just annoyed me too much so I just went with the scope.
---
Yeah I've read it - so we can't use bugs right?
---
Now as a community are we to decide among ourselves what weapons are bugged or would you agree thats something better left for Bethesda to tell us.
---
Assuming you are with me so far - If Bethesda has not achknowledged magic weapons as bugged weapons and told the community they should not be used - then why is it you think people using magic weapons are now open to being banned?
---
Yes my fixer works great with my build and perks - and if I build myself around junkies, and get a magic junkies weapons? 
---
How would a casual player with a junkies build know any better?  Why would they instead not assume its fling amazing damage because of their build and perks? And why would they even care?  Who in gods name picks up a weapon and worries about being banned because its doing more damage than their last? 
---
Imagine trying to explain this to a new player to fallout 76.
---
Welcome to the game.
---
There is a great community here and I think you will really love it here.
---
Oh and before I forget - Here is a list of weapons you can't use. 
---
Yes, they are available in the game through natural gameplay, but if you pick one up or get one as a reward and use it, you will be banned so be vigilant at all times and if in doubt with any weapon - just drop it just in case.
---
Oh and this list is not exclusive - there might be other bugs in weapons we are not aware of just yet so if you think anything is a bug, drop it immediately. Better safe than banned.
---
As I've previously said, Bethesda has had ample time to remove the offending weapons from reward pools and has not - so I think its safe to say nobody is getting banned for using weapons rewarded through natural gameplay.
---
Its not like a player uses an expolit to obtain them - the game literally gives it to you - drops it right there in your lap.
---
To circle back to my original point - Bethesda will not be banning anyone for using magic weapons.
---
That's awesome, I'm keen for some NPCs actually. What's Earl like in comparison to the SBQ? Are there many NPCs or just a few added for quests?
---
Haven‚Äôt seen an ambitious one yet, only an observant
---
They're waiting for that Multiplayer Skyrim(Together?) to figure it out before they steal it.
---
On pc you can begin to emote and quickly go to main menu and into photomode. The animation will continue  I'm sure it can be done on console as well. Just have to emote and instantly go to main menu.
---
Well, you'd almost only ever need to carry 1 Core instead of, like, 15. That's nice
---
Have 109 Recall keycards, usually solo imposter, not a difficult event when prepared for it.
---
Hold it right there!
---
Literally just ESO at all times.
---
too bad dense takes a permanent slot in my life.
---
They always wanna watch, never wanna chase it themselves üò™
---
Good thinking, Max.
---
I did
---
Yep. This.
---
There was some interesting stuff in there! A clause on text chat which might suggest it‚Äôs coming to PC soon for example
---
There is a mod on PC for text chat though which would make that 'engine limitation' argument invalid.
---
I wish we could change stuff out on the fly like in Fallout 4 at benches cause both the queen and earl have armor stations nearby.
---
-use no mic emote

You have a trap camp? What system? If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôd love to have a look at it.
---
I would have to say annoying kids most likely
---
Like skim read or word for word and interpreting the legalese?
---
No, because every single time we‚Äôve hit way over the goal by a margin of 250 which is what we donated, EXCEPT concrete. Concrete we got 1 over the goal. ONE. That‚Äôs literally not even possible without fudging the numbers. Why wouldn‚Äôt they just do it with every single one if it was fake?
---
Thanks everyone.
---
One of the top 10 requests is to know how many top 10‚Äôs there are.
---
Yeah just recently started having this issue.
---
Actually it does hold water.
---
&gt;So speaking of in-game tools, I really wanted to pin the devs down on what I think is a critical omission of Fallout 76: the lack of communication tools to build communities. Why hasn‚Äôt Bethesda prioritized working on key social tools ‚Äî namely guilds and text chat?  
---
&gt;This touched a nerve (in a good way!), as the devs said that this was the ‚Äúnumber one‚Äù most asked question. The answer to that lies with the fact that prior to the Steam launch, a majority of the players actually played on console, so the need for text chat wasn‚Äôt quite as pressing.  
---
&gt;But this is clearly an issue that isn‚Äôt going to go away, nor does the team hope it will; both Gardiner and Baudoin said that the team has had many ‚Äúconversations‚Äù about text chat and the like and that there are long-term plans that may involve tackling this.
---

---
Bethesda has said the same thing about looking into text chat for the past 2 years. It's not a priority for them.
---
However, thanks for playing. Better luck next time.
---
Word for word. There was no legalese. It was all straight and to the point.
---
They should just give us garages for each wall
---
None of it makes sense. Why would you need special steel but not need and strangler pods or blooms?
---
What even is vault steel?
---
What even is scrip?
---
And Yellow.
---
I like to whisper in my mic when talking to other people, pretending like my quality is shit, and when I‚Äôm fairly certain they‚Äôve turned the sound up:
---
Blast ‚ÄúBodies‚Äù into my mic.
---
Makes me sad. Plasma and fusion cores are excluded
---
Yeah, ONE WEEK of being nice would have been, uh.
---
Nice.
---
It isn't too much to ask I don't think, especially with so many of the Atom Challenges that are available for players being bugged (Hello, kill 13 tough enemies. Hi there, do 23 daily quests.)
---
Is it so bad to let us have just a little sup at the table for one week?
---
What happens then?
---
Yep, it‚Äôs that simple.
---
Cyberpunk 2077
---
A player can put any item, for any amount of caps they want. It‚Äôs THEIR vendor. Some people do it as a joke. Some people do it to display something that they are proud to own. Like when people were fighting each other for toilet paper because of Corona, I often saw people selling toilet paper for 30,000 caps. Some people do it for laughs, some people DON‚ÄôT have the scrap box. So to keep a junk item they like from being accidentally scrapped, they put it for sale.
---
I actually had to talk to him again now, months after finishing the grind, because I picked up junk that was undroppable and could only be delivered to him. Bitter times
---
Ok as an update: DemonSlaya666 is the smartest person alive.
---
In all seriousness though, this fix worked. It was officially that damn CAMP skin from LR.
---
So while Bethesda took 5 days to get back to me only to ask for a DxDiag File, the FO76 community helped fix the problem in a couple hours.
---
I‚Äôm debating on whether I should reply. I‚Äôm honestly thinking of giving them the DxDiag file but then also explaining to them that the community already figured out a fix and that it‚Äôs a skin causing havoc.
---
Thank you DemonSlaya666 and everyone who replied. This was killing my game.
---
I do it every now and then if I'm really bored and need missles. Kidding about that last part, no one needs missles.
---
i heard about an exploit that player teams might buy your entire inventory because then your stash goes on sale, Probably bullsht but it is why my .38 rounds are 20k EACH. Good luck emptying my inventory
---
I have been contemplating a bit a self induce murder for the opportunity to plunge to my death.

would definitely love a chinese pistol skin for the 10mm smg

Coffee aside, and I'm not trying to convince you .)
---
But if you play more than 6 months in a year, the yearly sub is cheaper even if there are some months where you don't play.
---
The monthly is only cheaper if you only need F1st sporadically or play less than 7 months.
---
wasted all that gold on it. used it twice. took it off.
---
True. But it still doesn't destroy things. It stores them.
---
I like it
---
a lot of it stems from the fact that a lot of people who play Fo76 never asked for it to be online in the first place, and play it in a singleplayer fashion anyway.
---
there's no need for it to be a 'service'.
---
Every time I go against Earle we can never seem to put a dent In him. And always fail the mission
---
Similar boat as you OP, it sucksüò≠
---
I think that it was copy and pasted from ESO. It mentions that game a few times and they have text chat. It also said we can‚Äôt trade or sell, but we have vending and they don‚Äôt.
---
Seriously I stopped player shopping (and vending) about a week or two ago. 
---
It's pointless, and up to like 80-90% of people have no idea how to price shit to move, or what to stock.
---
Even ammo is hit and miss. I love seeing '10,856' under ammo and you get there and it's 5000x 38's, 4,000x 10mm and the rest is syringer.
---
Any meaningful trade I made never even happened in a vendor environment anyway, so all my machines have been scrapped and no more visitors. I'll sell through discord and here (when I see a mention of an item I have) and the game doesn't punch me in the dick for 10% of my profits for no reason.
---
Well, we have the no mic emote - hopefully that means they‚Äôre slowly working on it somewhere?
---
Seriously, I‚Äôd love some text chat. I prefer not to use the mic in this game, and having a way to just type would be great.
---
If you do more PVE than PVP it is good for getting to areas where you can see the entire event horizon. I run Uny AP Sent and its just a blast. Just wish I could move some points and wish Goat Legs had a 100% reduced fall damage perk. I'd be set! Lol

Weirdest? A nukezone w/o radioactivity.
---
The most annoying? Travel Bug and sleeping mobs that can't be looted.
---
You have to deal with hackers *smoothly*
---
rly ?... and from there do i get mine ?\^\^   
---
they are ingame since "Fastnascht" this Year
---
And again.  We killed Earle yay! oh I am instantly dead.  NFI what killed me.  Annnnd I've spawned outside in the rads.  Well, I still get the event rewards, just can't loot Earle.  At least I didn't have to run up that frickin tunnel.
---
When IS season 2 anyways?
---
But on PC, the Bethesda account name is usually different than Xbox gamertag.  Even if playing through Xbox Game Pass PC.  I play through Steam and my name wasn't available, so I can't even message a random player through Steam.  You have no way of knowing whether a PC player is accessing the game through Bethesda, Steam or Xbox PC App.  
---
So for that to work, you'd have to hope that the person you're trying to communicate with has the Xbox app and their account names match.  We do have other 3rd party apps that you have to hope the other player is using.  But then you're in the same boat as the Xbox app because it's all 3rd party.
---
Oh, I missed the collectron... well fuck I guess, didnt even know it came in store since I was taking a bit of a break between seasons
---
Headed to the chapel and were going to get married
---
I just figured that was a reference to RMT stuff and other trade scam type stuff
---
If thats the way it is what‚Äôs the point of playing? You are supposed to level up in order to beat big enemies. That‚Äôs how games go. If it‚Äôs that way then they will lose a lot of hard core players and their fallout 1st money.
---
The ultimate *volunteer*.
---
Bethesda... sympathetic... haha haha you forgot the ‚Äújk‚Äù though.
---
Waaaaaaay at the beginning
---
What kind of lazy dumb stupid idiot bs is non-dc‚Äôd bundles? Embarrassing
---
Yeah same, taking a little break until the next patch but now a little pissed these limited time rewards just kind of flew by
---
Tl;dr version of the lord of the rings
---
I don't hate assaultrons, Polly for example is quite nice.  I just hate the head mounted beam of insta death.
---
Yesterday on Xbox, 2 ticks kept biting me. I couldn't use VATS on them. If I shot at them or hit them, nothing. It was like they weren't there, but they were. No red dots on my perception. It was super weird. Had to bolt or else they would have killed me.
---
Probably not since they tied them to score. If they turn em on people not finished will start getting score again.
---
Nuka Cola My Blood‚Äôs In It is always a tickle (and easy) to craft. :~) Great before Line In The Sand or just to fill a slot in your vendor.
---
No it's not the one you get from Raiders. There's another ammunition factory that people have found a glitch to blueprint and then install in their camps. Then they can't scrap them.
---
But if you don't have that, I think you'll have to submit a ticket to Bethesda if moving your camp doesn't fix it.
---
One last thing: Check under stored in the build menu and make sure there is no stored blueprint.
---
Well it most certainly wasn‚Äôt observant.
---
There's literally an inside the vault where Bethesda says "plans change". I'm not going to re-litigate Fallout 1st and the repair kits, but Bethesda have admitted to changing their plans. So I'm not wrong
---
This is true for me, at least it was. I suppose I still play the game like a single player game, and it plays well for the most part but I also know that they won‚Äôt drop the fallout IP as a single player IP and that this is just another flavour of Fallout to play. There will be a Fallout 5 that much is certain. 
---
But I‚Äôve come to really enjoy 76, fighting with or alongside other players and coming across players RP‚Äôing as NPC has been great. And for when I want to go full RPG I‚Äôm a first member. 
---
Even from a quest point of view I think some have Been better than fallout 4. The RaRa quest in Wastelanders is my favourite BGS quest in a long time.
---
This is shouldn't have to be a request this has to be fixed
---
X-01 plan jetpack would be needed.
---
Rather than burn 5k caps get someone to craft it for you.
---
Thetes porn for this go there
---
A wedding ring. Special abilities include:
---
Cap stash cut in half.
---
\-3 endurance
---
Alcohol addiction
---
As a newbie (well level 35 now) thanks for looking out for us. You and the other players who have dropped me Aid or helped me with a more challenging event. It‚Äôs made the game really enjoyable!! 
---
I can‚Äôt think of anything I need help with right now personally. All my quests require me to head to the right of the map but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready for that yet so I‚Äôm just taking my time and grinding events and looting! :)
---
OK. Well I guess if they are asking for that, you might as well give it to them. At least you can hear what they claim to be the problem and go from there.
---
But like I said, I've had a similar problem and I'm on Xbox so... It's their game. üòÇ
---
You also may want to check your power connections to the vendors.  I moved my camp and didn't realize that I had lost some wiring to my generator when I blueprinted my vendor building.
---
Would that work? The jetpack is its own thing not just a thing for the original jetpack.
---
I make decent money on my machines but like you mentioned I price shit to move and I put prices that actually make sense. I've found some cool items and good deals in vendors so I'm not giving up on them yet, just extremely annoying seeing morons put items in for max caps that are barely worth anything to begin with. Always at least one or two minimum of these nuisances in each server and they think it's a joke apparently? Jokes have punchlines or at least some comedic value. Overpricing dumb shit has no comedic value, just wastes people's time. Can't say I blame you for not wasting your time on them anymore, it's definitely seeming pretty futile to use the machines how they are intended
---
Why would they take them away if they were going to give them to us?
---
I totally understand the Atom shop being what it is. None of the updates or dlc cost money, so they have to keep the servers running somehow. Only issue I have is the pricing in the shop, however it is steadily improving.
---
Hmm.. Things I craft often.
---
Berry Mentats, Psycho, Overdrive, Cranberry Relish, Corn Soup, Blight Soup, Ballistic Bock, Company Tea, Formula P.
---
I use the crap out of Formula P, and since blight soup/overdrive/psychotats/ballistic bock stack, I always down those before boss fights along with whatever bobbleheads/magazines that I might have that are appropriate.
---
Edit: Forgot Radshield.
---
2.7 needed to be said
---
Heres looking at you ‚Äúraiders‚Äù with your punji board bullshit
---
You mean collecting wood logs? Prickett's Fort upper center right of map.
---
That was it. I put 4k junk on my vendor for 1 cap each (bc I really needed it gone, I was weight capped hard) and it was gone in a minute.. out of curiosity - are there any lists about what each type of junk is worth on average?
---
There was a roman themed one a month back or so, it wasn't "Cesar's Legion" it was just standard Roman Legionnaire armor
---
Yh I did this had a real nice home then placed the camp down and then could get the right spot when I replaced it so I spent an our just rebuilding it
---
Summersville has a house with allot of burnt books (over 100+) collect them and hop servers
---
This is one thing I forgot to mention, there was a culture of barring items behind bundle prices however like with the communist bundle (bugs aside) this was better.
---
This is a moronic outlook. 99.9% sure you‚Äôre a cheater.
---
Did it come with a helmet?
---
Goat legs level 2 makes falling a non issue.
---
I have done my own testing and it's not 180 items.4 times i collected just over 180 and the items i collected first didn't appear but when i collected over 255 they did. If it was 180 it isn't anymore. Angryturtle on youtube did a video and said it was 255 items and from my own testing i'd have to agree.
---
ANYWAY! Fast travel to summersville and slightly to your right is a house with like 200+ books in it. Go ham.
---
I think so.
---
Will be seriously disappointed if it's just a prefab we have to stick somewhere and it just doesn't snap with anything. 
---
Am really wanting a door for walls,  and a trap door for floors. (Think the floor safe stash)
---
That way they can be easily integrated into our existing camp builds.
---
What I'm hoping to do is take the entirety of the back side of my camp and put it in the instanced space then deck out my front house. 
---
Wondering if the space can be changed up at will to be tall, long, or wide as we please. 
---
I'm sure there will need to be limits on its maximum dimensions just let us figure out the shape.
---
Am wanting an effect where people enter and climb downward,  or upward depending on what suits the terrain we built in.
---
Would be really interesting if we just make a space with basic foundations, walls, and roofs and the instance is activated within that. Would allow for multiple entrances/exits and will greatly confuse players who glitch their way past doors.
---
Just need to figure out how that would work for underground builds.
---
If it's a pre built space that we can extend would imagine it  starting off as a 2x4x4 or some such space then we add additional rooms/halls from there.  Expand the space to be a giant underground singular room, or make it a winding set of halls for something more labyrinthine. 
---
That we haven't heard any specifics at this point suggests to me that its not due for a long while still. Meaning the wait for mannequins/power armor displays  will either be agonizing if their released together,  or that well have to delete half our camp to display even a single clothed mannequin. 
---
Anyone have any more legit news on the subject?
---
Honestly, with me or another specced high level by you theres no mission too much. My city is in firewatch so it may be a bit before im back on. Sing country roads for me in solidarity
---
Everyone got it.  It probably updated so they have to let you know the new terms and you have to acknowledge.
---
You didn't do anything.  Unless you did.  But this isn't a result of anything you did.
---
Testing it myself I'm only seeing a very small difference from 5 INT to 30 INT. Like one piece difference when something returns 20 pieces. So it seems like it's under 5% difference which is a bit disappointing that it makes such little difference. I always thought it would be a larger difference.
---
Here's the contents of the scrapbonusint.json curve table in SeventySix-Startup.ba2 if anyone is interested in seeing the table responsible for this function.

I just had to do it. I think everyone does.
---
Most items are simply copy/paste from fallout 4 or even worse the creation club. Also the pricing is way too expensive, 9euros for an outfit or 18euros for a power armor skin/recolor is just overpriced.
---
Like someone else mentioned, the comunity requests alot of stuff they want for ages now and still we get mostly bugged crap that doesn't work or is falsely advertised.
---
Imho microtransactions should be banned from games that already have to be purchased like it was in the past. The development cost didn't rise that much (in fact it didnt got expensive if you clear out the inflation) and most of the budget is for marketing. Maybe add dlc's but that's all.
---
Sweeet ! Ty mate
---
This is pretty much my experience, but from the other side. I‚Äôd love to help players with stuff when in teams, I have experience and good gear. But as someone with severe hearing loss I cannot use headphones and mic. Text chat would make such a difference.
---
Books! Haha I love that, thanks!
---
That feeling when you just go BRRRRRRRRRRR until there is no enemy left
---
I disagree. I use the chat feature in Elder Scroll Online. I really like the guilds, zones, etc. I can ask for help for a game thing. Send a chat to the group in the dungeon, etc. It would be fun to have an event chat where I could say, heh I found some power armor or fusion core, especially to a lower level character who might not have some of this stuff. It would also help, say with the tea pot event or the Mama Dolce to coordinate who is doing what.
---
It's late for me here so imma make this short, I mean no disrespect to anyone with what I say.
---
Firstly, Bethesda stated that while micro-transactions would be in the game, they would be purely cosmetic. They lied when they introduced repair kits and scrap kits. Not a huge deal but it's the fact that people feel betrayed by Bethesda, especially when Bethesda was highly respected way back when.
---
 
---
Secondly, Fallout 1st, what a mess it caused. To begin, people asked for private worlds since day 1, and they got behind a pay wall. In a way it makes sense, too many private worlds can create stress on the server's so limit the amount of users by introducing a pay wall. People got pissed because they assumed it would be free. You could blame in on players for being too expectant and demanding, but also blame Bethesda for poor communication (can put this anywhere in this statement) in not explaining this before Fallout 1st. 
---
To continue, infinite junk storage, a middle finger to every none 1st subscriber. Players struggle with stash limit, especially collectors and it often leads people without the junk they need to make camps, fix and upgrade weapons etc. infinite junk stash is something everyone wants and needs (key part) in order to make management of storage possible/easier. Therefore, putting it behind a pay wall pissed alot of people off. 
---
Lastly, the price is just ridiculous at ¬£100 a year, for a game many people spent ¬£60 for already, just to be able to have was they asked for since day 1. To many people it felt like Bethesda were taking the absolute piss. 
---
To conclude, I just want to say I have no issue with cosmetic micro-transactions at all, I'll complain if I think prices are too high but that will the extent of it. With Fallout 76, it all comes down to the fact that many people felt betrayed by Bethesda, and rightfully so as Bethesda did lie to players a fair bit about this game both before and after launch. That betrayal grew into annoyance as Bethesda failed to communicate with players properly so people got fed up and just started to complain about everything they could just to make a point. 
---
Now all this analysis is simply so I can say this. For Fallout 76, micro-transactions do not need to be removed, but paused. Nothing else should be introduced and instead Bethesda need to tackle the current issues. People pissed about Fallout 1st? Lower prices and maybe swap out its perks so all players get infinite junk storage and in exchange fallout 1st users get more atoms or something like that. Bethesda need to hide their greed, focus on players quality of life in game and communicate with them in order to rebuild the respect and status they once had. (Though they still have those in decent quantity, it's not what it used to be).
---
100% agree.  Since I see the SBQ event far less now I could really use another source of improved repair kits.  Earle and a couple events should give us these now and I'd be a happy camper.
---
Riiiiight. You must be new here, and never bought or traded for *any* end game gear.
---
You can just sit in the corner, all self righteous with your  power armor.
---
Hah! I don‚Äôt want to jump into anything until my character is ready. I want to hold my own! And I really wanna launch a nuke! Would definitely love some PS4 friends to run along side with though! I just got 1st tonight to play on my own server and not run into overlevelled areas because someone else has been there! 
---
I‚Äôm so excited for one wasteland though. That should help a lot! 
---
That rendition of country roads is my fav!
---
To keep players playing daily and weekly until the next season/update happens? The legendary run ended today, and update 22 with the new season doesn't come out till a week or so. With the main quest being broken still, you can't do that. You could still grind for some BOS stuff, but as far as substantial rewards for daily activities or weekly activities, there will be none till the next update.
---
Usually it's because I realized that something has destroyed half my camp, but yes.
---
Exactly.  Nowhere does that clause mention real money.  I hate rules that could be interpreted/enforced against normal gameplay mechanics.  They could literally ban everyone just citing that single clause.
---
Camden park has over 200 items.
---
No, no, that can't be it. I think you're close, but it can't be that simple.
---
I dont think it would.  I think the above user was trying to help get the function.  But I assume you want the fashion.
---
&gt; honestly, who's completing that quest, every time I see it gets completed I check the cranberry bog only to see that it's deserted.
---
I have it happen sometimes on a private server;  it's not players.
---
You can be mad at this post all you'd like, just shows me you also probably vend garbage and overprice it, rendering vending machines pointless as more and more people just stop using them
---
clearly hacking in this game is super fucking easy, they are everywhere, making the game really sad lately :(
---
Funny same thing happened to Anthem
---
Badge of honour or shame?
---
Both would be ideal
---
I have lots of great stuff.  I never duped. I don‚Äôt have an ammo collector at my camp. Remember when vendors were shut down for weeks? This is what isn‚Äôt cool.   Glitch through a door to drop a nuke and you‚Äôre a hero.
---
How often do you run into these items in player vendors? It happens maybe every once in a while on my end. Is this an imposing problem that‚Äôs effecting your play sessions?

Did you place those two white railings a while ago or just recently? I tried to delete a porch foundation to leave a railing behind earlier today and now it won't let you delete the porch till you scrap the railing. Just asking because I'm hoping there's another way to glitch those into placing.
---
If I recall correctly it had no mention of Fallout 76, but plenty of other TM, odd, though anyway not enforceable in many cases.
---
Love the game. 1st member since my second month into the game. Play daily. Finished the Season without spending a cent and overall totally happy with it.
---
OP if I realised anything about this sub and the world, nobody is ever happy. You'll never please everyone. 
---
Our game is imperfect, but what isn't ya know?
---
Fishbones at Ohio River Adventures gives me trouble too.  I'll try to talk to him or continue with the dialogue and he just says "I know I'm handsome, but it's rude to stare."  But Ward's the worst.
---
Have my free award for visibility. Fellow dweller.
---
Thank you for making the original post!  Very much needed!
---
My husband finished the season at least a month ahead of the deadline and I was done the week after.  I laughed that we'd been so worried about finishing when it really was so easy and didn't require tons of grinding.  Just like you said, most all of the daily challenges and at least several of the weekly challenges can be finished in an hour or so a day, especially if you focus on them.  I did make a new character to deal with the leveling up when I realized it was taking me forever.  lol
---
Oh yeah, text chat for spammy cap and legendary sellers
---
When I try to build it, it says I lack the requirements.
---
No problem! Lots of wood logs there.
---
The way this is worded makes it seem like we ain‚Äôt allowed to even do player trading. So pack up the vendors and stop trading y‚Äôall...
---
Just try public joining teams. Sometimes a team member will drop by your camp to check out your store since they can fast travel there for free. They may wave at you, but that's it. They may also occasionally join event you are doing but it seems rare.
---
I may be wrong but, sleeping bonus does not stack with Cranberry Relish. 25% bonus will be dropped to 20% from relish, plus the 5% from sleeping. You can save time and just worry about keeping your belly full of Cranberry relish. Reminder, find a main spot to get cranberries but only grab about 4 each time. With super duper you will have enough relish for 2-4 hours. Cranberries can take a while to respawn so don't go overboard. Please correct me if Im wrong, I noticed this recently.
---
That‚Äôs some big brain shit right there
---
Isn't it 13 Vsteel per Solar/Thorn piece, though? You'd still only get 1 craft every 2-3 days. If anything, I think they should uncap it since you're still limited by scrip.
---
Probably would have better luck keeping track of those kits if he didn‚Äôt constantly have his eye on us.
---
The game takes some getting used to but it sounds like you‚Äôre getting the hang of it! I would suggest using this week to focus on some main quests (like the quest that takes you to the Wayward, etc.) because it helps you learn basic things about Appalachia &amp; you‚Äôll learn various things about the world by talking to the NPCs in the game. Also this is a good week to work on questing/learning the game since the next season of the Legendary Run starts on 9/15 (if you want to partake in that. I find it a fun challenge!)
---
I saw above you wondered why you‚Äôd want to move your camp and as you explore the open world you might find nice areas that offer beautiful views, good water sources, strategic locations (since bouncing off your camp and off of Vault 76 is free fast travel), so things like the above might make you want to move your camp. There‚Äôs also a challenges tab in the game menu (that you get to from the map screen) and by completing challenges you‚Äôll earn Atom currency and one of the challenges is to move your camp a certain # of times. If you need help with events, quests, need some supplies feel free to add me on XBOX- my gamer tag is the same as my username on here. (:
---
Edit: Another thought about moving your camp is there‚Äôs a few ‚Äúhot spot‚Äù areas that get nuked more often than not so it may be in your best interest to learn those spots and try not to place your camp there (whitesprings and also currently Monangah are definitely hot spots). If your camp is placed in an area that gets nuked (on that particular server) i believe the nuke basically destroys your camp.
---
Well, you've duped and exploited exactly as much as I have. But being under the misconception that you haven't benefited in some way from someone who has, is more than naive. I've had a BE handmade I legitimately traded for shortly after BETA, and several uny sent pieces of armor from tue same time. I have no illusions about their likely origins.
---
I also don't really care what other people do in game.
---
But what do I gain from participating in the first place, all seems like a waste of time to me.
---
End of season one was today. Season Two is out in a week with next patch
---
I thought it was 10 with the armourer perk equipped but its been a while since I finished my set so I could be wrong there
---
Booze for Bivs daily.   I like Biv as he reminds me of a friend I almost never get to see anymore.  Alcohol recipes ALWAYS sell.  And I like using 3 workbenches and my sink.  It feels like real crafting going from bench to bench until I get the final result.
---
Smh
---
As far as I know you never got both from one nuke. You either nuked one or the other.
---
There has to be a nuked rad zone around the mine for it to pop both when you launch in the queen
---
I hear the sound of the beam in my sleep.
---
I really want that one and the angry supermutans!
---
Most Legion cosplayers wear the atom shop Legion armor with the Impostor Sheepsquatch helmet from Encryptid. The actual helmet is gladiator-y, but it doesn't look like any of the Legion helmets from New Vegas.
---
https://d27a0rbs4sj628.cloudfront.net/icons/353/emoji/Bunnies%20-%20Flirtmoji.png
---
There was a bug where if you nuked the queen ACP would pop as well, confirmed to work not too long ago.
---
Maybe, sometimes my regular grenade launchers will fire two shots from a clip of one- the game has a hard time keeping up with your clicks versus your running out of ammo
---
Does anyone know what the new terms we're agreeing to are vs the old ones i.e. what's changed?
---
Then what is? I know energy weapons are fucked. What about shotguns and rifles?
---
just tested it, still working.
---
Ah dang, that may explain it, I think the nuke zone had not long expired.
---
I'm sorry you don't understand the way things work.
---
That would be cool if it also came with a 500 cap bounty for indecent exposure.
---
I'll probably just make another alt for that lol
---
Weird, someone just dropped one and no ACP. Needed some repair kits like but I would have preferred to do the ACP
---
If Monongah Mine is irradiated any nuke will trigger A Colossal Problem.
---
I could care less about what anyone does in game or out as long as it doesn‚Äôt negatively effect others. Anyways it is what it is.
---
Are you talking about the greenhouse building set?
---
This. Is. Awesome.
---
No the instanced camp spaces.
---
At least once or twice on almost every server. Sometimes their entire stock is literally all at 30k. Its a nuisance and I'm so tired of paying to fast travel to a camp just to see a 30k item that you can literally find at the very beginning or almost anywhere. Toilet paper was kinda funny the first 2 or 3 times but it gets old fast
---
Yeah, but it only happened to my "communist" character... apparently my photos where of "national concern"... dunno what that has to do with a picture of the giant Chally poop from the Meat Week event but if it keeps Merica safe. My patriotic character on the other hand... I never run out of beer and snack cakes for some odd reason.
---
Plus you hit a point in the game where your needs are so specific (a particular weapon roll for example) that you can't afford to burn hours server hopping to see the very items you mentioned ($30k pies and insult notes for example...).
---
That's mainly why I went to forums and Discord groups. Plus with the pitiful caps limits I just *can't afford to sell anything anymore*.
---
I take a dump and suddenly maxxed caps again.
---
nope but it's not like we have a choice if we want to playü§£
---
Why leave the board up if it won't let me finish it off? I assumed I would have the whole day not 45% of it. Why say Sep 8th is the last day and not let people use it?
---
I just sell everything for under 100
---
not much junk goes for more than 10 caps a piece i've found. ib HAVE paid more for things like black titanium and ultracite when i've found it though. Ballistic fibre i have sold at 15 before. I have paid 30 for coal before but only bcause i really needed it for a serum and wanted to tempt people into selling it. 
---
Junk is worth what people want to pay tbh. If i am near max caps i'll buy almost any to just get rid of caps.  i feel this are fairly fair prices.  
---
nobody wants glass or bone or ceramic. maybe a cap each. 
---
steel, cloth and wood is usually 1 cap per. I have paid more though. Usually when bulked.
---
Lead 2 per. (could probably get away with 3)
---
circuits up to 10
---
Screws about 5 now that ACP is a screw farm. 
---
concrete 3-5.
---
asbestos 3-4
---
antiseptic 4-5
---
Copper 6-7
---
Crystal 5-7
---
adhesive 4-5
---
Fibre optics up to 10 
---
Gold/silver 10 maybe more
---
gears 3-5
---
plastic 2-3
---
Aluminium, Acid, Oil and Nuke material you can charge more for as they are harder to find and people want them. up to 10. even more per.
---
i'm missing some. Prices based on what i have in my scrapbox right meow. i collect everything. So the stuff there's not much of i know i'd pay more for ya feel me?
---
I woke up to the same annoying surprise.
---
Super vague. 
---
Lots of people going to get account name bans. No hitlers or trumps or any reference to historical or current people. Literally that‚Äôs in the TOS. 
---
Role playing is dead unless you role play with a group that all want to role play. Too much role play?
---
Griefing can be practically anything in the game that is not agreed upon pvp. Nuke someone‚Äôs camp...is that griefing?
---
Poor youtubers will have nothing to talk about. All references to glitches or bugs or hacks are bannable. 
---
Bethesda will get all creepy on us and stalk our words on other sites to use against us. Careful what you say on reddit. Probably should not link your reddit name to your IGN. Have I said too much already?
---
No intensional use of bugs or glitches. Soooo....no intensional use of the magic effect. No glitching double walls. I mean the examples are endless here beyond the actual hacks. 
---
No third party software or scripts. Mods anyone?
---
Thanks, I saw this information nowhere until after the fact.
---
&gt; Also the pricing is way too expensive, 9euros for an outfit or 18euros for a power armor skin/recolor is just overpriced
---
This is why people need to stop calling them ‚Äúmicro transactions‚Äù and instead call them ‚Äúmacro transactions‚Äù. There‚Äôs literally nothing ‚Äúmicro‚Äù about a single (cosmetic) item costing ‚Ç¨10+
---
Ended this morning for me, I barely even got my coffee in was ready for a full day of grinding xp. Guess I will start a new char.
---
Don't forget that you can create new characters to get the level up challenge easily in like 15 minutes. Just don't claim the rewards on the new character.
---
That was a mistake on your part. The game's clock always ends at 11 AM eastern. Not only that but the game also had a main screen message giving the exact date and time the event was over. If you missed that, that's not the games fault.
---
Had no idea. I have either gone for one or the other and never noticed it triggered both.
---
What if the Fixer is a skin for the combat rifle?,would that cause it to loose its abilities?.
---
A point and laugh would be good for people that try to grief you.
---

---
Aw right I‚Äôm really wanting a legion Helmet like the ones from Vegas but here‚Äôs hoping they release one
---
See I remember it being a thing that you didnt need the base jetpack plans to make the skinned ones, but a friend last night was in the same boat and unable to craft the cosmos jetpack on his armor.  So I think it may have changed recently.  Recently being sometime in the last 8-16 months when I was unable to build certain jet packs.
---
I think it's less about Fo76 being 'a different flavor' and more about it having no business existing in its current form. I mean, of course Bethesda is not going to abandon singleplayer Fallout games. if anything, they probably want Fo5 out as soon as possible so people forget about this mess.
---
but Fo76 is a perfect example of 'thanks, I hate it'. nobody asked for it, not like this. so discussing about the hate surrounding subscriptions, cosmetics and timegates is somewhat disingenuous considering they're a problem Bethesda manufactured in order to sell the solution. it's pointless.
---
the solution is dropping the mobile scheme altogether. at least half the playerbase would be more than happy to host their own local servers, for one. but of course that would rob Fo76 of its raison d'etre. this game is like a hamster wheel.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve had all my photos disappear a few times. Once was after I got a new PlayStation, so I assume it‚Äôs got something to do with that rather than saving the photos to the account itself
---
Uhhh the mods took your photos as they were communism stuff? Mad haha
---
Did it yesterday. If they have fixed it have you tried using a flame thrower turret and break them. Then delete foundation?
---
How are energy weapons "already" 2nd place?  Besides magic damage Gatling Plasma is probably the best heavy weapon for short/mid range by quite a long ways.
---
There are NPCs everywhere. You'll even get traders wandering in to your CAMP to hang out for awhile. As for Earl, there's a lot of micromanaging while running that fight. For one, he's tanky as hell, then there's the added bonus of the endless wendigos he spawns periodically. When he screams, he sends your character in to a panic and you can't do anything but wait until you stopping running away in fear. While all of that's going on, you want to watch the environment. The ceiling will drop in on you/burn you, there are like... radiation hot spots? Or something? They hurt. Also, the event is maxed out at 8 people, so you have to get in there quick. All in all, I enjoy it a lot more than SBQ. (:
---
There wasn't a time, it just said Sep. 8th.
---
i have tried this 4 or 5 times and it just puts me outside the mine.
---
The ACP has to be nuked first. Then, when you nuke the queen, another ACP appears.
---
I play on two different consoles, as far as I know pics save to the console you play on. In my case, two different Xbox ones.
---
I dunno whos the doucheball that told everyone about the Library in summerville, thnx for leakn the secret spot for cloth... lol Ive been farming there for so long, and when anybody asked if I knew of a good place to farm cloth I always directed them toward the repeatable event up at Morgantown airport :D
---
Like where are all y‚Äôall at? I‚Äôll always check out any camps I see with a bunch of plans, but they‚Äôre almost always over priced. If I can buy the same plans from an npc for less, there‚Äôs a problem. 
---
A lot of plans sell for around 230? from the npc. Then I‚Äôll see the same plans at camps priced at like 250+. Like why are they selling recipes for 50c+? I literally never use recipes. Lol I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever made anything from a recipe tbh.
---
Yup, it really sucks. I hate that they have so many limits in this game. And I am the type to see something I like in a machine and buy it even if I will never use it. So I love hopping from camp to camp and buying shit I don't need lmao and its enjoyable to throw money at someone for something they no longer use or need that I think is cool but selling toilet paper for 30k would have been funny over 6 months ago and the shit is just annoying now. People who call it a joke lack the creativity to do something that could actually be considered funny lmao
---
Don't lower it. Find someone with a lower intelligence and then equalize your bonuses and then each one of you scrap newly made items, recording what materials you each receive.
---
A little Vault Boy comes out at the bottom  (and also female opens top window), does a smartarse tune, then hops back in again.
---
It would certainly be a show of good will on their part during their 'seasons' phase of keeping us logging in.  If there's only a week or two between seasons, how much could it really hurt their bottom line to have that time getting the miniscule amount of atoms those daily and weekly challenges were granting?
---
Building Team (and soon Casual Team) is just shorthand for a team of solos. I never played with my other Building team members.
---
We might come across each other incidentally during a public event but that's it. Handy too given you can loot what they kill too.
---
On the main screen, in the top right, it said the legendary run would end at 12 today. ): I'm sorry you missed out on the last rewards. Next season looks a lot more promising though!
---
Thx mate. I tried to use the steam to start the game and i have sound from my BT. Im not sure it is just luck or its one of the solutions. Need to try few more times.
---
Instance is full or you are not fast traveling thru team list...keep at it, doesn't work every single attempt but so worth it to Double down on rewards and xp.
---
Free psychological warfare boost
---
Ahh I didn't see the helmet. Maybe I got it later but my board was all claimed
---
It appeared that a nuke had been placed on it previously. But seeing as how the nuke zone had just expired, I'm guessing that's why it didn't pop up again.
---
Smash420dankboi: All your mom's are hoes. Suck it.

Yogurtwafflestomper666: Give me free stuff.
---
The main reason things like this don't evolve,is because people are assholes . And they'll abuse someone. It's a shame.
---
Corporate douche baggery. Worry more about a potential lawsuit that their six figure lawyers would have to fight than making the game enjoyable and fun.

TLDR:

Section 1-4 don't be a cunt.

Section 7 No spamming.

Section 8 Appeal detail for when deemed a cunt.
---
I see now. Thanks for clarifying!
---
Oh it was for sure their game. The Legendary Run CAMP Skin caused it. Really odd that a skin would cause such big issues. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs more concerning. The skin causing problems or Bethesda taking 5 days to respond with ‚Äúgive us DxDiag so we can blame you.‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt work in tech support but how would my system specs affect their system AI and pathfinding that they would need that? Perhaps I‚Äôm confused as to what all DXDiag contains.
---
Same for me on PS4 and PC. I don't know how long it's been around, but I started noticing it more around whenever the last update before season 1 started.
---
X. It's a game. If you don't catch them all, so what? If you had a nice day outside, met some friends, saw a good movie, read a book or had any type of nice day instead, it's totally worth "loosing" /not getting some digital goodie instead.
---
Yeah, that's about right. There's hardly anyone playing on Xbox so seeing this much clutter is unlikely. It should also be optional so players can turn it off. Having a board is better than endlessly hopping servers and camps only to be let down on almost every occasion, don't you think?
---
Are you suuuure? I preordered and never saw anyone use the missile launcher. 
---
I used to shoot any missiles/mininukes I had in nuke zones to tag enemies, but then I‚Äôd drop the launchers.
---
Ah, I guess I am too busy unwinding from the day when logging in to notice these things. I am not a hardcore player, never thought I would get as close to finishing as I did. Last night before logging off I saw the other spaceship still had 2 spaces to go. Logic would indicate I had enough time. Then I saw the Sep. 8th stuff and figured I had 1 more day.
---
Server stability I guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I was able to fight it one of the two times I've seen one. It was glowing purple, can't remember the descriptor.
---
Ah yes, being sexist AND not being able to handle other people‚Äôs opinions.
---
I did struggle with season 1, in the beginning I forgot to log in and do my dailies, and I kept getting hit by the autocomplete bug and didn't know why for a while. So I just did the best I could and then threw Atoms at it at the end. I learnt a lot towards the end and your advice make sense... Sleeping to get well-rested, using soups and drugs to pump my INT, logging on even just an hour a day, I think season 2 is gonna be fun!
---
Happens when switching guns in ACP along with auto-fire bug.
---
I think people have been misreading the document that says 180 items as it separately mentions 60 containers, where as Angry turtle counts items, containers, flora etc altogether in his experiments.
---
No monitor emote next pls.
---
In reality the real reason people hate micro-transactions is becuase theyre all poor... the same people that complain about the daily free atom challenges dissappearing. Buncha haters that give fallout 1st members shit becuase they spend all thier time in the wasteland and cant afford 5 dollars for a "cosmetic" item they dont even need to play the game...
---
I've killed a couple and they just drop junk
---
I feel your pain, I moved the 28th of last month, and still have to wait till the 11th for internet. Mind you they‚Äôre just mailing a self install kit ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò´
---
what if bethesda just took room for NPCs from a random encounter spot and made them available for recruitment?
---
Bethesda isn't anywhere fucking close to Rockstar, let alone making them look generous lmao
---
First of all that is hilarious.  Naw  only people that have been banned before have to sign it.  ha.
---
Personally my only issue paying for MT is that the game isn't improving as it should be. We payed AAA price, people even paid for 1st, and we haven't come nearly as far as I think we should have in terms of how the game runs. There are still so many of the same bugs, new bugs occurring all the time.
---
Now as far as content goes, there is a lot. I've enjoyed the game a lot, and continue to do so on occasion. But you never know when your enjoyment will turn to frustration because something breaks or is broken. The norm shouldn't be a broken game if we're paying for the game, as well as the 1st membership, and Atom Shop items.
---
I guess I'm tired of supporting the game more than I have because I feel like it isn't really improving. We're getting more content, but with the same old song and dance of broken issues.
---
people who are tired of seeing this posted
---
I'm sorry they didn't make it more noticeable for everyone. I always check the news and the atom shop when I got in, just to see if there's new deals or anything new going on that warrants my attention. I also check reddit or twitter every now and then to see what's going on, so that's how I knew. 
---
If it helps at all, Fallout 76 "updates" the atom shop and everything on Tuesday (even season 2 starts on the 15th, a Tuesday) at 12pm EST.
---
Xbox for sure haha
---
What perks do you use? I‚Äôm at level 56 so most enemies I encounter get taken out with the stealth bonus before they get to me, and when they do the level 50 stealth suit provides enough defenses to keep me pretty safe. With that said, I‚Äôd love to boost up the Chinese stealth suit to be even better so I can use it longer. Thanks!
---
I am on right now. I can help. 
---
psn: Radcooldude55YT
---
Also, stack dailies if you can - eg if you have to claim a workshop and do an event, that's pretty easy since as soon as you claim a workshop you can stick around until you get the event to defend it. There were others that worked well together, I can't think right now though.
---
Pretty much this. I work a 12hr shift and still manged to get to finish the run.
---
Build in a spot with some settlers. Tada! 
---
I have two raiders at my camp. They mind their own business, procrastinate about raiding foundation, and murder low level players who are not on talking terms with crater.
---
I was one of them.  Didn't know about SBQ explosive resistance.
---
Cushioned mod on legs replaced goat legs/legendary effect for me
---
Griefers and perverts...that's why.
---
It might be too much to ask but I think 'Seasons' should reflect in gameplay. BGS needs to step up their Fallout game engine years ago. I'm not asking for full blown storms as many on PC don't have the best hardware.
---
Wtf ...this is horrible . 100 score from 10k was a great way to earn points . I hate public events . Let me play by myself and enjoy it.  Not waiting on a timer or check point with some goobers. Lots of Afkjng and Xbox msg hate coming my way next season .
---
You can favourite armour so it's in your hotwheel, I have a jetpack and an asbestos one, with the latter being for Earle
---
ive thought of that, thanks for the suggestion. i just wish i could outfit them and assign them to guardposts;( but we cant have everything!
---
You lost me at the first instruction. Dick stuck in Wendigo spawn‚Äôs mouth and it does NOT feel good.
---
Figured that out the hard way.
---
That sounds like it's going to be beautiful ):
---
Oh. Is it considered an exploit?
---
I see people keep saying this but i see loads of people in games. 
---
Right now there's 11 people in teams and a few more than that on the map
---
Should stagger bosses.  I don't care what it is, you should stagger anything with a nuke.
---
What a fresh new idea!
---
No, it doesn't last long and happens at random.
---
May I ask how you do so? Pressing most other keys, including Esc, seems to cancel emotes for me.
---
We‚Äôve been doing exactly this.  Really works.
---
Excavator PA reactive plates and blocker= 75% reduced melee damage taken
---
I can solo tank the imposter sheepsquatch while someone grabs the pylons and the damage gets put on while I keep aggro, done in under a minute a few times
---
spam diluted stims as necessary
---
Need at least 3 people for this method
---
Obviously you didn't want it badly enough /s
---
So.. I don‚Äôt have a problem with micro transactions but I do have a problem with their pricing. Cosmetic items are way too expensive and even 1st in my opinion is over priced. I feels as though a private server should have already been part of the game. I don‚Äôt think you should have to pay to play alone when you already pay to play online(Xbox live) 
---
And I don‚Äôt think any membership, especially one offering as little as 1st does, should cost more than Xbox live itself. $60 for a YEAR as opposed to $100. Just for some extra stash and a tent. 
---
Now I do currently have 1st as I was trying it out, and I DO like it a lot. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the price. Especially when I feel like some things should be in the game at no extra cost anyway. 
---
They should just leave it to buying atoms and maybe some expansions to help keep servers running.
---
Shhhhhhh. Thou shalt not mention a bug or glitch. This game is perfect. Any opinion to the alternative is grounds for a banning by the great and powerful TOS, enforcer of the arbitrary agreement and mighty rules lawyer for the all seeing Todd.
---
Ok. i was worried to use my guns affected by it for awhile there. Thanks.
---
Then go play it.
---
What mods are you looking for? I will be on line in a few minutes. nmart
---
Aye. it may be 240 but i've always went to 260 or so. 
---
But i trust angryturtle. The amount of effort he puts into research suggests to me he knows what he's talking about.
---
Those are great for Heavy Energy users.  Vampire Gatling Plasma helped me survive Earle when I ran out of stims.
---
We should be able to get it done easily. Glass is everywhere. It‚Äôs why when you nuke someplace, it‚Äôs called ‚Äúturning it into glass.‚Äù
---
I use it on my handmade,AR isnt as popular unless you get a really nice legendary roll. The handmade has better handling and damage between the two if youre looking for a gun to feed 5.56.
---
That's actually more valuable chat than what actually happens with the PC chat mod. Conversation on chat mod is considerably more inane to the point that unless you're the 2-3 people chatting constantly, you want to mute it.
---
It‚Äôs a must have for pvp. If you don‚Äôt have it your dead. Ground dwellers don‚Äôt last long
---
One of the new legendary perks (Master Infiltrator) provides the same effect as having all three lock picking and hacker cards on at the same time without actually needing them to be equipped.
---
Think that's the closet we're ever going to get.
