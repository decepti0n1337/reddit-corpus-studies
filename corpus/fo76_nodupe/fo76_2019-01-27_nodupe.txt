Never thought to try this thanks for the tip

Get Good Doggy, Slow Metabolizer, and Can Do, and you'll be swimming in Dog Food that heals and fills up your hunger bar. I sure miss those Feed the Peoples too. They were nice for self and for others. Pretty sure they disappeared out of your inventory too if you logged out or something. Also grow some corn and gourds and make some corn soup and cranberry relish. That's nice for AP and XP. Also check out Sunshine Meadows, you can make packaged food at a factory there like Sugar Bombs etc. It's not like food is hard to come by. That event was just nice.

makes the experience all that more enjoyable personally.
---
It‚Äôs the wastland. You need people like us so it is realistic

Many moons ago someone mentioned servers have set drop lists for legendaries, on those servers certain legendary effects drop much more frequently.  Ive applied it to grinding and it adds up.
---
So even after finding a bloodied weapon I grind out bloodied weapons from the server and I still haven't found anything worth a damn. 
---
I dont want craftable legendaries, but god dammit I want to feel like I'm getting somewhere with all this effort.
---
Amazing trap ahead.
---
I literally thought of this the other day lol
---
I saw this coming into town from the mountains to the west, I thought the same thing and took a pretty good pic of it from above.
---
So anybody know what's next week?
---
NP!
---
Took ALL of my 308 ammo over 2k worth ): 
---
 OK The view from my CAMP:

---
It might have been planned at one point, but honestly, they rushed this thing out the door so fast a lot of us can't play for more than ten minutes at a time without crashing. And with the staggering amount of hate it's received online, I doubt Bethesda's going to bother expanding the game at all.
---
Im not sure on how much they‚Äôre worth but really any decent level 50 armour and weapons or caps. I have quite a few serums and have no real use for them. I can probably trade in about 10 hours time because i have to sleep üòÇ
---
Blackbird and camo skins
---
Damn I sure get that bug a lot then haha.
---
Welcome to the wasteland 
---
Nothing wrong with the idea, but we all know that 95% of the notes you find will be ‚Äúsuck my huge balls‚Äù or something equally as childish. 
---
Honestly, for a few seconds there I couldn't tell.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 hold PS button and press square for zoom. Game changer. 
---
I get what you are saying. I'm saying I don't agree. 
---
Where is your camp located? You may be in a high traffic area.
---
I want an alcohol distillery maybe a prohibition dlc or something
---
Is this in ps4? We may have been in the same lobby. Pretty badass shot though! 
---
they don't need new PvP servers, they just need all the servers to be what the new PvP servers are going to be, full damage all around, but make passive fully passive, you can't harm them and they can't harm you or your base.  do away with the stupid PvP "slaps" altogether...
---
Would it really be that difficult to add the ability to change the name of weapons and armor?
---
EDULCORATING 
---
No shit
---
Hopefully in DLC.
---
Playing a role is role playing. I dont like the assholes myself. But it is playing a role, a role that exists IRL. And technically, they may not actually be an asshole normally, they could actually be rolepalying one.
---
Servers to potato sorry bro
---
7.62x39mm isn't the same as 7.62x51mm NATO/.308. While who knows what Beth exactly based it on, the clip would suggest a 5.45x39 AK-74, so having it use 5.56 isn't far off.
---
For real? That's anticlimactic...
---
Yep. Just got a 2 Star legendary hunting rifle. Although not exactly the effects I was hoping for. It‚Äôs nocturnal plus limb damage. Also got a 1 star hunting rifle. I‚Äôm selling. Damage isn‚Äôt what I had in mind. Cheers
---
Are you going to plug your video on every single comment in this thread?
---
I want headwear with working headlamps and outfits with backpacks/ satchels.  
---
I needed a good laugh today. This hit the spot.
---
If its role playing isn‚Äôt it up to the player to match the lore ? Raiders even have their own power armour made of scrap 
---
[removed]
---
Server hop the top of Watoga High School it usually spawns a high-energy core. It took maybe ten minutes yesterday to grab 8. 
---
Not really, it's a King Kong reference. To be real though, if I was looking for birds and found giant ants that would be pretty climactic
---
Yes if u own a workshop and someone clicks to take it over they can fast travel to you anywhere on the map and kill u  me and my buddy have tested this
---
You can roleplay as raiders, griefing would mean you follow them around and keep killing them with TSE shit in one shot.
---
I didn't really understand why people here call any kind of player vs player interaction "griefing." Then I learned that there is some console trophy, "Good Grief", that is rewarded for killing 20 players. Killing other players in a pvp game IS NOT GRIEFING! 
---
They could literally give me my fucking batman suit in literally MINUTES!
---
I can't seem to figure if this is ironic or not.
---
The Gauss is up to you. There are armor piercing capacitors you can add along with a suppressor if you want. Build it however you want to play it. Avoid the grounded mutation.
---
Go run events in the Cranberry Bog. Most events will give you not only normal Heavy Combat Armor but also can give you one star legendaries. If events aren't your thing you can get normal Heavy Combat Armor from the corpse in the glassed cavern.
---
I hadn‚Äôt either for my first 130-odd levels but today it was impossible to find. 
---
Why are the X/Y axis on 2 seperate sensitivity on PC? Why does the game hog up all resources while alt tabbed. Why does alt tab break the game so you can't move your mouse outside of an invisible area? Why does alt tab sometimes take upwards 30 seconds to tab me out of the game and back in even when it's obvious the game never sets aside resources whatsoever? Why does the quantity selector slider on mouse never work, and only moves to the right, no matter where you click? How come the game runs and feels like shit on a modern high end gaming PC even with all settings on low and resolution downscaled? Sometimes I do a quick 180 and my character only turns 90 degrees just from the sheer amount of input being lost to all the choppiness in the game.
---
The game is _chock full_ of shit like this. It's like a gold mine of amateur game dev pitfalls. Let's not forget how the physics were fps-tied until people whined about it and some streamers were laughing at how they were moving at speedhack-speeds while looking at the ground.
---
That was a month back or so. It was fixed after quest progress reset for upgraded motors.
---
what is ur gt?
---
Bloodied explosive 10mm SMG? Or pistol? I'm not clear if "smh" was a typo of SMG or disappointment for getting the pistol...
---
The SMG is fun.
---
Finish brotherhood of steel questions.  Full set of ultracite armor is a reward.  To be honest I don't see it often.  It doesn't have a jetpack.  And it is REALLY costly to repair.  .t t60 has optimized on both hands jetpack and calibrated shocks and is easily the best I have for all around purposes.  Plus plastic steel and rubber are all it really needs to repair.  
---
If it happens again I‚Äôll make sure to remember to record it so I can post the video proof. It‚Äôs quite annoying when it happens but like I said has only happened a few times in 600+ hours of gameplay. 
---
And most of the atom shop suggestions are either really edgy (blood-and-gore-stained power armor, the head pikes as a camp item) or people wanting stuff from NV such as the NCR Ranger Armor (this is *in spite* of how it wouldn't make sense lore-wise). Neither of those things are ever gonna happen, people.
---
well, I mean, technically that is more "player vs camp." Did your camp do something to piss the guy off? Has your camp tried switching servers or getting a dense mod on its chest armor and equipped the Fireproof perk?
---
Awesome
---
Ok. If I don't get lucky tonight I will hit you back up. 
---
That‚Äôs just good game design. 
---
I am on PC! 
---
Rifle or shotgun probably 
---
I have around 3k Atoms and I honestly, couldn't care less about the stupid shit they sell in the Atom shop -it's garbage. Skins and paint jobs, outfits? Who gives a shit? I'm not saying some of it isn't cool looking, but it lends NOTHING to the game in terms of content. NOTHING! 
---
I've been running around in my mistress of mystery garb + PA and I have no reason to switch it up.I'd love for there to be actual, worthwhile, upgradeable gear in the Atom shop as opposed to a bunch of stupid paint jobs and dumb outfits. 
---
For the love of all that is holy Bethesda, give this a look.
---
No taking the junk is fair game. I killed you so I take what I want then I leave. 
---
The "Slap" damage system is a "crap" damage system, amiright?
---
 They go off all day long sometimes. ;)
---
i collect 'em.  my base in Sanctuary Hills looked like TOny Stark's house by the time the last DLC dropped. lol
---
Ok c'mon the Patriotic CA Paint is pretty good
---
And are we gonna pretend as if the Blackbird and Hotter Rod paints never existed?
---
The lunch box at Grafton train station is where I drop all my extra ammo and plans. Past couple times there was someone there grabbing literally as I was unloading and they were jumping around emoting like crazy. 
---
Pistol, smh not SMG. I think it might not be horrible for trash mobs, just that the bloodied isn't much help.
---
NO SOUP "FUN" FOR YOU!
---
The bobble head characters(are they hats) are the worst. I can understand wanting clean comfort in your wasteland home but not running around like a plushie at disneyworld is not.
---
Raiders have something to gain from killing, food and territory and shit. The asshole who comes up to me and one shots me with a tse does not gain any of that, he just wants to be an asshole
---
The player who is "invisible."
---
NO FUCKING WAY unless they start selling unique firearms &amp; armor in there, too. Fucking microtransactions hell. They said it wouldn't be pay to win, then they shit all over players who build as if Bethesda didn't produce that play mode themselves and carry it forward from FO4.
---
It's just super weird because some melee weapons have like 50 mods, and then some have essentially none. 
---
There has been a concerted campaign to hate on Bethesda ever since they bought the franchise.
---
You see people whining like "People used to be so nice and helped each other out but now all anyone does is wreck shit, kill you and take your stuff!" and it's like "Bitch, do you not read notes?" because this is literally how people went from friendly survivors to cutthroat raiders in the game.
---
No, we are the vault dwellers rebuilding America, this is our story. We can make whatever lore we want withing reasonable limits. If someone wants to be a raider and wear combat armor underneath a dress then that's their decision and they can do that
---
upvoted lol. I feel the same about these posts.
---
&gt;Todd says I can be anyone I want
---
&gt;I pay $60 to be a raider
---
&gt;Some dumb baby on Reddit paid $60 to be a victim
---
There's is NO PASSIVE mode, it's PACIFIST mode.
---
Meaning you will not do any damage to them whilst it is turned on. people can still attack you etc. Its more so you don't tag people by accident and get a bounty or nailed by a load of turrets etc.
---
This game is PVPVE not PVE.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
They do! 
---
I‚Äôd prefer they fix the connection, freezing, crashing, item duping, and general issues with the engine and online first honestly.
---
Seriously, they better force us to create new characters, as well as lower the exp rate as you level up. (that way, there ain't level 100+ kids running around in the first week)
---
Side note, monsters better do 2-3 times the damage, cause, I'm gonna be real, they're pathetic right now, especially late game.
---
And one final note, players need to do 25-50% less damage to each other so people don't get one shot while in power armor anymore. Because, that shit is hilarious from my side. (uses a 141 sniper with no armor)
---
Wow did add that, after about 10 years and a half dozen expansions.
---
Bethesda really needs to fix how doors fit into the brick set...  that's just terrible, and you even paid good atoms for it!
---
Boost content shouldn't exist either. Just because a different company did it doesn't mean it's a good idea. It leads the presumption that to be good or get anywhere you need to pay money. It's also in the same grouping in my opinion, that just because you can throw money at something to get it doesn't mean it's right. That's a rich kid (or rich adult) mentality. "Buy" shouldn't trump "Achieve".
---
Good shout. As my character aspires to be as drunk as possible while using Party and others to coincide with being as drunk as I can get irl. I've seen these copper shinies and wanted one of my own to not only provide a secure crafting situation for my character but also a.. wait where was I? I want to craft beverages as well too I think. Make it so. 
---
I never called you a baby. I was joining in the wambulance with you. they said it wasn't going to be a traditional Fallout game from the beginning. I don't know why you people think that it would be when they have said time and time again that it's not going to be
---
Also maybe lesson the spam of the energy blast. I know they are bats and that's how they see but sometimes it gets old having them sit in the same spot endlessly spamming their energy attack. 
---
Check out the Sniper Outfit hat. I use it for a cowboy look.
---
Like a pristine princess bed doesn't break lore...
---
ok :)
---
I also learned this the hard way at level 90 something.  I have stopped taking workshops for the plans/junk unless I am about to log off.  Basically I‚Äôll take a shop, defend, then drop.
---
Yes. Literally.
---
I find them all the time in Watoga, depending on starts and stats you can get for 300-800 per piece in the shops. I'm looking at 2 3\* pieces right now that are 295 each.
---
Man, they seriously dropped the ball with that armor. Stats are meh and debatable worse than other sets and they just hand it too you like it is a free sample of deodorant. Imagine if it was actually good and the only way to get it was from SBQ plans. People would have actually tried to get it and would have needed to interact with each other to collect the whole set. What were they thinking?!
---
How many points do you want to shift? Is it less than 20? Then respec. 
---
Good info! Last trophy I need is kill 20 players. May have to use this. 
---
Exactly that, adult thing. Not all adults have time to put aside to grind several characters to a playable lvl. And I'm not saying the boost should cost $100. 
---
And again, if you have enough atoms from grinding the game, the boost is free.
---
Bug: Enemies don't load in, but still kill you. 
---
This is the most frustrating thing that has ever happened in any videogame, ever. Invisible things just killing you over and over. It's like a lovecraftian nightmare. 
---
I have no idea what the issue is, but guys please, please figure it out and fix it. Getting murdered by nothing is not how I like to spend my free time. 
---
I know you're all working on this stuff, and thanks. I really like the game, but this kind of glitch actually stresses me out, and that's the opposite of what gaming is supposed to do for me. 
---
I meant the tap, not the drink. Just as annoying
---
Thanks. I will watch it
---
Hey man.
---
Nuka Trapper can be pretty addicting.
---
I totally understand where you're coming from.
---
No problem, honestly this advice is more of a psa for pve players who don't want to be attacked, but I guess you can do this to do a little hunting :)
---
Yes. And if you're unlucky like me and a lot of people we scrapped this chassis thinking it had nothing on it. Never got to see my full set.
---
I have claimed and held dozens of workshops and so far only once was PVP'd.  Had a lot of players come and help me defend.  I get the concern, but so far I am not seeing it.  I am currently knocking on wood.
---
I have quite a few. Message me tomorrow. Gt: chiseledhen860 
---
they better compensate.
---
yeah that really needs to be nerfed.
---
"people dislike things I like, and are wrong" shouts idiot on the internet?
---
It was never confirmed as anything as far as things went it happened once so ive personaly put it down to just a rumor  
---
That would be a side quest for real. You pick up a signal on your pipboy that starts a quest called We Get Signal. You make your way to another bomb disposal unit who sets you up the bomb and off you go to move zigs.
---
Yea I knew who it was meant for but I'm tired of waiting for bounties to appear. I really dont PVP just want to get this last trophy. 
---
You can also use supply drops as bait for people that dont know that supply drops are owned by the person that calls them down
---
I really don't understand their mindset behind the stuff they make for the Atom store. They could load it up with cool shit and make a mint but instead they pump shit like that out at a snails pace. I don't see why it's so hard to grasp that people playing a post apocalyptic wasteland survival game want some nitty and gritty.
---
If some guys in tuxedos show up and start wrecking your shop, they‚Äôre from the Whitesprings Nukavendor. You‚Äôre stepping in robotoes here bruv 
---
But the paint logo doesnt show in your stash.
---
Also good info!
---
I keep forgetting to get that. Then again, my budget is maxed, so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to place it anywhere. üôÅ
---
Camp Mccaron
---
Did they patch already? (I mean right now)
---
Heads up, if they're in a team, all of them will be marked for pvp. You'll know because they'll be red on your compass
---
I hope this post was a joke
---
Yeah I have 3 in concen already but refine it when I get up high enough to not worry about it unless I happen to pull one from a pack.
---
As JustforFallout76 says, CAMP location matters.  Somewhere there's a lot of passers-by is more likely to spell trouble.  Also, the primary defence for camp grief is the log-off button.  Your camp vanishes when you do, so if you don't like it, a server switch is your escape.  To me that shows some shortsighted design decisions.  They want us to spend real world money on ATOMS and a lot of that is so we can build nice camps - perhaps ensuring people don't lose interest because others want to be asses would be in Bethesda's commercial best interests?
---
Jesus weve gone full circle. Its non functioning for a reason. They were very clear since the beginning that the shop items would be purely cosmetic. Its not supposed to add actual content and it never will. 
---
I think people are shitting on it just because it's EA
---
But other than that, I'm pretty sure it's because we gamers are spoiled at this point from all the incredibly good games we had in 2018, so every game right now has a tough act to follow. It doesn't matter if a game is good, if the game isn't *just as* great as games like RDR2 and such, expect it to get heavily bashed for no real reason while saying  "this is what's wrong with the current gaming industry. Indie devs need to rise up!!!1!1!1!"
---
Good to know. Times like that I love being invisible 
---
Looks like its a in garbage truck, so I'm guessing its a refrence from american dad
---
Or they could just implement separate PvE and PvP servers like people have been screaming for from the get go.
---
Here ya go, I thought others might be interested so wrote a bit:

I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. This game is what I‚Äôve talked about since I was 14 in a party on 360 with my cousin playing through Fallout 3 &amp; it‚Äôs respective DLC‚Äôs. I can acknowledge it has issues but these are issues that can be fixed. Should they have been that way since launch? Yes &amp; I know this game was made to generate a lot of money &amp; as long as it‚Äôs cosmetic &amp; I can grind the the challenges to get atoms im fine with that! Love the game so far though, seeing people &amp; emoting it just so wholesome it makes up for any lack of human NPC‚Äôs in my personal opinion 
---
When you can still 1 shot kill someone with slap damage, yes, the system is completely broken.
---
As long as you don't own a workshop. If you do and someone attempts to hunt you, a red dot or triangle is above your head regardless.
---
Got marsupial?
---
I wish they would make a skin that looks like a two-handed sword :(
---
but they are fixing huge amounts of problems... they have had multiple patches with hundreds of fixes and improvements in each.
---
Alright sounds good 
---
Players:. "Please Bethesda, let us play the game and give you money."
---
Beth: "Here's Survival Trolled.  Enjoy spawn camping."
---
You can't one shot through slap damage.
---
Judging by the amount of people in the market forums with countless god roll items and multiple full sets of gear that seems impossible to attain (full sets of marine un yielding + sentinel + ap Regen) I'm pretty sure duping still exists. They are likely just duping a few items at a time to fall under the radar.
---
But if I start to claim and dont actually claim it I'll be fine. 
---
What are you talking about? This game should just know when you don‚Äôt want to be attacked! It should automatically kick people engaging in PVP, especially if you‚Äôre at a workshop. PVP at a workshop that I‚Äôm at should be a 4 week ban at least. I also think that if you drop your junk due to death, Bethesda should come to your house, personally apologise and return all your goodies, plus interest. I mean, these AAA titles‚Äô standards are crap. 
---
I imagine there will be pve only servers in the future.
---
nice save, and no shit it's not going to be a traditional Fallout experience, but they stripped away almost everything that makes a good Fallout experience.
---
u do know that the fatman or orbital strikes could do the same as a tse weapon to your house.
---
I will tell u what my friend told me the first time some1 lvled my base.
---
"Find his house and blow it up" 
---
if u cant take them out and claim the bounty, just leave your base leveled. So they get bored and leave. Hide somewhere for a few minutes until they leave. Then track him/them on the map. At one point they will move to their base.
---
Profit claimed on paybeck. Blow it up and leave server.
---
then have friend kill u and give u back ur caps.
---
&gt;vents will give you not only normal Heavy Combat Armor but also can give you one star legendaries. If events aren't your thing you can get n

Thank you for the advice  is there any other way to get the BOS arms does the watoga bot sell them?
---
I used to have my camp in a pretty good spot back when everybody was nuking Whitesprings constantly. I think this was the first one I saw. [https://imgur.com/gallery/WqIB29o](https://imgur.com/gallery/WqIB29o)
---
I have to start playing with photomode more. I was mostly just using it to get pictures to remind me where resources and stuff are.
---
Captain cosmos Power armor !!!  Even the outfits with the rad protection and jump ability would be the shit!!! I always thought the space armor was incredible and since you can earn the most powerful power armors thru the game(enclave, BOS) once you complete those  quests you should be able to buy it !!! No unfair advantage and its lore friendly!! Common Bethesda are you this fucking stupid you can‚Äôt figure out we don‚Äôt want 20 dollar paint jobs(more like a couple of bucks) and costumes!!! Get a fucking clue!!!
---
Yes. As long as you just hit claim, and bail, you'll be okay. You don't have to stay in the bubble, the person who owns it will always be active for pvp with you only.
---
Double check to make sure your PS4 and Bethesda accounts have been linked [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/36352/\~/how-do-i-link-my-playstation-network-account-to-my-bethesda.net-account](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/36352/~/how-do-i-link-my-playstation-network-account-to-my-bethesda.net-account)?
---
Im hoping that Bethesda changes there minds about allowing characters to jump back and forth from normal to survival mode. I feel it is a big mistake. New characters only or a 1 time transfer from one to the other. Id even be ok if they charged us atoms for character transfers.
---
Yes, BUT.  There's big balance issues with the way it's implemented at the moment.  Kudos to Bethesda for the idea, but negative kudos for the implementation.  Logging off shouldn't be the best camp defense mechanism.  Players shouldn't be incented to build simple, cheap camps just because there's no practical way to defend it against other players, who gain nothing from destroying a camp other than messing with someone else's game.  The risk/reward mechanism that should be the cornerstone of game theory is completely broken wrt camps.
---
yep
---
Yeah fuck Butch for playing me out of that sweet roll. 
---
I‚Äôd like to get that one from you. When do you plan on playing again?
---
This completes my spaceman look! Marsupial + bird bones + spacesuit and helmet :p
---
Nice! 
---
You sure as hell can.. 
---
Try tongue. But hole.
---
My camp has been there since the beginning, it doesn't get old!
---
They should
---
I like the combat shotgun with enforcer perk for when i am getting swarmed.
---
hunting or gauss rifle for sneaky headshots.
---
What's the point of the game then?
---
I know some merchants who would pay you for some of that gear. Not everyone has same luck 
---
As the only apparent source of revenue for Bethesda, I expect we'll see a LOT more in the Atom store.
---
Use photomode. Take a photo of it to remind you. It's been working for me to pin good loot spots and the few random 3 star spawn spots that are hidden around the map in unmarked locations.
---
Late to the comment party but eeeyyyyyy. 
---
You think that's a monster? I'm sitting on a 3* two shot explosive,  and I've gotta say.  I might not use my shotgun anymore.  This thing hits so stupidly hard.  Even without the fletchette mod, with just a scope,  I can snipe people who are barely in render range.  One shot and they go to the ground. But I threw the mod on because what's better than 2 harpoons flying at you?  18
---
Think about it Fortnite is pure garbage with overpriced garbage for sale !!! only kids are playing this trash most adults opted out a year ago. Bethesda don‚Äôt be Fortnite be Fallout!!!! Goddam it!!! 
---
Wasn't there some people who actually tried to do the "glitch" and couldn't get it to work no matter what they tried?
---
That's a sweet thought. It makes me think of also some movies like [Blast from the Past](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124298/).
---
That's actually a great idea!!!
---
February 22, so about 4 weeks away.
---
PRINCESSU KENNY
---
Yes they did.  The last patch notes included "Trades can no longer be completed without consent"
---
I agree with you 100%! 
---
I have been killed by it a couple of times now 
---
Someone destroyed everything in my camp while I was doing Bunker Buster, couldn‚Äôt repair all and I wasted ages fixing everything. This needs to be added.
---
Yea, PVE and PVP servers would sort it easily.
---
Bethesda wanted to go another way though ...
---
You're right, but flippantly, I'd rather they had a LESS dynamic system.  I'd like them to just lie down in front of me quietly so I could beat them to death, collect my measly token XP, a lung, and move on with game play I'm interested in!
---
I‚Äôve been wandering what it‚Äôs from too
---
Sorry, I was playing GTA online earlier today and mixed up the two model names. GTA online calls it passive mode

I used to have a bunch and I see a bunch but no real stash room or really a need for caps. I guess I could keep a set around if 3*

I know it‚Äôs late but I‚Äôll at least see if I can get some plants.  GT: BellmanComp.

---
As a bunker dweller myself, will you show me yours if I [show you mine?](https://imgur.com/gallery/18daXrG)
---
Yup and I think that was an interesting thing to do, and that they could have 'fixed' the current system rather than just breaking out PvP servers and leaving 'Adventure' mode broken, but at least they are showing that they're listening and willing to actively develop the game and try new things..
---
Nice!
---
You can, but Bethesda being Bethesda wont confirm if the way it's being done is a bug or working as intended.
---
Me too
---
Nope. I don‚Äôt have turrets or anything for that reason. It was just sitting there, and the dude and his buddy came up and starting shooting the crap out of it.

Thanks

I'd eat up a sunset sarsaparilla vending machine

I'll see if I can network you in. You part. Of any guilds or groups yet?

I just want Halloween decorations that are already in game!!!

Agreed!

People think they have, but theres always an underlying reason. The most common is people engaging pvp with you by "contesting" and not claiming your workshop. They then find you in the world and can kill you freely. 
---
There was a video I can dig up if you don't believe me, ut was tested with an explosive shotgun, combat rifle, and a couple others, with hundreds of bobbleheads stacked, they still did miniscule damage through the slap mechanic. 
---
It is always either pvp being initiated by the workshop exploit, or perhaps a bug in the game, but as it is intended, even with something like 387602777 damage on a shotgun, blasted at point blank, and before fireproof was changed, did minimal damage.
---
Don‚Äôt come into *my* tavern and tell me what my character would do or who my character is, you role playing nazi. I don‚Äôt have to justify shit. That‚Äôs what my character would tell you to your face once it was dead on the floor.
---
Seriously, can we just recognize some of this constant whining is pure bullshit? Playing this game AT ALL is a form of role playing. OP doesn‚Äôt get to decide how anyone plays their game or role-plays. The entire point of role playing is that you do stuff and make choices that your character would do.
---
I don‚Äôt want to be an asshole in real life, and I actually try pretty hard at that. But killing you in a PvP zone and taking your shit is something I think is fun, and my character really would do that.
---
If you play games to be the same person you are in real life that‚Äôs fine for you, but if I like to escape some of the mundane morality of every day life, put my shotgun up people‚Äôs asses and pull the trigger, I honesty think doing it online in a game is just fine.
---
So suck it if you don‚Äôt like how other people play. You do you.
---
Woah now &amp;mdash; Atoms can be earned at a reasonable rate in-game if you keep your eye on challenges. This isn't GTA V (yet) where the currency is inflated to the point where buying it is the only way to get nice things.

I‚Äôm on now playing with a friend. Should I join your world or you join mine? My gamertag is the same as my username

Sounds good! Im on now, names Lokiisenpai (i cant wait for the name change)

The pipboy game.

Wait... you erm... did you leave it in your room in the vault?
---
Did you happen to own a workshop when it happened?
---
The Dark Souls community is really nice though. Invaders even generally wait till you are done with pve so it can be a 1v1. There might be a few mean players, but after hundreds of hours in those games with lots of multiplayer in the various forms, I‚Äôve ran into a total of 2 mean players across the Dark Souls Trilogy + Bloodborne.

It's all good. I just server hop to my customers location to serve them better üòÉ If I am not needed them I am not online.
---
If there are not enough people for hunter/hunted, will the new mode have enough people to  be a hit?
---
Dumb question but is it AMS headquarters? I am looking and can't find the 3 fusion generators at all. 
---
I run dense, 3x fireproof and dodgy. I can tank my own TSE shotgun at point blank range if I have AP. My 6 endurance are 3 Adamantium skeleton and 3 fireproof. Post patch you won't need 3 fireproof. 
---
I haven't found that to be true on XB1, it is soo much worse now.  Not only are the load screens longer, it has me in the world most of the time. Even after I load in and can move nothing is lootable, enemies are invisible and vendors not loaded for 2-3 minutes. 
---
I like that it exists for people who want to express themselves in that fashion; but personally I'd like to see a lot more "wasteland" objects. I'd prefer my CAMP to look like something that would be found in the game world; most CAMPs just look too "artificial" and the silly items exacerbate that. (Again, not that I mind; I'm always happy to explore people's CAMPs.)
---
That's why I put poop-post in the title, It's a sarcastic request.
---
the difference: real space suit looks better
---
I got a workshop going. Do you mind joining me?
---
Occams razor says maybe there's no campaign. Perhaps there are other reasons? 
---
I‚Äôll join you in a second. Add me 
---
Nope. On PC though
---
recently i have never gotten anything above a one star for an event reward

Best dps and capacity goes to the handmade. Heavy guns are weak compared to a vats crit build with a rifle. handguns are low on the dps scale
---
This is a measuring contest that I can get behind. 
---
I'd be fine with paid content as long as they do free bug fixes.
---
Ill be on in about an hour or so :)
---
generic armor plans can come from most zones, the only really notable things are that you are unlikely to get marine armor plans in the forest, as that armor is level 35 and the forest rarely has anything above level 20, meanwhile the fact that areas like cranberry bog have a minimum of level 35 means you are most likely to get that type of thing there, as the mound won't "roll low" and spit out low level garbage, at least not sub 35 low. I think  it's 35 at least, I have heard that around and don't personally have a way to be sure. 
---
Either way the only things truly region based are power armors, other stuff is just more or less likely depending on the level range of the area.
---
Id love the ability to create notes on my own map about each locations usefulness. I take the next best approach and right it down in sticky notes. 
---
K.
---
you could have just stole some guys stuff who was transferring from characters lol.
---
that ain't no typo
---
Indirectly yes.
---
They made it so you can't trade until both have the window up.
---
Alot of ppl sold their items for 0 caps.
---
Yeah I figured it was either rifle or shotgun. Probably rifle due to range. And I've never seen a single person use true energy weapons. The game seems to be lacking balance. 
---
In his defense, that is a risk you take when you dont have a trusted go between.

Been using this site just to locate them and get thme over with. http://dulfy.net/2018/12/02/fallout-76-treasure-maps-guide/

I try to do dailies/weeklies as a dad with a full-time job while raising a teenager, and it's not at all charitable, especially when coupled with $7 lamps and $20 Red Rocket signs. And it's a major problem when they're selling unique building assets but not unique firearms &amp; armor after saying it wouldn't be pay to win.
---
Lmao that‚Äôs awesome!!! That‚Äôs what he gets!
---
Try as they might to deny it, but the fanbase suffers from a really bad case of [Only The Creator Does It Right] (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheCreatorDoesItRight&amp;ved=2ahUKEwii24223IzgAhXwY98KHRCCBREQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1YFcTIUm2CvbJrxx6dK3Uz) syndrome. 
---
Fallout 3, 4 and 76 get lots of flak for not living up to the original games despite being great games in their own right, with the memorable characters, *ridiculously* big environments ripe for exploration and so-so stories (not bad but not exactly great either. Just average)
---
NV, despite being made after Bethesda acquired the rights, is the only post-Interplay game not to get any flak whatsoever despite having several problems by itself. And that's because the game was made by Obsidian, which is made of former employees of Black Isle Studios aka the *original* devs of Fallout. 
---
If this isn't Only the Creator does it right syndrome, I don't know what it is
---
Well that‚Äôs good to know 
---
Nah Adventure mode is just what the game was before they added the snowflake slap damage before launch, they blinked and got worried about sales at the last minute. That's why its so badly implemented and thought out, it just doesn't work.
---
The "new" mode that's coming was announced this way, because they've got nothing else! They can't or wont fix the duping as it's a single player game with multiplayer tagged on. If you loose a quest item and can't progress further with the main quest due to it, Bethesda's GM's only suggestion is to Start over....seriously lol wtf?!?
---
The duped items are going to stay on the adventure servers shoe horning anyone that doesn't want to get 1 shotted into 1 or 2 builds. I would put caps on the new servers being announced soon enough that they will become new characters only, just the backlash there getting at the moment they can't risk making the wrong choice public knowledge again. 
---
People will only white knight for them for so long and Todd can't avoid his mess forever.

Eh. I just got the healing factor mutation. Best heal in the game

Most physical PC games now don't come with a disk, or if they do it's usually only a partial install, then a Steam code.

While I like the build, it's simply overkill. You don't need that much damage and I feel unyielding is bait.

Serendipity feels really weird. Imo dodgy is better especially with having an enormous AP pool.

I was honestly hoping for an unyielding sniper build.

This is a video of the workshop exploit that allows you to kill somebody anywhere on the map, even through pacifist. They are marked for pvp for you and teamates only.

Wow.  Great shots.  I still haven't been visited by Mothman or Flatwoods monster yet; over level 50.
---
Ownership, Right of First Sale, Right to Repair, etc are dead.
---
I can just as easily assume that you are not indicative of the typical player. You base your opinion on those you have spoken to as if they make up a sizable enough pool to make a definitive study. You wrote an entire post deriding people who enjoy the game and want them shuffled off to a basement somewhere. 
---
If I recall, a Dev had mentioned that they were looking into it and going to make it easier to work with. They might have hot-fixed that at some point since that post.
---
That kind of makes sense and that's what I was thinking and yet the Excavator armor is relatively easy to get (adds 100 extra carry weight)
---
Maybe they just weren't counting on people having the patience to gather the materials to craft the excavator? 
---
Hey, finders keepers üòä

South east of vault 76, look for the rooster on the map

I for one wish that the Atom Shop didn't exist in any capacity in a full-price AAA game, particularly one that was released significantly broken and still has a myriad extant issues, but that's none of my business
---
How did you get T60 jet pack plans?  Vendor, event or other?
---
I use perforating capacitors on a bloodied explosive gauss. My other mods are kinda ugh. But im trying to get a recon scope, and supressor

Bullshit. That's just a cop out
---
The NAR repair yard?
---
 Yeah I know. So few of us are have it turned on. I have talked to a few people and that was really good. Be so nice if that 168 level watching my level 45 guy in Combat Armor trolling a fissure and getting a level 68 beast. Beat her down while yelling at the watcher. She got away, went back in her fissure. ;)
---
Awesome will do!

Thanks I have been looking in the wrong places!!!! This is where they had the camera crew set up??

I want raider themed items.. I want make my camp look like an raider outpost.

I scrolled down here too. /wave

Every post about being bored should come with a mandatory statement of hours played in game.  Colours everything in the correct light.
---
I check the stars now more then i did before. I may have already had one but didnt check thoroughly. 
---
Xbox had a disc. That sucks tho.
---
I got a disc with my PS4 one, but then it wanted to download the whole thing. So kind of disc but no disc situation.
---
And it's really good at satisfying thirst!
---
Make the atom shop version require a normal gas mask to craft, making it a skin effectively. I don't mind the idea of custom atom shop armor and weapons under the precondition they are more or less just "skins" that require their basic variant to actually be found in the game world to make.
---
NV isn't great. It has some great parts. Don't get me wrong, but Fallout 4 is better. Especially with how the DLC blended into the core set so well. I am SO glad that I waited until after the release hype died down to dig in.  
---
Fallout 76 is basically an early access game, but I bought Fallout 4 on sale and played the shit out of it, so throwing another $50 at Bethesda to preorder 76 was a no brainer.
---
Yeah thats correct thats why i put it down to rumors as theres no other info other than "i traded someone and they took all my items" sort of say text. 
---
Musta been the guy from the bathroom at Sunnytop Station having lunch on the go.
---
Being able to be an asshole in the Fallout series is why I have always loved Fallout. Assholes shit on things, so to me, you‚Äôre an asshole for shitting on being an asshole. A fun-shaming meta asshole if you will.
---
Is you want to be a good guy, and only do good things? Fine.
---
I want to the Legion, Nike Megaton, put slave collars on people, sneak grenades into their pockets and build elaborate radiation traps at workshops that‚Äôll kill them. 
---
That‚Äôs what you don‚Äôt understand. People DO get something out of destroying a base. It‚Äôs FUN. We are playing a game for fun, remember? That‚Äôs why you‚Äôve got all that junk in the bag you dropped right?
---
You stick to your live and let live morality and I‚Äôll bring the mini nukes and we‚Äôll see who has the most fun, because I won‚Äôt let you or anyone fun-shame me into playing your way.

Because some people just want to watch the world burn, and there‚Äôs plenty of kindling left in West Virginia.

I did find a random game at the Dam, so there probably is a real game.

I accidentally sold my TS 10mm smg... I wanted to see how much abd hit the button. Tried to buy back but was gone. Still upset bout that one.

My pc hasn't had a disc drive in over 5 years.

That facial expression. 
---
Slightly raider style tip here. If you nuke watoga and run between the 2 vendor robots you'll often find tons of bags from dead players. 
---
Last week someone nuked it and I counted 17 different paper bags full of junk. 
---
you can make a build that can do a crap ton of damage with one shot, have to use perks, gear, chems, all that shit...
---
It's them damn dupers again. Now they are putting items into other people's inventory when they aren't looking. When will it stop?
---
I disagree I want pink unicorn camo on my fatman launcher
---
it's not a bug, you can use perks, gear, chems and mutations to one shot a lot of creatures
---
Phoenix vendor in Watoga.
---
Cool beans, I'll be on in a little bit, should be about half an hour I think
---
Turns out: you have a girlfriend.
---
Looks like he was just trying to transfer gear to another character
---
The good news is that you can get the pip boy game from the terminal I'm your room back in the vault!
---
The bad news is that... You can't get back in with this character.
---
Missile Launcher and Fatman are explosive heavy weapons just like Auto Grenade Launcher and get reduced.
---
Get you some brick walls and laminate floors. Looks so nice.
---
Some events only appear to trigger when more than one person is in the radius of the event trigger.
---
I figured out that Patrol Duty (the event at the prison that drops Handmade plans about 33% of the time) triggers for me only when I go there when another person is already at the location, or if I'm there and another person enters the area. Otherwise forget it, I've never seen it otherwise.
---
I'd bet there's others that are like this too.
---
That would be cool if there were different PA linings that could be added to help with rad resist and others. I also agree that there is a serious lack of paint options. Where is the love for Excavator / Raider?
---
I have noticed it spoils awful fast.  Hadn‚Äôt paid enough attention to notice it doesn‚Äôt become spoiled vegetables or whatever 
---
Yesterday I got baited by some level 60s with a bounty. I'm 405. I lost 1200 caps. Meh annoying. They're assholes, move on. 2 hours later I'm join up with a leader of a clan using the text chat mod on PC and I happily donate stuff I don't need and grab some cool magazines. Then I get to chat and help others most the rest of the day. 
---
Im nearing 760 hours and I love it. 
---
So sort of "No except yes"... whether it's by sheer damage, or through miscellaneous bugs, the outcome is the same - unintentional death through defective game implementation!  So I take your point but I think it's a distinction without difference.
---
find a better place to level up
---
I support this. Also, please bring back the Blackbird X01 paint job. Wouldn‚Äôt it be more beneficial to keep this stuff in the store all of the time?
---
I don't defend it at all. I'll never buy it because im worry about the potential low quality. Is it that too hard for you to read 2 sentences in a row ?
---
How do u know what server ur on for a certain drop list?
---
Poop post aside, there are mods that make certain materials glow.  doesnt work if theyre in a container.
---
it won't take a hundred years, let alone two, for humanity's baser urges to come out during an apocalypse
---
Not only a duper would have that gear, so fair game....
---
lol black cat encountered.  They are about as rare as cryptids 
---
That sounds more likely than what I said. Especially because I had that plan a few days ago and when i tried to learn it, I discovered Inalready had.
---
Is that map interactive at all?
---
But only a duper would have that gear, so fair game....
---
But in all seriousness, I think Grahm has a line where he refers to Chally as "he". I could be wrong though. 
---
Patrol Duty only triggers if more than one person is present inside the trigger radius (which is pretty big, about twice the size of most other events). At least, after experimenting with it for hours this is what I'm 99% sure of.
---
In the toxic valley you can find some warden Mr Handy's. Kill them and it leads to a quest inside the prison.
---
The easiest place to find the warden bots is if the event Manhunt is up. Finish that event and they usually arrive afterwards to arrest Mad Dog. Kill them and loot them to start the quest. 
---
Unique shotgun reward. 
---
Yes, but only if they're locked.  Not sure if it's a bug or oversight on bethesda's part, because everyone gets their own loot from containers anyway.  It's a great way to farm junk from people who don't know any better though.
---
6 of each TSE though? I doubt it was just transferring from one character to another.  But lmfao OP. I say keep it and distribute to trusted friends. 
---
Does anyone have a screen cap of it?
---
You have to go ashore usually and shoot a few lurks inside the shacks to get the next wave to spawn. Sometimes it spawns the queen over on the cliff next to the steel mill and she doesn't come over to you so you have to go visit her. What's more annoying than that is when it doesn't give you any loot for finishing it.
---
Your complaining about no unique weapons and armor after they said it wouldn‚Äôt be pay to win? That‚Äôs pretty much a form of pay to win, depending on how you look at it and the circumstances 
---
Cool, thanks!
---
Allegheny asylum has pretty much a bit of everything. Loot it dry. 
---
You've misunderstood: They've *rightfully* abstained from such practice while abusing builders with a breach of their promise.
---
I have a theory on why this is - Bethesda didn't extend the slap system to CAMP objects because of workshops.  Basically the game is treating your CAMP and workshop objects the same way.  They really need to separate CAMP objects from workshop objects, and apply the slap system.  Even then, people will still be able to destroy it, but it will take them much more effort and ammo, so they might not be as inclined.
---
I didn't dream of a Fallout were energy weapons were nearly unusable :(
---
Happens to me all the time
---
Now I know. I need to farm for more springs so I can craft more to break them down to get said mod.. Dam shame lol 
---
Damn it... I wanted to tell her :/
---
If your on Xbox can I have a shotgun for 1k caps
---
What are the traits of the 3* ultracite laser?
---
Is your base overlooking the valley just below the com tower west of Watoga?
---
Easy fix: Song changes only apply to your own CAMP, anyone who plays music there, plays the song you have active üëç
---
Who's to say that a raider cant kill for fun? There are psychotic people in the world that get a thrill off of murder and kill for fun. Is it that hard to imagine that some raiders can too?
---
Is that from a mutation or a disease? -50% accuracy is pretty gnarly.
---
Kill stuff till you see the pattern.
---
Whitespring WAS good for it.
---
[Yes I feel your pain](https://imgur.com/a/IJB8msk)
---
I believe deathclaws have a weak point on their bellies.
---
Its the twsited muscles muitation!
---
It will effect hip fire accuracy, shotgun spread, and weapon recoil from what I can tell from personally having it
---
Same bro, same.
---
But then that metal structure would have been vaporized....
---
Shhhh....
---
Nope, in order to have a rare item be a rare item, it needs to be rare. Calibrated Shocks are pretty useful too so pretty worthy of being rare.
---
I don't mind grinding for them, sorry you feel that it isn't "fair".
---
Sadly I haven't found a redrocket you can actually build on. They are all currently reserved for stash box access. Resources such as oil, concrete and lead holes are all over the map, you such build near 1.
---
The mutation, all mutations have a negative effect to them. Some are more harsh than others
---
Yeah, I just looked it up.
---
Atom shop is a joke save your money! And even your atoms you earn dont deserve to be wasted on that crap.
---
Ok but I don't use shotguns and tend to aim down the scope with my rifles.. still gonna take a hit?
---
What are you trying to say 
---
If you're a melee build, it won't really matter, you don't need that much gun accuracy. If you aren't melee, get rid of this quick.
---
It's not that bad at all with Class Freak and if you've got decent perception
---
I destroyed all of someone‚Äôs turrets the other day because they were set up at whitesprings.
---
After some back and forth gunplay we killed him and his teammate (yay for marsupial mutation and being able to get the high ground (it was over after that)).
---
Then I stripped down to nothing and let them kill me for the bounty.
---
Then they wouldn‚Äôt take my dropped junk so I dropped a lot of stims, health items, food and legendaries...they did the same back.
---
At an impasse I took my stuff, my junk and their stuff and logged off because I had to go.
---
So yeah, straight up griefing sucks but not all pvp is griefing and can be fun (my experience was) and with no hard feelings...everyone just classifies any pvp as griefing here so when someone makes a point like Op about real griefing it gets misinterpreted as whining.
---
I haven‚Äôt had anyone grief me but that‚Äôs no doubt due to my level now and I played while levelling up...and straight up luck.
---
I had someone hit me with warning shots at the gold club yesterday when they saw me In there after they fast travelled in and ghouls spawned...but I‚Äôd already been Inside looting.  I just snuck out and let them have the majority of kills and only killed those that attacked me straight out.  (I can sneak past anything in this game and it won‚Äôt see me unless I start shooting).
---
My build is 50% melee 50% ranged I have 13 pts in sterngth
---
Most likely not but it might have an effect at extended ranges with rifles and if you fire rapidly with any
---
Holy shit. You just spent a half hour writing an angry response to me saying people write angry responses to stuff.
---
nice!!!   sure is a fun weapon, I still use a lvl40 2* TSE one all the time.  Someday I hope to find a quad.
---
I think there is one in morgantown but a lot of ghouls spawn around there.
---
Its hard to sell all a dupers stuff since vendors hold 200 caps. That must have been a small amount of items, or many vendors. And probably no, you won't get banned since you don't have it anymore. 
---
Wow.
---
It‚Äôs called role playing. I guess I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised that you don‚Äôt get it.
---
please stop crying about it.
---
He wanted to build a house so wanted you to move your camp.
---
Rather than server hop his plan was to make you move yours so everything would auto repair and you‚Äôd only lose caps.
---
I don‚Äôt do this but I can see his logic.
---
Hmm, do I do the quest and risk losing all my ammo, some power armour or a legendary or do I not do the quest because it‚Äôs got a game breaking bug.
---
Time to feed the machine a right power armour leg!
---
Maybe between Xbox and PS4 but please leave PC out of it. After dealing with the actual five year olds that mess around in multiplayer games on Xbox for years I'm happy to be on PC  away from most of them.
---
Then you're just roleplaying a psychotic asshole, not a raider
---
I mean, its not like its a secret üòÇ
---
I remember when they added this in morrowind in a patch and it was great.
---
Then they took it out for oblivion...as well as most of the other things that made it enjoyable
---
It‚Äôs only drops from other players. The ones with the nuke key cards will not give you a bounty. 
---
Yes ‚ù§
---
It would help if they weren't so lazy with it. What I mean by that is I used some 'earned' atoms on the starlet sniper outfit and character's hair clips really badly straight through the collar. It looks awful.
---
 I'd understand to a degree if it was while in a motion animation, or if I'd had a non-stock hairstyle... but nope, just standing still. Unusable (it's a cosmetic, the only thing it's there for is visual). And they potentially want a (fairly hefty) chunk of money for that? Nah.
---
Interesting, thanks.  I'm going to implement dodgy and see how that goes, appreciate it.
---
I know that one, jus a bit to small to buld something in it. Thanks anyways :)
---
Love this idea!! I would definitely build one and use it to broadcast an advertisement for my shop! üëå Think it would turn into an absolute grief fest though, full of explicit content. We have local chat though so don't see how they couldn't just expand that facility. 
---
Speaking of shops. Gt: KMooreLod HMU of you need anything, wide selection of goods. 
---
It wasn‚Äôt a nuke card it was an event or whenever someone calls those air drops
---
That would work if u got all the kills to see every item that drops.  But it's always crowded.
---
This post + let us display our power suits already 
---
OMG, thought I was the only one with clipboard/DT OCD!
---
Since dupers still sitt on millions of items without getting banned i doubt it.
---
Because not everyone believes in pacifism.
---
If that‚Äôs yours moral doctrine that‚Äôs fine but don‚Äôt try and force your views on me by not letting me break your stuff.
---
Jerk
---
Most people that go to whitesprings hate the turret farmers.  Hop on your mic, team up with someone who's farming, and tell them they can clear your bounty.  Most people will watch and laugh while you go to town on the camp, some might even start breaking it themselves.
---
Never trust a clown though.
---
Put passive on an shoot at people, a lot of people panic and shoot back, giving you the option to then hit start pvp ;)

I had an interesting experience last week. Was hopping servers taking over the dirt track over and over, farming for plans and xp. I typically build a defensive barrier with a raised parapet angled out to avoid the resource right in front of the workshop. 
---
So in one hop I moved towards the workshop but didn‚Äôt get my usual quest to claim it. I entered the dirt track and found the parapet I had built maybe three hops before. It was unowned so I claimed the workshop. Didn‚Äôt get a bonus for it though.
---
It was interesting that the server somehow knew I had once owned that workshop. I understand that this could be exploited by teams. But at the least I should have gotten a quest to reclaim it.
---
What it if evolved to make emotes ? How fckd would we be?
---
I've made my own fun out of leveling different characters for different builds and focusing each on different weapons.
---
My main character is closing in on 150, is all decked out for sneaking and sniping things down. Every piece of gear has weapon weight reduction to allow me to wander around with at least three seperate rifles with different ammo types for varying situations. Two shot lever action for standard sniping from a distance.  Two shot handmade for medium/close range when faster fire rate is needed. TSE prime gauss for those pesky scorchbeasts + SBQ fights.
---
My second character is mid 70s, even more focused on stealth (shadowed/muffled mods on nearly every armor piece), with a heavy focus on one handed weapons. I run around with a stealth blade modded cultist dagger, which (with the ninja perk) nets a juicy 3.5x sneak attack modifier for my attacks. Not only can I kill most things in one hit with power attacks, I can sneak right up to them in broad daylight and remain hidden.
---
Third character is 54 (still a bit of a work in progress), and is by far my weirdest one. Decided to do a bit of a challenge with this build by restricting the weapon usage to pipe weapons only. It's been pretty competent damage wise, considering the major focus of the build (besides just using pipe weapons) has been a high luck, high agility VATS build.
---
Then my final character comes in at level 99, and has been quite a ride. Focused this character's build around using nothing but heavy weapons (primarily a two shot .50cal machine gun, an explosive gatling gun, and a two shot prime minigun), and running around in power armor. This character chews through basically everything in a couple of seconds, and seems to do a hefty amount of damage to the SBQ, (as long as she's sitting still on the ground where I can unload full clips into her that is.) I've even gone out of my way to make the build in such a way where I can swap over to a shotgunner loadout without having to move any special points.
---
TL;DR: I totally haven't been looking for an excuse to talk about my characters at all, nope, not at all. &gt;.&gt;
---
100% sure??? idk why this plan is so elusive if anyone on PC has a spare i have the BoS Paint i would happily trade for it :D 
---
As in the pip-boy game didn't load, my character couldn't do anything, and there was no way of doing anything besides leaving the game. I assume your character also was able to correctly get the three bloods for an Ounce of Prevention, bugs don't hit everybody equally, hence why they're not obvious issues that are easily fixed.
---
Bethesda are a big company, they don't need you crying for them, what they need is to do their customers and their games justice by properly testing them and not rushing them out of the gate so they can get their live service generating cash.
---
If you are talking about strictly you, by all means, I'm glad you've had a fairly playable experience and haven't hit game-breakers like I and many more people have. On the whole though, the player base skews more to my experience than yours. Imagine how much more active, interesting and profitable it'd be if nobody had to suffer through this shit. As I said, I enjoy the game fundamentally, but the quality level just isn't where it needs to be. 
---
I reckon, if Bethesda doesn't just sweep it under the rug, it'll be a fairly brilliant game in about 6 months, the only question is whether it'll still be profitable enough to support by then. And with a rushed release causing a lot of issues, they've unnecessarily hurt themselves there. I'd assume you wouldn't disagree with me, but apparently large corporations have developed quite the culture of fan defenders...
---
You're not wrong. I've just noticed that some players have gone around making their own quests for other players, and I think notes would be a cool way to improve roleplay functionality. 
---
If 95% of the notes I read are Deez Nutz, it will make someone's Lusty Ghoul Maid fanfic 1000x better when I finally find it. 
---
Hot  and miss for me most days. Playing late helps.
---
Otherwise ya need a different farm spot
---
I have it and swap between heavy Guns and melee build. It is not that bad with the Class Freak perk that reduces the penalty to 12%.
---
Mainly use different gatling Guns and 50 cal machine Guns. Never use vats for heavy. I think it is worth it for me.
---
Don't spend hours on workshops, even if they have a resource you need.  Claim the workshop for loot, put up some necessary stuff, do the defense for loot, go about your day and check back later.
---
I seem to get the best loot whenever Whitesprings is nuked. Love it!
---
+30 damage to mirelurks and bugs
---
50% limb Damage
---
1 agility
---
I thought the lore of 76 included the fact that no nuclear bombs landed in West Virginia?
---
Please be a comedy TV writer!
---
This is a pet peeve of mine and a definite sign that I am getting old...  I much prefer we when games offer realistic cosmetics/customisations that were designed to complement the setting your character is in. 
---
It seems now the trend is far too zany in all genres that Ive seen. From FIFA created players running round with orange afros and bright neon yellow gloves, to destiny and the weird dances/emotes and their evolution to Fortnite dances etc.  It just feels like it's pandering to a very low common denominator. 
---
But again - this is clearly me fantasising about game devs maybe appealing to a more mature (emotionally at least) audience. But if the kids like it, and they spend their money, I guess it's gonna have to be bright pink, moonwalking power armour sets. 
---
Lol. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs‚Äù. What are you not telling us?? üòÇ
---
On now, request accepted üëç
---
Its like you are thinking the same thing except the way you say it makes me think you don't really know what you are thinking.
---
Lol I would have sent the heart emote sarcastically and server hopped
---
And a necklace! We have the slave collar, but we need some bling 
---
We need to get that idea to the devs. 
---
Why can‚Äôt I solo a silo? And yes I was just pumped to get that nuke dropped and will take better precautions in the future 
---
TU! Quick question Xelliz, why/how did you get the Order of Mysteries logo after your name? 
---
[I love to DJ.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR5u9jb0PJE)
---
 Its up on the cliffs, here:
---
That's a cool idea.
---
Dude!
---
Great job, looks fantastic!
---
It's probably literally the same chickens from Skyrim. 
---
Yeah I'm new... Oh I guess you got me. 
---
A neon yellow vest for it would be 10/10 OSHA approved.
---
I think the instruments are done quite well. People can jump in and out of perfect accompaniment. I like the radio, but I don't need to hear those tunes much more.  
---
If you want to express your frustration with 76 please go somewhere else and don't disrupt or annoy the people who came to this post fora different purpose.
---
Hmm ok. So level 28 is gonna be a big downer? Man that sucks.
---
Tell Bethesda to hire me.  I should fit right in with current staff handling the Atomic Shop.
---
;)
---
Oh well your reply also adds nothing to the sub.....so there
---
It wasnt like this at the start of fallout 76.  Found that out yesterday 
---
Pacifist bro, if someone is able to initate pvp on you since you dont have pacifist that's on you. 
---
Yea tell me about 
---
We need a server list and Server numbers. Its  crap we cant choose a server so we can have our bases load in. Bethesda we are supporting you support US 
---
As a fan, I agree with you. I have always dreamed about a game type like this for a fallout game. I was a fan of them sense oblivion actually. Loved their way of telling a story and showing a story. 
---
I agree. A cryo build could be interesting, so could an ‚Äòalien/laser build, or an explosive build (not legendary prefix). So many different builds that are not viable because they‚Äôre rubbish.
---
It annoys me when idiots on here want to nerf TSE solely to provide more diversity with other weapons, ignoring the fact 90% of other guns are shit.
---
ok thanks! I think ill go for it
---
I think it‚Äôs a Skyrim reference there are books in game called the lusty argonian maid 
---
It has a living fish in it?
---
He wasn‚Äôt rude and has a point about lasers...he gets my upvote :)
---
I feel the cryo gun is in an ok spot. It's freeze effect is absolutely devastating against powerful foes like the queen, and the ammo isn't actually that bad to craft if you know what you are doing. It's just lead crystal and steel. The most prohibitive is the steel, the rest can be super easily farmed at one location. 
---
Yes, lucky hole mine, yes, I know, everyone always recommends it, I know, yes, I do, but it's true.
---
The place has about 100 lead ore, and 50 ish crystal, that you can multiply by 4 with excavator armor everyone should have. If you need more crystal there's a ton in tangara town.
---
Assuming you have 400 lead ore, and 300 crystal, which isn't hard with my advice, with 600 acid you can make 1000 lead and 200 crystal, before super duper, which makes 1500 cryo cells, without perks, and leaves 500 lead left over. Steel is the biggest limiting factor in the equation, requiring 1000 steel, which you can make from ore, requiring 400 ore and a further 200 acid. 
---
All in all, cryo cells aren't that bad to craft, considering the amount of power it gives you against bosses. Should you be using it as a mainline weapon, not really, But that doesn't feel like an undue restriction to me.
---
Yes ( I mean it‚Äôs the fake grass, I don‚Äôt know what other people call it, I‚Äôve always called it fake grass)
---
Ironically the TSE nerf will result in even fewer builds. Things aren't looking well.
---
Thanks! Now I can clean my desk of lots of notes about the different types and ingredients of foods. =D
---
I have this mutation and also do half melee, half rifles and as long as you have rank 3 of class freak it doesn‚Äôt really make much of a difference.. 
---
Yeah, looks like it.  Movement is probably a scripted deal but it makes things a little nicer.
---
You're angry! I suppose I shouldn't like you when You're angry?
---
There is often a behemoth at Pylon V 13 near Bog Town. 
---
Eh I get where you're coming from, but "winning" at CAMP building is kindof up to each individual player to define. The Atom store doesn't offer anything that adds any actual utility or convenience to the CAMPs; only cosmetic items.
---
I'm a compulsive CAMP designer myself and I can definitely relate to how you're feeling, but you could also "win" by designing an interesting CAMP with only the base items, too. Hell, half of them I don't want to use anyway because they're just too far outside of what I consider to be the quintessential aesthetic of Fallout (*i.e.* I'm on OP's side).
---
It will.
---
You'll put the crosshair on a head and simply miss.
---
I found that mutation to be different from the accuracy stat
---
Astro Turf sorry 
---
Were do you farm crystals? I still feel the batch is far too low.
---
Yeah, plants can be annoying. I do know that there's a farm in the northwest that has lots of corn, mutfruit, razorgrain, and tato. That's usually where I pop off to when I need to replace some plants at my base.
---
That's what I thought.
---
Yeah but why design it this way for some items and not others? That's rhetorical I really don't think they had a reason.
---
U Mean Your Not Feeling The Childrens Princess Castle Bed, Its Pink FFS  What Do You People Want.
---
You on pc?
---
Dump it in containers in train stations. =/
---
Nah XB :/
---
Drop it, sell it in mass amounts, burn it up by using it, or store it in a pack mule character's account
---
It's always cheaper material wise to just plant new crops instead of repairing what you already have
---
I haven't noticed much improvement with these past few patches. The game's crashing continually, for one thing. I suspect they are putting most of their resources into their other games - in particular up-and-coming releases. That wouldn't be surprising as they will be toast, with the public, if this happens again. 
---
That is where mine is as well but up near the water lol. 
---
Can anyone confirm this?? Yeah he definitely didn't fast travel away or anything. I didn't seek revenge either, just ignored.
---
I have only bought the air guitar stance for photo mode...but I couldn't resist because I'm a competitive air guitarist.
---
I would also like some more cool gear instead of just the wacky stuff.
---
Looks Sweet With The Mistress Of Mystery Tattered Dress, I'm Just waiting For A Black Bandanna And My Life Will Be Complete
---
Crouching for sure hides you from map?
---
Aren't raiders assholes? We're in a wasteland and we can do pretty much anything we want, of course I'll be the asshole.
---
Probably adding PvP along with the TSE nerf same patch.
---
I found one with the Quad legendary effect, which allows for 20 shots before reloading. I was pleased but it's literally the first one I've found in the game and I'm at level 96.
---
We got their name, ban them bugthesda!
---
They‚Äôve consistently updated the atomic shop every week though üôÑüôÑüôÑ
---
&gt; I don't mind grinding for them 
---
What a load of bullshit.  It's highly possible to find calibrated shocks on your first ever visit to the vendor. It's also possible to grind for thousands of hours and never see them once. 
---
You are promoting the lie that obtaining them is some kind of accomplishment when it clearly isn't.  It's just random chance.
---
A rare item is something you get from a rare accomplishment.  You don't get calibrated shocks for accomplishing anything.  You get them for showing up when they happen to spawn in the inventory. 
---
You Can Be A Princess On The Inside, It Doesnt Matter Whhat U Wear.
---
Happening to me now... I have plenty of rounds on me but my UI says 000 / 000 and won't load or do anything. Other guns are fine... Been using this gun for 6+ weeks with zero problems. 
---
Anybody have any dressing for this word salad?
---
I don't know if you can build in it, but there is one at the south end of abandoned bog town, I know there are spots not far you can build extractors around.
---
Handmade an Gauss are on top for me.
---
Radium rifle also stacks up pretty well in PVP with the extra radiation damage.
---
I enjoy using the Hunting rifle, but sadly it's pretty weak... Even with the. 50 cal attachment.
---
I stay away from rapid fire weapons, high cost of bullets. 
---
I‚Äôve tried selling it. People only want the 5.56 or whatever that thing needs. I might make a mule character. Just for bullets and plans
---
Yeah I agree you would just get a notification same as now with sons of dane, top of the world etc to say. For example, KMoreLods Player Radio Found. If you wanna go check it out you do. 
---
Probably the same reason they limit the cap pool to 200 per faction, to help limit how fast you sell stuff to make caps and to limit your carry capacity. it may seem small but having to stop by a tinker's bench to bulk some stuff together before you can sell it off and get more carry space adds up.
---
Can I suggest going through and cleaning up dialogue on the terminals. There are pages and pages of stuff which is quite boring to read and which doesn't take the story anywhere. Some of it's good, add's flavour and teaches us something we need to know but it could be a lot briefer. The writing generally isn't good enough to sustain the interest. Eg. Mick Flanagan's Terminal at the Rusty Pick. There's nothing there I need and there was way to much of it. 
---
I'll take the level 15 leg
---
Gamer tag is Slayden10 send me an invite whenever you‚Äôre ready 
---
i had it eat over 3k 5.56 ammo the last time i tried it
---
Same exact thing happened to me about 10 mins ago. 
---
Dude the game's been out for only 3 months, they've been working on balance patches and we don't need DLC updates frequent enough to feed you content mongrels every month.
---
one workaround is to buy a skin from the atom shop and apply it to the weapon. you won't be able to sell it and you'll get an extra click through before dropping it 
---
Two foods that I always use on any build are thistle soup for ap regen and tato stew for hp regen. They are both awesome and easy to make... Thistle seems rare at first but there's tons of it between the waterpark and the corporate housing up north.. 
---
Company tea is the best though... 10 ap regen is nice... But who has tons of honeycomb laying around, right? 
---
It's in each game since Morrowind
---
   
---
the content is over after the first 15 days 
---
You sir have talent. Good on ya.
---
would you have rather they time gated everything to create the illusion of content in between an actual update of more time gated content every 6 months?
---
No, just because you define something by a very weird and specific method does not mean that is the definition of something.
---
A rare item is an item that is rare. It has nothing to do with how you get it.
---
Sorry this drives you nuts but it's really no big deal.
---
Isnt that part of what a raider is?
---
Exactly.
---
 Mines on a pond. There are quite a few up there.
---
I dont recall the last game I bought from a store that even had a disc in it, even single player games usually just had a code to Origin or Steam. So this is not a "Blunder" on Bethesda's behalf, this is just a common occurrence now.
---
Joining you now. Wanna head to v76? 
---
The one thing that really bothers me is the amount of lock ups.  I don't think I really ever exit the game on my own, I usually give up after the game locks.  For the third time.
---
Please Bethesda, fix the XB1 lock ups.
---
that works for me
---
If you do everything in Fallout 76 in just 15 days then you should be a speedrunner.
---
crystal ore is found in two major locations I mentioned above, I've so much crystal it's practically falling out of my ears, I use it as currency with the merchants because I have so much of it. 
---
15 for a batch is alright, 27 with ammo smith means a reload a batch, which given it is possible to make a rather large amount seams fair to me. I made like 2000 cells the other day on a lark, and have to say it's rather effective for certain things. Breaking the weapon is more a pita than ammo at this point.
---
Yep it‚Äôs a wonderful view and rarely attacked except for a mothman and Flatwoods monster lol. 
---
Think it was last patch they changed it.  Moronic change if you ask me, need to be making things group friendly not purposely forcing them to be solo specific.  It was fine how it was, not like everyone was doing those air drops left and right to share the amazing loot
---
Four post bed- major let down- what is it for a DOLL
---
Sure
---
Agree with number 3. I drop them when I've learned them because they have weight. If the weight was removed we could just carry them and we'd be able to check if we have them.
---
I have bad news for you... you may get banned for having duper‚Äôs stuff. Because all the system (if Beth is keeping a log of item transfer/addition) can see is that you took his duped things. You may be mistaken for a duper‚Äôs mule. Best get rid of them quick. 
---
I was about to say you're wrong and there's about 5 mats that bulk to less weight but apparently that's changed since November when I wasn't looking.
---
I think you /u/casualRaider are playing the game right
---
Just sell it at a discount by the thousands
---
Oh shit I didn‚Äôt know that, I‚Äôve played Morrowind but never noticed it.
---
Can't join party because of stupid communication ban. But I'll be there in a sec 
---
a short history, exploration, launching several missiles, it's over I've been since the beta, and it's a waste of money 
---
Ok just join my team so I don‚Äôt lose caps fast traveling there please
---
It's free to go to vault 76
---
It really is moronic just like the assaultrons at the nuke silos with the eye charge beam
---
I see you're not much into the raider aspect of the role playing world.
---
You should play some of the other fallout and see what the Raiders did to "grief" in them.
---
As for the fog crawlers in the glassed cavern: It's the rare and mythical West Virginian cave shrimp
---
üòäüòäüòä
---
Oops learn something new everyday, I‚Äôll fast travel there now 
---
the tourists  at the ski resort were once rich respectable people who actually spawned the first raiders, why can't the vaultvdwellers at vault 76 also turn to raiding, ( you know What people are like, some are just scrum bags )
---
Personally I've never had A problem with griefrrs, I've played the shit out Of the game since day one, just lucky I guess
---
The only thing that damaged their reputation was from releasing the game in such a fucked up state and now dragging their asses to fix things. I like the game too but the pace of patches is just embarrassing.
---
Bingo, would only say its a larger campsite since there is a very tiny one nearer to where fast travel dropped me
---
I use .50. And 5mm if you have of that on pc :)
---
Wood, junk and oil.
---
 I actually moved down a bit from that position as I was getting bumped all the time and now I get Radrats and even Scorched sometimes. I guess its close enough to the Scorchbeast attack Watoga circle, to get them. She did strafe my place once as well. ;)
---
Poker/Blackjack table for your camp would be fun.
---
Grow a pair and tell them to f'off. 
---
Nobody said anything about PC.  It‚Äôs XB1.  So you can save your bullshit calling...
---
Looks like the babies had their way with your karma lol. These pussies need to go back to FO4 or Candy Crush.
---
Yea it‚Äôs a popular spot but I love it even though I may have to switch servers occasionally 
---
Bitch, you think that's all the content?
---
Probably
---
I had to buy it lol
---
yea haha for sure
---
Also happens at the lighthouse when doing the firefly even
---
You still there? I just Dc‚Äôd
---
I finally succeeded a few days ago (after forgetting about the quest for a month).  I made sure that the scorchbeast I was fighting was one that came out of the fissure (not one that was just randomly flying around), although it did NOT die particularly close to the fissure.
---
From what the Nukapedia article says, though, it sounds like it's supposed to work for any scorchbeast that you kill, or even one that you find lying around dead.
---
No I dcd 3 times. There is likely a duper on that server. Pick one and I'll join. 
---
Following the quest line in the beginning does help keep enemies reasonably leveled. When I first started FO 76 I was traveling all over the place and having the same problem. But when I started following the quest line more closely, at least until I was into the 20s, things were much more reasonable.
---
Even if you missed it, it was added to your inventory when you exited the vault. Not sure if that change happened by the time Beta launched, or the retail release however.
---
What‚Äôs so good about nuking white springs? (Level 60 here never launched or witnessed a nuke yet)
---
Loading in now
---
You have played the game how many hours and you are claiming it's a waste of money? You sound like one of those 1000 hour steam reviews talking about how bad the game is lol.
---
How about some gwent?
---
It requires a different mind set. If your AP runs out, fucking hide. Otherwise enjoy being effectively immune to damage.
---
Hahaha! With little reflective strips üòÑ
---
Scrapping them gives you the fruit + fertilizer needed to replant it. You don't really loose anything other than having to wait for it to regrow.
---
It'll never happen. It's a copyright trap. 
---
You'd have to have a centralised sanctioned list of music and then you pretty much have that now but without some non-DJ/non-voice actor filling in in-between. The worst of all worlds.
---
Yes, wouldn‚Äôt that be great!
---
Challenge yourself by using sub par weapons you scrounge from dead scorched on scorch beasts. It'll use up a bunch of ammo. 
---
&gt; gwent
---
No idea how to play but I've give it a go haha
---
I agree with this statement, the balance doesn't seem to be there for one of Fallout's signature weapon systems.   
---
If you get found out, maybe. You're still profiteering off duping.
---
It's the whether or not you get found out that's the real clincher.
---
any one else sence a zetan expansion. Flatwoods alien, ufo sightings and now this, we are not alone.
---
Dude, he shot the putty tat?!?! 
---
Lolz I can‚Äôt kill a scorch beast
---
Nah but forreal, the ppl that do this are losers
---
Yeah, I was thinking of popping a coffee in that scenario.  Have plenty from hunting dog food. 
---
Just dump it in paper bags or containers. .38 and 10mm I dump in and around Flatwoods (the Responders church with the protectron trader)/Overseer camp. The .308 and .45 (when I have excess) I dump around train stations in higher level areas. The only other ammo I use is the 2mm ECM for the Gauss Rifle.
---
To be honest making ammo is super easy at the Tinkerers Bench especially with the Ammosmith perk. So not many players need/want extra ammo. I just wish we could sell ammo to vendors but with the pathetic 200 caps limit on vendors would make an already shite situation for selling even crappier lol.
---
Aggghhh I had that last night finally and then my kid started flipping out about bedtime and I had to log out and when I logged back in I used rad away before I remember to put the starch perk on it. 
---
Get owned 
---
Holy fuck this game. 6th times the charm? 
---
Auto stim does, so it would make sense this does too.
---
To be fair, this seems to be standard for their other games.  I'm pretty sure the duping glitch in Fallout 3 still works...
---
Probs not üòÇyou good I‚Äôm just big chillin
---
It all goes downhill from here, trust me. /s
---
Just go to a workshop that has acid and the extractor will be an option. Hemlock Holes, Spruce Knob,  Federal Disposal Field HZ-21, and Abandoned Bog Town
---
Most of the legendaries were bad so idk if it was duping 
---
Umm have you ever played fallout before? The game has always been depressing. You live in a toxic wasteland where everything tries to kill you. Fo3 you could blow up a town full of survives if you wanted to. Fo4 your own child was plotting against you. I kinda like the new take. Just saying ;)
---
What about that reload glitch tho
---
They've said this is coming. 
---
There's a whole lot of loaded luggage out there in West Virginia....
---
Agreed.
---
Just solo it at lvl 94. Its easy.
---
Eh great. I claim workshops to get the free loot and the loot for the initial defend event and then I abandon them usually. Now I guess I have to abandon them by server hopping.
---
My head hurts
---
You're basically complaining about the lack of persistence in a game that has a lack of persistence as a foundational aspect to the game.
---
Workshops aren't that big of a deal to get. If it's that much of a pain, you have bigger problems to deal with first.
---
Bethesda is hilarious.  They can‚Äôt even release a cool raider armor skin, because it is ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE to get raider armor plans in game.  -37/10 job on that.
---
Seriously.  You have to roll alts and complete signal strength for a CHANCE to get plans for raider armor.  
---
I have a very nice camp by the overseers camp and bridge to help new players. Water purifiers on each corner, crafting house and a bunkhouse to rest. If I saw you shooting it up and acting like a raider I'd be both annoyed and have fun chasing you down
---
A guy comes running up to your camp with a wanted level and starts attacking your camp, so don't trust strangers? Right...
---
The typo about typos üòÜ
---
I could always try joining you if that‚Äôd be easier?
---
You don't mind grinding to get it. You'd mid very much grinding to never get it. 
---
MMO games  will always have haters on launch while a fan base slowly grows.  Even fortnite had haterz b/c it started as a pve then str8 copied pubg. 
---
 I wouldn‚Äôt waste time on focusing reviews released on launch beta or actually release.  
---
Be patient, wait for the ps5, and then get Anthem with a 10k hd tv when it should be in its prime,  pass its prime, or dead depending on how it goes.  
---
Only time will tell. 
---
In the meantime, I‚Äôm chillin with fallout 76, ssbu, and hearthstone.
---
But I have high hopes for Anthem in the log run, it looks promising but let‚Äôs see how EA fucks it up. 
---
 Yeah I still get bumped, I may move again soon. I've always loved the Harper's Ferry area and I don't need to be 7 caps from Watoga anymore. ;)
---
Sutton has one. Flatwoods too. Both have spawns around it though so even if you could build there, you're stuff is going to be trashed regularly.
---
giving up ?
---
Tse's are lame. Seriously they're crap compared to a furious automatic rifle with a crit build, dps can't compare.
---
I had a tse handmade and ditched it weeks ago, don't believe the hype.
---
A dozen turrets?
---
I'm excited for the jump force beta. Super psyched. 
---
Exactly. I haven't seen any stacked weapons except in Duper inventories.
---
Stop being reasonable and get angry
---
So what is stopping me from doing the same thing now with local voice chat?
---
Almost the exact same thing happened to me except a smaller scale. 
---
A lvl 60 something must have been thinking about how every girl in high school ignored him and felt he needed to level my completely unassuming and minimal (Only 2 crafting benches at the time) CAMP. 
---
Thig is I can only usually play for about an hour or 2 at a time as it is and that is a session ruining troll. 
---
I just thought it was at night in general. 
---
People think Anglers evolved from Angler fish but that really makes no sense if you think about it. I've been to Bar Harbor (the place Far Harbor is) and they don't have Angler Fish. I agree they most likely evolved from Frogs but I wouldn't be surprised if they came from an aquarium like the Megasloths.
---
It's kind of funny you gotta admit.
---
Losing valuable junk is a pain though, but you can always get it back. And you should always stash away your valuable junk when you get the chance.
---
14 minutes later the game crashes to desktop.... FU Todd Howard you suck.....
---
So I can‚Äôt scrap it to turn into ammo I do use?
---
We need a functional backpack that increases your carry weight. Like the one from the creation club. 
---
Looks good, but I‚Äôm broke rn. And I‚Äôm treating jump force like Anthem. Waiting till it‚Äôs fully developed &amp; I‚Äôll have money to play it at it‚Äôs maximum quality. 
---
I'm happy to do so if I can prevent my stuff getting looted. I'm fairly confident with my pvp skills but to die and lose whatever I'm carrying would suck the chungus. 
---
I'm level 51. I'm going to start exploring the mire as soon as Rose let me go. The bog only when some quest takes me there

JD Powah
---
It was introduced in the last patch. There's a vague reference to it in the patch notes.
---
No idea but vertibots count as eyebots for challenges as a related unrelated FYI.
---
Don't use the repair all function. Either by design or a bug, it uses substantially more mats than if you repair things individually.
---
Bethesda can't even track Challenges correctly, what makes you think they can accurately track a player's inventory?
---
But placing them down like a map marker which your team can see would be much better
---
We knew there was a princess bed since beta. What's your point, exactly?
---
Cool, I might not make it back on tonight, but I should be on tomorrow during the day, gt O918 (o is the letter)
---
Nothing but at least this way Bethesda has nothing to do with it so they're legally off the hook.
---
Do you happen to play on PS4? I‚Äôve been trying to figure out why sometimes I can carry 302 and others 402 with the same gear and no buffs. 
---
I of course use class freak rank 3 with it, leaving me with -12.5% accuracy and there is zero difference. I tried hitting very very small targets faaaaaar away and did not have problems hitting them. (This was with a handmade rifle) If you don‚Äôt use class freak, it could be a whole other story, don‚Äôt know. (Not online, can‚Äôt test it sorry..)
---
I cam understand factions in some of the other fallouts where you can only go down one road. In this game, you can do all roads, all missions, and there are no npcs to call you out on anything. Frankly the faction stuff in this game is window dressing. Doesn't do anything one way or the other as far as I have seen or know.
---
alright thanks
---
The amount of times I've done that at Poseidon...
---
Yea there is a cool spot down the tack from Harpers ferry I may eventually wanna move to. 
---
Part, not all. The whole point of this post is that you're not a raider if you just want to be an asshole. Not sure where you missed that
---
I understand completely. I enjoy beta testing a good bit, did it with doom and a few other games and it really left me with the right impression on whether or not to spend money on it than watching YouTube game play. I like the hands on. 
---
Brotherhood of Steel. 
---
I hate synths, cant remember if they hate robots or not but I do and because I like power.
---
Nice. 
---
Please look into [ASCAP](https://www.ascap.com/). The legal issues with doing something like this would be a nightmare. I would love it if I could broadcast on whatever server I'm on but the whole royalty thing would kill it. 
---
The game is in bare-minimum-effort mode. Atom store stuff was finished months ago and released on a schedule. The new "PVP mode" is just the regular game with the Slap Damage check box unchecked. If 76 is an experiment than it is an experiment to see how little work they can get away with.
---
I didnt launch mine until I was level 99
---
Just save it until you have a bunch, and then loot or craft a weapon that uses it. Usually, it's not a very good weapon (pipe), but you can use it to kill low-level or common mobs.
---
Just because common level 50 weapons aren't as good as a 3 start TSE doesn't mean you can't use them in the game.
---
Although, there are some weapon types that are just a pain to use (laser). Breaks far too quickly even with Gunsmith 5 and Weapon Artisan.
---
actually bethesda does have that elder scrolls card game........
---
never played it myself but if they wanted to start tieing online "services" \*hurk\* together it would be a good place to start.
---
I am plying on the Xbox One and am going through the "miner miracles" quest even with all the materials necessary and going to the power armor station that the quest highlights the game won't let me create the torso it says "You Lack The Materials Necessary" and I can't figure out a method to fix this I have tried going to different servers, getting rid of all your stuff and picking it back up, Resetting the game, and trying other stations. I am unable to find anybody else with this issue.
---
 No. Back towards the Station there are two cars, one on its side and the one you can get in has the corpse, crates, sometimes a submachine gun and .45 ammo and often some plans.
---
The atom icon does if it is using atom shop paint.
---
It's about roleplaying for me. I imagine my character as an ex-military covert Ops sniper, after the war has decided to be a Rogue operative, but still holds allegiance to the enclave.
---
 Yeah, its nice there. Up on the cliffs above the town there's some great places for us cliff dwellers. ;)
---
Any TSE rifles of any kind?
---
People should start placing their camps there and not building anything just to take the spot till all those people get sick of having to server hop to place their camp.
---
Atom Cats
---
Because power armor
---
Lever handmade gauss 
---
That just sounds like your fault then
---
Depends on your play style and time, ive played every day since BETA, and Im still not finished with the main story, so yeah I have to agree with the above, DLC not needed yet. As for Atom store, everything they are adding is already in the files, its just a periodic release schedule, so its nothing "new" it was already planned.
---
Theme parks for the nuka cola cups
---
The Enclave because they have a cool bunker, Missiles, and they created Scorchbeasts and that's badass
---
 Yes, I am.
---
Well said sir
---
You could, you know, do the event yourself and still get them.
---
I haven't played in a while - is this a new addition to the game?
---
This should be way higher
---
How do you know how many hours you have into the game? You play on console?
---
 As someone when gave 1700 hours to final fantasy 12, I just can't see the implementation of the gambit system being any more than a cluster fuck in Fallot 76. 
---
The gambit system worked so well in ffxii solely because it was a turn based battle system, you try to run that with a live battle system in a multiplayer environment and the servers will burn down.
---
Best case workable solution would be the perk loadouts attached to weapon swap, with your lock picking, hacking, carrying being on separate hotkey in a not battle scenario, but even that would require Bethesda to fit h the bullshit engine they made the game with and start again.
---
Wouldn't mind if they do this during the Survival beta but after that, no. 
---
Speak English please
---
I was in Texas the other week and I fell and landed on my knees in a puddle ..

---
Make sure all the materials are all either in your inventory or stash. Splitting between both is buggy
---
You were in your camp, but didn't stash your junk before this?
---
The invisible friend issue happens if you fast travel or enter an instance at the same time. Travel one at a time.

" **We know that there has been some frustration over how powerful these mods are, particularly when combined and used in player vs. player combat.**"  
---
That's quoted directly from the post bring up the changes to  TS/E in the link, I mean I can understand the pvp side of it as there hasn't been a single player capable of surviving a hit from my Assassins Explosive Dragon rifle to date (Not even those level 300+ goons)  
---
But if you remove the oompf of those mods it's going to make end game combat an absolute drag because nothing else out there comes close on the TTK radar as far as firearms go. But then again that's just my own observations  on this social experiment.
---
:) ;)
---
Fah Hahbah\*
---
I‚Äôve seen that too! I tried to check it out but it said I couldn‚Äôt go that way.
---
I did try that they are all in my inventory.
---
Since no one asked the most important question about this...I will.
---
Where is the bathroom?
---
Caravan?
---
Someone killing you in a video game doesn‚Äôt make them an asshole, if it upsets you so much then you‚Äôre just a crybaby
---
Any chance ya got any two handed Executioner's melee weapons with increased swing speed?
---
Ever heard of subjective versus objective statements? I really love this game, I have been enjoying it a ton. Now, instead of saying "the game is not fun", you could have said "I dont like this game".
---
damn, this topic should be marked NSFW, I didn't need to see you guys circlejerking
---
Interesting.  Anyone else?  Maybe it will be extra content when Bethesda gets around to it.
---
I can't wait for more interior options. 
---
As beautiful as the design and exterior is for this build, the inside still looks like a moldy basement because of those pics stained walls.
---
Could you take anything? If not I do not see why, people have phased into the presidential suite &amp; not been banned.
---
If someone starts attacking your base just server hop, don't get drawn into their PvP bullshit
---
Bah Hahbah
---
Just one handed with swing speed and power attack. Two hands just a grog and war drum single star though.
---
Yes but slap damage seems to scale no matter what.
---
You are in group and wait for leader start game
---
It‚Äôll be much easier than when you were in your 40s.  What platform you on?
---
Do you have the exact amount of one of the pieces? I know I cant craft shotgun ammo sometimes if I have the exact amount of plastic sometimes.
---
Got it once, tried logging off and it disn‚Äôt help, something to donwith waiting for a team member. Try to see if your in a team, press on social and them team, leave team. I think...
---
there is a pip boy game you find in the vault before leaving, I think in the overseer office but not 100%. 
---
Honestly the Order of Mysteries. This wasn't explicitly pointed out in the lore but I don't think people should have their hands held all of time like the Responders seemed to do. However I do think that people should be protected from the bad in this world when they can be
---
Its pretty sad that most of the ones out there that came from trades, might be dupes, and their owners don't even know it.
---
I agree. Build your house in the woods on a hill far away from me. Because if you build in the middle of the lake next to new gad because it's flat there's water and resource deposits im going to drop artillery on you. Not because I'm a dick. But because there's few good artillery targets and i know i can always find a camp in the dry lake bed and i didn't build artillery to NOT use it. If this makes you sad then realise that i now have a fat bounty. Which gets taken out of my caps. So in essence i paid someone else to kill me as recompense for blowing up your precious camp. 
---
stash was full. 
---
Imma bet the art department has a stack of amazing things which the bean counters are overriding because Fortnite is selling Carlton dances and making millions...
---
...which leads to the fundamental error in 76, which is a management team fundamentally misunderstanding what the players want.
---
They want balanced PVP?  MANAGEMENT: just repackage the current broken system with the troll safeguards off.
---
They want cool atom stuff?  MANAGEMENT:  Fortnite is selling llamas.  Llama sell well.  Stop wasting time on faction uniforms and flags.
---
I know thats what I usually do
---
Same, I bought a couple of the floor tiles to spruce up my camp, but other than that there hasn‚Äôt been anything I‚Äôve wanted. 
---
Spawn glitch?
---
Not in my stash
---
If they make us start again they risk loosing the players that actually play the game often, the ones crying for a fresh start must have bad gear cos they hardly play. Or they would want to carry on also 
---
Yep, sucks they weigh .25lbs. I drop or give them away as well.
---
I have not tried that but I will.
---
You can build in Wilson Brothers‚Äô garage. Might be the closest to RR.
---
Kind of thinking the new farm spot might be a different game.  I just want to be able to have fun playing a game just like everyone else.  The rng for this game is terrible at best.
---
Thanks.  Why didn't I think of that?  I just restarted the game 3 times and my console...
---
There is a black bandanna it has a skull and white squiggles 
---
I don‚Äôt think anything short of a No Man‚Äôs Sky NEXT style mega patch would make it anything more than an average online game.
---
North from the vault, east of the tyler county fairgrounds. It also had the witches hat when I found it
---
I was in the Mire the other day and something really odd happened. There was a lvl 61 glowing hermit crap on the road still hidden in her shell/bus. When i shot at her she turned into a lvl 61, 3 star legendary glowing hermit crap! I was so excited and killed her, expecting some fine legendary loot. And guess what i got? NOTHING!!! Where the f\*ck did my legendary loot go??? -.- 
---
Hey if you are on Xbox , I can make handmades :) my USR: is TheCoffeeMage see you around!
---
The density of ghouls to nuke then farm, and a lot of plant life to convert to flux.
---
Hahahahaha!!! So serious.
---
Let me know if it worked
---
Maybe.  Would you be willing to take a stroll down by the river just past the Mothman Museum and see if you experience it too?
---
Yeah, I learned this the hard way after over 100+ hours. I was one shotted out of nowhere by a player. He was kind enough to explain to me what happened, and even gave my junk back. You can do this trick with a friend or solo, but works much much better if you have a friend. With a friend, there is zero chance you can lose the fight due to no slap mechanics in workshop pvp, and the element of surprise
---
i feel in my heart that they're going to be limited, which sucks because i have a lucky pistol character they'd be PERFECT for. i need to save up some atoms.
---
I have seen it as well. For whatever reason that's where all the cargobots go when there waiting for a quest to summon them or a random supply drop
---
I now need pink castle walls to go with it
---
yeah I am building there now but scorged keeps spawing inside of it and destroying everything. if they spawned outside that would be fine but nope :(
---
I know what I‚Äôm doing! I bought the gauss rifle plan it wasn‚Äôt cheap I‚Äôve upgrade science 1 
---
Yup, six aiming at the second floor and six at the bottom floor. Didn‚Äôt get a shot in on a single ghoul.
---
Pacifist. Not passive. 
---
Like this idea!
---
Very frustrating
---
Things that come to mind:
---
* Maybe you didn't have Passive Mode on, but you thought you did?
---
* Maybe Bethesda never bothered to check when you've targeted through VATS.
---
* Maybe Bethesda never bothered to apply these rules to the relatively obscure Drill weapon.
---
parts of Fallout games can def be depressing, but that's all this game is...
---
Yeah. It might be why I leave. Cool place though. I usually place a turret out back that shoots through the door and kills them... but the rotting meat piles ruin the aesthetic. 
---
I'll sell you a drill for 200.
---
No need to paste in medium .ini  now just make sure it‚Äôs in your custom and prefs. Putting it in medium.ini ensures the game doesn‚Äôt change it if you happen to change video settings. Settings in OP are working very well for me gtx970 i7 920 8gb ram 80fps++
---
Nah, still haven't found the excavator calibrated Shocks after much hunting but I either will, of will find someone selling them.
---
No biggie.
---
I have read a million times here on this sub that people who have a wanted tag by accident run to next player to lose it. a bounty of 100 isnt much so I wasnt thinking he.is going to destroy me all by his own  but ofc it was my own mistake. met too many nice people lately so I might have become soft. 
---
Darn, thanks anyway 
---
Yeah it's really odd. I honestly doubt this is what Bethesda intended, as you can essentially "assassinate" players anywhere in map. Just look at owned workshops on map, then look for that player. Have your buddy sneak into the workshop, then you literally walk up to the workshop owner. Regardless of location of workshop or workshop owner, the moment your buddy contests the workshop you can do full damage
---
Doesn't matter what you think.  Here's [Zenimax's TOS](https://bethesda.net/en/document/terms-of-service) who is the parent company of Bethesda.  Number 8: Rules of Conduct, bullet point 8.   "You agree to not use any Service to:  Promote, upload, transmit, encourage or take part in any activity  involving hacking, cracking, phishing, taking advantage of exploits or  cheats and/or distribution of counterfeit software and/or Virtual  Currency or virtual items. In an effort to continuously improve the  Services, You and other players discovering exploits, cheats, cracks or  other inconsistencies are required to report them to ZeniMax"
---
Distribution of Virtual Currency or virtual items. 
---
So if Bethesda finds the account names of players selling virtual items on ebay they have to right to ban their accounts.  Cry all you want.
---
there's a few other places too, freak show for one
---
I always thought fog crawlers were mutated preying mantis
---
It kinda was but I wish I had stored at least all my ultracite before this. 
---
if you aren't interested in pvping on a level playing field, then you aren't interested in pvp.
---
I did this too I never got banned 
---
This could've been caused by debris when the Space Station crashed, a hillbilly with a Fat Man, or maybe Modus tried to hit Defiance with a missile but missed.
---
Their turrets set up in the line of fire outside the clubhouse windows often get hit or splashed by explosive damage and give people accidental wanted status. Especially if you use Gun Fu and they get auto targeted with a full auto gun.
---
Ah. Its kinda dumb in my opinon 
---
Let's shut down Bethesda studios until we agree on building üëè some üëè walls 
---
Depends how bad my weapons get. I went adrenal reaction so I might be ok enough. Going towards bloodied now.
---
To be fair i dont want to listen to your taste in music through a crappy mic 
---
Yeah, as I thought. You had nothing to backup your statement. Folded, just like Trump.
---
The damage output will still be effective..make sure u max out the specific perks 
---
It has already been started.  I'm not trying to re-start.  It's the same game, same map, same missions, the main difference is no restrictions, which I never wanted in the first place.  The only cowards here are the ones crying about using new characters.  What are you so afraid of?  If you feel that your gear isn't tight, tighten it up.  I have put hundreds of hrs. and over 15,000 caps into my build.  I'm not worried about anything but not being able to play with it.  Trust me, it's a total botch move to cry about it
---
Do you have herbavor?
---
I'm going to have to try this because I'm built in a valley and my artillery range is crap.
---
"Someone ***choose one*** ( ~~Broke~~/Stole/Attacked/Killed ) my ***choose one*** ( Contraption/Loot/Dog/Me/~~Home~~/Work ) and I am angery because I ***choose one*** ( ~~couldn't~~/didn't have the ability to/wasn't online ) and my ***choose one*** (Contraption/Loot/Dog/Me/~~Home~~/Work ) got schwacked!"
---
I'm starting to think this is kinda like a normal selection wheel people have when it comes to bitching in online ***SURVIVAL*** games. It's the same fucking story on Worlds Adrift, you just cycle out some of the words, and in **THAT** game you don't have the luxury of being able to have your entire 1-8 hours of work being teleported out instantly. Your shit is going to get busted inside of a survival game, and your shit is ***100%*** going to get busted on a ***POST APOCALYPTIC SURVIVAL GAME*** if you don't have the ability to accept your hard work is going to schwacked, don't play these kinds of games. 
---
I roleplay as an asshole. Git gud
---
You have a month or more to prepare. 
---
Workshops are not for building bases they are for earning resources. 
---
Build collectors and generators and maybe sime defence.  Nothing else 
---
lol yeah. Also, right after posting this I found someone made the same post a few hours prior. But eh, how often do we really check these things, honestly? But yeah, glad to see more people thinking this would be a good idea.
---
I have 30% damage boost with three rifleman cards, and maxed demo expert. Are those the ones you‚Äôre referring to?
---
Definitely not the Fallout game I‚Äôve always dreamed of, but good enough to hold me over until FO5 comes out. 
---
Thanks! I encountered them most often while scouting for new camp locations away from marked locations, mainly in the savage divide or the mire. 
---
No the only thing in their were the power armor which was just cosmetic 
---
...maybe limit them by quantity. 
---
Say - you can't place more than 20 of the same Atom Shop object? That way we don't run into this issue. Obviously, floors would have to be exempt from that. 
---
No that's the black sun hat (not sure of name but I Roll around looking like an undertaker with it and my surgical mask. The black cowboy hat is further south. It's not easy to find and easily 'under' looked from two feet away. WTS WTT loc of real black cowboy hat. Want serum recipe, anything other than talons. Serious inquiries DM me.
---
Yep.
---
yes..depending on which gun your TSE..even without maxing the gun is still super strong just won't be one shotting most enemies anymore

Borderlands 1/2/Pre sequel - Psychos - Someone who is completely and utterly insane and may or may not be enhanced by radiation or drugs, furthermore they charge you with a buzzaxe which is a badass mixture of a chainsaw and an axe

But, I would probably buy

Well, considering the hat I got was named ‚Äúblack cowboy hat‚Äù I‚Äôm gonna have to disagree with you lol

Giving the kid opportunities to leave is nice.  Putting the kid out of his misery is nicer.

IT WAS THE ONLY GOOD ONE
---
mine is lone wonderer.... well because there are no factions left to align with truly except ... the enclave.
---
PS4? I'll buy 10mm
---
Because then they get bounties. And the people who check the map constantly for bounties to collect will swoop in quickly for the kill. You spend like 40 wood and steel and some gears and oil and voila.  Back to the camp you know and love. And they essentially pay someone to kill them for the joy of demoing a camp.  That's the game dude. Get yourself a fat man and return the favor to some unsuspecting stranger some day and check out the other side of the equation and you'll see it's all in good fun. It's not "griefing". Its playing the game. 
---
this patch notes are so generic they could be made up.

"Several improvements have been made to in-game performance"

Tarberry juice only says it gives 120 AP and I was under the assumption it lasted less than a minute probably 30s which would put  it at ~6/s but maybe my sense of time was off (whenever I tried to look there was nothing I could find online listing more than its vague in game info that is also inonsistent with all other labeling /sec regen consumables and didn't bother to precisely time it while the in game timer never says anything more precise than "&lt;1m") and you are right.
---
Ya know, that could be a cool addition or alternate use for said freezers. You can either use the space for maintaining perishable items, or put certain items in it to add effects to them. Ice cold Nuka Quantum : also adds freezing effect to melee attacks.
---
no shit it seems like there's plenty to do at level 1 you drone.
---
Im leaning to bloodied both for more damage and the better accuracy.
---
Damn, I would have reported them for cheating.
---
I mean, doesn't the X-01 Power Armour technically break the lore (since Advance Power Armour has yet to be made)?
---
Retconning and all that shit ain't really an issue in BGS's eyes.
---
Would be awesome if they could swoop in, pick you up and throw you. 
---
We‚Äôre talking about total percentages. Your math doesn‚Äôt work for my example at all. 
---
Not sure NMS deserves to be thrown under the bus here. They've put out more free expansions to the game, consistently, than any other game in this era.
---
I bought succulents and string lights ‚ú®
---
The pink bed is pretty rough looking. It‚Äôs kinda dirty and banged up. 
---
Oh, I was actually kinda serious. I legit want to build thunder dome out of princess beds and potted plants and that stuff - it could be a blast. 
---
True, I don‚Äôt know how Beth is handling it. Perhaps they don‚Äôt keep a log at first (they really should for an online game). And their database can‚Äôt handle direct queries.  That‚Äôs why they say they can‚Äôt see player‚Äôs inventory or restore items. 
---
But from what I‚Äôve read, they now have a way of knowing if a player suddenly have 10k super stimpaks, 100k ballistic fibers or other ridiculously huge numbers of rare items. To me, it read they now keep a log of players‚Äô item addition and removal or at least monitor it. Still not a direct peek into players‚Äô inventory, but they now know about the ‚Äúchange‚Äù. Of course, this is my speculation still. 
---
Now this situation at hand, let‚Äôs look at it from Beth/police point of view. A weapon dealer dropped off his cache at a certain location. OP happened upon the stuff, checked it, found two dozen guns, and took them. The weapon buyer came along, and they fought. OP escaped. Then the police/Beth found OP and checked his cache. Now, how do OP prove himself innocent of the weapon deal?
---
This is exactly how I roll when not using power armor.
---
Surely you can see the difference in urgency in fixing a duping glitch in a single player game and a multiplayer game.
---
So far! We can change it!   Less clown armor, and more wearing a deathclaws face!
---
Don't you just add boiled water?
---
Bloodied has more accuracy or what are you referring to? I don't get that accuracy part.
---
I just want goddamn barn plans. I've been looking everywhere for them, done hundreds of defend the settlement, and searched every vendor and Harper's ferry 1000x. No barn plans. I have brick and metal, but no barn. Ffs I just want to use it for my interior walls for my brick house. 
---
I'm desperate at this point 
---
I think you get in one of the early quests.

There's a slight delay on spawn I think but not long enough. Just fast travel out asap. I've spawned in on a nuke zone a few times now and I can usually catch it before I get more than  1/4 health bar of rads.
---
Here are things that should‚Äôve been included. 
---
Curved walls and ceilings, and a fireplace the one from the atom shop is fine but why not a actual fireplace, you know nuclear winters and all also it can double as a cooking station.
---
Actual windows. Wants to point in having glass if it is all broken still. It can be stained glass to show the different glass that was used to make the window. 
---
Actual bags. I use the Scribe outfit mainly it has a backpack and side pouches and it feels more authentic running around collecting items and stowing items. 
---
Pepperoni Rolls recipe. Which saddens me that this isn‚Äôt in the game. 
---
Functioning Nuka cola machine. We can stock it ourselves to sell to players.
---
Functioning Refrigerator that we can stow various meats and veggies that slows the decay rate down by 95%
---
A clean bathtub. 
---
Xbox
---
Then your fine. 
---
You're trying to justify griefing by saying they're braindead psychos? I guess we agree
---
What's the name? Not about to scroll through 1,120 different ones :P
---
I don't think you need to learn it I thought I could just do it off the bat. I may be mistaken
---
yup had this hapen yo me too today. Now when I am sprinting and the fame starts to lag I just stop and stand still as I qm afraid the game will crash. just really hard to enjoy the game because of this
---
"Inane silly shit" IS what is part of Fallout though.  It isn't non-fallout-esque.  Over the top humor, satire, ridiculous gags and items, has always been part of fallout.  
---
I‚Äôve been preparing since a week or so after release, as soon as you hit level 50+ and have killed the queen a few times pvp is the only thing too look forward too, pve isn‚Äôt near challenging enough imo
---
Did you really make a throwaway to comment on politics and fallout 76? Such a coward.
---
My flair should speak for me
---
lot of flags in your situation.
---
\-wanted players can't see in the map, so it's unlikely for him to find you at your camp unless it's in a popular spot.
---
\-shoots at your camp to get your attention instead of only emoting. (even more suspicious if never sheathed his weapon)
---
\-a bounty of 10\~30 is an accidental bounty , not 100.
---
I'm a 100% Pacifist mode player, PvE is more fun.
---
You are able to target other players in V.A.T.S. even when it's ON, others on the other hand can still wreck your shite, they can even harm you with their slap damage, although it's significantly decreased. If he had an OP weapon (like a TSE) he could still do enough damage to cripple you.
---
Maybe that is the reason. You said you survived the encounter so you definitely had Pacifist Mode on, otherwise you'd be as dead as Net Neutrality.
---
All of my reddit accounts are always throwaways. It just depends on how long before I feel like I need to run [shreddit.py](https://shreddit.py) and move on
---
Sorry, PC
---
I love the silly shit because I have a fat character who's my enclave agent but he's very absurd. He currently wears the sack hose mask and a clown outfit, he's huge, and he carries a chainsaw. But the nicest enclave agent you'll ever see. The absurdity fits his personality. 
---
Then I have a raider who looks like Abe Lincoln and his name is Eba. And a pacifist named Jesus but he claims lasers fit his pacifism, and a skinny tiny woman who's my heavy weapons/demo expert. 
---
I've envisioned the nuclear apocalypse as messing with everyone's minds, I love my absurd items
---
I mean... if someone has a Wanted level - especially with a triple-digit bounty - I inherently don't trust them.  You don't get to 100 by accident.  You get there because you've crossed a lot of players.  The bait-and-switch routine is fairly typical of this behavior, and they are *never* interested in a fair fight, so don't even bother.
---
I'm sorry you had to discover this the hard way.
---
Thank you for the correction!
---
Sorry that you felt you needed to explain yourself to me. Have a good life.
---
Your character isn't saved until you exit the vault, which nets you level 2. Even if you kept the game running 24/7 not idling, you would have to create a new character each time the server crashes or goes down for maintenance. You don't get to stay in the vault. I found out the hard way.
---
I agree IF you added more players to the map. But the map is too large and random encounters are too rare.
---
That‚Äôs so odd.  I thought they just ‚Äúappeared‚Äù out of digital thin air.  But why someplace so visible?  Makes you wonder.
---
Griefers in general? The ones who abuse duping and game breaking mechanics in order to go about doing what a raider would do? I don't agree with their methods because it gives them an unfair advantage, but seeing how Bethesda has yet to fix the problems I've stopped caring
---
Raiders? Tend to be the people who want to play aggressively and hunt down other players using whatever they worked with in order to hunt and kill other players
---
My comment was to show that their are instances of raiders within other forms of media who kill almost entirely for the joy of it all
---
Here's a little video for the inside of a Pshychos brain too ( seeing how you think they're braindead ) 
---
[https://youtu.be/6chxuovrbCI](https://youtu.be/6chxuovrbCI)
---
That's how they look, but they are actually shrimp.
---
There was already a Zetan DLC in Fallout 3. You get abducted by them and then fight your way through one of their motherships. 
---
Also, this looks more like one of the [alien animatronics](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/9/92/AnimatronicAlien-NukaWorld.png/revision/latest?cb=20161030203749) from Fallout 4 Nuka World than an actual Zetan.
---
I thought the exact same thing. Who even uses Diluted Stimpaks when you could just have a Stimpak? Even as a Lengthener, I only carry 3 Stimpaks on my person at most. It's just not worth it to stockpile.
---
Well, thank the lord..
---
On a serious note, thanks for the clarification üëç Its still not my style, id rather get the racecar haha
---
Was just saying alot of this stuff looks out of place. I guess it would be different if they gave us clean walls to go with the floors theyve offered.
---
Personal gripe: i wish i knew dark laminate was a thing before i purchased the light laminate :/
---
"No, keep playing." -Bethesda
---
Probably because people have already been banned for stuff like that
---
Pretty sure thats what the game is called
---
I agree. I have a level 170+ plus account dedicated for pve. I am starting a new account and will try to spec as perfect as possible for pvp.
---
That was the next thing I did was check to see if pacifist mode was on. It was. Generally as a rule, I check to see if my settings have not changed and that my gear is properly equipped when I start a new session.  I am baffled. Simply baffled. 
---
I think Bethesda just funked up the despawning system. Maybe they were intended to fly over the forest, out of the map and despawn to reduce server lag.
---
Don't all assaultrons in the game have the beam attack?
---
PMd ya
---
Didn't happen tonight, bit three nights ago. Otherwise it's been stable enough.
---
I think it'll come eventually, but by the time it comes, most people would've already moved on.
---
It has gotten a bit better in my experiences ever since people haven't been duping in every server.
---
Yeah, I've just learned to deal with it. Of course the odds always seem to be against me and it ends up always being the last one in my inventory is the one I was looking for. 
---
Nuka Tapper.
---
What I mean is it feels like they use it more often
---
They always spawn there. I think that's where they code all the Cargobots on the map to spawn.
---
You wana RP a fucking raider? Suit up in raider gear, grab a fucking pipe gun, and RP as a raider. Awesome.   
---
Steamrolling over other fucks with overpowered duped shit just makes you garbage who can't compete when you don't have the advantage. 
---
You‚Äôre a saint! 
---
Two Shot nerfs your weapon accuracy and doubles recoil. So doing bloodied instead of TS gives more accuracy because you're not losing accuracy.
---
Some of the BoS started regretting their actions as they were taxing the free states and responders. One of the Mistresses of Mystery questioned if she was better than a raider after killing so many people. The wasteland brings out the bad in a lot of people even if they started with good intentions. 
---
Because Bethesda didn't think ahead with a lot of things they added into the game 
---
( Although I still believe I should be able to pick locks on Player made crap, just not destroying stuff ) 
---
I'd suggest you look at the forums, Reddit, any feedback medium really.
---
If they *don't* make you start again, they risk much more than the ten of you threatening to quit (and never following through for more than a week or so).
---
Community feedback has spoken. If there were a way to clean up cheaters and glitches, we'd be happy for character import. However, there isn't, so we aren't.
---
Plan for a fresh character in survival.
---
I think he's saying that "Graham" isn't one of the names that Codsworth can address you by in Fallout 4.
---
(Happy Cake Day)
---
I've bought some floor pieces and a potted plant. It's sad. 
---
I guess I really thought you wanted to explain your reasoning instead of start some petty reddit argument. 
---
sadly no :(
---
Sure, everyone dumb enough to post a YouTube video of it in action. They don't need to track anything if they're just going to post the evidence for Bethesda to see.
---
No problem! Enjoy it, one of the best looking headwear in the game imo
---
Newp. Plan for a fresh start.
---
Wait, you've dreamed of a broken game without NPCs and with pretty much zero quests? 
---
If you wanna wait till tomorrow morning, I can give you a Zealot's gatling gun for 200 caps. Level 50, maxed out mods. 
---
Are you talking about Graham and how legion NPC's in New Vegas won't say his name because it's forbidden?
---
What platform?
---
IMO, the only reason to do Workshops is to get Plans.  From both taking and defending workshops, you can acquire an array of CAMP plans that can sometimes cost quite a bit otherwise.
---
so what you want is Mad Max Online
---
I agree that I don't much use diluted, but I am not at a point where I only have 3 healing items on my person. I mostly use healing salves because it's easy to stockpile near my CAMP. I don't like making diluted because I use the water for bathing. 
---
It's a RPG and if you don't remember raiders have been a prominent role is all previous fallout games.
---
Got any decent legendary unarmed weapons 
---
Yuuuppp. I'd like to know how they have the servers set up. I feel that when it gets to this time it always gets bad, surely they can see these trends also and should do something about?
---
I have literally just rage quitted for the first time in years because of the lag, Shooting enemies health down for it to ping back to full, frequent crashes and the sheer I ability to play a game I've purchased!
---
 This has gone on now for sooo long, there really is no excuse. Its also not excusable that stability wasn't mentioned at all in Inside the Vault!? How can that not be a priority when it's the biggest problem? Because Bethesda already have our money, that's why!
---
 Fed up with them now...Obsidian should've made this game! Online new Vegas remastered would've been incredible and I doubt the service could get any worse. 
---
Would I still be under that category if they have there platform with nothing but turrets placed at the gulf course of white springs? I am not accurate with my weapons, and stray shots tend to hit a house near there. I then proceed to light there house on fire and orbital striking it and the owner if they show up.
---
There is. On Playstation it's square then square. Once you hit transfer, you can take all.
---
Most framedrops I get is when I see a lot of things. For example there's a hut in the north-east where there's an event involving ghouls and music or something (can't remember the name) where my computer just says "Noooo... me no like." Scorched Earth on the other hand; Smooth as a criminal.
---
Bethesda games always have a habit with poor optimization, even FO3 stutters on my bulk(ish) PC.
---
Unless I was hallucinating(which is not impossible), I saw the other player‚Äôs health drop when I drilled his face. Which would warrant his justified retaliation. 
---
....Should I tell him?
---
Well said.
---
What if they're RP'ing being an asshole?
---
I was sitting on 3000, and was not paying attention, and the selection lagged, so what did I do? Double tapped A. I'm now the not proud owner of the Santa PA skin. Not happy about it. 
---
There is already...if your on pc just tap r twice...not sure what the console hotkey is..
---
You should have left some salt in his bag.
---
but what if someone is role playing as a raider from outside the vault
---
Source? Evidence?
---
The guy is what makes me proud to be from Manchester. He is our city's MvP
---
I'd already started my second restart and that cured it. I did have idle main menu players on my team so it seems likely that you were probably correct.
---
Ah, that does make sense. As for the OP, at least they have some video evidence, though it could still be argued they could be in on it. As for everyone else without any video footage? I doubt they can, and when they start banning people who just picked up something off the ground, they're going to have a lot more bad press. At least they are used to it now I guess?
---
Please, please, please don't let us players who have been preparing for PVP for months now fall to the wayside. A lot of players are still making new chars to play this PVP mode in March. It leaves us a lot of time to get ready. PLEASE do not make us restart with a new character.
---
agreed
---
Interesting...
---
...I'll check tomorrow if drills really are immune to pacifist mode. If it is: Ultimate Trolling Weapon confirmed.
---
OK but maybe some of us want it to be obvious to anyone who lays eyes on us. 
---
It happened to my buddy when we were in a world together... What would I gain from lying about that?
---
Lucky man! Wish I could say the same, just had to turn it off cause it is u playable atm. Always seems to be at this time and as a brit, I wanna blame America! Seems like when it gets evening there it all goes to hell. 
---
I want blackbird tho :(
---
*Role Playing
---
I'd also say RPing Enclave or Brotherhood should make one come off as at the least a little abrasive to those with more gentle sensibilities.
---
Nope. Truth is they are banning dupers. Not only the youtuber that you talked about. 
---
I mean, what were you expecting?  Even if you got a physical disk, this is a game that will be updated constantly and because it's multiplayer, everyone must have the newest version to play.
---
The only reason they make the physical copies is to have something on the shelves at physical stores.  You can't go to Wal-Mart and say "I want a game code, please."
---
It cost 40 caps to move a broken base and it's fully repaired 
---
The first thing I did after getting the flamingo plans was completely surround my buddy's CAMP (which was pretty much just a bed and cooking station at the time, no walls). Took up as much budget as I could while he was off doing something else. He left them up for a surprisingly long time, considering he had to jump over them to get to his stuff.
---
My camp's in the middle of nowhere tho, with no rsource nodes, no plants, heck, no spawn locations near it. It's totally useless.
---
So I'm terribly confused.
---
Nothing to gain from this so no exploit, don't worry. You're only breaking Da Rulez when you gain an advantage.
---
Could you be a little more specific please
---
This is very exciting! Can you tell us more about your method? How much charisma, which perks, all of that stuff?
---
I've looted him only once though, and now that you mention it, the time that I did loot him I thought it was glitching, every other time I've lost track of his corpse (but mininukes have that effect, lol, you get better at tracken bodies down.
---
yo there should be a perk so that unlooted bodies make a noise
---
Nope, there is no way. Sorry you haven't been planning for this like the rest of us. You still have time.
---
+karma
---
Yea its uh pretty obvious that this is a scrapped animatronic zetan, not shitting on it either, still a cool find.
---
I‚Äôll bump it up to 1.5k
---
Ps4 pro. Thanks for the quick reply 
---
Oh boy people on this sub will grasp at some seriously short straws to dodge the fact that this game is terrible.
---
As if this game didn't deserve the hate train.
---
I was not aware that u cant see people with a wanted tag. I moved my camp to whitespring so that might be be why he found me. I know that it was my mistake but whats bad about warning people about those guys? 
---
You know what, I'd buy that.
---
Sell excess to the In-Game Vendors. You'll hit Cap Max in a matter of days.
---
Makes sense, I forgot that part. I get up close so it doesn't bother me.
---
Hah, that might be. As an American I know this is usually when my buddies and I party up and hop on. 
---
no, bad idea
---
On PC, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúR‚Äù then ‚ÄúR‚Äù
---
Agreed. I dont like power armor but started to collect them w hopes of showing off the nuke cola paint job at my camp as deco. Killing queen gave me all ultracitw plans so I built that. Found out x01 is better. Decided if I was gonna do it my way, I'd be rolling in raider armor if at all.... I've narrowed it all down to one set. The excavator set.... the added carry weight is clutch in a bind so I can fast travel... and the fact I pull 4 or 5x more ore w/ it made me scrap the others until they let us display them. I mean, is this not a camp centric game??? What's the problem? 
---
If you move your camp it cost 40 caps and it fully repairs everything while the asshole gets a bounty
---
Nah bro, it ain't happening. Plenty of us have been planning for months for PVP and have made characters specifically for this. Everyone complaining that PVP should be a fresh start has time to prep a new character. More than a month at this time.
---
Ugly green with wood paneling, sign me up.
---
If you can verify this, I would greatly appreciate this. 
---
What that other guy said, I guess? I‚Äôve never launched a nuke and generally avoid nuke zones (I‚Äôm only lvl 33).
---
I'd be willing to bet Rifle.  It's a very broad category that encompasses guns with so many different purposes.
---
This all sounds amazing and its reminding a a bit of FFXI with the way you can change faction. Wasnt as hashed out back then but its an mmo i can remember that had 3 factions and you could swap, for time/price. Hopefully Beth sees this, it could make things a tad better.
---
As for the camp stuff its beginning to remind me of Fo4, dont recall the addon but it was where you could micromanage civs and newcomers to your settlements. Lovely.
---
Any 2 or 3* unarmed melee weapons with instigating, bloodied or furious 
---
It's funny and sad, because all of the asshole griefing are all the same: Big power armor jumping around like idiots with explosive two shot shotgun :))  
---
They are all noob just exploiting the game so i had to prepare myself against it, so now each time i capture a camp, my camp is being attack or when i go to watoga school, i'm prepare to deal with them :D  
---
I farm a ton of stealth boys, i have like 45% reduction of explosion damage and more with armor mod + 20% damaga reduction from lone wanderer + 40% damage reduction against player, since i play mostly vats critical, i just go invisible, charge at them and one shot every griefer, wanted or ennemy in my way with a critical shot  
---
I can't wait for the nerf on these two shot explosive weapon, they will mostly be useless
---
I‚Äôm going to try this later, thanks for the tip. 
---
Ah, didn‚Äôt know that.
---
I would suggest letting Bethesda know what happened. They‚Äôll probably take the stuff from you, but on the chance they eventually ban the dupers, you‚Äôll be safe. 
---
I've seen multiple people posting videos showing duping over the last month. Not just one. Bethesda just needs to look at all their comment sections to find a bunch more asking or offering help with their name and platform. They make it very easy for Bethesda to ban them.
---
I sware half this sub has Stockholm syndrome with Bethesda. I see everyday thousands of upvotes defending all the shitty things they did with f76 lol. Do you really not see how rushed this game was? How much of a cash grab it is? I can get liking it but constantly praising is beyond me.
---
Well you cant because we all physically start from inside the vault unless you want to completely mess up that story part
---
Bye felicia
---
It could be part of a whole 'garbage pail kids' type theme. With boogers and bandaids and shit
---
I wont make that mistake twice dont worry. And I was certainly not trying to entertain them but there is ofc a little anger when smth like this happens. 
---
You're welcome!
---
I'll agree with that sentiment when they allow us to mod the game the way we want without going through gated pay walls as they milk atom shop.
---
Best npc so far. 
---
You should get a job with google translator.
---
I'm on pc, but thanks for offering!
---
Forget the link for it but if you google ‚Äúfallout 76 mineral map‚Äù someone compiled a full map of all resource deposits and their type/location online, very useful and how i decide all my camp moves
---
Lvl 35 instigating death tambo power attack 2*\ lvl 50 mole miner with swing speed/ I have other in those categories but only 1*
---
I mean, you say that, but if there's any place where a player is likely to disconnect, it's in the middle of a Nuke Zone.
---
Not very great...
---
You don‚Äôt just drop in paper bag to transfer gears. It will poof if no players around. And if player around it‚Äôs not safe to drop stuff like that. 
---
Put down the pitchforks, lets get ready for PVP.
---
(If I haven‚Äôt replied but I think I did) what I mean is they use it way too often
---
I hope it helps. When the loading screen ends, I usually look up at the sky for about 5 seconds. After that almost everything is loaded and I don't get locked in my pipboy. Of course many different factors could affect this, so just take it as possibly helpful advice. Good luck.
---
Sorry, I‚Äôm on ps4
---
Any shortcut for Xbox? I have the same annoyance
---
what?
---
Yes I get it, until Bethesda get their shit together, wasteland justice will just have to do. But when they do get their shit together...? Perhaps it‚Äôs a fool‚Äôs hope. Sigh. 
---
As for picking stuff up, picking up 6 different guns you can claim plausible deniability. Finding 6 exactly-the-same gun, you know something‚Äôs up, best call the police (in a perfect world). 
---
Would If I could fast travel. I v encountered some kind of bug that I no matter how much stuff I drop my weight doesnt go down since the last patch. And since ther server crash a lot I dont want to drop my gear I use to check if it would change when I drop everything. 
---
I can see how it would be fun, but I also see that being a huge load on the servers. 
---
The only reason you're 'saving' weight is because of the 2 Plastic Scrap you use when bulking stuff.
---
TBH: I bulk stuff anyways, since it's helpful to see how much I have of something.
---
I tend to keep around 50 of non-bulkable stuff, 10 stacks of 30s, 15 stacks of 15s and 20 stacks of 10s, except springs and screws.. I sooo can't get enough of these! Almost instinctively tried to grab my mum's desk fan when I was visiting!
---
Remember, there are about 6 or 7 different vendor factions with their own separate cap limit.
---
Raiders, Responders, Whitesprings Station, Watoga Train Station, Watoga SuperDuper Mart, Enclave, and Harper's Ferry.
---
(I don't know if Whitespring Resort is affiliated with Whitesprings Station.)
---
Heck yeah. I want to play Caravan against other wastelanders, then flip the table and start firing when I know I'm going to lose.
---
Grats bro. I'm in same boat. More hours but just about same level _ 158. I would like to find at least one TSE before nerf so if they ever let us display them, it will be among my trophy rack. Anything after is just ludicrous. 
---
Except Fallout 3 actually had... *human NPCs*.
---
Man, that was like having a battle of wits with an unarmed person.
---
I tried to understand the counter but could not grasp it. I wanted to use it with a pressure plate to power the deco shower for like 10 seconds,but i guess it's not how it works.
---
console or pc?
---
Treeminders. Or Cult Of Mars. Just because they're stupid as heck, like me.
---
If I had to choose I'd say Elder Lyons Brotherhood Of Steel was cool. You know: The one before Elder Hitler joined the game.
---
Based on datamined data, most of this stuff was all made in advance and is slowly being rolled out while they work on additional content. It's gonna be a few months before Atom Shop content made based on community feedback is going to show up. 
---
And I'm sure for the actual game content they'll add in expansions will have a higher ratio of "cool" stuff, by virtue of it being directly related to any story content they're working on. 
---
I agree aswell. 400 hours on this account invested in one characters build I don't wanna start again. It's a slap in the face to all that have been supporting the game already. Bethesda games have always been about options and blocking our  heavily invested characters from free pvp mode like that is so dumb.. I believe bethesda sees this too. Even if they did this the community will manage to fuck it up again anyway. Not smart.
---
I‚Äôm a trap
---
Raiders destroyed a dam with mini-nukes and flooded Charleston, destroying West Virginia's post-war government and plunging the region into full-blown anarchy.  What are you on about?
---
What system do you play on?
---
Ok Thanks for the input I‚Äôll think about it
---
Ps4 try to join a server that a friend is on, go through the loading screen (no full server) and get the pop up that my CAMP can't be placed. Hit ok, then I'm disconnected from the server. Have repeated 4x
---
Of course, mate.
---
In about 16 hours I can report back.
---
...If I can find a drill that is...
---
I bought a nice door, since every other door looks like shit. Understandably, of course, but jesus christ. Can't we make something that looks half decent?
---
I did this to a drop , was level 8 first day in last week , and people are like level 100+ , I unlocked it thinking sweet as loot ! Then boom bounty , and a level 100+ chasing me down the mountain side for the next 5 minutes! I ended up getting pretty far and hiding under a rock ledge , thinking he can't see me , but I guess you don't lose the mark / arrow above your head ?? And can be found anywhere on the map ... A bit silly I thought . I had literally 0 chance to survival in this context. What was I meant to do ? Keep running for ever ??? New player tips please :) 
---
I use it with my main because I have Chemist, turns one stimpack into four diluted, which equals two stimpacks, and they're lighter than normal stimpacks.
---
Yes, if you can. Not all bases are built in places where you can really move them around. If your base is built in a cave system or some other nook, it's going to be impossible to move it back if you rebuild it somewhere else.
---
man, i bet your homework is just covered in red ink.
---
I agree with everything you say here. I imagine they will make the adventure mode without PVP and let us transfer our characters like they already said. If they do anything different I don't think it will be taken seriously.
---
when i played fallout 3 i role played as a survivor from somewhere else not the vault , thats what role playing is i guess, even in 76 i dont consider myself from vault 76. so you can. sorry i know im being pedantic, just trying to prove a point
---
I am not saying they are not banning people from YouTube but I am saying not only youtuber that dupe got banned. 
---
I am pretty sure they do have some system to monitoring right now. Because people that I know they duped are not using any public platform to let others know they dupe and they got banned. 
---
People that duped before the 10th and stopped afterwards are not banned. Unless they still hoarding huge amount of stuff. 
---
This game definitely blurs the lines between "evil" roleplaying and griefing. But I think it's still important (possibly even more so) to make the kinds of distinctions like the one you pointed out. Even the Raiders ultimately were just trying to survive. I'm pretty new to FO lore, so apologies in advance if I say something stupid here, and even then I am aware of the more extreme Raider factions that appear to get more enjoyment out of being harsh and malicious. But at the end of the day, if you're just camping around destroying entire bases for no reason, we have to agree it's just griefing. At least give yourself a reason, because even Raider factions seem to recognize that leaving victims with SOMETHING to recover with, will only allow them to produce more resources for the taking later. Actually pillage resources you're in need of, and leaving something behind for the victim to rebuild from, and I'd say you can get away with calling it roleplaying. 
---
Yeah, but I don't remember which one. I know it was a side quest though.
---
Oh well today I learned too. I'm 150+ hours in as well. 
---
lol
---
Thanks for the link

How much do you have that you're so overweight?
---
Lol could have said "just play the game" . As a new player your tip is useless :( gimme some juicy tips pls 
---
Nope seeing as how you're the only one to have revisited a day old thread to complain about something that has quite literally nothing to do with you. Your comment is pretty asisine considering the last time I posted in this thread was almost a full 24th hours ago, so that probably should've been a clue to you, wiseass.
---
XB1, SORRY!
---
sincerely,  the breakfast club
---
Get yourself a full set of X-01, keep an eye on your health bar and bring out your arse kicking weapon and you're all set.
---
Attempting to do the Poseidon Power plant mission and get an infinite loading screen upon entering the plant from the cooling towers.
---
Wait, can you have multiple chassis' with different armor pieces?! Everytime I use my PA chassis, it uses the same T-60 set
---
No
---
The Responders and/or the Order of Mystery.  Be kind.  Try to help.  Run toward danger instead of away from it.
---
My friend and I friend always destroy any base that's turret farming the place. So please, go ahead and place your camp there. More fun for me.
---
Ultracite calibrated shocks are only from plans, which are a rare drop from the Scorchbeast Queen. It'll probably be easier trying to find someone who can make them for you. 
---
To be fair both of those games have been out for at least a month longer then 76.
---
2-3 hrs in, i'd give it an 8.5        hang in there, kitty
---
you can out-of-bounds yourself into a lot of places just by entering power armor that is against a wall
---
Level 107, havent seen either myself :/ 
---
As a new player (level 12) , I have had people gift me some ammo/ stims. We appreciate it ! Don't let the one asshole ruin that for you bro! A level 100+ gave me 200shot gun shells my first day :) , made my night ! So thank you for your kindness in the wilderness my friend
---
What did you mean by soon because it's still here. Thanks for the explanation
---
Its skin color is to light to be an actual set an I think it's an animatronic one
---
I dont remember how caravan worked, but I enjoyed playing it in new vegas. That would be a fun idea to introduce
---
Yeah but I just walked through a door before it loaded.
---
This is false.
---
You cannot tame smaller domestic creatures, such as cats, squirrels, and chickens. Stop spreading disinformation.
---
I'd wreck your shit in Yu-Gi-Oh! Or Triple Triad. UNO. Taro Cards.
---
Poker Dice (which I played a lot back in RED DEAD REDEMPTION) was pretty cool, that would be a cool minigame to play with others.
---
what platform?
---
if it scratches an itch..    a lot of kids choose to huff paint, but you got fallout 76
---
Sounds like stealing twisted metal and mario kart's ideas
---
Oh, you're a bot.
---
I hope that rumor is false. Lots of people use mule accounts to store legitimate items. It would have to be an absurdly high number to avoid banning mule accounts. I've heard some people actually play with 1000's of pounds on them because they don't want to discard anything. I would go crazy with no AP and moving at a crawl personally.
---
I wish they could monitor challenges correctly.
---
From a story perspective it appears that the reclamation has failed because we never hear about  West Virginia in any of the other fallout games. So that means that what ever the people in West Virginia were trying to do didn't work out. In turn that means that any rebuilding we do would be redundant.(Doesn't mean we still cant build things, this is in the present after all. Destroying West Virginia would have to have happened in the future otherwise we wouldn't have a West Virginia to play in.)
---
From a more realstic perspective it was because this game did not exist yet so there was no need to mention it in any other games.Also it depends if beth wants to make this game cannon or not if they havent already. I don;t
---
So then if we rebuild it would have to be in another state mabe in a dlc similar to World of Warcraft where we could go back and forth between 2 different states.
---
ill try to find it if i do i will post here 
---
If you find Calibrated Shocks on a vendor, and it breaks down to Ultracite, they're for the Ultracite Power Armor. Each one gives +50 carry weight, so you'll need one for each leg.  
---
However, they're also available for the Excavator - if you see them on a vendor (or out in the world) and they say they'll break down into Black Titanum, they're for the Excavator. That means a possible +200 to carry weight, all told.
---
Aslong as the bobblehead problem is fixed I don‚Äôt see any problem with carrying characters into survival, 
---
Why should I have to start all over again because some players are waaay behind when it comes too pvp gear and are crying about it? 
---
If they don‚Äôt let make you start again the majority of players will just remain in adventure mode, as they likely would either way 
---
Fresh characters would only level the playing field for a day or two anyway,  it‚Äôs pointless, this would lead too a massive increase in griefing in ‚Äúadventure mode‚Äù as many people have been building towards pvp servers just too have them stuck in adventure 
---
Well to be fair , they gave you some more game play :) that sounds like some cool rpg shit to me ! Obviously it would suck , but to be able to get revenge is pretty cool mechanic ! 
---
X then x on Xbox 
---
I found the one about explosive diarrhea, I didn't know what he was talking about at first 
---
Yeah, its x. Bonus psa, if you have any perks for finding more ammo/chems/food for a container you have to search it again with y
---
Which platform? I‚Äôve noticed PS4 became more stable after the last patch.
---
Yeah, something doesn't add up here. I think you're just fear mongering. I've never had an issue before with any randoms. Op probably got griefed once, and is upset he couldn't stop the guy from logging.
---
Oh is that what the other guy was saying? I looked on the wiki and didn't see anything about it. Do I somehow have them on my excavator armor? I didn't know anything about calibrated shocks until right now
---
A big fat NO
---
I have a two shot hunting rifle... I found the day after patch.... or maybe its exploding. I dont remember. I use my pipes on other things for the ranged explosion... or for less mess just a plain quick two shot. I mostly beat it up with melee, tho. So I'll have to chk which my hunting rifle is... No. your mind. Not mine.
---
Thank you for your nonjudgmental information you have saved me minutes of my life
---
Additional camps would be cool. I think they should be expensive (caps) so it doesnt just litter the map, but sometimes i want to make a new CAMP without having to destroy the one i have.
---
Otherwise, keep GTA in GTA.
---
Closing post
---
Oh really? I just assumed it was automatically there. Wow I've wasted that card since I got it
---
That's right virtual mess, keep mocking people who enjoy something you hate.
---

---
I have it and if you have class freak 3 it‚Äôs something like -13% so not that bad, hasn‚Äôt phased me.
---
It is, but at the same time, what you see are a handful of different approaches to surviving in the wasteland and dealing with the Scorched plague.  It's not about who you'd side with, as much as which faction most aligns with your own play style.
---
I completely understand. It's part of the point I'm trying to make, that our own experiences are solely based on what we want to do and how we view ourselves
---
Just move your base. Problem solved. Fixed for free.
---
can you clarify- how would you define 'outrage culture' and your understanding of it? 
---
what percent of the outrage surrounding this game might be due to this elephant in the room, this 'outrage culture'  you speak of
---
I'm not a fan boy, however Don't blame the devs, blame the exploiters that gave more work for the devs.
---
No I 100% agree, just trying to say that none of their games have release flawless. 
---
I agree that it is a little bit better. 
---
I need healing factor. GT: SamsterMac
---
I've been playing since the stress test, and never had a single one until this last patch. Now I get minimum one a day. I've never believed in coincidences.
---
Fantastic. For you. If you're thrilled with the Atom shop as it is now, GREAT! I think it's shit. Stupid, worthless, and altogether pointless! 
---
Yes because it's so exciting trying to make people afraid?...
---
Talking to my friend she said the same thing was happening in her server once. 
---
yo screw this guy! give me your missiles, I buy with pure gold and silver! alright fine sell your missiles to him.

Ps4 ack!

---
@misanthropi\_ is probably right. I HAVE found a single Calibrated Shocks in the wild for Excavator, so I know they're out there, and what they break down into.  
---
Your Excavator already has +100 carry weight built in, but you can get Calibrated Shocks to add an additional +100 on top of that.
---
I sorta have 2 Mr. Farmhand pets. I set up camp outside Flatwoods at a copper node, perfectly placed between 2 Mr. Farmhands. One closer to town the other up the road. They are close enough that I can see them when I am in camp, but far enough away that they don‚Äôt attack me. Even better is after doing the Fertile Soil event they don‚Äôt attack even if I walk up to them, but have come to my aid when mole rats were attacking my water purifiers. So yeah, please give us pet robots.
---
I hadn't thought about that fix it lol, for simple bases anyways, still not great placing mechanic system for CAMP yet. Hopefully something we get in the next patch
---
Oh ok. Once again I feel like there was some how to play book I missed, that everyone else read. Thank goodness for this sub I'd be so lost without you guys
---
So not gae?
---
No I‚Äôm straight 
---
what happened to that quest?
---
I'm sorry is this a troll? I honestly can't tell.
---
Not gae
---
I can't use my name in one game but it's a name of a super mutant in the other. Idk just bothers me a bit. 
---
Hate to say it, but uninstall and reinstall. Your data is all saved on their servers. 
---
This is why I rarely bother taking workshops. 
---
PC.
---
I have one it is only a * though. Unless I sold it or dropped it in the world
---
also you can change from medium preset to 'high' or try ultra now with a gtx 970 (good view  distances sliders preset). Remember to add in these settings to custom and prefs AFTER setting ingame preset or there will likely be some stutter when turning the camera quickly.
---
I think small moves tend to SEEM to cost more because usually when youre making them, youre building up a CAMP in that location for the first time. Youre moving stuff around and trying to see what works, get jammed up and decide to "move", but youre technically moving multiple times on the same server. Im pretty sure each consecutive move on the same server increases in caps each time.
---
Ahh so it's already nerfed? I did notice the accuracy sucks occasional ly, and that jump shots sucks ass right now. But I've been running bloodied/ unyielding since release, with a little bit of weightless thrown in. I know by my health bar what it takes to do the trick. I usually float around 50-65√∑ health. But will dip if it's down to the wire for extra umpf. Oh I should mention. Melee build with rifle back up. 
---
No problem, good luck out in the Wasteland!
---
Yeah these cry babies just want to drag us down to their casual level. Stay in adventure mode if you can't hang with the big boys who actually care about pvp.
---
This sub IS the How-To-Play book. :-)
---
It‚Äôs pretty high number. 1000 is nothing close to it. I think they are talking about several 100k over weight. 
---
The glowing ghouls use to give up to 650 xp per one untill the update made it 150 ish
---
But they had the beta for the base game and obviously that didn't have any effect on what launched 
---
135... never launched either
---
I would give them real money for a complete set of Nuka themed workshops, furniture, and decorations. 
---
It also depends on what type of weapon it is. I think an instigating explosive shotgun should work pretty well.
---
As long as people come up to me and act friendly I'll continue doing the same.
---
How do you know what challenges there are? I get them randomly but I never know what I can do to earn atoms. 
---
It‚Äôs in a locker between bunk beds up in the barracks. 
---
No I keep everything but the t60 in my stash untill I can name them.
---
I hope nobody has a legit mule with that much weight! Here I was worried about my character with 6000 pounds of power armor parts and chassis.
---
I was running the game in borderless window mode and was getting about 45ish fps. In fullscreen I get 72 tps stable.
---
But... the purpose of start fresh is so the challenge level is even for all, ie the rarity of supplies and being forced all the way through a character‚Äôs progress, made more often to have a broken weapon, starvation, disease, radiation is what makes the possibly unfriendly interactions have higher stakes. So that the player choices are actually and truly based on survival situation, somewhat randomly provided by the environment. Like, maybe a player found a rare weapon and when it breaks it only then respawns in such a way another player could claim one, if they couldn‚Äôt get it from the existing player holding it, and in order to renew its repair you had to get that specific spawn point , creating points of contention and using the scarcity of specific equipment create a real Survival mode feel, places people are hoping to recover something very important which might not even spawn as the exact thing they need but it will be something rare for sure. A system where competition narratively makes sense because everyone can‚Äôt have everything. 
---
That‚Äôs why they are up in arms wanting the mode to be a separate start. They want a higher difficulty with more complexity so the interactions with players have high impact and drama, as described in the official announcement of survival mode. 
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs nerfed yet, but it will be in the next update.
---
Unless you're willing to switch your build around based on what you find, the chances of getting two good stars on a weapon that you want are not high. The game's essentially built for trading, at least across a team.
---
As a compromise option you could limit yourself to only buying with caps that you gained from trading.
---
Here's a tip. Make so much ammo you can only move with Batteries Included on lol, that thing burns thru ammo like snow melting in hell
---
Darn I was always wondering what triggers and stops the radio...now I know lol and I‚Äôve been playing since beta =x
---
Thankfully. There are no humans that will kill you if you touch the chickens.
---
I've been saying this since seeing the outrage over Bethesda's plan. It's stupid if these casual gamers, who are bitching about other people's gear, get to dictate how pvp is done. They obviously don't care about pvp if they haven't prepared for it. 
---
I've prepared for pvp since launch day, these people are scared of the "dupers" with two shot explosive weapons, but Bethesda is nerfing them. Giving milk to a crying baby. These same casual gamers have no idea that with two simple perks/mods, you can COUNTER those weapons.
---
Tldr, FFS do some fucking research and prep before bitching about something you know nothing about.
---
Sadly yes. It seems simple as a player but I don't know how much they actually play there own game. It's fine for a casual player that doesn't push to perfection but when you start maximizing the build the gap starts getting fairly large. 
---
Dense mod your chest. Slap on fireproof. Then go buttfuck their corpses..tse isn't shit with dense and fireproof
---
I havent experienced this issue and I'm carrying a Dragon, rifle, and pistol on my Union Soldier. It's fun though. Adrenal reaction and only 40-70 health and no armor is a challenge for sure.
---
I don‚Äôt have those: big l for me
---
That‚Äôs the storage key, not weapon storage key :/
---
I guess I‚Äôm somewhat describing a hunger games like space. I recently saw that series for the first time. 
---
Doesn't it make the SBQ freeze? I heard it's great against her
---
LoL I‚Äôve heard plenty of complaints about there being nothing to do in the game but if fools are blowing up bases and leaving without even killing you or waiting for someone to extract revenge they really must be bored.
---
Lol? My man, mathematically speaking you're insane. TSE = 600% damage if you've got the right perks and such for every bullet. furious = 30% damage increase. With crit, that's upped to occasionally 260% plus whatever extra damage the crit perks give, i can't remember off the top of my head. That means the perks would have to cover another 240% damage increase to even be equal to TSE weapon damage output, and I already know they don't. Not to mention every shot a TSE gun makes is that damage while you can't crit every shot. And that doesn't even take into account that you have to build up to that 30% increase in damage, you don't start with it. Every single fight...
---
For me on xbox, its been as unpredictable as its always been. Ive always had hard freezes since fo4. I rarely get a server crash or disconnect, its almost always the game freezing. Each update seems to make it crash in a different way. 
---
Adrenal reaction plus bloodied/instigating, on a stealth build with chameleon or stealthboy PA. Could be the new meta. It probably already is.
---
I‚Äôm really going to blow your mind then when I tell you the one violent night quest is a reference to Beowulf.  
---
For those unaware, Beowulf comes to the aid of the King of the Danes whose mead hall gets attacked at night by a monster(Grendel) summoned by all the racket their making. 
---
So now the plan is to take, server hop immediately? This game.
---
Is that the cage with the level 3 lock?
---
Says you‚Äôre offline
---
Heh, I agree. I must have sold or vendored a gun I was trying to sell. Both the buyer and myself were sad :/
---
Did you unequip Iron Fist by any chance? 
---
And what about when people abuse the ability to go 100% passive?  Turn passive off, sneak up on someone with passive off, kill them, turn passive on and never have to worry about them getting for revenge until you find your next victim and drop passive again.
---
Ps4 here and the error screen crashes have stopped for me. Now i get stuck in loading screens or my game just freezes. Twice since i logged on 20 minutes ago and am currently waiting for the game to render in
---
Everytime. Doing anything. 
---
Now we're cookin'!
---
PS4 Pro :/  Its seriously just getting worse and worse for me and its making it very discouraging to play.
---
I'd like it
---
Right?? If you're going to come and attack me and my base yeah I'm gonna be annoyed. Not gonna get upset because it's part of the fun honestly imo. But that? C'mon man
---
Yup
---
Or how about being able to build settlements? That'd be cool to gather together and form a settlement where people can interact and live together.
---
Try to store all the springs in the stash
---
Because YOU are the pacifist.  The mode isn't designed to be your impenetrable shield, it's there so YOU can't accidentally damage anyone.
---
Put everything in your stash and then try. 
---
You can't bulk screws. Gears and springs are fair game though.
---
I've switched to a server cat and had much fewer disconnections
---
I have played solo but "lucked" into a few interactions where I went through some areas with other players and really enjoyed it. I wish I had more RL friends who played, or found a group of players who want a "hour or so a day" player to weigh them down lol.
---
Haha yeah just plug and play we all have those mods
---
just msg join my world gt:rcayton1
---
On the fifth try, could move for about 5 seconds, then same.story. locked up. WTH Bethesda?
---
Not just no, but hell no. Only cosmetic items in the pearl shop. They were very clear that atom shop items would be cosmetic only. If they break from that and lie to us and start putting in P2W garbage this game will tank even harder than it already has.
---
Ive gotten 2 freezes ever, and it was this week, but I mainly get bluescreened (PS4). Ive actually gotten black screened 2 or 3 times, and i disconnect a handful of times, but more often than not im being thrown out of the app.
---
I play on xbox. I only get the buff while in the excavator pa.
---
Known bug.
---
Do not try to open your pip boy, map, or any menu until the environment completely loads.(wait even after th screen fades in)
---
Playing melee now but my rifle build is still effective with a 1star bloody handmade. Oddly enough I find it does more damage to the queen then tse.
---
Sure, that's *a* difference, but it doesn't make 76 "nothing like" 3.
---
Two shots are really nice, not even too strong. Almost how the normal weapon should be, too bad two shot itself is getting a big nerf.
---
Strange, I was showing as online. A few people we're able to join. SBQ was finished.
---
Are you looking for legendary or basic?
---
My barn plans I bought for 950 caps gave me the power connector plans.
---
Fucking ripoff.
---
Do you use the targeting HUD?
---
So where exactly is it in the glassed cavern? 
---
Hi and welcome to this sub. Most people who are active here would probably agree with you.
---
I am devestated that I didn't but the Blackbird paint job. The only thing I have bought so far is the camo skin for the sniper rifle. 
---
\--close
---
This games so inconsistent, we dont even have a set of consistent issues! The error screen crashes are whats gotten worse for me. I did get stuck loading once today though.
---
No the only things I changed in my perks were barbarian and ironclad. I figured that the berserker deathclaw gauntlet would drop some damage but my regular one drops too. They go from 462 and 367 respectively but with barbarian they drop to 230 and 120 so IDK. 
---
I always just pick it. Didn't know there was a key.
---
Fuck... Yes. Should i not be??
---
On the right side of the screen, near the top, under "Subscribed" and "Edit Post", look for "User Flair Preview", and "Edit User Flair". It'll let you choose from a number of factions. 
---
Um... I actually like/bought the princess castle bed, but I definitely agree with you. 
---
Almost certainly not. If it's bad then it's probably just the leftovers of a Whitesprings nuke run. If it's more mediocre then it's probably a stash clearout.
---
If you don‚Äôt have pure water. You can‚Äôt make it. 
---
Dc'd me lol. I feel you on being discouraged
---
yeaaaaaah given the AK doesn't exist in-world ........ but the rhyme isn't quite there.
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/YMjBSpr
---
keep it with maxed class freak then. Accuracy loss is minimum at that point. 
---
The PA weight reduction perk is garbage even if you feel the need to have 7 of them for some reason. And if you're always wearing one you only have to worry about 6 of them taking up weight so in the end you don't even save 50 weight while Batteries Included saves me ~500 lbs mostly in all the FCs I have hoarded up for the same Int point cost.
---
It‚Äôs the respawn.
---
Yeah with bloodied/instigating + double damage due to hidden + adrenal reaction + adrenaline + damage buff drug is the best damage.
---
Well, there is, happy hunting xD
---
Redicueles. This game was rushed out for release. They should have worked one more year on it. Then it would have been great. And it would have gotten great reviews. No one are blaming the devs. 
---
Agreed. Now we just get Corpse Flower Stamens. Yay.
---
Sure man I really don't think Charisma matters mine was at 9 or 10 here; I always tame with lone wanderer, wasteland whisperer, and animal friend even though I've heard only one is required. But really the key is the spot I use crashed vertibird and have seen everything there but it may take days of server hopping to see the same thing twice.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
1*?
---
Last patch caused crashing issues with targeting HUD. Take off your helmet for awhile and see how your crashes go
---
Well... that worked... Thank you!!!!
---
With the two shot mod you can shoot 250 rounds before it breaks from 200% condition without using any durability perks. It's a good supplemental wepon for melee and for the queen fight. 
---
If you have the explosive affix it has stupid insane range with the vanilla barrel. If you dont have the explosive affix i suggest you switch to the long barrel. 
---
If you use the long barrel be careful there's a chance you can freeze yourself if your too xlose to your target.
---
I suggest you empty 1 clip into the queen every time she lands. Assuming everything hit that should freeze her enough that she doesnt cause to much of a ruckus 
---
And you are here why? This wasn't defending anything.. It's easy to hate a game when all you do is play make believe western. 
---
If you really want to drive yourself crazy look in the error history menu in system settings to see how many times its happened. The blue screen crashes have stopped for me, fingers crossed, but i still have more crashes than days ive owned the game
---
We need proof man. Your just wildly throwing accusations and expecting everyone to stop teaming up. This is unreasonable and ridiculous. 
---
I too was sick of Medium quality to achieve smooth fps. For otherrs reading please use this solution, it should work great for you! Ultra textures ftw!
---
for some reason also te itexturequalitylevel=3 gives more fps for me than 2 or 1.  
---
 iTextureMipSkipMinDimension=1024 iLargeTextureArrayDim=2048 iTextureQualityLevel=3  are the main settings that you should use for good lookingitem and object quality. The rest are settings to skip minor lighting and additional textures, just use the settings i posted and you won't notice a difference from ultra imo and somehow gain a lot of fps.
---
If Bethesda added a bear skin coat like Warren Beatty wore in McCabe &amp; Mrs Miller (yes, an obscure reference....) I would buy it.
---
Thanks for the advice! I will be trying this the next time Im on. Im sure ill still get some, but i hope this negates a majority of the issues ive been having.
---
Go to the map, press the button to bring up the game menu (as if you were going to quit, or change game settings) and "CHALLENGES" is listed there.
---
Even after you equipped it? Sometimes Fallout gets confused on multiple weapons of the same type on the UI, maybe it's just a cosmetic UI bug.
---
Wooosh
---
After removing my targeting HUD I've crashed one time the last week. As opposed to crashing 2-3 times an hour
---
I had the same issue but with about 500 x .308 rounds. 
---
I want a princess dress :]
---
Y'all are asking for more serious items, meanwhile I'm over here just asking for more reasonable fucking prices.
---
Im curious now. 
---
Side question: Has anyone taken notice to the error codes? Is it usually the same ones? Do they mean anything specific or are they fairly generic?
---
I'll have to check when I restart the game again, hopefully you're right though. 
---
I honestly think it is. Even though I'd expect it to be an American server and a European server but this is Bethesda after all. 
---
 Well enjoy your gaming, hopefully it's stable for you. 
---
Thank you so much. I think this was the one
---
I like the brick wall interior . It's just plain white.
---
That was me that made the list.  There's only two missing that I know of.  One of the Delbert recipes that I don't think anyone has found and the one that uses the megasloth mushroom.  I can't get that damned mushroom to drop so I get the recipe!
---
I know this is kinda like the Princess Castle Bed, but... I need me a Pink power armor Paint. 
---
Ps4? I can hook you up.
---
I think they are taking their taking hate of video games too far. 
---
honestly I'm an old man now. part of the reason why I love bethesda is because of ID... and id almost dissolved as a company because they gave up their monetary gains so that the FPS genre didn't die out. I would love it if people realized how morally wrong thinking something is morally wrong can be. I've read all the studies and am honestly offended when I hear stuff like this now-a-days.
---
It isn't boomers, it's not even conservatives; it's sheer mob mentality. If you blame video games for the worlds problems then you're letting the real culprits get away.
---
Let's also face the fact that had Bethesda done PvP properly these assholes would be exactly the people who would become raiders. Which would have been awesome.  
---
Explain the wild part please? Oh, and where I said to completely stop teaming up?
---
If someone wants to team up with you, all I'm saying is maybe shoot em message or party invite to be on the cautious side. Maybe check to see if they have a bounty before accepting. People doing this wouldn't take the time to type a couple messages or join up in a party to talk for a few. They want to get in and out as quickly as possible. Does it really bug you that much that I'm trying to give people a heads up lol
---
Triggered.
---
Wasnt the targeting HUD not working initially? 
---
They fix a game mechanic and it completely shatters the game. Oh, sweet Big Irony.
---
Yup. Same here. 
---
Ok so I just reached level fifty and I‚Äôm starting to get a bunch of end game loot and now I‚Äôm gonna get some serums but I have no clue how they work and which ones I should get.  Can u tell me what all of them are and which ones are the best. I have money to buy so I can buy quite a few. Also how do I keep them because don‚Äôt they get taken away when u de disease cure or rad away. I think there is a perk for that called starched jeans but do I get that perk first before the mutation or do I get the mutation then get that perk. Please help
---
Dunno didn't put it on anything until this patch
---
&gt;  Found out x01 is better.

Except it's not... Ultracite has best ballistic resist and X01 has best energy resist.

prior to some patches ago, if someone completed the quest the whole server would get the food reward. it was fixed so that only the people who participate in the event get the reward. the quest is called Feed The People and since the whole server got the reward many thought it made sense, but it was actually a bug. the food you get from it also gives an xp reward when consumed.

I'm a big fan of the "post-apocalyptic restaurant reviews" you can find at pretty much every eatery in Appalachia.
---
It‚Äôs close tho!
---
No, you can‚Äôt bring stuff you‚Äôve made and found already because the way drama exists in survival mode is the scarcity of stuff and the gradual progression of players footholds in the world. 
---
You know, i think im thinking about the 'highlight living targets' not working with berry mentats.
---
Either way, tis buns

If you do a high rad build diluted stimpaks are good, you dont waste a full stimpak when you could dilute it into 4 smaller doses with chemist, or 8 if you get lucky with super duper

I just want more dresses, hair styles and camp items that look like they're from the 1950s.
---
Aesthetics, mostly, for me. I'm aching for full T-51 PA. But, at the same time, I enjoy mixing and matching different pieces for a unique look.
---
None of this actually matters, though, since I don't really like using Power Armour, period, and as such I can't contribute much more than my opinion to the conversation.
---
Almost everything you said it correct and not your fault.
---
That being said... Junk is easily replaceable and if you're worried about losing it then don't carry around a bunch at a time. Everyone has a CAMP and stash.
---
That‚Äôs gonna be my TIL for the day, thanks. 
---
Are you a bot, programmed with human hubris ?
---
An hour a day keeps the fallout rotmonster away. That's not bad, if you can be prepped for specific events in that hour. 
---
Yeah. Most of the helmet mods are trash and 2 crash the game. I guess recon sensors do it too. Might not cause crashing but I'm not going to test it.
---
It really isn't, I've seen people compare it to no man's sky.. it's no where near that bad either. I honestly believe that Rockstar paid for bad reviews, you'll find in too many places that they'll somehow bring up how great red dead is when they talk shit about this game.. like seriously, I can't be the only one who noticed.
---
Yeah but the problem I was running into with this is phantom budget and funky placement restrictions (those goddamn melons mang) preventing me from just scrapping and replanting exactly where it was.
---
Crazy. Is that the standard asking price on XB1 for serums?
---
I‚Äôm on PC and people will just pay me the automatic trade request amount which is 2400 caps. I‚Äôve even been asking 2k instead thinking I was giving a 20% price break. Been taking 6k on bundles of 4 and those have been selling well.
---
theres a lot to cover about mutations i suggest u look up a video. as per all the mutations go to the wiki to see what they all do. sorry not here to explain im here to sell.
---
What is the point in bulking? Some materials reduce weight when bulked, some don't. Some you can't only sell bulked, others you can sell bulked or loose. 
---
It's a confusing system and not a fun game mechanic. Why not just get rid of bulking all together? Or make it so that bulking does actually reduce weight for all mats?
---
Superb, really!
---
If the system is properly
---
Designed for the way successful
---
Pvp works - conflicts in locations that players traffic through for repeatable reasons - then it won‚Äôt only
---
Level it for a few days. It will be the ongoing definition of level, the inability for players to ‚Äúbeat‚Äù the survival gameplay, instead constantly being out of supplies, room, firepower, and safe haven
---
Same generic code CE-34878-0
---
lmao people out there getting scammed considering what u need to craft the mutations. the materials required to craft mutations are not at all hard to get. definitely not 2400 caps worth. no offense.
---
The only thing that bugs me is soggy lint and I don't mean you.
---
Yup under photo mode it‚Äôs one of the filters. Lots of people get confused when loading their characters cause it only records the level of your character when the photo is taken. Cause ya know it‚Äôs a photo. But you can change your character load photo to any photo you‚Äôve taken. So I just update my ID photo as I progress.
---
Yeah I'm wondering too. Stuck with the first face I made for my toons
---
ü§£ don't scare me like that
---
Which is that from?
---
Noob
---
&gt; My stash box has been full for a long time.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;(...)  
---
&gt; I have hardly any caps, you get shit for trading things in, vendors have  limited caps- only way to get caps is to scrounge or limited in  rewards. 
---
These two go together.  If your Stash is full, you should start bulking things and selling them.  You can make a ton of Caps doing this, especially with a couple ranks of Hard Bargain.  Eventually, you'll begin to learn what resources you need, and you leave behind or sell what you don't.  It's going to vary depending on your character, of course.
---
This isn't like the other Fallout games where you can hoard to your heart's content.  There are few items that are truly sacred.  Don't keep pieces of armor for a rainy day, or a weapon you know you'll never use.  Sell it for Caps or scrap it to learn mods to make your sacred gear even better.
---
&gt; There‚Äôs no guarantee save option I‚Äôve found.  No way to save- I‚Äôve  slept, fast traveled, achieved checkpoints, finished quests- none of  them have proven to be surefire auto save points. 
---
The most reliable option I've found is to get to a named location.  Fast traveling really should do it - I don't know why it doesn't for you.  The only times I've had major setbacks (and this is like... maybe 5-10 minutes at worst) is when I'm off-roading through areas like the Savage Divide.

I think it's easiest to get the plans for the BoS mods from Grafton and Vendor Greg.

Yeah they aren't mutually exclusive.

Pay to win. Not on my watch. Case closed.
---
There was a real nice feeling to go and do it for everybody's benefit. Instead I've not done it once since it was 'fixed'.
---
If anything we need more events that benefit the whole server. There should be one at the damn that provides water to everybody too. An event at some of the mines that provides ore. Add a toy factory that gives small crafting components. Something like that. Or, preferably, the players have to *make* the toy factory. In a certain area and has to have certain benches, etc. Add some of the conveyer belts from FO4 and make players set it all up.
---
Yes it would disappear when the server empties but it's something at least.
---
Well then how did i die in one shot, makes no zense
---
Super beautiful game and it has an insane draw distance which definitely sets up for some good photo opportunities. Climbing the top of the devils backbone and getting a nice shot of the mire with fog rolling through the cranberry bog can be breathtaking 
---
The only things I got from there were the red rocket Pip-Boy and the four-poster bed. I have 2250 atoms from regular gameplay (level 68). Looking through the shop while I make this post. I don't see anything that looks that appealing.
---
Truth. I didn‚Äôt play any of the post classic titles. Going above 200 hours here. 
---
Have you tried the server hop method where you just spawn at charleston station, run over the train bridge, turn around and run back? Worked for me once at least haha, didnt try it

This guy gets it

yeahh lol I've been playing since the beta

I know that but where in the cavern?

So much salt here you could sell it to all the vendors for 1 cap each tifay and still have enough to sell tomorrow.

While aesthetic wise it may not quite fit I don't think a princess bed qualifies as lore breaking by any stretch of the imagination

Its the good old Bethasda matchstick tower patching process (no glue included), some of the problems could have had fixed by modders months ago but as it is, this was nothing but cash grab....

Just better to finally uninstall and let it sunk.
---
It bugs me that you're spreading misinformation, backed by zero evidence. You're trying to create hysteria among the masses, probably laughing maniacally while watching it all burn down. All the strides we've taken, as a community, to make it as friendly and engaging a game as possible, and you want to flush it all down the drain for these "rumours"
---
Scrap the broken Mutfruit and you get 1 Mutfruit to put back down. You can then repair all.
---
The negativity comes from a large amount of wrong type of player and a journalism climate that is just not the classic pc - adventure - role playing gamer that it is built for. Realizing how incredible and fun it was felt like a secret that lots more gamers are going to eventually know. Like the first 10k Warcraft classic players when everyone was amazed that many people bought a game, they found it to be more than they expected, they had a bigger audience and therefore server strain they never anticipated.

That's what I said üòì

I'm bored, but I've played the hell out of this game. I'm totally sure I've played over 200, likely over 300 by now.. it was just disheartening to hear that this new game mode isn't until March, and that isn't necessarily new content..
---
The way they released it, it felt like they planned to have new stuff periodically released, that they rushed the release of the game because the content was on the way already.. Half of what they complain about with dlc is that it was ready before the game was released- they complain because most developers charge for that dlc. 
---
I guess I was wrong or perhaps all the bug fixes pushed it back? I don't know.

I'd love the ability to leave notes that automatically pop up on other player's screens that are on the same server/region. Uncharted territory I know‚Äìperhaps call it a "text chat" of sorts.

On paper it sounds amazing and giving some creative people the ability to do their own talk show sounds neat, but copyright laws would make playing music difficult for bethesda and I have heard music via people's mics in online games. It doesn't sound right.
---
Holy shit that's alot of text!
---
I think it‚Äôs because the lore of the situation is that there are few locations where there would actually be security to stop raiders and hostile behavior. If a player wants to do that the only consequence would be enacted by other players. No guaranteed secure place to build camp. It‚Äôs the core lore of the premise of the game. 
---
thank you so much! 
---
If you're at a low level, it can be pretty hard if you're not used to survival games. I honestly found every encounter to be unfairly difficult until I hit Level 30. Maybe it's just me being so bad at the game, but after I found a basic idea of what I was good at, got some decent armour and actually used my Perk Points carefully, I not only became less squishy, but started having more fun. Power Armour isn't necessary, but you might enjoy it. 
---
I'm only Level 31, currently, so if you're a higher level than me, then I guess my advice was useless.
---
I'd pay 3000 atoms in the atomic shop for that
---
I still have my faceless photo from the beta, lol

Leaving a note is an example of an interaction container, the default item it could contain before you add anything item wise to go with it. My response to the inside the vault call for feedback covers new container functionality and ways they could be built or portable for greater player impact on the other players. My /u is always open. 
---
How is it not a part of the game when it's clearly a major part of the game. 
---
I hope so too.
---
If you find out it's still bugged try to write a ticket to Bethesda so they know this problem exists so they can fix it. It's worth a try and only costs about 5 minutes :D
---
Im on the way. Wait up!
---
Good luck.

Have you tried Better Business Bureau? I had to contact them when my card was being charged when I canceled several months when I played ESO.

It's a rare encounter by that station. He sells you two random outfits out of a large pool, some of which are exclusive only to him, and two unique plans for cuckoo clocks that you can't find anywhere else

Better question is: can we change the photo used during the character select screen. I used a preset because I wanted to get the game going right then but now I've made my character look more like me

I could have sworn you could so I signed in to check. you are right. I must have just assumed you could since vendors sell screw in bulk.

also I had a guy with a wanted level run to my camp and start destroying it so i got a bounty. thanks for that. first time I had someone attack my camp. it was interesting XD.
---
How much do you want for the helmet? I'm not sure what to offer, or what its stats are
---
One third of the guns in the game need damage boosts to compensate for the ammo and another one third needs more more durability + ammo to compensate for the damage.

Nope, the PVP gives everyone a chance to get the plans etc.  (I leave my extractors unlocked)

Andddd literally in the time I made this post less than 30 min ago and now the game froze in a fight with 2 scorched and I had to restart the game.  
---
So some of the things I‚Äôve kept in my stash box are named items, I suppose if I‚Äôm not using it and it‚Äôs not quest related I need to ditch it.  I think I always show up to the vendor, and sell all the weapons I‚Äôve been carrying.  And then the vendors out of money so I‚Äôve never even got to the point of selling bulk items.  Also I bulked some things a while ago and went to try and sell them and the menu didn‚Äôt even show it as an option.  Are there only certain bulk junk you can sell?
---
Also I chose 5 regen AP faster cards, but it will only allow me to attach a max of 1 set of 3 in my perk stack.  Is this some temporary level limitation or does the game let you choose perk cards that you actually can‚Äôt apply, and I completely wasted 2 of my perk card picks? If there‚Äôs a max to be applied, they should gray out that card or remove it from the choices. 
---
Some materials sell for less than 1 cap per piece. In order to sell those they have to be bulked.
---
I think this could be good. Especially getting rid of showing up on the map and not having legendaries. Would allow you to sneak and require skill

---
From what I've learned (by modding FO4) is that the percentage always calculates with the base number. So if you stack up the anti armor they'll be added up. 
---
50% + 12% + 6% = 68% overall armor penetration.
---
Don't know if the armor penetration can exceed 100% though, never tested it myself.
---
so you're the one that killed me

---
If you really picked up a dupers spoils, you wouldn't be able to sell it all since it would be thousands of caps worth of stuff. 
---
Most likely you just picked up a bag of junk legendaries, nothing wrong with that. One high level players junk is a low level's free caps.

I have been playing since beta, and have yet to have issues until two nights ago. I‚Äôve legit not been able to get past a loading screen in two days. It just loads and says ‚ÄúServers not responding, controls are temporarily disabled.‚ÄùIt also deleted all of my photos. I uninstalled and I‚Äôm trading it in for something that actually works. 
---
Yeah man I tell them the mats up front so it‚Äôs no secret. I had no idea what to ask for price on my first sale and the trade automatically places it there at 2400, I told the fella the number and he said that was fine, he even bought 2 from me. We chatted and hung out a while and we both also agreed the price seemed high. Still, I need caps so I continued selling a couple more times that way and catching no resistance from bartering types, but I did hear those guys state the cap amount was a struggle, and so that‚Äôs when I decided to lower the price to 2k. I‚Äôve had zero complaints from buyers, only thank you‚Äôs and friend requests for return business.

It's a cosmetic item, there are no stats.

None have released nearly as poorly as 76, not even close. The minor bugs and annoyances in 7 6 are the major issues of past games

Ok, you're telling me that my PC with 32GB ram, GTX 1070 with 8gb ram and an AMD FX 6300 = a potato PC?

And I am the troll?

Second I never said i was building a homebrew xbox. I was comparing the specs of a homebrew to that of an xbox 1x. To basically say that, if that machine could theoretically run it the same as a console then my computer could be expected to preform similar if not better. Now if you actually went to the links and comprehended what i was typing you could come to the conculsion that what they would use in a homebrew for the cpu was the amd 8300 COMPARED TO MY 6300 its only Marginally better.
---
Furthermore, the gameplay i have experienced is  ‚â• to what i have seen of videos testing FPS on PS4/PS4 Pro/xbox 1/xbox 1x. Also after further testing, by putting the pc into selective startup (per bethesda ticket) and swapping out my power armor suit with Targeting HUD, I can get a solid 29-40pfs when "taxing" events such as the SBQ.
---
But again, thanks for you input.
---
Thanks! I'll have to check it out. Appreciate you, dude
---
Yeah, I have a melee and single shot rifle build, so I‚Äôm not too unhappy with all the melee weapons. I just wish  i could get any type of fun with some effects.
---
Maybe they'll release an alien DLC that turns the alien blaster from worthless garbage to just bad
---
Are you on Xbox? I have 3,000 and will sell or trade for cheap or 5.56 rounds.
---
TYVM!
---
Free caps for you then, I suppose. 
---
No the super mutant trader in 76
---
And other things that annoy me- this stupid fucking scorched beast that keeps showing up just being a pain in the ass you repeatedly kill and there‚Äôs literally no reward.  Search scorchbeast- nothing.  #fffffff
---
Also Ive ran into several situations where the game doesn‚Äôt register shot damage.  I have clips of me point blank shooting things repeatedly and they take no damage.  This seems to happen with more mobile enemies- cave crickets flying enemies etc.  
---
Damn that sucks. I managed to get it like the 3rd time I tried that method, tried it less than 10 time since and havent gotten it either.

It‚Äôs been two days since I‚Äôve been able to even get past the load screens, and I actually liked this game until now. It deleted all of my photos too. I‚Äôve uninstalled it and I‚Äôm moving on.

was just pointing out he was not in the process of duping.  you guys need to calm
---
I hope I find a copy of this game for like 10 bucks sometime just so I can see wtf is up with it
---
I don't lock anything either, if either there were more workshops and some were marked community so anyone could build like they owned it or you could opt to own as pacifist and it would enable anyone to either take the workshop if they want it for PvP or to use it without taking it. 
---
Wouldn't it be smarter to have more options than own for PvP or don't use it at all?
---
lol no we tested it with each other not a random i don't do pvp
---
I agree. They wanted it to be endgame armor but it really falls flat as level 50 is definently not end game for many players. Plus while ultracite is not hard to aquire with some knowledge, it is for many casuals and it makes it seem hard to repair and not worth it. Even with the knowledge this is true as X-01 is very similar with more consistent mod spawns and lower repair costs
---
What do you keep in your stash.  I prob am storing the wrong stuff I‚Äôm only level 30 so I‚Äôm still figuring it out. 
---
I keep having to jump servers to get out of my power armor.

Theres a different responder bot that the trader that can spawn there (random encounter), he usually rambles on about morgantown airport has fallen

I'm guessing you're on PC? Seems like that's who's suffered the most bug wise.. I've played with hundreds of people on PS4 and we all get more or less the same experience.. most are generally happy with the way it plays. I ask because of all the negativity I've seen..
---
You say something like there's people defending Bethesda as Fanboys, but I haven't seen that at all. I think some may appear that way on here, but that's because we have to defend the game against people who seem like they haven't even played it.
---
I don't disagree with anything you've really said except when it comes to my different experience- pretty sure that's just a console versus PC issue. I also have hope for the game to become something better over time, I just think the more they listen to the players the more this might become like every other multiplayer game I don't like.. so I'm keeping my optimism grounded.
---
Oh. Well Thank you, that's really thoughtful. Sorry I was apprehensive at first. You can never tell these days.

The topic was done to death on release but was about the in-game music. Basically nobody is going to listen to my station - the same songs in a different order.

Your suggestion (playing your own other music) is on very dodgy copyright grounds. You're essentially broadcasting at that point and being real radio station.

Aren't you the lucky one... Griefers are known to do things like this. Someone posted this very thing not even a week ago. Same deal random invites and then get your camp decimated. The only difference is that in the other post the griefers wanted to gain a high bounty to allow friends to collect (or something similar).

Personally, I've had my base leveled a few times. Every single time it has been someone with a TSE. If you haven't encountered this yet, don't worry you will. It's only going to get worse if they don't balance as people get bored and OP from time played.

Great post! Learned a lot
---
Are dupers back?

Pretty sure it will already remove player visibility on the map. I could agree with the legendaries but not mutations. It's a gameplay aspect and is actually in the lore
---
I am, but I guess I don‚Äôt stop at camp before I leave every area.  I will spend several hours playing before I go to camp.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm as mad at losing my loot because of what‚Äôs lost per se, but the fact I‚Äôm losing anything at all because the games broke.  It‚Äôs not like ‚Äúoh shit there goes all my glass shards!‚Äù  It‚Äôs just more of an annoyance that it‚Äôs happening at all.

Np! Happy hunting!
---
Wish I could buy the stone/brick plans in the Atom shop.
---
same i love how well the mire looks
---
This is the point where you assess what you have an decide if you _Really_ want to be able to actually play the game.
---
 I understand people don't have to finish capping the workshop station to initiate the encounter, but doesn't the Miscellaneous quest pop a notify that someone is trying to contest the workshop?
---
Got it for 250. The plans to make this item are around 1k.
---
There's a thread about TOWNS out there. Bethesda replied. 
---
I suggested changing the camp area from a circle to a square, and allowing camps to snap together like floor pieces.
---
I always try to rebuild america by claiming all the workshops and building them up.
---
Ok I sent you a message on Xbox lol be on that time!
---
I feel ya. Its not perfect, there are plenty of things I wish were better or different or would be fixed, but damn have I been enjoying exploring the world. Definitely the most interesting locations to explore across the the 3d fallout games IMO. 
---
I already sold the marine plans and every plan/ recipe I‚Äôm selling 50 caps 
---
If i remember rightly, it is in the "modern couches" plan. i forget where it is sold. I want to say whitesprings since that is where "resort couches" plan (ie the fancy red couch) is sold.
---
I am starting to notice this myself at the benderbots. Personally I don‚Äôt player trade too often, it‚Äôs more if something comes up when chatting with random strangers and I offer to help. Glad to absorb this info though nonetheless.
---
‚ÄúGuns have a high amount of different customization options...‚Äù
---
Waves LMG around*
---
Hurls 50 cal across the room*
---
Jumps up and down on top of a pile of black powder guns in the corner*
---
I will try in whitesprings, i hope is there tnx!
---
The best. I‚Äôll have to stop by. 
---
Isn't that what a Wendigo is SUPPOSED to be? I always thought Wendigos and Skinwalkers were interchangeable. 
---
You pretty much described every innawoods I've read.
---
Your best bet would be a google search, at this rate. I'm a console peasant, personally, so I can't help much. But if you want a detailed explanation on how to delete it, I doubt Reddit is gonna help much.
---
Lol I was the one who bought them 
---
googled it and fallout wiki has it as "Sold by Brotherhood of Steel vendor bot Phoenix at Watoga Shopping Plaza."
---
I have gone to and killed the queen 3 times in the past like week with no issue on PC, maybe the loot took a couple extra seconds to load. I am sure I will get down voted for sharing my experience as is usual here but I guess I am just lucky or something and people don't like that.
---
Thx i needed the plans so i could get the full set
---
LolüòÇ oh couldn‚Äôt tell my bad haha
---
Had someone follow me around a server, shooting me unprovoked and messaging me relentlessly even though I wouldn't engage. It felt pretty good to watch my friends destroy his C.A.M.P. and collect their bounties before he could fast travel and shoot them. He wasn't role playing, he was just a teenage dickweed.
---
any scrap you have more than 200-300 of, you should start bulking at the tinker's bench, and selling the bulk to vendors, that should net you some caps and some stash space. You can also go to Billings Homestead (a workshop, West from Charleston Station), and harvest the wheat to sell to vendors, with the green thumb perk you get over 200 razorgrain per harvest (about 3 mins work), and with the food weight reduction perk, one load weighs about 5lbs (50+ without it), so you can server hop a couple times and take care of getting all your daily vendor caps (1400 caps/day) easily. It does take a bit of playtime to unlock the right perks/find the right weapon/etc, but once you learn where things are and how they work it gets easier. 
---
For the death skull not showing on your local map, make sure you haven't turned off tracking the "retrieve your loot" quest in the quest journal. 
---
hope this helps, its a gallery of all plans with an image of what it unlocks

---
When you launch a nuke, post here. I've had the most success doing that, or joining one's posted here.
---
If you randomly nuke on a server most likely you'll get low levels. That just makes the fight harder, or impossible.
---
So as I said post here before you do a SBQ fight. Even if it's not your nuke, ask people to join if there is room on the server.
---
It's 24 people per server I believe. 
---
you're welcome. hope its there!
---
is there a messaging system on pc like on consoles?if there is and ur looking for more player trades i suggest messaging players between lvl30-50. players that are between these levels are almost always looking to buy mutations
---
That freakin‚Äô sucks. I‚Äôve been taking my time and putting off the SBQ fight solely because of the amount of posts I‚Äôve seen since launch with your same problems. I‚Äôve never done it and probably never will if they don‚Äôt fix it. I just don‚Äôt see the point in wasting my time on something that‚Äôs got a high chance to either cause my game to crash or give me garbage loot. I would really love to see more from them on this issue since it‚Äôs been around forever.
---
Thank you. The part that sucks is that the defenses we get for camps don't really help against TSE's MIRVS and Fat Mans. Especially combined with the camp destruction perk card whatever it's called. Only way to stop them is to be at your base when it starts 
---
Lotta griefers defending their griefing, here in the comments, huh?
---
I ran into this with some legendaries I had recently. I basically decided that if it was underleveled and I could get better ones, it doesn't make any sense to keep them. 
---
Oh yeah, you're right, someone beat me to it.
---
Also a very good idea but hard to implement because the camp disappears when logging out.
---
Embrace the overencumbered life. You can still carry up to 4x your carry weight before you can't walk. With deep pocketed armor you can still easily go up to 900 pounds, and with calibrated shocks on an excavator suit you can carry upwards of 1600.
---
Are you on xbox?
---
If you're talking about stacking staircases on top of one another using the Post method, removing the Post is what causes it to be Inaccessible. 
---
If you notice when moving your camp, your stored tab should have a blueprint of every level for your house. 
---
People are def using an exploit. I kill a scorchbeast in 1 shot. Every once in a while I bump into somebody who quite literally cannot be harmed. 
---
I've heard that spot works pretty well, I don't have the patience for all that though. Plus I don't really want to scrap a bunch of my camp to make room.
---
Maybe I'll try again if they ever increase the camp budget!
---
Like others say keep the mutations but ditch legendary effects. No players on map but team and friends. Perks alone are enough to create diverse play styles and still be as balanced as can be
---
I‚Äôll add you when I‚Äôm on tomorrow
---
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about but that is helpful!
---
Why not both? Its so limiting to have only friendly interactions with other players. It is a Bethesda game after all, where you can choose to be good OR evil...
---
It was! And wasteland justice prevailed, I got 3 vault suits and an apology haha. (Never updated it) 
---
If there is a spectrum of justice with anarchy vigilantism and imposed law being the poles I'm definitely on the anarchy side. Not because I'm for "grieving", but instead see in as a mechanic to inject self governance/defense, it's fun to me.
---
I'd say why not both but that's literally what's happening. There's two servers. We are literally getting both.
---
That's probably gonna shit the bed in the long run (as if this game needed an even bigger identity crisis) but it's happening.
---
So since there are no npcs do you think they will add aliens?? 
---
Thats sweet! 
---
Map, then menu, challenges
---
I would like to know if it can exceed 100%. I have 75% melee armor penetration and a 50% melee armor penetration melee weapon. And does having 100% mean that armor does not count at all?
---
sadly, dupers are the real Atom Shop of FO76. 
---
I wonder how this company will keep paying +400 salaries every month, after how the things worked with FO76...
---
On PS4, it seems time based. 
---
I've spent over 3k caps moving my Camp the last 2 weeks, and my base cost is always 40 caps. Placing my Camp and placing it again shortly after, increases the price to 160, for a total of 200 caps for 2 moves. 
---
After about 10 minutes have passed or a server hop, the cost goes back down to 40. 
---
That's where I found mine. The witch's hat, too!
---
After you sacrifice your most beloved co-op companion to the Wise One at Point Pleasant under the Harvest Moon whilst chanting The Litany of the Flame...
---
Hahaha no.
---
I have one
---
Something I always do to my Workshops are to build up Barricades around them in high stacks, cutting off access to them entirely, so that nobody can get to it.
---
I GOT WREKT 
---
I'm not sure you understand my post.  I essentially crash out of the game or get disconnected every time.  The one time that wasn't the case, it was just me and two others and we had no problem taking out the SBQ.  That leads me to believe it has something to do with the number of players in the area.    
---
I wouldn't have a problem at all if collectively we just couldn't kill her.  I'd just like the opportunity to try without crashing.
---
I think the most important thing to do is make sure you shout "Who killed the dinosaurs? The ice age!" whenever you use it.
---
I've been trying to fill that gap with FOnline games for what, 10 years now? I remember how devastating it felt when the original 2238 session was announced to be ending, but then a couple others came out from those ashes. A few of them are still even active to this day.
---
I was about to come here and make a Triple Triad reference.  One of the quintessential video game sidegames.  And most annoying.  That damn Queen...
---
I disagree. It's a very good game but Donkey Kong is a pretty great game.
---
Sounds like some grade AAA, farm raised, free range bitchin' right there.
---
No. Crafting puts it at 150% iirc. Fix it good allows you to repair to 200%.
---
Funk the Queen
---
The real enemy is RANDOM!
---
i drop some supplies including ammo at the overseer's chest in flatwoods regularly 
---
115 here and I haven‚Äôt either
---
Yeah, I‚Äôll probably start doing that
---
Ah, my apologies. I run into this every time I make my house, because I build it upward. I know exactly what triggers my problem, but I have enough caps that if I mess up my build, I can just start over. 
---
No down votes from me at least.  I'm just curious what the issue is for me then, or what we might NOT have in common that prevents you from having the same problems.  
---
very true. being perfectly honest, ill take looking cool over lore consistency any day. they could just hand wave it like ‚Äúoh its not NCR its just some riot gear with a trenchcoat‚Äù and im sure nobody would care
---
That would give me a woody.
---
You keep sayin' stuff like that, I'm gonna start thinkin' YOU'RE a Synth.
---
I would love to help but Im still on the quest line I switched characters 
---
I will probably switch to furious/explosive instead of 2shot/explosive for SBQ (using a .50 cal hmg)
---
While I do agree, and I do feel PvP has its place in this game, now is NOT the time.
---
PvP is a sensitive thing and currently there are far too many issues that need to be addressed.
---
That's why I mentioned having them snap together. If you can't build outside your square, then you wouldn't have to worry about requiring a friend to be logged in to access certain areas. Unless you, the players, designed it that way. 
---
Can't wait for a duck swim ring
---
I think I may have beat you. I got an Instigating The Dragon, which I think is 2x all damage, as opposed to a two-shot that just adds another round making it 5 shots? Or maybe they are equal in damage. Bought it off a vendor too!
---
Your welcomeüëçüèª
---
I had the same issue, I was trying to do it at whitesprings then I went to my camp and it worked then. There might have been a server kick but it happens so much i lose track of when it does or doesnt happen.
---
Get the pharma farma perk. I find a shitload of chems and sell them all besides stimpacks and a handful of radx/radaway.
---
I have a basic Xbox 1 and had no issues with the Queen other than everyone on the server failing to kill it because we all just goofed off shooting each other 
---
Oh god. I need this.
---
My account name is CapitanAcab (acronym). Freestates ‚ÄúAM I BEING DETAINED OFFICER‚Äù sovereign citizen type.
---
Would be perfect to excercise my 2nd amendment rights with on some statist responder scum.
---
I agree the first hours of the game were pretty fun but it got boring fast when you realise every quest usually has some mystery and you have to find someone who is either 90% of the time dead and just has a holotape (of which is a mechanic that gets boring fast) or there are an robot.
---
I loved there base in fallout 4 just wish they did more with them as a faction in the game. Someone has datamined the atom cat PA paintjobs so hopefully we will see them soon on the atom store.
---
For now rocking the hot rod paint job
---
I‚Äôm selling
---
Also me. I‚Äôll buy with caps lmao. 
---
Fair enough
---
Is it the spot where the crashed  satellite mission can happen?
---
I have the same sentiment. When blackisle was collapsing, a lawsuit came into play over the rights of an mmo fallout. I‚Äôve been waiting to see those results. Now the future is here and it‚Äôs not perfect but excellent on so many levels.
---
And here‚Äôs me looking at the Atom Shop and telling myself I HAVE to buy the princess bed. (I did and I don‚Äôt regret it).
---
It's 24 people on a server. It's already a split playerbase.
---
What they need, is to ask themselves what the intended purpose of weapon degradation is. Is it a resource sink? You need a better resource sink in your resource collection game, than frustration induced by yanking gear away from players. Is it to make things feel worn out and old? Fine; you can do that by DRASTICALLY increasing the time it takes to wear out guns, because we have only been in this wasteland for 3 months, so there is no reason a machined gun should break 16 times in the course of that time span. 
---
Right now, degradation serves no real purpose than to make us need resources. The trouble is, in order to get them, we have to use those weapons. Which degrade. So...why would our character not sit his ass at his base, farm, hunt very occasionally and only use his weapons when enemies come to him? This whole situation is FUBAR and needs a rethink STAT.
---
Sorry, you're right I did misunderstanding it.
---
Luckily, for me at least, the crashing stopped. As long as I get there before the nuke dropped. If I log in after it dropped I can't even move.
---
At the fight though if there is a mostly full server, and everyone is using a TSE I lag like crazy. Unfortunately everyone is using TSE now so it's a lag fest. So far I haven't disconnect as much during the SBQ fights. I still crash randomly a lot though. 
---
Speak for yourself. Pvp is fun as hell.
---
Since my last message the lever sold
---
1. Place CAMP in forest region where newer players are apt to find it, just off a road or something.  
---
2. Lock your door with a "0" level lock
---
3. Wait for new players to learn you become wanted from looking to pick a lock
---
4. Offer to "help" new player by clearing their bounty
---
Doing this I got thanked by nearly all 20 of the people I killed for the achievement.
---
T60 plans you can get from the event in cranberry bog distant thunder/treasure maps, T51b plans you can get from treasure maps.
---
I dont think there is T45 and raider plans yet, at least i havent found any (470 hrs playtime)
---
Dude, over 50% of the playerbase are duper mules now. If you have a TSE you traded to get, you have a dupe. Bethesda is 100% not gonna come after this guy, or any of us that are holding a duped gun. 
---
I got worse with first patch, disconnects.
---
Better with second set of patches.  Like much better actually.
---
But the last one is causing blue screens now.  PSPro
---
Sure it is. On engines that dont exhibit constant stutter, feature an auto aimbot mechanic and have lousy feeling weapons with no punch that arent fun to fire. But inserting guns into an RPG has turned out janky enough in 2019. Now you want to add skill based, twitch speed PVP?
---
Good luck with that. IT will be dead in a month when the players go back to survival game PVP in actual stable, modern games.
---
sorry for sounding rude but what have you been doing in those 470 hrs? whitespring? ive already found a couple peices of t45 and raider plans
---
Yes others can clear them out before you do, it is after all a multiplayer game. I would suggest getting the pharma farmer perk in luck, you will never run out of stims or rad away
---
My first thought was "they'll never do this because it would let people say awful things to other players" and then I remembered we have neon signs and small letter sets that allow the same thing but more public. 
---
Then I also remembered that time during the beta when I had to listen to a dude rant to his roommate about "damn trannies" over an open mic. 
---
So yeah, notes would be lovely. I want to be able to leave a personal note in gift bags instead of just leaving a propaganda flyer like I usually do. 
---
There is a reason this Reddit flair exists ^. People will ROLE play everything and I'm glad people do you may not like pvp and that's fine but fallout just idnt for you then, as all a raider from fallout 76 is a raider with a player behind it from fallout 4.
---
I say F.U. Bethesda
---
I got some t45 plans tonight. 
---
I‚Äôve seen raider addons but no base plans yet. 
---
Wow really fascinating lore :) I guess that is their intention but I would prefer if we could fire off 2-3k rounds before it breaks. 
---
What an ass
---
I've got a ryzen 2600x and gtx 1070 and game is on an nvme drive. My internet is straight shit so I doubt that's related.
---
That would mean that past level 50, pvp would almost absolutely everything, im sure people are going to want to do more than just pvp there, if there is no legendary farming then thats dumb because then there is nothing to do really beside shooting each other and gather resources preparing to shoot each other. Its suppose to be a more hardcore survival game mode where pvp resticitions are turned off and deaths come with greater penalties, not a pvp only mode. If they force us to make a new character, legendary farming wouldnt be very easy in this mode because there is no whitesprings nukes to farm super hard because your gonna be afraid that someone is going to shoot you there, messing up your farm
---
hunting for plans/legendary farming, its probably just my bad RNG took me 2 weeks of swapping servers just to get the plans for the bos officer uniform.
---
Why has there been 3 posts about Stalker's in the last two hours? It's the same reason Junkie's and Nocturnal is a thing, cruddy rolls exist to make the good rolls amazing and the mediocre rolls seem okay. There are melee sneak builds, maybe they want the 100%. Guns don't really need Stalker's anyway, don't make it seem like it's a good gun roll ha
---
Yeh, about those... why?
---
This exact thing happened to me, twice in one day. I fixed everything one by one and when I was finally done, someone else came around, shot me in the back and proceeded to destroy my house.
---
Today I learned...... lol
---
Should have walked more forward so she would have killed herself on her own two shot explosive as well and then taken all the duped junk too. Make sure to dump this somewhere nobody will find it.
---
You do when your melee is broken....
---
The bashing one makes no sense. But I think the stalker one goes kind of well with sneak sniper vats build?
---
Never noticed that  until now. I can't unsee it now and its going to bug me for a long time. 
---
Lightbulbs do the same 
---
The crashing is ridiculous. Every single time I run a silo it‚Äôs a 50% chance to crash. Launching a nuke and getting to the nuke zone is a 100% chance to crash. I even crashed four times yesterday just building my frickin house. No other game - and I‚Äôve been playing since Nintendo first came out - punishes you this bad for simply trying to play it.
---
The flatwoods monster is definantyl a zetan but seems to have a darker skin tone and surgically modified I personally believe it's a scout
---
Dude if you don't like it then don't play it. If you want to crap on the game then go over to r/fallout and you'll find many friends. Beyond that just shut up. Stop trying to ruin the fun for everyone else just because you don't like it.
---
exactly why i keep my house on the edge of the map far away from fast travel points, I'll see them coming and just switch servers.
---
no worries! you on xbox one?
---
Still pretentious, have a good day sir :)
---
I hope you will grow up one day
---
That's gonna taste like shit.
---
The thing is that it is not just some cruddy roll, a stalker‚Äôs effect on a melee weapon is literally the same as picking up a non-legendary because it has no effect on the weapon, nocturnal and junkies can at least do something
---
Ah, well, you see Bashing damage on a ranged weapon works best with a bayonet, but not in the way you think. You stick the weapon muzzle down in the ground and run your face into it to TRY and understand the logic by forcing it into the cranial cavity.  Likewise, the stalkers effect should be combined with Industrial Size Shortening. Slather that on the weapon hand, equip weapon and fling the ever-loving snot out of it at mach oh-my-god speeds.  100% headshot out to 100m with boxing glove... deathclaw gauntlets are band from professional darts for this exact reason.
---
If you‚Äôre Xbox I got a couple loose flux I can give you.
---
I was really excited to realise I'd unlocked the candles since they're in the weirdly named "antique lights" plan and then I noticed they were super bright and I was disappointed. 
---
In Fallout 4, I always had candlelight in my builds for bedrooms since it's nice soft light and doubles as a table decoration. 
---
If you move the camp and then replace it from the stored tab, everything will fix itself.
---
Make it permanent. Like your erectile dysfunction. HEYOOOOO!!! I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. That was uncalled for. I'm projecting. 
---
Never spam it always put them in slowly
---
An in game llama would actually be nice tbh
---
Speaking of Anthem, why can't Bethesda be as open as the Anthem devs are? The Anthem devs are super open reguarding how things went in their demo sessions, while here we're struggling in getting anything out of Bethesda.
---
I don't want to be prejudice against any specific group but i do think it's a new trend, probably because games in general have become more mainstream and as a result have become easier than in the past.
---
Actually it does do something, +5% accuracy at 50% AP cost. This is a bad deal, just like Nocturnal's or Junkie's is a bad deal. With Nocturnal the day/night cycle isn't even equal or the same length consistently. This makes it worse then a regular non-legendary most of the time
---
He is talking about stalker‚Äôs on melee, not on ranged, he saying that it makes no sence that you can obtain stalker‚Äôs on melee
---
I've got a Ryzen/Nvidia combo with nvme as well.  My spec is a little different with the 2700x and rtx 2080.  But my internet is also hot garbage.  Are you sure you're not my evil doppelganger?
---
Heavy is wish making fairy. Make wish!
---
Lol, okay he was just being a dick then and that was the first thing that came into his head when you caught him
---
Any pics?
---
I hated that animated movie it was so creepy
---
Was this meant for me?
---
Cause I have a Hardline stance about expoits and dupers, and it's ban the fuck out of them.
---
If this was in regards to "I did it", that was in reference to Diablo 2 when I was a teen, and arguing over whether that disqualifies me from now being against it, 10+ years later.
---
I ended up making a base off one platform.
---
While this does work. I understand people build large and impressive bases that require a difficult and elaborate setup that can‚Äôt be simply placed down. 
---
What if it's both? *x-files theme*
---
Man, either way it seems that I'm a bit alone in my problems here.  I wonder what the deal is?
---
How do you figure out where their camp is?
---
Because you don‚Äôt get to turn on passive mode for other players.
---
True, it‚Äôs all in how you build. I‚Äôve found if I stay away from that crazy staircase I rarely have issues moving it.
---
The stash limit is fine. 
---
Yea I am about half way through officer on deck
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
If your on pc, send me a message. I can join your server and kill anyone.
---
What a coincidence lol. Maybe try turning rtx off.
---
There will always be assholes who try to justify being ass holes. They are not raiders, they are assholes who play online games and grief others because life has done the same thing to them in the real world. If Bethesda didn't code you, hire you and doesn't pay you, your not part of the game you are just an asshole. Props to the op!
---
Where?
---
Only thing I can think of is a bug that involved having the Herd Mentality mutation where it prevented you from sharing Rank 3 cards (in my case it would share it as long as I stood still, and stopped whenever I moved, lol).  
---
I've seen some posts saying it was fixed, but I still find it to usually not work.  
---
You can buy it form a vender I got mine from a vender in the Savage divide
---
Yeah I think that's a thing. I also think it used to be bugged but it got ninja fixed a few patches ago.
---
Very nice.  Here's one I took on the edge of Whitespring as it got nuked. [Ready to smack some ghouls](https://imgur.com/ZmzHNX4)
---
I see your "what" and raise you my "why"
---
I feel the same way.
---
Ah yeah, and then you could just get rich of off bulking steel and wood. 
---
Well then bulking needs to reduce the weight of all mats. Makes sense if you're using plastic to do it. 
---
Find me tomorrow. I'm GT: theonlycuregirl I'll be your bodyguard or make you new weapons/armor
---
Maybe it‚Äôd be farmable in CAMP?
---
Or maybe it‚Äôd be a rare weekly spawn in dangerous areas of the map that aren‚Äôt nuke central?
---
Would be cool to have to go hunting for them‚Ä¶ like the creepy spy vendor guy in Destiny/2. 
---
Why you carrying power armor parts in your inventory?
---
What do you mean adds 5% accuracy? When you use a melee in vats, its either 95 or 0, even with stalker‚Äôs effect, it is still 95 or 0, 95 is the highest number that vats will display, stalkers does nothing on melee, it might even be worse than a non-legendary melee depending on if it makes you use up those extra 50% action points, nocturnal is horrible most of the time but can at least be decent if you use it at a specific time in the night and junkies can be decent if you are running around with addictions
---
The blue metal door with offset vertical glass slats?
---
add me! ingloriouspulp 
---
Unyielding combat armor with BoS and deep pockets. Make sure you got good sneaks and all your defensive perks. You might have to throw away your perks for carry weight.
---
I didn't think anyone could miss that prompt, but someone should definitely tell OP.
---
True, any spacesuit is designed to maintain optimal environmental conditions. 
---
I like to play as a raider, if I come across another player. I usually demand food or water, if they don't have a MIC I just move on. No swearing though
---
Killed 4 beasts before i came here. Thanks man
---
It's far less immersion breaking than mics, and they're trying to promote player-to-player interaction, so this seems like a logical answer. 
---
Also less intrusive than neon lettering. 
---
Id just love the ability to create food/drink that wont spoil. The only one that doesnt spoil now is Brain Bombs and im sitting on 20 for some reason.
---
Ive never known a bottle of tea to go off sitting in a bottle for a few days.
---
I think the event should just put 100 cans into a container afterwards, for anyone to take.  If you want free food, you at least have to go pick it up.
---
I can't believe people are still salty about this.  Just go sleep for 20 seconds or whatever and get the exp bonus.  Pick some cranberries and cook.  Nobody deserves to have free food teleported into their inventory daily.
---
I would like to suggest a more noticable alert if your base if under attack. Currently it's easier to miss than see when someone attacks if you are not home.
---
Personally I can't see the system being overloaded by something like this: it's already keeping track of dozens, if not hundreds, of fluid modifiers for each player "live". You can already change loadouts at any point (even during combat... if you can tank the incoming attacks while doing so). Chems, armor, damage and protection due to condition, resistances, etc. Many perks and legendary effects activate based on time of day, HP or RAD levels, etc. - these kind of contextual modifiers are Fallout bread-and-butter.
---
The gambit system was inspirational, but is significantly more complex than the Fallout system I'd envision would be. Basically, the system would as "heavy" as you want it to be. This would be completely controllable in the definition of the available conditions. Fewer, simpler conditions result in fewer, simpler perk changes. More, more detailed conditions result in more, more dramatic perk changes.
---
For example, most of the conditions I originally listed would be essentially quality-of-life improvements that would only trigger when players are *already* swapping cards. The framework *could* support in-combat, detailed conditions like weapon swaps, but wouldn't *need* to do so to be (extremely) useful.
---
There's also a case to be made that if you make the conditions *too* detailed then you might has well simply revert to the "all perks, always on" system of Fallout 4. I think that the balance here would be to improve quality-of-life and immersion, but be less useful (or flat-out useless) in live combat.
---
That's one of the main things I like about the idea: it can scale easily (with the introduction or refinement of conditions) to support as many or as few use cases as you like. It could be introduced support only "Lock Picking" and "Using a Terminal", then expanded later to include workbenches, camp crafting, etc.
---
I agree tho' - this is all academic. With the state of things as they are I wouldn't expect to see any like this... ever. The game's budget is almost definitely shot trying to keep up with the break-fixes, much less the promised additional content. Ah well - maybe in "Fallout '77".  ;\^)
---
My weapon/loadout is ussualy a furious combat knife with full paint splat metal and a pirate hat plus the smiley doctors mask 
---
You are absolutely clueless.
---
I beg you, go to a computer subreddit like bapc and create a thread posting your computer specs and ask them if your computer is good enough for fo76. Please link me your thread so I can laugh at you as you try and tell everyone they are wrong about your cpu. Make sure to tell them you feel it's as good as an Xbox.
---
You won't do it though, because you're a troll.
---
Why would it say adds 100% accuracy but only show 95%? That doesn't make much sense they should change the description
---
Fort Defiance usually has plenty of Military ammo bags for ballistic fiber
---
i guess we agreed and didnt realise?
---
This was funnier than it should be. 
---
And she's dead. 
---
Yeah, and that's why most people want it increased, because it's fine.
---
People can go join the events if they want to participate and get stuff.  I know FO76 has a bunch of white knights who want to aggressively "help" people, but come on.
---
 When your whole life flashes before your eyes, how much of it do you want to not have ray tracing?
---
Why would I ever turn off rtx, even if I could?!  
---
/s
---
I agree. 
---
Why does the perfectly viable job of Raiding mean you have to maintain some defined aesthetic (Very UnRaiderly like, that conformity), and be in a gang
---
Damn. I don‚Äôt have half the build budget you do. 
---
updated my post
---
So I hear, nobody has ever killed me or done any noticeable damage.  So I have to file this under the same heading as the trade-stealing "bug" that everyone like you swore was real but was just made up.
---
You're thinking of Raiders as a faction.
---
Other people can perform the "job" of Raiding. It's essentially just taking what you want, killing people, making people afraid. 
---
It's rather effective obviously, as Raiders are fucking everywhere in Fallout.
---
Even without it.  I jump, shoot at the right angle, and take no damage.
---
Nowhere near to the point 76 takes it though. Fallout is no longer a satirical, dark, gritty, post-apocalyptic RPG. It‚Äôs a bright, colorful, happy dystopian RPG.
---
Downvoted!? You humorless savages.
---
All stash boxes are linked, and there's one in each train station and each Red Rocket. You're rarely far away from one or the other.
---
I'm not sure what's up with your save points. I've never lost any noticeable progress except in missions, and I've disconnected enough times.
---
Nice build, I love the balcony area. Sounds like you're right near a fissure? I can hear a scorchbitch going crazy in the background. 
---
TL;DR :
---
I don't like it when other kids kick over my sand castle. 
---
what was your armor loadout ? my notification said you commented something about it but i can‚Äôt find it 
---
You know how I know you are bad at your job?  Because a good toaster wouldn‚Äôt burn people like that. 
---
You probably shouldn't try doing that at a train station
---
The stalker‚Äôs effect only actually works on ranged, where the accuracy is from 0 to 95 and not only 0 and 95, on a ranged weapon, that 42 accuracy is turning into 84, on melee weapons, stalker‚Äôs is making that 95 into ... 95, which leads the point of the post, why can you even get stalker‚Äôs on a melee?
---
I bought my jet pack plans from Phoenix.
---
Yes. Let's fix what's not broken. 
---
Even if it's a mechanic that is thematically accurate....because some players just want more.
---
What do you play on? 
---
Its near Fort Defiance. Very rarely the angry bat bothers my camp its more like molerats but i have a turret that usually does it job amd takes am out.
---
I sent you a pm but it's all unyielding with one piece chameleon. 
---
Well pvp is part of the game so quit bitching and git gud. 
---
And thanks for the compliment üòä
---
Right I understand about ranged, but if VATS only goes up to 95% shown, why would they say 100% in the description? Does it guarantee it to not miss?
---
this is freaking awesome! great work!
---
Mierlurks
---
It crashed on me after I created my character but haven't left the vault yet. I had to recreate my character and I did it differently and gave him a different name and ever since the game randomly displays one or the other if the character's ID cards when in the loading screen. It's weird.
---
"Some" implies that it's a minority.
---
No other game in the franchise, at least in the four recent games, has limited how much can be stored in a box. It clearly has issues that the majority of people perceive to exist, and said majority wants those issues fixed.
---
100% agree.
---
  I do believe that griefing is part of the game and adds a layer of realism to the game. So, if you've came by all 100-200 of your levels honestly then so be it, grief your ass off. If you've never duped or cheated in any way then you've earned the right to "role play" as a raider if you want. The problem is 95% of you haven't and you're just being a bunch of pricks.
---
  PVP servers will do nothing to fix this either. These players dont want a fair fight. They always attack in pairs and always someone half their level.
---
  That being said, for the few dicks that I have ran into I've ran into far more 100+ guys that have been cool and happy to help.
---
Other players 
---
Did you click ignore? Cos I'm pretty sure that effectively blocks him. And then you wouldn't see him I don't think? Altho that I could be mistaken. 
---
There's also a spot near the Creamery, just south of it on the top of the hill. Cats, rabbits, chickens, foxes, squirrels, frogs, and radstag spawn there.
---
If you're into legendary gear farming, Whitesprings is your spot.  You do have to have an explosive weapon or automatic tesla rifle to tag enemies before someone massacres them.  Some people don't like to share.
---
We need a Nuka Cola Workshop and a Distillery Workshop. There are perks for both. 
---
I'm pretty sure dataminers discovered that they were originally in the game, but cut for whatever reasons. Hopefully it comes back in later content updates. 
---
Yep
---
I do And I‚Äôm now done with officer on deck!
---
Hm, how exactly do you mean? I do use the filter that only shows plans for things you can actually build pretty often, but I didn't notice it at first... 
---
 scorched enemies do have a level of armour depending on creature type  
---
Where did u bought the blue blanket couch?
---
Are you on ps4 or xbox
---
i just got a couple of recipes for mutations if ur interested. Marsupial 4k and speed demon 3k.
---
I wonder if his friends think that you're an idiot too? Hrmm
---
The crops and requirements of stabilized flux to repair my rad shower are very annoying.  This house destruction phenomenon that a lot of players do, either to raise their bounty or just to be a jerk, is really irritating.
---
Right, a ticket system. Not a forum... omg....
---
It's in the "modern couches" plan, you can find it at quite a few different vendors. I got mine from Whitesprings. 
---
It's multiplicative, or to put it another way, each reduction is applied individually. For example if you 75% pen from Incisor and 50% from an AA legendary, the total reduction is 87.5%.
---
Because the damage calculation is based on the ratio between damage and armor, anti-armor effects work out as a flat damage bonus regardless of whether you have other armor penetration (eg. 29% damage for 50% armor pen). However, there is a maximum damage to armor ratio after which there's no additional effect. I'm not sure what that ratio is yet.
---
How about no. Why TF would you encourage microtransactions
---
...Did you miss the part where raiders blew up the dam at Charleston and then proceeded to murder everyone still living in the city that survived the flood?
---
I've had griefers destroy my camp when it wasn't near anything &amp; every time it was for no apparent reason.   
---
It hasn't bothered me too much because I've played up to lvl 41 now and it's only happened a few times in all those play hours. But it's still annoying cuz I'm a big crafter so my camps are often built onto existing structures &amp; houses vs standalone so when that happens I typically ditch the previous location entirely.  
---
At the same time, Bethesda designed a perk specifically for doing additional damage to other players' camps, so there's only so much I can blame people who think that's funny for using the game as they designed it. 
---
People will love you if you use it against the scorch beast qween.
---
I found this too! I think it was near Mountainside Bed and Breakfast?
---
Yeah, I loved it.  You were literally FEEDING THE PEOPLE :)
---
Now we get Corpse Flower crap.  I'd like that to stop please :(
---
Yes please.
---
Repair all should also repair non-destroyed items up to their FULL health bars.  My OCD begs you please :)
---
People role play things they are not all the time, don't project on the player for something they did in character. It's like saying actors are the characters they are playing on screen, think about it..
---
It doesnt really guarentee anything, but personally, i never see myself miss when it shows 95 anyway unless there is lag, and the description actually says +100% which just means double accuracy but still wont let vats pass 95
---
Site Bravo keeps bugging out on the pipe area. Either the quest won't account for all the repaired pipes, or it just crashes. Bethesda please.
---
Keen to know the answer to this too!
---
I see your point, what if survival mode was an option temporarily?  Like enabling this would keep you on a server that had no legendaries until you beat the main story then you'd leave and rejoin with the rest of the players and continue the end game by farming legendaries. My main problem with legendaries is that they make the main storyline too easy. 
---
I just want equippable mole miner gear
---
Not that I am familiar with, but wow I had no idea that existed. I would love that for when I am searching for items. 
---
ü§òüèø
---
Noticed today I am having that issue myself. 
---
I do too :)
---
For all it's flaws, it's more fun to play Fallout with real live PEOPLE.
---
Had someone come by today and ask me and someone I was trading with for whatever plastic we could spare.  We sent him on his way with 100-200 free plastic.
---
I was also visiting a player owned store.  He didn't have anything I needed, but he bought a few serums from me.  Then one random guy asked if I could mod T60 jetpacks.  I said yes, looked at his inventory, and we settled on one of his plans to trade for a T60 jetpack.  He got what he wanted, I got what I wanted, everyone walked away happy.
---
That doesn't happen in normal Fallout :)
---
God forbid we want shit that looks cool as opposed to fruit hats and princess beds
---
I saw that, too.  I believe it's near the mountainside bed and breakfast?
---
The problem here is not DPS. The way armor and damage reduction works in this game it reduces your damage by percentile.
---
Which is why the minigun, submachine gun, LMG, gatling laser and other high ROF guns don't do diddly squat for damage against anything with even a hint of DT.
---
This leave a whole class of weapons and playstyles pigeonholed into obscurity. Min/max systems are fine in single player games. FO76 isn't and players shouldn't be painted into a corner because the way the game is engineered. 
---
It's where Hancock sends you for your first quest in FO4.
---
check the market forum. This is not the appropriate place for this.
---
I'm only lvl 41 but I've found a few of the quests humorous so far... exa: Rose, parts of Mistress of Mystery.   
---
But most of the humor I've experienced in the game has come from interactions with other players, which I think is what they intended. They've typically been wordless interactions, too, cuz I usually don't have a mic.  
---
Nope, you don't get to paint my post as derisive just to defend your own poor attitude. I didn't speak unkindly of anyone.
---
Either it dosent matter. But can we wait till tomorrow morning. 
---
Ammo, cryo cells are pretty cheap if you know where to look for the right materials.
---
It's just lead crystal and steel. The most prohibitive is the steel, the rest can be super easily farmed at one location.
---
 lucky hole mine, yes, I know, everyone always recommends it, but it's true.
---
Assuming you have 400 lead ore, and 300 crystal ore, which isn't hard with my advice, with 600 acid you can make 1000 lead and 200 crystal, before super duper, which makes 1500 cryo cells, without perks, and leaves 500 lead left over. Steel is the biggest limiting factor in the equation, requiring 1000 steel, which you can make from ore, requiring 400 ore and a further 200 acid. Otherwise you save on acid by scrapping weapons and junk for steel, lead can also be grabbed from non ore sources, toys, weights, wrenches. Crystal is the only semi rare material that you would really need to refine from ore
---
All in all, cryo cells aren't that bad to craft, but there is a trick to it. 
---
Either it dosent matter.  But can we wait till tomorrow morning
---
Everything just gets buried there.
---
Sometimes you do everything in your power to be friendly, but you can't fix people that don't listen or care.
---
Thank you for sharing, and thank you for sharing where you found it! 
---
Screenshot available? I think we would all love to see it. 
---
Unfortunately no it's the same as the classic pipboy map without all the color. Like the map from fallout 1, 2, tactics, 3, NV and 4. Then some fuck decided hey let's make this shit color
---
Bethesda QUIT RUINING WHAT WE LOVE
---
Yup and theres a bed as well they are called modern bed they sell em at white springs
---
Not that I actually know, but I would assume Grafton
---
Your TSE is also like saying "I brought Thunderfury". It's an artifact-quality item if we're talking MMOs. It's a great drop to get but simply put few people are there and explosive heavy weapons have tons of perks around them to build their effectiveness that fit them into builds more broadly. TSEs are on the downturn now.
---
My MIRV armor penetrating fat man does an eighth of the SBQ's health depending on being on psycho/overdrive and racking up full adrenaline beforehand if I can land two shots before she gets back up. Quad barrel lock-on bunker buster is fun for lazy crowd control or making SBs land even while they're sonic spamming you to blindness. Pretty much negates VATS gameplay.
---
I didn't mean to make it that way but the meta is changing away from TSEs, and it makes it really important that you realize the TSE is being placed in a niche now rather than being a separate higher tier as the meta moves on. The weapons are an interesting and effective class for special applications, just don't expect developers to put a point-shoot-win gun in the game, they just needed TSE for that exact reason.
---
Free States Anarchist. I believe in personal sovereignty, no chain of command, no masters, no rulers. Following the plot, since I didn't align with BoS after the fallout, it kinda makes me a raider. Rose is kinda hot anyways.... 
---
I feel as though they shoud have the flare gun act the same way as the syringer, that different modification can give it drastically different effects when used.
---
My ideas are 
---
1: SOS flare-like this post is if you shoot it an area marker will show up on the map saying "player name sos".
---
2: Blinding flare-when you shoot this enemy will lose vision making it very easy for you to enter sneak on the enemy. 
---
3: explosive flare-when you shoot creates a small explosion, basically a weaker version of the m79
---
4: weighted flare-a heavy flare round that does actual damage to enemies when it hits them.
---
I'll hit you up if this other guy dosent reply
---
Basically everything has some amount of damage and energy resistance. The Awareness perk lets you see that amount in VATS.
---
\+karma
---
Dude, your "You are SPECIAL" page is one of, if not the greatest 76 resources on the internet.
---
No, theyre affected by the zealot effect. The zealot effect applies bonus damage to scorched, scorchbeasts and scorched animals.
---
Is come back and play for that. 
---
Grafton?
---
Yep, invest to max rank in fix it good to get to 200pct condition, then to keep it that way you should max rank in power patcher too.
---
Thats...  a good idea, like the creation club for fallout 4. And then bethesda can focus on the actual dlc, and they will still have the modders making things for the atomic shop.
---
PS4
---
Prunaaaaah
---
I can‚Äôt repair my weapons or armor even though I have the required resources. It keeps telling me I don‚Äôt have enough even though I clearly do. 
---
Another good rp raid is the roadside toll station
---
üí©
---
Also the mad hatter‚Äôs tea party on the ridge near-ish the fairgrounds in the Forest
---
Your complaint was legit until that last sentence üòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
Also may I ask, was it a safe you located it in or a different type of container? If it was in a safe, did you have to unlock it?
---
Gimme one of the alien rifles from Fallout 3, I loved those things.
---
I'm also looking for it to be explosive
---
Yeah, with integrated muffled grunting audiofilter for your mic output -)) Would be an awesome mod, I guess.
---
What he did was a lot nicer than how I do it. I don‚Äôt give them that many options.
---
Especially try any events that pop up in Grafton
---
I think the aspect of that's frustrating is that there's really no repercussions for wandering around wrecking peoples' places.  This kind of player 99% of the time has a TSE explosive shotgun, so engaging them usually isn't going to end well unless you have 400+ ballistic defense, rank 3 fireproof and an explosive weapon of your own.
---
Because according to most feedback, people were/are enjoying the overall friendliness of players. Why are they insisting on survival pvp when what most people want is new content in pve?
---
Really?  Where was this request for hardy-wasteland-like items?  
---
I love my Vault-Tec blue/yellow lamp, bed, chair, etc.
---
Honestly id be even more motivated to buy if it was that detailed
---
Totally agree with you, but I've played enough online games to know that balance will eventually come. I'm holding on to my energy weapons in hopes that they will get buffed and not break after a clip or two.
---
Must be! You failed your Captcha. 
---
What does TSE mean?
---
I can‚Äôt repair my weapons even though I have the resources to do so. I just get ‚ÄúYou lack the requirements...‚Äù box with each resource reading the correct amount. (Adhesive 6/6, etc.)
---
I'll run anybody through it on PC that's at least finished the rest of overseers missions. Free rn. Snowbound and down.
---
While it might be fun, it will lose interest very rapidly as soon as a dozen of players farm fast enough to become insanely high level. Then theyll one shot every new player.
---
This if everyone is forced to create a new character. If not, and we are allowed to use our pve one, then this mode will last a week at most due to the levels 200 already existing in pve.
---
People were craving new content in pve, not a survival mode. 
---
Hear hear! I love Aaron too!
---
Like hoodies made from death claw hide 
---
To repair its like 1/10th or even cheaper, and with the contractor perk its basically nothing
---
Muzzle velocity and muzzle energy are two related but very different things.
---
Two different calibers can share similar muzzle velocities. Muzzle energy is the combined calculation that factors in velocity, projectile weight and an average barrel length. It is a more accurate mathematical model to represent how much damage a projectile will do because it is that energy that is getting transferred to the target.
---
Can I haz an ammo?
---
Close but no see gar. He was talking about war with allusions to shitting on the run.
---
If your on Xbox I can give you some mats and help you rebuild. And I have ammosmith and super duper. I can craft you some mad ammo! GT is Kaise7en
---
Yea, it lists it as one of the effects of the mutation if you look at your pipboy
---
Can confirm. Found mine there too
---
Thanks for the kindness, I‚Äôm actually on PlayStation tho. And I hopped off for the night after that.
---
I love fog in this game.
---
If you are on pc, you can always join my game and send a team invite. I‚Äôll come meet you and you can dump it off to me. :)
---
My raiding kit is chameleon or weightless everything, junkie affix weapons, and coke head rp. Hey, got a any nuka? Got any chems? I really need some nuka man. Get dosed up and addicted to as many chems as possible, then off i go into withdrawals i get more aggressive. 
---
They made 5 gangs to facilitate rp. The ones that go on murder sprees are just cutthroats. 
---
Give it enough time. When Bethesda has had enough of it they‚Äôll pawn it off to the modders. Just a matter of time.
---
Fwiw, camp budget never seems to be an issue unless you're maxed out. I've tamed deathclaws, sloths, mirelunk Hunter and king, yao guai, and radtoads  and my budgets are always tight beforehand.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs more that I lost a lot of steel and lead that was going to be used for ammo. Along with a good chunk of other things that I couldn‚Äôt store and were dropped as I was killed trying to protect my base. Not a big deal but definitely put a damper on the night.
---
See a person that roleplays as raider
---
@
---
"Raider" dressed up in x-01 PA and use TSE
---
I agree that the payoff is there as you get more xp so its like a mild difficulty increase which personally I enjoy.
---
  
---
I welcome added mechanics of letting other players tag when possible - It makes for much more cinematic fights and **prevents boredom arising from everyone killing everything on their own** super fast and **promotes close proximity, actual physical tactical cooperation.**
---
I don't mind this, because what I do is tag mobs &amp; bring them to the high level player.  
---
You can just sneak melee and snipe stuff from the backline. Chuck some explosives in. Wear PA, use chems, foodbuffs, abuse high-ground and sneak headshot bonus. Plenty of tools offered for the wise survivors for this to not be an issue and more of a welcome challenge.
---
In my experience the high level player will work with you to get you some xp. 
---
Personally I welcome the bullet sponge enemies on occasion and a 66 supermutant when I was 25 was perfect practice for the endgame legendary monsters and practise your DPS and essential for learning to sneak better!
---
You should always have the tools to deal with a few max level mobs on your own unless you've wandered extremely far from 76 at sub level 20...
---
nerf Mr Gutsy tho
---
Killed her a bunch of times today
---
What you going to do about it?  Make angry posts on reddit? :)  See you in game :D
---
If your camp isnt too elaborate, you can move the camp, and once things get stored they fix automatically and can be placed again
---
Was with a group on PS4 this evening. Not sure what happened. There were prob 8-9 130ish lvl people, lots of explosive rounds... Literally 27:00+ seconds left and she was dead. I saved the video, there was a meat on her body that could not be looted and I got a two star combat armor reward... No plans nothing else. Then she bounced once into the air slightly and disappeared after about a minute. So three minutes of killing zero end game rewards...
---
The advice I heard was to keep 10% clear, where I've crept up to only about 1% clear I think haha
---
Though it can be role play, there are lots of better approaches to it and they even include positive feedback from the other parties.
---
Awesome üëç I'll be on tomorrow around noon Eastern. GT is Kaise7en
---
False. It's all relative, yeah? Depends on your goal.  I never wear PA so only time I needed it was in nuke zones. My DR wasn't a concern for me, just the rad resistance. Anyways that's wrong as well. It's all wrong. The bestest armor is probably trapper. That's where I'm at rn. Im tryna put together a suit that's not PA that will only need diluted radx and glowing blood pack to go to duka nuka nuka land to fight queen and glowing greenies.
---
suppose to be a guarantee drop first time you kill her.. maybe becuase its an alt the game bug and thought you were using original character
---
At least it'd be the only decent (and not half-assed like everything else, except, maybe, the blackbird paint) thing in the atom-shop...
---
The problem is the armor system is heavily biased in favor of high alpha damage, and dps is irrelevant.
---
take a random enemy with 100 armor, which is lower than most after level 25 or so.
---
Let's compare three guns, one has a rof of 1/min, and damage of 100, one has 10 rof and 10 damage, and the other deals 1 damage and fires 1000 shots a minute. Call these A,B,C
---
A. deals 50 damage per shot, giving 50 dps (100/2)
---
B. deals \~0.9 damage, and has a dps of \~9 (100/11)
---
C deals \~0.009 damage, has a dps of \~9 (1000/101)
---
It doesn't matter how good a weapon's dps is on paper, gun C has ten times the raw dps of all the others, but is still absolutely trash. This is the problem with the minigun, it's alpha damage is so low that enemy armor completely negates it, and there are no enemies in this game that have no armor after you reach a level to use the damned thing, it's only good at killing level 5 scorched in the forest, which you don't need a minigun to do. A straight dps calculation is completely meaningless if one weapon does close to full damage, and one deals such a small fraction of it's potential dps it isn't relevant. Gun A could fire 0.2 shots a minute and would still output more damage than either of the other guns in spite of it's dps being low.
---
As for armor calculation, take the damage resistance and divide it by the weapon's base damage, add one, then divide the weapon's base damage by that number.
---
The best weapon in the game is the one that deals the most damage per hit, the super sledge, which not only craps on the armor system inherently, but has the best armor piercing perk, and can be boosted so high that armor means nothing. To make the minigun as effective as a super sledge the enemy needs &lt;5 armor
---
It doesn't take long to give it a shot and find a tame. Go to the vertibird or other random spawn point until even a lvl 5 radtoads appears by itself. Getting the one you WANT is another matter but to just test it out wouldn't take very long I'd imagine
---
Don‚Äôt blame the player blame the game.
---
I didn‚Äôt ask for a show off. 
---
I‚Äôll admit it, I love the shop for cool Mid century modern pieces that I can‚Äôt buy in real life. 700 points for a malm fireplace, can‚Äôt help myself. 
---
I looked but only found the same one tucked away in a safe
---
He‚Äôs the kind of peasant that *earns* his fireball.
---
I was just answering your question. Have fun failing, I know I never do.
---
Well that‚Äôs useful info. It probably would‚Äôve been tough to get it back to how it was (in the same spot) if i moved twice, but I‚Äôll remember this in the future.
---
I know what you mean, but the way you worded that made me imagine sloths swimming around in aquariums.
---
Sure, if they pay them and it does not affect any jobs at the Bethesda(people who do this work must still have their jobs).
---
I've found that this game is similar to real life.
---
My main character nobody fucks with me because I am bigger than they are. I started a new character and now that I'm a level 10 all of the little bitch boys are tough guys all of a sudden. I wouldn't expect anything less online.
---
Oh, you're an idiot.
---
Yeah man. At one point I was tryna build a super raider power armor looking set but turns out if you break apart excavator you lose inherit carry weight perk, and arms description is a lie. Using excavator arms together in anything else besides excavator pa does not yield extra ore. Can we get Bethesda some English majors so were all "schpeeking the kings Engrish!!!" 
---
I don't think this is limited to the PS4 or the excavator set.  I am on PC and have been crashing to desktop randomly with no error after switching to my pimped out T-51b set.  There is a post on the Bethesda forums regarding the effect (where enemies glow red) from targeting HUD and some medications that is causing crashes.
---
I switched back to my X-01 set and was able to play for a couple hours with no crash.  I put the T-51b helmet with the targeting HUD in storage and farmed up a new one and haven't had the problem since.
---
Gotta love people on Reddit   /s

We climbing in yo windows, trying to snatch yo junk up, trying to pick locks

So you better hide yo base, hide yo bags, and hide your own self, cause we raiding errybody out here

If you're _in_ the zone, chances are you're _set up_ for the zone, power armor, hazmat suit, something. This sounds more like a "I logged out in whitesprings when it wasn't nuked and I logged back in and it is". 
---
I think the key thing people need to understand is that melee has 100% accuracy in vats already. If you're in range, you'll hit, if you're not, you won't.
---
Stalker on a melee stealth playstyle would actually be WORSE thhan a standard weapon, because the legendary effect is supposed  to guarantee a hit when outside of combat at the cost of 50% more AP cost, which  means you'll be spending a  lot more AP for your initial sneak attacks.
---
This effect should be ranged only, like some other effects.
---
Probably. The market is still flooded with duped goods and they will always find a way. 
---
Ah damn. üòìüòì
---
I agree, Donkey Kong is a pretty great game but Metroid Prime 4 is ... error 404.
---
But an Epic game? That's fortnite. 
---
I have more problems with MIRV of blowing up myself on the flat ground and the bomb exploding very early somewhere in the air while attacking from the high ground.
---
I've missed with a vats melee before. You do hit probably 95% of the time, though.
---
It took my torso BOS combat armor and I think either my right leg or right arm piece. Never again am I doing this event.
---
Annd you're still a sack of shit? If you're raiding people, if you're going up to peoples shit and smashing peoples shit, you, in the real world, are fucking garbage? Every fucking raider gang wears raider gear. 
---
You're an entitled sack of shit who goes with the best gear you can get to smash up other peoples shit who can't stop you. 
---
Anyone who does that is _trash_. 
---
Definitely, dream come true for me. 100+ hours in and still going strong.
---
I have a nice load screen photo of top of the world halfway across the map from the south of savage divide and it‚Äôs still HUGE

The hottest of takes
---
Same issue with T-51b on PC.  Crash to desktop, no error.  Replacing the helmet with an unmodified one resolved my issue.
---
has to be a bug
---
my alt char has all these plans/recipes but they dont highlight to say learn because my main char has learned them. on my alt i just have to press X to learn even if it isnt lit up, guess it wont be a problem once the new patch hits tho since it should tell us if we learned or not
---
Living near whitesprings nets a privilege to have some [terrific (or rather terrifying) views from your living room](https://imgur.com/a/DpxEAZw) \-)) 
---
Just a question: did you experienced any other tittle of this franchise?
---
This is a dumbass shell of a game. You people are sheep
---
power armor (go in/out) ussuallly fices this aswell
---
Mb, but devs prooved themselves to be completely unaware of nearly everything, so I'd rather expect the worst.
---
Two-Shot Explosive. its a 2 or 3 star legendary gun and is(not after the next patch) the "best" legendary mix besides Bloodied Explosive which is just a glass cannon.
---
you cant backpedal now and be like 'I was just trolling lol'
---
Good point, thanks. Almost feels like this, I did go into my workshop and still says need plan.
---
thanks 
---
Where is this location? 
---
u on xbox?
---
Heavy weapon AP cost is just too much for this to be nearly as good as Rifle VATS. 
---
Don't be dumb, people that are griefing aren't looking online for people's approval through telling strangers they're "role-playing". They don't care, they want to grief you. They want to tell you to be salty, they want you to call them griefer so they know they've done what they set out. "Cool raider RP" satisfies nothing for them.
---
People telling you they're raiders are being raiders. It's that fine a line. The difference is that raiders want to kill you and watch you die permanently because they enjoy that, and that their survival is easier when they take your shit. The line gets super blurry when you can respawn and take it back and be salty about getting shot in the face. The raider is sadistic in the same way as the griefer, the raider is just different in that their goal isn't just to watch the world burn but to also probably not say "I killed u like 50 times scrub get rekt ill follow u to any server lol".
---
If the raider laying you out flat is dead silent that's not even a little out of character. You're getting hunted by post-apocalyptic survivalist psychopaths, there might not be a lot on their mind aside from getting off to watching you twitch and writhe from shredding gunfire before you slump, chump.
---
Yea I‚Äôm a post apocalyptic landscape everyone would get along 
---
Link me to something that explains DT, please. Every fallout game seems to work differently in regards to armor. I recall New Vegas would only reduce damage if your weapon damage number was below a certain threshold. I never learned how FO4 armor worked.
---
Also, if armor is the only issue and not DPS, there are a ton of anti-armor options for guns. A rifle for example can get 50% anti-armor from legendary effect, 36% from Tank Killer perk card, and somewhere between 30%-40% depending on the magazine (I can't find exact numbers online though it would be easy to test). 
---
Based on how these seem work in descending order, you're looking at 68% armor reduction with just legendary effect(50%) and perk card(36%), and possibly around 77.6%-89.2% depending on the magazine used. I'm not 100% certain on those last numbers. I've only ever tested two effects at once. My assumption is you would remove 50% total armor first, then 40% of that, then 36% of that for legendary, magazine, perk. You seem to work in descending order.
---
In any case, that is incisor levels or armor reduction. If rifles and melee can achieve same levels of armor reduction, then knowing the DPS of both is essential to determine which is better and by how much. There is also room for arguments about the time it takes for ranged and melee to engage an enemy. Ranged can attack immediately. Melee takes time to run towards the enemy before they can do their damage. In essence, ranged gets a head start in the DPS race, which, for some reason, nobody has tried to calculate yet when it comes to these discussions.
---
Good to her man my wife doesn't mind watching me play but never would I get her to pick up the controller lol
---
T51, since i only have T51 armor mods XD
---
Yup. I have every single perk card related to gun durability and gatling plasma still seems break in shorter time / monsters killed by a huge margin.
---
They will come off of your power armor while wearing it. 
---
I fed it my t60 helmet once. 
---
They already offer the clown suit, which is necessary for the wendigo daily. Id consider both options equally pay to win (in that theyre not really).
---
Most likely this another playability oversight or too difficult for whatever reason to waste time and resources coding. I would settle for the rocketgirl costume coming as 2 pieces, but as it stands, if you equip a facemask it unequips the entire suit, not just the helmet. 
---
Based on these comments maybe the spacesuit is separable? Which would make the issues with the rocketgirl even more perplexing.
---
Side note: are they gonna fix the duped bobblehead stacking issue (perhaps also the 2s explosive... although idk if theyd be as OP without the bobbleheads)? I just finished going through the bunker to drop a nuke only to fet a few hits on the queen before she was flat 1 shot. None of us were able to loot her. We didnt even get the quest rewards. Fking cancer these ppl. Whats the point of playing the game if you 1 shot the queen?! Just to ruin it for everyone??
---
I used to do the mission daily since it fed the whole server. I havent done it since they 'fixed' it. 
---
It breaks really really really fast. Does lowish dps. Not good vs flying scorchbeasts.
---
Not that good.
---
You better watch out that friend of yours, because he looks like he might want something from your girlfriend.
---
But nice story. Have fun and sounds like you already have.

Your frustration is understood by everyone else who plays but at this point it isn't a surprise, you have to just say "this game........." and shake your head several times a day :)
---
Don't worry though the second time through the silo is easier because you know what to expect.  And you'll be grateful of the L80 players' help next time, for sure!

You can build a room with no foundations but with walls from the roof to protect your crops, water and resouce collectors.

SBQ*
---
Amazing story. Hope you create a lot of memories with your girl ingame. 
---
SBQ Loot is beyond atrocious. Worse than a lvl 60 ghoul. And it's end game...
---
Mind if I ask if you found yours in a locked safe?
---
This is a terrible argument as we already have to eat and drink like we have the metabolism of a shrew. So this particular line of thinking makes about as much sense as a trying to bail out a sinking canoe with a slotted spoon.
---
They have gone to great lengths to make the game a realistic survival game. The only thing comparable would be the STALKER games.
---
There is literally no reason to not do some basic arithmetic to make FO76 fall closer into line with common expectations of how firearms should work. 
---
The point is that min/max core gameplay leads to one or two endgame playstyles with everything else relegated to rubbish bin. That lack of variety leads to stagnation and the playerbase suffers which in the end effects the corporate bottom line.
---
The safe door is pried open and it‚Äôs sitting as a static object within the safe. No lock picking required. 
---
1.tame a dehatclaw
---
2. set nopvp mode
---
3. let them attack ur camp
---
4. enjoy their panic when they recognise they cant harm the deatclaw but that chase them while ur all turrets shoot them  to death :D
---
If you're too close to a popular spot, move.  If your camp's being attacked, server hop - it'll vanish and limit the damage.  Yes that's lame but that's the mechanics, why not use them.  And if you need a hand look me up on PS4 'tigertemper'
---
Systems? why when you can just get and copy alll the MMO "mechanics" in a cheap way aand pretend to sold it like a fallout game...
---
I mean, if building settlements In F4 was a bit "unused" it, here on f76, only has place to give some cheap housing options...
---
Thank you much.
---
Vats/Sneak. That's what everyone is going to be running. Weapon doesn't matter, a base weapon can 1 shot everything with that setup.
---
Emoting in power armor is fucking cute. 
---
Hah! I never knew it \*was\* a guaranteed drop.  Interesting!  Good to know, thanks for bringing it up.
---
I like trains

He was a PreWar ghoul. He says so in Fallout 4. He listened to Silver Shroud as a kid on the radio (and also apparently Mistress of Mystery) and got ghoulified when the bombs dropped. 
---
It shows. 
---
Don't watch the video, he just stands there.
---
Switch to max sneak and crit if you use Rifle, you will go back to 1 shotting. Heavy weapons sadly won't have that option and are kinda dead on arrival next week.
---
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older then we wouldn't have to wait so long. üòâ
---
I definitely suggest destroying at least one persons camp at some point.   I saw someone had that limited time Red Rocket statue and I thought this could the only time I'd ever get to blow one up to see the rocket take off.   After I'd gotten a 50 cap bounty from that, i just went all-in and totalled this players camp.  450 Cap bounty. I decided I'd just run from whoever came after and it was a fun chase.  And honestly...  I'll probably do it again sometime.
---
Im Russian, and this makes me feel home
---
Xbox :,(
---
&gt;But an Epic game? That's fortnite. 
---
Well ain't that just rather literate of you. 
---
Meh, that is like get robbed by a guy with a pistol aiming to you and while he tells you a very great joke...
---
No matter how good the joke is, you dont laugh... same with F76.. can be all the depressive they want on the holos..... the gameplay just doesnt follow it and the dumb situations or wonky combat (or other questionable mechanics, like vendors) just throws all to the toilet...
---
Bethesda... instead do a Skyrim getting MMO mechanics, did a MMO with skyrim mechanics... they did exactly the same with fallout, just this time they camouflaged the game better... but still has the same conceiving problems.
---
Sweet thanks
---
I want a wall object that has cabinets built into it already sort of like the walls in some of the buildings in Fortnight 
---
PC
---
Then let people have all units in bulks and units ... beacuse for me its not a problem with plastic at all watogs school if not looted is giving you 139 plastic in 15 min of farming
---
Did you follow the instructions? If not done correctly it will be rejected.
---
Thats odd. I am playing on pro and my log says I have only had 11 crashes since dec 27th when I made the switch to pro. Crashes on my regular ps4 also dropped dramatically after the last parch before christmas.
---
Compare that to the 11 freeze/crash per day back when I was playing new vegas and I am quite satisfied with current stability.
---
Every piece of software has a specification on what it should do. All specifications, in some form, say that the software shouldn't behave in unintended ways.
---
Whether a game has bugs and whether its behaviour matches expectations is not subjective. It's a property we can measure with software testing.
---
Right now there are lots of behaviours in the game that wouldn't pass the testing, should the tests exist for them.
---
Arguably the game misbehaves much worse than other comparable products. Thus the game can be said to be badly off.
---
Obviously you can't see the scorchbeast goes in line with the whole impenetrable aspect. You can clearly see and hear the attacks and see them having no affect as well which was the point of this post.
---
This will take awhile for me to digest. So 100 damage vs 100 armor reduces total damage by 50%. 
---
But something doesn't make sense. If 'A' has a rate of fire of 1 per minute at 100 damage, and only gets reduced by 50% leaving 50 total damage, wouldn't you still need to divide that 50 by 60 seconds to determine damage per **second**? I'm only getting .833 dps for A, not the 50 dps you claim. 
---
actualy they can and many people banned because duped items already... just check youtube.
---
There should be a way to make things both lore accurate and fun at the same time though...if not I think fun should take priority - it is a *game* after all.
---
The game gave you an option to be an asshole. And you chose to be an asshole. Which makes you an asshole. Do you understand my premise?
---
No it‚Äôs placed on top of toy alien 
---
Ps4
---
I saw the E3 demo and what they were expecting. I've played enough games to know how games like these work. I then watched as countless youtubers gave their prophecies of how the gameplay would be like, with NPC's and stories and... we weren't shown any of that. We were shown some basic story elements and some PvP, and crafting. This was going to be an open world MP game in the fallout universe, eg: DayZ in Fallout.
---
I didn't really care. I saw some Twitch.tv footage. I thought "Huh. Fallout. With friends. And base building. Could probably spare some time for it."
---
It's a decent game for what it was sold to be. Everyone else took too much to what people said and tried to insert their translation of what they thought he developer meant and not what they were actually saying, usually following some youtuber who said "They totally meant this."
---
If any group of people were sheep, it was the people who expected "more" out of a game that wasn't going to offer them that. MP in Fallout. That's what some wanted. That's what we got. Works for me. Could've been sold at $40 and been better received, but otherwise meh. 
---
All games are kind of bland when you break them down. Nothing's really new. Part of it is releasing that cynicism to just enjoy yourself. If you can't, play something else. That's what i did with red dead redemption 2. Could barely get out of the tutorial. Just felt quite rail-roaded. Literally. And figuratively. Looked pretty though.
---
Oh awesome, mine is a picture of my crotch as I had know idea what I was doing.
---
I have. It's fine. I wanted to play multiplayer in a fallout world with a friend. It works perfectly to that end. 
---
Anyone who expected otherwise wasn't paying attention.
---
Fallout also stores data here  "%appdata%\\Local\\Fallout76" not sure if that will help worth a try though.  
---
Also does the game crash on other chars from your main one?
---
Imo brilliant idea i wil ladd this to headline but explosive flares in deeper thinking will be useless 
---
You are not the nukeborn so Im affraid you do nothing here but run in fucking circles... maybe 200 years after the Third Era, ended along with the Septim bloodline you will have more luck.
---
Probably in bethesda was something like
---
A "hey hey hey, wait,  dont this go against the lore we are developing on this game?"
---
B "we dont pay attention to numerical ones and you think we are going to invest time on that?"
---
A "Mmm well yes you are right... but then? people is going to ask for any kind of lategame?"
---
B "just invent any excuse to reskin classic creatures into some high-lvl mobs so we can get bulletsponges that force people to look for better weapons... that will make people expend 3 times more time in the gamee until they notice the only DLC we will release is going to be a sightly better developed PvP, instead the current placeholder.
---
A "You evil"

B "Me genius"

C "We fucked"

What platform? 
---
 Well, I just wasted several minutes of my life. Lame flex duder.
---
Beat her with just two players with one-star weapons a couple of days ago. Queen wasn't too bad but the mobs were brutal. Forgot to check whether there was anyone else on the server before we launched the nuke.
---
When anyone else shows up it's usually a walk in the park. I play on PC, so I can only guess that struggling to kill the queen is a console thing. Not enough players with hardcore damage builds, maybe.
---
Oh lord yes. INTERIOR WALLS, paint for those walls, wallpaper, interior doors ... ALL TEH NEED
---
You can be a dick in this game if you want to.The fact that you choose to means you're a dick. That is all. Digest that and work through your issues.
---
There's one at the Freak Show, too
---
I hate trolls
---
There is one last thing to do.... i know its hard but could you please drop those guns on the ground they have been created in flames of exploits and are corrupted . Those guns needs to get destroyed !
---
It depends what was it that you expected it to be at the release? It will be better, that's for sure, and then it will get worse, and then better again...
---
Wont argue that point, but my asshole behavior opened up an opportunaty for another player to take 450 caps off me and that that really took the asshole flavor off the whole thing.
---
You in PS4? 
---
Huh?
---
yawn
---
I expected a fully functioning game as shoulda everyone else üòëü§î. I'm still enjoying it, see has potential but some things stress me right out with how inconsistent everything is overall 
---
Where was your camp. 
---
The gateway drug for mine was Fallout Shelter, then mainlining some hits of Fallout 4 VR.
---
depends on the person everyone has different opinions on what the game should have turned out on reason..will it get better than what it is right now?..yes will be up to everyone expectations on how they wanted it? highly doubt it
---
lvl 3 fireproof FTW (endurance perk)
---
That's the real issue. A weapon can either die quickly, or have low DPS, but not both. I'd be fine with energy weapons being glass canons, but right now they just sort of suck. 
---
I think this is correct. I believe the safe was slightly ajar. 
---
I just remember this because there are also a few level 3 safes which is what I look for the most in the game. 
---
This a satire post? I thought it was serious.  Oh well.
---
I know plans for a few, and I tried to learn plans for the raider underarmor, since that's what I use.  Either it's incredibly rare or impossible.
---
Everything except low-level enemies, IIRC. There are no categories of high armor/low hp and high hp/low armor enemies. Hence armor penetration is (nearly) always good.
---
&gt; I expected a fully functioning game as shoulda everyone else
---
Online games(and this is also a Beth game) rarely are fully functional at the release, so it's silly to expect it. You can want it and that reasonable, but expecting it is not.

&gt;...dragging their asses to fix things.
---
As someone who works in software development (not in the gaming industry, mind you), I‚Äôve yet to get the impression they‚Äôre ‚Äúdragging their asses‚Äù. Some issues simply take a lot longer to nail down the causes and code a good fix. It‚Äôs not like they haven‚Äôt been releasing updates with many fixes on a fairly regular basis since release.
---
You need a new boyfriend 
---
I think the shower plan is tied to "I am Become Death".  I didn't get the plan until i actually launched the nuke that created the Scorched Earth event.  I didn't even know I was supposed to get it.
---
Fast asleep. 
---
What? How can you have a bloodied build without adrenal reaction mutation??
---
oh i ll try to delete that as well thanks i just reinstall the bethesda launcher atm so i check that later ! but definitly worth a try
---
i cant even create an other cha i read about that if you crash while the game loads try login an other cha and back to main but my game crashes even before i can create a new one before i can hit start
---
i see the please stand by before the intro "video" should start and bam crash D:

Sure showed me. Oh god how will I ever recover from this. Haha. Cheers man. I appreciate the humor

What your GT?

[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
This game uses the same formula as fallout 4, surprise.
---
There have been tests done on this subreddit, I wish I could find them atm, I vaguely recall the thread as being about legendary armor piercing test on a human.
---
I did the math
---
For minigun dam = 14
---
for 50 cal dam = 40
---
for gatling gun dam = 79
---
How many shots does it take to equal the full damage from a minigun's entire magazine. This math will assume 100 armor, but it does not matter what the armor is as long as it stays above the weapon damage numbers all times, 79 armor or 1,000,000 doesn't matter as I am calculating a ratio of bullets.
---
500(14/(1+(100/14))) = 859.65
---
860 / (40 /(1+(100/40))) = 75.25
---
860 / (79 /(1+(100/79))) = 24.67
---
So in order to match the full amount of 500 ammo a minigun can hold in it's magazine you need to only fire 76 rounds of .50 cal, or you could take a gatling gun and fire a grand total of 25. The rate of fire is slow but not that slow. 
---
If you double the damage of all guns, and assume 45% armor penetration from the previous tests, the amount of bullets the gatling gun needs to equal the minigun increases dramatically, as it goes over the critical mass of the armor&lt;damage, while the minigun fails to, requiring 40.29 bullets to match 500 from the mingun, the .50 cal needs 99.62. Can you see where all this lines up to mean without high per shot damage your dps is irrelevant. 
---
Quit your bitching. We're all allowed to play as we see fit. Not our fault you're an underpowered pleb who is afraid of getting wrecked. You knew what this was coming into it. 
---
"Just posted bit it's it showing" lol can you see why I was confused? 
---
Jaze 
---
Is survival coming out on the next patch or the next next patch?
---
Gotcha.
---
Thanks for answering
---
Auto correct is the bane of my existence. 
---
I feel ya dude lol 
---
I'm on Xbox One and have given that one away 8 or 9 times.
---
We do a mothball of plans and pass them around.
---
Yeeee. I play on X box and I don‚Äôt have any great legendaries. 
---
You wanted cooperative or MMOesque game?
---
fails on both however has both.
---
Pointing just for the MMO or point just for the COOP for me could be a much better option... instead barely decent MMO, barely decent Coop, too much lore and gameplay options thrown away for no real innovation... 
---
 People renounced conversations and deep NPCs for 16-19 strangers..?
---
*I asked this because i would say the 70% of people I just found in the game and we discussed about the quality of the game and said without too much doubts "yes" they told me later that they were ussual MMOesque players that mostly never touched the franchise.
---
Yeah. I bought Battlefield 5 and Fallout 76 for 200BRL (60$?).  
---
BF5 was a big disappointment (partly because it doesn't run very good on my machine - but FO76 doesn't either), FO76 is actually good. Not great, I feel like it lacks a lot of things, but it's definitely good. I'm loving the exploration and worldbuilding.
---
No. Every update brings more issues. Instead of fixing the game. They give us atom store junk and a new mode.
---
Understandable-
---
It is a flat percentage chance.
---
Flux yes!
---
If your on PS4, I can build one in your camp for you. 
---
Good idea thanks for the tip!
---
Except for the fact that as long as you own that workshop you can be hunted across the whole map by anyone who even momentarily tried to claim it from you. So you can't really go about your day and ignore it till you server hop and make sure you're on a new server where you don't have any ownership of it.
---
I like references
---
No, I don‚Äôt expect the game to survive the year.
---
You aren't alone, I play on PC and have the same problems, as do all of my friends who play on PC. Since the last patch, CTD has been a huge problem, especially during nukes or when I'm in/near Whitesprings or Watoga.
---
Interesting like the fast travel. Bet that took some planning...
---
Equip power user and you shouldn‚Äòt have a Problem anymore even with a Jetpack :) 
---
Just go to Poseidon or one of the others and you get plenty by claiming the workshop.

My new buddy launched her first today and we got a fail.  I think if more than a handful of players are present, everyone has to be doing max contribution unless there's a couple lvl 200+ players in there with TSE gatling guns or furious super sledges.  I had a 2-shot handmade (easily 300+ a shot w Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction going on) min/max sniper build with an 85 rd drum and unloaded over 2000 rounds into her, at least half of which were doing 3.5x sneak damage plus mainlining psychobuff when the timer got down to 10 min.
---
I was the only player there when she erupted, and usually I can see her health tick down with each shot solo or with only a couple players around.  It was doing nothing to her.  I was hoping to kill off at least one regen while the rest of my team caught up, but literally nothing happened when I shot her.
---
She was at about 40% health on her last regen when we failed and she triumphantly flew away.
---
It's a fool's game to expect something to reach the potential that you envision for it.
---
I think if the game survives for a year then it may come close to what should have been it's   
---
retail release.
---
I wasn't negative either. Was fighting a scorchbeast queen earlier today, her health was about a little more then half-way down at nine minutes left.( a lot of low level players participating) Threw a plasma grenade, spawn back in and POOF, scorchbeast queen's health is now full. High level players eventually joined, but we only got her down to about 40% health. I was really hoping I could get a cool photomode pic with the queen and hopefully find the rad shower plan. I'm pretty bummed, wasted a lot of ammo too.
---
if you find where someones camp is, they can only respawn at their camp and at 76
---
if they dont speed up how long it takes to spawn in (the time between your character appearing and when you can move), then a team of 2 or more can camp both locations and murder you over and over until you leave the server
---
Buy them from vendors. Power stations have fusion core processors. Look in power armors you find in the open world as well as fusion core generators. 
---
I have played the other fallout games. I love fallout. Never been much for pvp though. And preprogrammed raiders are not the same as players who have the ability to have far better equipment plus way higher levels than yourself. You can't compare previous games raiders to players at all. 
---
I've quite enjoyed what bits of 76 I have played but it just sucks getting griefed and having to server hop just to finish what you wanted to do. The game is designed to be played solo or in groups as well as PVE or PVP. It just ended up rather unbalanced in favor of the PVP aspect. So I've put the game on hold until I see what new changes come along. I love follout lore and enjoy reading the terminals to learn more about it or discovering new areas. Not to mention just taking my time to appreciate what the developers created. If someone is in pacifist mode and refuses to return fire, just leave them be. 
---
My stash seems to last forever. I did notice that if I go melee and use power attacks it depletes them much much quicker. 
---
Yep. Game is done. 
---
Off to play other stuff! 
---
This is the PA skin I'm waiting on.
---
Thanks so much!
---
I want a red paint scheme for my excavator armor. 
---
\&gt; If you own a workshop, and someone hit claim but just leave, you're now able to be hunted by that person.   
---
conversely you can hunt them  
---
the only time i claim workshops is to initiate pvp at owned workshops and hope they drop junk. have not needed to farm junk for over a month
---
nah, 
---
i mean it's inconistent. overrepair does give "edge" to melee weapons, but not ranged weapons.  
---
similarly, overrepair gives additional ballistic resistance, but not energy reistance to armor.
---
but that's not the bug part, the bug part is flat damage. i mean, put it to buzzblade or ripper or chainsaw and it'll completely chance the weapon. for some weapons, damage increase is literally multiple TIMES.
---
The card itself. It says a slight chance, not a numarical percentage. As a person with thirteen luck I can go two hours without it procing and I have had it proc twice in two minutes. Literally rng.
---
The only ‚Äúgood thing‚Äù that‚Äôs I‚Äôve got from the atom shop is the blackbird power amour paint, but I like buying the poweramour paint to sell it ingame haha 
---
Can't stand the heat, stay out of the fire. 
---
Might be worth trying to rename the video files, see if those are the problem (bethesda,net\\Launcher\\games\\Fallout76\\Data\\Video) the game will just try to skip to the menu if it cant find the files, so if it just crashes you know its not the video files, have you tried launching the game from the fallout directory and then logging in ingame? and if none of that works im out of ideas :D
---
Offline invite Ee Mode Ee 77
---
It breaks fast, and ammo is expensive, but I feel like it does help a lot in a SBQ battle, it‚Äôs the heavy weapon I‚Äôve felt I‚Äôve been the most helpful with. 
---
The crystallizing barrel makes it throw ‚Äúsnowballs‚Äù and it‚Äôs much easier to hit things far away and it‚Äôs way better for ammo usage, so I‚Äôd recommend that. 
---
I found a "dead" sentry bot with 52 missiles on it.  FIFTY. TWO. OF THEM.  If I have to leave all of them behind because the weapon they're used with has so little reason to haul around with me, despite being a God damn missile launcher, then I think there's a problem. 
---
I‚Äôll buy Harpoon Gun, Ultracite Explosive Vent and Ultracite Left Leg. Let me know when you‚Äôre online and I‚Äôll hop on and meet you.
---
I did not receive it on first kill. I got a prime handmade receiver plan, but no arch
---
Absolutely. Whenever someone brings this topic up WOW and LOTRO come to mind.
---
Both has very strong fan base so the incentive to keep making content is there for a business. As long as people keep playing, they will continue making content and improvements.
---
And they have lasted over a decade each now...
---
On Xbox.  
---
I had a guy who was wanted for 5 caps (He must've shot a wall or something accidently) come along and repair my turrets... Only for those repaired turrets to immediately all open fire on him. &gt;_&gt;
---
You are welcome, I already lost like 800 bullets in there...
---
(that was the first week, not surprised it is still bugged)
---
thats just what she said!

How about fixing bugs instead?

The Mistress of Mystery was a recurring character on the Silver Shroud radio show (and apparently popular enough for Shannon Rivers to build a 26-year career around voicing the character), but also had her own ongoing comic book series and was a member of The Unstoppables team-up title as well (and appears on 4 of the 5 Unstoppables perk magazines in Fallout 4). Connolly's continuity discussion is referring to the discrepancies between the radio show and the comic.
---
Connolly's discussions with Shannon's husband Fred indicate that the costume used by the Order of Mysteries is based off of the Mistress's "new" design, and the one on the Unstoppables covers is "old" one (with a full-length dress and a loose, see-through veil).
---
I still need springs for weapons.   I keep power patcher on at lvl 1and even that Dallas amount is a huge help 
---
Youtubers are constantly shitting on the game. (Juicehead for example) While none have even played the damn game for their own opinion.
---
I would punt a baby off an overpass for a clean Park Ranger outfit and hat. 
---
It should be dpm in that instance, I changed it between minute and second at some point and didn't correct all the things. Also, I should admit that I am not really good enough at the maths involved to work out how to put together the complete formula in a calculator, and us a slightly simplified version. Inaccuracies inevitable, but yes when armor = weapon damage then the damage dealt will be half, that part is accurate.
---
No, it's rather literal though.
---
That's what I said? 
---
Had this happen with a TSE Dragon. SbQ was not happy

---
If it would be real raytracing instead of faked "half-raytracing" maybe...
---
Anyways your probllem can come from a lot of things.... for example I wont be surprised that any pllayer on that server could  be using any of those tricks to increase the amount of pieces in CAMP, creatingproblems with the server... I noticed servers running llike shit because this and being just on the starting, on a nuked area would be much worse.
---
The funny thing is, I have yet had a player come chase me or had them kill me yet when I do this. I'm not sure if they can come get me if I just leave after hitting claim on their workshop
---
If they put actual weapons and armor in the store, you‚Äôd eventually find yourself needing to spend real world money in order to compete with everyone else buffing their characters with store weapons bought with real world money. That‚Äôs referred to as ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù and it would be a bad thing.
---
I don't know what kind of underarmor you like, but heres's what I know:
---
+ raider
---
everything but shielded can be bought from raider vendors (pleasant valley, sutton, sunnytop, R&amp;G stations and pleasant valley ski reort)
---
+ Vault
---
All mods gained through completing the main questlines, including shielded
---
+ BOS and Marine
---
Everything but raider can be bought from Phoenix at Watoga Shopping Plaza (shielded lining drops from Forbidden Knowledge quest rarely)
---
+ Enclave
---
All plans, including shielded lining, can be bought from MODUS in the bunker
---
+ Casual
---
Everything but shielded can be bought from Responders vendors. (Morgantown, Charleston, Welch, Lewisburg stations and also Charleston FD, Flatwoods, and Camden Park. Certain Whitesprings hotel vendors will also have it in the hotel shopping area.)

Seriously this is dumb, its like ask for shazam app on the pipboy just because I find it slow to notice which song Im listening on the game.

First time I ever saw the show. It was mostly the same as every other similar comedy news/interview type show. Not really my thing, but I kept it on because she was going to interview John McAfee and his crazy ass is entertaining.
---
OK I'm not a power armor user but I got the Excavator Power Armor and am running both arms level 45 and the rest T-60. I do not get any bonus when I mine an ore node. Only 1 ore. So I assume I need to equip all the Excavator pieces to get this mining bonus? I can find no reference to a mining bonus with Excavator PA.
---
Solo, always.
---
I want some stuff added in game and not just the pay store (considering how slowly you get atoms). For every four items at least one findable. 
---
After you edited it?
---
So a notebook? You can grab some from Target.
---
To me, when Juicehead speaks about FO76 it feels like he actually likes the game but he feels like he has to shit on it otherwise the hivemind will fuck his channel.  
---
I've played maybe 7-8 hours now and I'm still enjoying the game a lot. Actually just created another character because I felt I rushed through some locations.
---
Then leave. Unsub, get over it.
---
We already know that's coming with the factions update.
---
Welllll thats upsetting, they need to get on top of this stuff.
---
lockpicking sux...  from every single time I found something decent (decent its not great) I found 12-15 emply containers.

---
It's not just Excavator PA and it's not just PS4. I've been having the same issue on PC since I installed the mod, but I finally found something to replace it with.
---
I tried to role play as a raider, had a lot of people from my community participate. Unfortunately, there's not a lot to gain from being a bastard so we just attacked all strangers on sight if we happened upon them while doing quests. Usually the result would be a fast travel, no retalitiation.  
---
Once though, we killed a person who had just finished an event, and through his open mic he sighed with the voice of a 45 year old before disconnecting. I felt terrible after that, I never did the raider thing again.
---
Yeah this is why I stopped playing. The only end game content and more than half the time you don't get anything.
---
It would be good if there was 1 settlement with human NPCs who were able to just survive. Would be a hub for quests and trading. 
---
They could have plots you could rent to build your camps. 
---
It's hard to believe that with all of the bunkers, vaults technology etc that literally not 1 other person was able to survive. 
---
I havent experienced that. I have to keep leaving the server to be able to team up though.
---
&gt;If at least the game would auto-load the cores with less energy instead the ones with more... but noooo
---
 If at least the game would auto-load the cores with less energy instead the ones with more... but noooo 
---
I have every game in the series at this point. NV is probably my favorite overall and I have the collectors edition of it. I still enjoy this game. 
---
Overall, I found the NPC's in Fallout 3 and 4 to be trite. They weren't deep. New Vegas was clever, but they still were not deep. They had about 3-4 layers in most cases. Some a little more, most just a single line they repeated over and over and over. This isn't Nier: Automata. This isn't a Metal Gear game (though I wouldn't describe that as deep either, just a lot of lore).
---
What i have always enjoyed about Fallout is the lore itself. Learning about how people went about their day, reading the random entry of a disgruntled worker pissed at his boss and what his actions were about it. The NPCs were always... annoying and took me out of the game. They were never animated enough. Just talking dolls. 
---
Humans, however... humans can be much much more interesting. Too bad most Fallout players suffer social anxieties, which might be the real reason people get upset about other players vs NPC's because so far I've had far more interesting engagements. Like this one girl I spoke with. Asked her how she was doing, asked if she wanted to group up for some quests, some random guy kept trying to murder us and i kept killing him with an axe. Was fun. 
---
Got to explore with one of my best friends around a spooky house. Got chased by ghouls and a scorchbeast. Saw hell. Was fun. 
---
Honestly, if you spend your time in an MMO you know most people either spend most of their end game getting nifty clothes or standing in the social area and chatting. At least in fallout I can do that and shoot something. With friends. With strangers. In that regard, it does better than an MMO specifically.
---
Either case, it does exactly what I wanted.
---
I wanted a fallout game. I wanted multiplayer. I got those two checked off. And there was plenty of lore not ruined by stiff NPC's and ultimately boring dialogue choices.
---
(Moira was one of my favorite fallout NPC's, next to Veronica from NV.) Overall.... I wouldn't really call Fallout games "deep". They're clever. They're still only a few layers down though. Fallout 76 though... I see it more as a DnD player's Fallout. Private servers would make it all the better though. Actually set up RP campaigns, get players who roleplay as Brotherhood, some as lone survivors, etc. DayZ is known as having almost nothing but some of my favorite expereinces come from RP servers. DayZ Underground has some of the best lore for an RP i think i've seen in that game so... yeah.
---
It's an RP'ers Fallout. That's all it is. That's all it needed to be. And RP'ers are some of the biggest spenders when you get to MMO's. Like, you think the Atom shop is EXPENSIVE?
---
Try a $30 whale mount. Or $10 for an outfit. Or a wedding that costs $30. People have spent THOUSANDS there. 
---
(I also play iRacing myself so... lol. I don't really care about cost except for right now cause I don't have a job. That's gonna bite me in the butt, tbh.)
---
Anyways, no point arguing this though. Fallout 76 isn't the future of fallout games. It is simply a fallout game. One of many. Not the last one, i'm sure we'll get a fallout 5. This is fine, it needs to be better, but it's not terrible like people make it out to be. Just flawed.
---
Im not necessarily familiar with that process. If i go about it, is there anything pertaining to my other games or saved files that i should be concerned/aware of?
---
 Hey man, hall of social justice is *that* way. The virtue signal is in the basement because its a fucking game. Gtfo with this not on my Christian Minecraft server style gate keeping
---
And chameleon with junkie weapon is far from the best one could be running. 
---
Didnt know know that. But if the current state is called 'easy to work with' than Im done lmao.
---
It might not necessarily break the lore, you could have an unmarked version that was ‚Äúscavenged‚Äù from police stations or something like that. I‚Äôm pretty sure the NCR scavenged their veteran armor but I could be wrong. 
---
Ahh, good to know. I knew there was something to it like that, just wasnt sure of the specifics.
---
They do, although Ive never really used them so I dont know how much.
---
Red Dead is superb though, I absolutelly love it. After playing 8 hours\~ of 76, I'd give it a 8 with huge potential to be a 9 through some new features and updates.  
---
I don't think Rockstar paid to smear this game, but I do believe that since it was announced, a lot of people were annoyed simply because this wasn't the Fallout sequel they wanted (*most people can't understand that Bethesda is possibly working on Fallout 5 while working on 76*) and just decided that it was shit from the start because they couldn't understand that this is more likely an experiment.  
---
Then Bethesda dropped the ball on a few matters and it just snowballed. A combination of mob stupidity (*it's idiotic how people were blaming Bethesda for the rum bottle thing*) and immaturity ("*if it's not the game I want, it sucks*").
---
The game was literally marketed as a PvP fallout and you think it‚Äôs wrong to engage in PvP, I bet when you play FPS‚Äôs you think it‚Äôs wrong to shoot at the enemy team too. Lol
---
I agree with you. I've experienced a surprising amound of crashes since the update. Loading in time has also seemingly gotten longer.
---
Jesus Christ its Jason Bourne 
---
Ps4 version
---
Ive just spent a horrid 4 hours trying to get past this big in the game for the info the fire quest and I'm still stuck and bugged myself now.
---
The final part to get the Beacon is massively screwed and also greifed, but that's another story.
---
1. On finishing that horrid timed race, if the protection is killed by an asshole player, you don't get a marker to the next location.
---
Skip 1.5 he's of my life looking for that c r a p And running into super mutant slaughter - awesome game design choice btw.
---
Finally logging back n forth, I get a server instance he hasn't been killed in yet.
---
I get ticket, quest proceeds, get gear, then walk Into lines before listeng to audio.  Quest goes away.
---
Spend 2 hrs redoing the entire freaking cave area until to back to protectron.
---
He's dead, of course, so find another server. (This is bullshit btw, he should never be able to be killed).
---
Talk again, quest resets to take gear. I do. Quest instantly goes away.
---
Reset like 3 times and keep trying various things with no luck.
---
I then think, why don't I drop what I got (helmet, clothes) and reset again to see if fixed.
---
Nope.  Now it won't even replace the items at all.
---
The quest goes away,then on talking to protectron, it starts again with get gear- acts like giving gear but doesn't, 
---
I listen to tape and quest briefly proceeds to the activate beacon....for like 2 seconds and goes away.
---
Without quest can't activate it, so now I have no firemen gear and I can't proceed.
---
Starting to see why people returned this game.
---
Is this even being worked on?
---
While that is cool. And it's awesome it provides free energy to workshops. I love it when that little green lights is on the box. It's a lot of work to do that for 100 caps. If you can get a hold of the Witch or Skeleton costume plan at the random encounter event just south of the Crevasse Dam you can sell the costumes and get all a vendors caps pretty fast and easy. Or get Cap Collector and Fortune Finder and find cap stashes. Some can give you maybe up to 200 in one caps stash if you're lucky. Also you could opt for water farming. Just pop down some water purifiers at a few workshops. Really easy way to get caps.
---
I wish I had someone to play with me at an exploration pace. Most of my friends that are into Fallout are always telling me how shitty the game is while not ever having played it. :/  
---
Guess I'll try to make some friends in-game. 
---

---
The link was helpful. I am curious if we have proof it uses the same exact system or if it is tweaked slightly to take pvp into account. I am curious now if critical hit multipliers take effect before or after damage reduction calculations. I will have to do a lot of thinking to figure out which would be better. I too am bad at maths.
---
Also the switch from damage per minute to second is super misleading in your argument.
---
Yea, id disconnect here and there before. I was also bluescreening alot a week or two ago, but generally when looking quickly through my STASH. Now its just constantly bluescreening. And if im not bluescreening, the friend Im attempting to play with does.
---
It looks pretty solid with the Preston outfit, I mean Western Duster. 
---

---
Hahah yeah, fuck fortnite and people who like it. How dare they have an opinion that‚Äôs not mine. 
---
I only played 4, but I crashed so infrequently, I cant even say i remember crashing at all. 
---
Never had any real problems with Skyrim either.
---
Im gonna have to check my numbers, now that i know i can.
---
Heck how about just dense / biocommesh etc for PA period.. How is leather armor torsos more advanced than  PA?
---
&gt; The interiors in fo4 were slightly MORE detailed. 
---
You are possibly right. I didn't finish FO4 (though I have played quite alot, I *just never visited the southern areas/nuka cola/some part of Far Harbor*) and I admit I said that without putting on great thought.  
---
Let me rephrase that part as: "*I like the world building I've experienced in 76 better than in the parts of 4 I've experienced*"
---
I didn't know it froze scorchbeasts, that alone makes me wanna keep it 
---
Melee builds are boring.
---
So you're like a underpowered Negan from TWD series. Nice xD.
---
Yup.. Was with a group tonight and someone walked over with a HUD and we got a couple crashes, it's weird as hell
---
For real? Never paid attention to the cap reward even tho I did it 5 times now.
---
What, do you think this is rust? From a AAA dev? C'mon.
---
Obvious sarcasm. It would be neat to have planters.  Also, theyre in the game. You can find them inside a few buildings with labs. Shit, theyre in skyrim even.
---
Yeah, I take that statement back, then. Looks like I didn't visit the most interesting areas in Fallout 4.
---
For me as well. Another thing that Ive noticed, but havent seen any mention of: when loading in, itll show the pics on the loading screen, then the black loading screen (signifying im about to enter the server), but instead of it loading and trapping me motionless, as it was often doing before, it would go back to a very short pictured loading screen, then drop me in. It still takes a few for all the graphics to load in when this happens, but i havent been left motionless for a good bit now.
---
Apologies for the run-on.
---
Oh damn, much appreciated. Thanks, and thank you beer.
---
I'm down for launching a nuke. I've done it solo. It was fun. Can team up tonight if ur about. Anyone. Haha 
---
Of course nobody ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù it - it just made a stupid, low-level event slightly more interesting when you could shower the whole server with a mild XP buff. Bunch O stew in a processor at the end makes more sense, but is less fun.
---
Took me a while to realise this. Was always shooting them in the head. 
---
To copy-paste what I said to the last guy:  Y'know there are people out there who aren't you, right?
---
You want the toughest, manliest, most totally-secure-in-my-manhood-please-believe-me stuff you can get. I want redwood laminate flooring to put the finishing touch on my CAMP. Other people want pink dresses and Princess Castle Beds. Deal with it.
---
Yeah the brick wall interiors look terrible. 
---
If it helps, pretty sure i got them from Grahm, not watoga or harpers.
---
Yeah... Fallout 76 is honestly a beautiful game. People focused on what they wanted when it came out and not on the things Bethesda is good at. I definitely won't overlook glaring issues like bugs/exploits, but Bethesda did many things well. One of those things is "environmental storytelling", where they use placed objects (and often dead bodies) to tell a story. I felt like this game was one of the best times they used that to full effect; it's just a shame that many people gloss over that. 
---
C L O C H E  H A T
---
If there's no nukes happening, I prefer Watoga.  I probably get more legendary gear at Whitesprings, but 75% of them aren't lvl 45/50.  I got a TSE combat shotgun and said I'm RICH until I realized it was lvl 30.  I hung on to it, modded it with a suppressor, reflex sight, hardened receiver and hip fire pieces, and gave it away to the first &gt;50lvl player I saw using a shotgun that was willing to wave back at me.  They were really stoked and tried to give me the best stuff they had.  I took some ammo and salisbury steak, but making someone's day was more than enough reward.
---
The server disconnects I get seems to be related to CPU usage or Network, for some reason. If I try to stream the game, I get disconnected soon - I have a kind of shitty CPU (i5 3330) but a good internet, so disconnects might have something to do with my CPU.  
---
I'll write again after a few dozen hours of gameplay. I've played maybe 8 hours now. How do I see how many hours I've played the game?
---
I might have I'll check tomorrow when I'm on. 
---
That's because the load screens use your in-game snapshots. Those are kept, even if characters are deleted. (You took one each time you made a character.) The picture displayed isn't an indicator of which character you are loading.
---
LOL.  No sweat.  Buy me a round if you see me in game.  Shankwell on PC.  I'll buy the next.
---
\*Salutes\*!
---
My first character is an unstructured mess, my second (and third) are much more useful and fun to play with even though they're both &lt; L80.
---
‚ÄúI wanna one shot everybody, but I also wanna tank anybody else. I want Bethesda to allow only me to RP as a GOD‚Äù - everyone who wants to PVP
---
You are right. I just wanted to say that on first impression, it isn't as bad as people make it out to be - which I guess is a sentiment people share over here.  
---
I'll see if I can update and form an actual opinion in a couple of days.
---
Caravan would fun to play in 76. I used to play it IRL with my friends all the time. 
---
Very well designed Alex. Simple, intuitive and extremely aesthetically appealing. Will be using the character builder for sure! 
---
Yeah, sometimes my double Gatling gun large mag (750) gets swapped for my bloodied explosive prime .50 cal‚Äôs mag (250)...it‚Äôs amusing, and probably a bit of a DPS buff. Not quite sure why it‚Äôs happens, but a TS blackpowder with that bug would be fun.
---
You can get that in level 45 version. I only use it for the +1 strength now, but it's still an OK weapon. I just have a lot of better things now to use, but still carry it around for the +5 carry weight when necessary.
---
Isn't that why they've always been enemies in every Fallout game?  Their life is as valuable to me as a radroach.
---
Man, that looks great! I'd build at the Whitespring, but I can't give up my sweet lead deposit lmao.
---
Good work on that house!
---
Man you are a godsend, so tired of repeating the costs!
---
Mind copies / links with credit?

I saw these at a watch tower once. Each level had a different plant inside these rectangular planters. 
---
I'm so confused why they haven't opened these up for us to use. It's already in the game.... 
---
Yes, I got both when I killed him.
---
* role playing.  You are not rolling your play, you're playing your role.

What usually happens for me is that it'll take about a couple of minutes to load in, then drop me into the enviorment where I'll maybe be able to move in the first second before it freezes and reloads again. I'm on xbox and before the last update I didn't really have any big bug issues, but now I've had a half health scorchbeast queen gain full health, long loading times, and a dead scorchbeast crash land in my C.A.M.P.  Do you also play on Xbox? Maybe it's a xbox related issues as it seems that pc and ps4 users haven't been having too much trouble after the update.
---
Aye, thanks! Yeah, I can totally understand that - resources get a little scare sometimes. It just means I forfeit my legendary farming or caps farming and go out into the world and look for...springs...
---
Sure :D
---
Thanks.  It could have been me.  I just recently turned 42.  I play to decompress after work every night, and it's a real bummer to get a thorn in my side while I'm trying to relax.  I'm struggling in real life, and I'd rather not struggle in my free time.
---
I'd say it's there now. They've patched literally hundreds of bugs and closed loads of dupes and exploits. I see complaining about maybe a half dozen bugs here when it used to be dozens. Give credit where credit is due, I'd say.  Unless someone just can't find it in themself to acknowledge that they are putting work in.
---
I rate the game very highly and even I'll agree they should've had a longer beta and avoided the temptation of releasing for the holidays. (Insert cliche "hurr durr but da game is still in alpha" joke here.)
---
If they were here at release, there'd be much less bemoaning. But of course, it's Bethesda so people will always complain, some for legit reasons and for some just because they want to. 
---
Side note: Other massive multiplayer online games that people adore now had rough releases. No Man's Sky. ESO. GTA Online (Yes, it did. Look it up.) 
---
I give the game a year, year and a half before a lot of people finally put down their rage canvas bags and leave the "it just works" memes at the door and just play the damn game. Sure, there'll be people who are so grudged they just will not leave it alone. That sort of shit isn't helpful. It isn't constructive. It doesn't add anything to the conversation. But luckily, the rest of us who genuinely enjoy the game can tune it out and just play.
---
What Jedi said, plus, levels fly past pretty fast in FO76 so if you get a nice toy at level 25, it'll be fun for about 5 hours then you'll have outclassed it.
---
0ok thank you, this sounds plausible and I haven't done that quest yet. Thanks I will and do ..
---
Yeah got it on both my prime characters on my first kill, as /u/Shankwelle said, looks like you may have to drop a nuke first.
---
 Depends on the underarmor. The Enclave will show you the next mod available after you apply the one before. Then you can buy and apply it. BOS is the same I believe with Phoenix doing the sales. 
---
You know what's even sadder. People complaining about the microtransactions in the game because they dislike Fallout 76. They pretty much discourage you from buying atoms and you easily earn atoms in game so... They integrated it in fine.
---
Faction based PvP. 
---
I have been trying to figure this out as well. I remember some sort of area with a bunch of cabins and robots where they can be redeemed at a machine outside. 
---
Awesome! Let me know
---
Being a raider is about the desperation for resources and the nihilism that leads to a hatred and jealousy of traditional systems Justice and fairness.combined this desire for revenge against a cruel world with a gang mentality in which social capital is earned through cruelty.  And that cruelty serves as a subtle warning to other members of the gang that no one should dare turn on you.  compare that to someone who spent the last 25 years of their life being conditioned to believe that they have been prepared to reclaim the world and rebuild humanity.  So yeah griefers are not role playing, they just are raiders.
---
Donkey Kong sucks!
---
What was his issue with this hilarious photo? 
---
It's kinda different in this game, as opposed to dedicated PVP, tabletop roleplaying or theater.  In those instances, it's clearly delineated that your fellows are all participants and know that your shouting lines or headshot isn't actually malice directed towards them as a person.  In this particular game, aside from enabling pacifist mode and blocking others, you really can't opt out of someone messing with you aside from asking them to please move on or server swapping.
---
I'm fine with people roleplaying as a raider, I get the appeal, but if someone is clearly not interested in participating or asks you to please stop, move along.  
---
Some people are not into PvP but love Fallout games, or play video games to decompress after work.  Consider that someone might be an EMT or nurse, failed at resuscitating a little girl after a car accident that day, and the last thing they want is some teenager shooting up their house online.
---
Don't even think about posting this on r/fallout.
---
But fallout isn‚Äôt a serious game
---
Got a 3 start robot assassin chest piece you can have if you want 
---
When I started a new character pretty much as soon as I hit level 5 somebody was trying to slap damage me to death. So yeah. If you can only spawn at CAMP or Vault 76 a pair of griefers could easily spawn camp noobs.
---
You're dreams must be the least interesting part of a night's sleep then. 
---
She‚Äôs being the man
---
Well "deep" goes more for the average game instead tallking about RPG ones, however Fallout (bethesda's ones) still had a good balance between shooter mechanics with conversations... (of course it could be much better)
---
I mostly expected that if Bethesda was doing something with fallout, anything would be great, not all but anything, the problem is nothing is great, decent maybe but just not great...  I only wanted the PvE aspeect of the game while I could get some multiplayer interactions with people at the same time, (so more like a coop) but I anyways enjoy what a MMO could get (because MMO just goes for masive multiplayer online... the sad thing for me is it just takes the worst of the already known MMO games instead try to be just diferent)... 
---
But what I experience was:
---
\- Good starting point without care..
---
\- Terrible IA, fights, spawn mechanics,
---
\- Lost things from the franchise to be replaced by a multiplayer that focuses on grind.
---
\- Lore its less deeper, the only thing better than previous fallouts its that the stories of the places are better (moving closer to FF3) instead be like F4 wheree those were much less... almost gone.
---
\- Housing makes no real sense... or turrets or defenses not worth at all in the ecosystem (even on F4 were more useful) not eeven taking workshops (that anyways doesnt offer that much interest)
---
\- No "basic" features for this kind of game, and also related to RPs like you say... for example not even trying to add trading posts on your home, like some way to place an icon visible for the people...
---
\-Again, you was talking about "get clothes" tipycal for MMOs... herewith things like the stash llimit, make collections of things are more a pain than something interesting... I expected to store at least 4 complete armors, one of every diferent cloth of the game, and every power armor... its just imposible, I stilll keep the clothes and the power armors, no longer trying to get different armors (wood, metal, combat, robot) full on T3 (reinforced) because I know I will need to scrap them by inventory limits... aswell this limits makes every weapon you wncounter a pain to hold, limitating your "alternative builds" to the minimun...
---
And now, talking just about the roleplaying people... the server limit of 20 its just "sad" for any RP server, and will be sad aswell for a factional war setting... what would be the best a 5 vs 5 vs 5 vs 5?
---
I just see every p√≤sible alternative an looks better than the ending result of Fallout 76... Borderlands for example is only a coop game, but they can focus on the shooting mechanics... and they do it nice.... F76 shooting its not bad but the IA, the creatures and the variety of situations makes it a bad shooter... its like fighting against scorchedqueens bored and based on some artificial MMO generic things like random amount of people with random weapons and random lvls hoping to maybe have enough power to luckily finish the fight... removing all "survival" aspect of the game, and turning it from a "skilled game where you need to think what you do and acept your good and bad choices" to a generic MMOShooter where you dont need to think too much about if you were doing it well or not, you just get a % of the responsability so hey! dont get mad You tried!...   And this can be seen aswell on the No-longer-use of developing an alter or the No-matter-what-you-choose you will always be able to relocate your atributes... mostly again based on "how much time you put in the game".
---
I could feel more survival, more satisfation and way better and unpredictable enemies on the first 20 minutes on hardcore (the updated one) on F4 than on the whole playtime of F76 (I quited on lvl 68 i guess)
---
Im not too worry about F5 (well im now worry on all the bethesda games, but because the way they developed this, not because I dont like it, but because it looks like a just too lazy development, I still thin that eeven if the games "survives" some time Its not going to be for long... I dont think that much amount off RPs will be able to keep this game, and I also dont think bethesda will give a fuck of it once people start forgeting the release... to begin with the  way they patched the game was a shame, no matter if this was for chrismas or when... still terrible bug ands lot of time for every single tweek.
---
I dont know for how much time did you play the game, I hope you enjoy it, but I just cant play more the game, For me its just terrible to see on every place shadows of what could it been instead.
---
have fun, and thanks for not being that kind of classic reddit usser that just hates every comment he is not agree with (not talking about the karma at all but the way to receive a debate)
---
When I started a new character pretty much as soon as I hit level 5 somebody about 2 to 3 times my level was trying to slap damage me to death. So yeah. If you can only spawn at CAMP or Vault 76 a pair of griefers could easily spawn camp noobs.
---
oh I have long since stopped using crafting food, &gt;&lt; i'm only eating pre-war noms, no expirey
---
LOL. I trolled one out of that fissure today. Was that your high end ass watching my level 45 guy in Combat Armor almost bring down a level 68 Scorchy. She ran at 10% and went back in her fissure. She don't like my sword with all that armor pen. He used 2 stimpacks and took little real damage. That BOS Heavy Combat Armor is sweet.  
---
 He put down 2 more at the Service Entrance at Whitespring but the staff got in on those.
---
 I have the dense mod for the chest but I'm saving it for the level 50 set. its hard to come by.
---
But not where it will bounce. 
---
Past fallouts and elder scrolls told me expansive stories with main and side quest. Reading stuff was a plus if you wanted, this game its reading to get basic info.
---
No. I've done it multiple times. It improves performance of your system, albeit temporarily. 
---
Just saying, the fish lamp is underrated and I love main. 10/10 best atom shop item and cheap too. 
---
Looks like bait to see how much hate you'll get.
---
It's alright though because you just need the hero doctor to come to the rescue. Obscure reference.. üòè 
---
I have a lvl 85, lvl 75, lvl 41 all 3 different builds just so I don't get bored.
---
Sorry no PC , does it not support cross play ? :( 
---
I've been having fun building inside locations which have quests because if someone else does them you get XP just for sitting around at home repairing armor or crafting or etc. 
---
I'd love to see it if you feel safe adding xa0t1ca. Not a griefer and only lvl 41 anyway ;)
---
Gwent! Oh wait...
---
Maybe I‚Äôm in the minority, but I suggest you hold onto the items for a really long time, then sell them. I just have the overall market economy in mind, that‚Äôs all. Either give them to friends who won‚Äôt sell, or hold them is my suggestion. Either way, enjoy your loot. IMO you earned it, what a story!
---
I mean the large area around Vault 76 where you cannot nuke. If you look at the map when launching one, you will see what I mean. They will probably do something similar to that where Survival PvP is not allowed within that zone and is only "invitational" PvP.
---
Congrats? 
---
Yes this is another example of what I am talking about.  This is what I mean by drops getting worse.  As I remember, in the past legendary enemies ALWAYS dropped something legendary. 
---
Was pure shit more often than not, but you'd get a legendary pole hook or rolling pin or something like that and it would be high level if found in a high level area. 
---
More recently, legendary enemies often drop nothing legendary and when they do, it's level 20 item in a level 50 area of the map.
---
I might start a new character after seeing this
---
I took my B.E.T.A. Character to lvl 30 by the time the game went public,   Created a new character and go to lvl 40 before I created my current character, now at lvl 62, but having much more fun with the game now that I have slowed down a bit.  The ‚Äúhidden‚Äù story line is pretty good and somehow I seem to lvl up faster when I am it trying to lvl up while having a much better game..
---
You‚Äôre a genius. I never thought of this but, my god it‚Äôd be sweet. I‚Äôd build a special room for this. 
---
Bad post
---
Also on a pole/skelly at the Freak Show.
---
How about if you want to role play a raider, you limit yourself to raider gear? Much more immersive and lore-friendly, wouldn't you say?
---
I'm 317 and have barely scratched the surface of the game, done only 2 quest lines...   
---
Really considering doing the same..
---
YESSSSS, this!
---
I spent so long looking for these the other day. I was sure they mousy exist and it was me being stupid!!!!
---
Fans: overwhelmingly ask for one thing
---
Devs: lol
---
Bethesda is taking notes from Disney I see
---
All these people going out of their way to help other people. How bothersome \* eyeroll \*.
---
LOL, sure ok dude.
---
disable legendaries entirely or nerf them by at least 90% in survival servers, so the "end game content" remains intact but won't give you a monstrous edge in pvp.
---
not ironic, just trolling
---
Same. Feel free to add xa0t1ca if you wanna swap. I'm level 41 currently and have duplicate plans and etc
---
You barely have to move it. You just have to pay the caps. 
---
I'll stick to selling golf outfits for 27 caps a piece lol
---
Bethesda doesn't seem competent enough to pull it off.
---
Bugs modders fixed in fallout 4 that are still not fixed here. Hmm
---
This post makes me want to grief now
---
1) Not knowing the difference between role and roll
---
2) Crying about how other people play and not using the mechanics in place to protect yourself.
---
You are like those low level guys running around nuke zones without passive on hitting people, getting hit by my plague walker screeching because of your fault because you die every time you come near me
---
I bought mine for 2k each. Seems expensive.
---
It's one of those things I think didn't need fixing, much like Mama Dolce's event. 
---
Just seems like enough vector for griefers to exploit.
---
Besides for the old part (25) that is pretty spot on. The only reason I was up there and took those workshops was to have encounters with people. Was super excited when that dude showed up and adventured with me.
---
cool
---
I have to read that book.
---
OP.  Effects all PA
---
Check out this post I out up the other day, trying to get a community managers attention, but I not only isolated the problem but think I found a fix.    
---
[Bug Fix] Pretty sure I just figured out the cause of the PowerArmor Targeting HUD CTD's AND THE FIX.
---
 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/
---
yea i mean there are easy ways to fix that, you can make it for example that they cant switch to non-passive unless they are at their CAMP, or unlesss they are a certain distance from another player. 010101 is right though, if they did away with slaps completely but made passive fully passive, it would fix alot of issues ( one of the biggest being that you can't defend yourself in pvp if you are flagged and someone is coming to attack you until they attack you first )
---
I imagine that the second playthrough was the intended way that Bethesda wanted you to play it.
---
I've been playing that way from the beginning and it's been pretty good. Love some of the story moments in the game, even more than other Fallout games.
---
Not all the terminals and notes are great but there's a lot of good things to find if you take the time to look for it.
---
I know I wouldn‚Äôt touch Survival without a TSE ready to go...
---
Lol my phone didn't load all the comments, otherwise I wouldn't have linked my own post, thanks for sharing it, still hoping someone in Bethesda will stop ignoring it... They were tagged by a few different people
---
For english not being your first language, your use of grammar is better than most Americans.
---
 Happy Gaming
---
well for any good system, you shouldn't be able to 1 shot anyone ever. HOpefully once TSE weapons are fixed that won't be able to happen, but if it is, then there needs to be some balance changes in pvp (irrespective of flagging and slapping )
---
Congrats!!
---
I still haven't looted a TSE and I'm level 317, lol
---
Sounds like it's gone, sadly. Hope you get it back somehow!
---
 Appreciate it!0
---
They're not hard to find. Power stations are good sources for 100% cores. Battle Bots event in the Ash heap seems to always get me at least 3 cores.
---
Power armour frames fusion generators around the place aren't bad either as an emergency supply but find them not consistent enough to rely on long term.
---
It can, because if they don't know what they're talking about and they cause enough evonomic damage to a good game then Bethesda are less likely to make more like it.
---
Me too.
---
I'm pretty new to the game so please enlighten me. Why was Whitesprings constantly nuked?
---
Its part of the game deal with it dont like it go play fallout 4
---
&gt;Also, why do Atom Shop items take up Budget? Do you NOT want us buying more?
---
They can't afford to feed more than 5 hamsters to power their servers. One more glowing map and all of Appalachia will disconnect.
---
No weapons or armour, everyone runs around naked and slaps each other
---
Mate, the number of clickbait articles churned out defending Mass effect 3 was massively disproportionate to the amount of hate AND the problems the game had at the time.  This is the opposite.  Also yes, that is how the world works.  Marketing doesn't always play fair.
---
I think I have some on my main. PM me if you still need them. Also if you have Stone wall plans that would be dope.
---
Still say it was a huge mistake to "fix" that quest... I mean FFS it was "Feed the people"!
---
Keep shooting and make sure you have pacifist off and all related weapon perks on and also put on fireproof
---
If you're on PC, I'll happily provide fire support for a bunker run and offer advice on what you need to do next while you take the lead on the experience of the process.  If you actually do the process, you'll know exactly what to do on the next run.  My first launch the guy I was teamed up with graciously did the lion's share of the tasks and told me what he was doing, but I forgot most of it when I tried a solo drop and ran around like a fool while burning up tons of ammo on respawning enemies.
---
ig: Shankwell
---
As an FYI, bring lots of ammo, rad chems and have fully repaired gear preferably at 100+ condition when starting the process of a launch.  You're going to fight a LOT of tough robots.  (I have a troubleshooters/vats acc/+1 ag handmade that I specifically keep for dropping a nuke or helping someone do it) Site Charlie is also ideal, because it's the closest to fast travel to the SBQ after you launch.  You'll have opportunities to repair your gear in the silo, and I highly recommend topping off your guns immediately after launch.
---
Also, try to keep Survey Camp Alpha or Forward Station Delta just out of the blast zone.  It makes for a much easier success on Scorched Earth.  A handful of chameleon snipers parked on top of a shack or trailer that don't have to worry about trash mobs and can focus on picking at the SBQ while she's flying makes a huge difference.  If I'm on the ground, half of my time is spent getting crickets and scorched out of my ass.
---
"I find it hard to believe that every single one of you read and think about what you chose to say in a conversation with every NPC you bumped into."  
---
I can only speak for myself, but... not only did I read and consider every word, I also continuously saved in the event that I might want to roll back any one of those interactions and change my mind. However, I'm also a fast reader, have been a paid writer, like to read books IRL vs just in Skyrim or etc.  
---
"I can do this because I don't have a bunch of useless shit in my inventory all the time."  
---
Well, if your goal is to build the ultimate disco dance club so that you can wear your maniacal cat costume &amp; host an in-game music event, that stuff isn't useless to you. ;)  
---
It's also not useless if you prefer to craft and/or modify specific weapons in specific ways vs playing with whatever happens to randomly drop or be in a store.
---
Make it so you cannot change modes for 5 or so minutes after doing it. Or killing a player locks you into the PvP mode for 15 minutes or as long as you have your Bounty. 
---
South of Green Bank Telescope! East part of the map!
---
I've got a post up, I think I found and have a fix for the PA HUF issue, and the worst part is it actually effects people around you.  
---
Pushing to try and get a community manager to respond  
---
I guess that your attackers were wearing armor with the sentinel effect. You can basically resist 90% pvp damage with that legendary effect and some perks.
---
Sure! happy to invite anyone to the hunter/hunted matches I put together. 
---
don't know about the SBQ but in general they go after whoever is dealing the most damage.
---
They had a build with superior defenses pretty much.
---
Ok that neon sign Kill Laugh Love has got to happen like now!
---
Not worried about how often that place get nuked?
---
I feel like this is the answer.  Even with the SBQ, I'm doing the most damage and she will always turn to me and swipe.  She also has a tendency to land directly on top of me.
---
Yeah I woulda enjoyed it more after multiple patches came out. And added gameplay enhances.
---
You don‚Äôt know that for sure.
---
He/she could still be just an asshole.
---
What's dumb is you still get a bounty if you get a QUEST to get the drop. Like, what the fuck, the game tells you to do something, and you get punished for it, with zero fucking warning? Fire the idiot who came up with THAT fucking system.
---
REKT
---
Just go round and claim loads of workshops and do events, I got that plan a lot doing that 
---
Hmm, not particularly! Don't know why, but I've only seen two or three nukes dropped in the past week. And they've always been at the Fissure Site Prime. Though, I'm not keen for the day I need to fully repair this C.A.M.P...
---
You scrap weapons for them. So you will need to pick up hunting rifles take them back to your base then scrap them. 
---
Great game, Godawful marketing
---
What? You get your fun out of intentionally making sure other people have _less_ fun. You go out of your way to provoke and attack people who _don't want to do that shit_. 
---
That makes you a _shitty person_. You, a person outside the game, get your joy making sure other real people have a _bad time_. 
---
That makes you a _shitty fucking person_. 
---
It is what it is. 
---
I would, but this isn't the _fucking trade forum_. I don't go to trade forums and give people shit, I only do it _here_ in a place that _isn't_ a fucking trade forum. 
---
You might not like it, but PvP is legitimately the fastest way to earn caps in the game. 
---
Other than that, you're really just stuck with daily cap limit if you're hitting up all the vendors.
---
I usually use raw flux, bulk adhesive, ultrcite.
---
Give me a glowing ghoul skin for my character! 
---
Will pay cash! 
---
Me too, second cahracter is more roleplay and I gave him some limitatiosn: only pistols and grenadas, no PA, lots of drugs and alcohol. Great fun so far.
---
That sounds pretty standard for me, honestly. 
---
The game is bad. It's shit. That really isn't a debatable stance. I mean, you can try and argue against it.. But it'd be like trying to argue that the earth is 6000 years old. There some arguments you can win. Some you can't. And the notion that 76 is not a bad game, is an argument you will never win
---
You might wanna make sure you're comfortable because that's a looong way off bro.
---
The fuck have you done to go to.level 317 without doing quests/exploring? Not being judgemental here, I'd legit want to understand. Why did you buy an RPG game to just go level up mode?
---
Don‚Äôt get butthurt bro, just calling you out. :)
---
I play both, changes pace and in some games it influences dialogue ect. 
---
Not anything overly deep to it, just abit of a different experience. 
---
Maybe it was the mod.
---
dat ass
---
hmm i wonder this my self as a guy all i can think is mabye a uniqe butiful character either for a love intrest posibily just cause they can.
---
I've only done (and I'm serious) the Raider Rose Quest line and the Enclave Quest line..  Weird right.  
---
I'm a old school vet of MMO's and had myself in a PA frame 20 minutes into the BETA ignoring all the quests and just started exploring and murdering the wildlife in the savage divide area from 5'ish... I've not touched the NE or SE, and have been exactly 2 places in the Ash Heap..  
---
So I guess I'm short, yes because I'm hard wired that way and figured I'd either return and do the whole story once I got comfortable and God like (which ironically was around Lvl 40, and no, didn't have a TSE) or more likely on a second character
---
Just nuked it, killed the hostage. That's not two front, that's use of excessive force!
---
That might work for you but I have several suits which are higher level than me and I can't collect them once placed. This means I have to sit around and guard the suit for a minute and a half which is especially stressful at train stations where other players are likely to stumble across it.
---
Agree
---
I upvoted the moment you said his name. I love that dude and i rewatch the show alot when i am down.
---
Nightmare! I feel ya bro. It shouldn't be the case though. Even right now I just got kicked, had a crazy long load time to get back in and then got a server DC as soon as I got back in.
---
 Great when you are about to complete heart of the enemy and have to do it all over again. üòíüòÇ
---
I played one in the Division. I had a story in my head so roleolayed it out. Then played wildlands and recreated my character on that too. 
---
Silver for you.
---
Because maths.
---
I just want Maxson‚Äôs battlecoat or something similar to it, Riot Armor from NV and a Chinese Stealth Suit. I‚Äôd be complete. 
---
So you spend your life living fancy in a vault with all the commodities and the second you get out you blow the brains of your neighbours and eat his guts? 
---
Well roleplaying makes sense. But I still don't understand why one change would change gender in an imaginary scenario. It's just foreign to me 
---
this Order of Mysteries member approves of your efforts!
---
In age of connan for example, it really makes sense, i mean, you dont want to be looking at a large dong the whole game
---
It's a solid base from which to grow.
---
flux is coming from plants inside the Blast zone right? 
---
i kinda wish they'd fix it myself
---
Thank you for the list!
---
Yea
---
i see, i'll try to hoard junks this full week then try sell them next week then haha :) thanks alot
---
thank you so much for the information :) ill try to get those once there's a blast zone
---
Your first shot back at them is sometimes only slap damage in my experience. Your second and third shots do full damage. Try using a higher fire rate gun or only switch to a low fire rate gun (Dragon for example) after you‚Äôve fired back with another gun.
---
You basically have to flag yourself for PvP by shooting back, and your shot back is often considered slap by the server due to lag or some other issue. I find that my second shot on someone that has attacked me is often the first one that does full damage. Kind of sucks this way but that‚Äôs what we got. 
---
Its thematically accurate to be throwing away weapons, food and medicine in the post apocolipse because your one box is full? Seems like an odd way to rebuild a country...
---
North of Barton greens and West of Morgantown is a cattery house stacked with plastic cat bowls.
---
Get the marine tactical helmet plan and farm rubber from Grafton high school and glass from garrahan estate penthouse. The helmets are cheap to craft and get you 29 caps each from the vendors.
---
Yea no problem, and remember to use Hard Bargain and Green Thumb 
---
Uh, they still spawn for awhile after a nuke disappears. 
---

Make it like survival on fo4 making damage and health lower for both players and monsters. limit legendarys too one effect. That would help prevent pvp from being unbalanced. I would say the biggest factor is nerfing the players. So combat feels like a fight and not just 3 seconds of panic. Player's that make tank builds can still be one shot. It defeats the purpose of making a tank build. Basically just alot of nerfing. The damage nerf from being out of pvp combat can't stop being one shot.
---
Depends on the game, ie. Mass Effect, the female sheperd was just a hell of a lot better voice actor than the male one, found him to be quite boring monotone. Since then its just become habit to play females as I do tend to find them more interesting 
---
As far as I know Serendipity does not work with PA....but I‚Äôm not sure
---
Probably a Albino Grafton monster, since it's got blowholes. 
---
If you've ever played Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer, it's almost the same satisfying TCHUNK- from the Saber assault rifle. 
---
I found it a Fort Defiance, in a little room that's only accessible by being in the top floor, walking across the hallway and drop to a small ledge with a door next to it. It's kind hard to describe it perfectly since it's a big place. But you can just walk down the big hallways, looking for a Door that has only a small ledge in front of it, meaning you can only get there by dropping from above it.
---
Thanks! Once I saw the beard and the harpoon together the rest of the concept pretty much wrote itself.
---
I wanted to know about this too actually, I saw those awhile back! Just like your encounter, they were only on bodies and couldn't be looted.
---
I was wondering if its based on damage but that brings me to my next problem. When I attack the SBQ with my friends she still attacks me mostly even when my friends use two shot explosive shotguns that do about 1000 damage per hit and I use a gatling gun that does about 400 damage per shot. So either my friend are poor shots (theres no doupt about that) or I'm just an asshole who thinks that everything bad happends to me xD
---
Very cool!
---
I'd really like to know that too. Sold mine a while ago and now regretting it. 
---
Because those people aren't cheating. It's officially not forbidden to place your camp there and you won't get any xp for the kills made by turrets.
---
I don‚Äôt. 
---
Have these items been repaired last 100%? Items that have above 100% condition have a slightly thinner, lighter bar superimposed on the darker, normal condition bar. The lighter bar decreases first until, at 100% and below, only the normal, darker bar is visible, at which point it will decrease when condition deteriorates.
---
Because it really doesn't matter and sometimes you like a bit of variety in the characters you walk around as. 
---
that doesn't work because alot of people thought they experienced the trade stealing bug which basically ended up with so little evidence that most people consider it to be fake now.   
---
The reason why it doesn't work is because something can appear to happen to someone but the underlying reason is unknown to them. Someone can be killed by what they thought was slap damage, but its entirely possible it wasn't slap damage and was instead related to some bug that resulted them in being flagged, or even a non-bug thing but potentially bad game mechanic like they accidentally attacked someone's corn.
---
I literally just got this. I found it at mount blair trainyard (which is just south of the massive digger in the southwest of the map) I found it on the roof of the most southernly building. Its random were it spawns but its possable for it to spawn there 
---
Smaller target
---
Variety would be getting to play as a ghoul or super mutant or robot/synth. Theres only 2 genders in game, seems like it's there to include everyone, not for variety.
---
Same hit box
---
Clothes
---
Pornhub
---
So far you're the only poster list legitimate reasons for selecting a female. I might not agree, but I can respect honest answers 
---
Because women are superior.
---
But I wanna believe
---
Sexist 
---
Oh yes this is me too. Walks under the starlight, reading the poems and stories. Role playing as an actual survivor. Mostly alone.  
---
and proud of it.
---
You might try new Vegas. Not bad.
---
Weird flex. But ok
---
Lol not every guy wants to jack off 24/7 you know. There‚Äôs plenty of females that enjoy looking at men‚Äôs ass. Can‚Äôt one appreciate the curvature of a computer generated female ass?  
---
Pretty sure I picked up a second set yesterday. Pm your gamer tag and they're yours
---
yeah, you can also stack 100 bobbleheads for the effects ;)
---
Yep bugged for everyone. You can trying logging a ticket. It's only 30c
---
Technically all asses you seen on the internet are computer generated. Also, no one said you couldn't. 
---
If you‚Äôre making a commando build, i don‚Äôt think you wanna be waddling around in a dress for extra perception
---
Technically your full of shit but people are still here trying to make sense of it all 
---
Zero quests?
---
Maaaan that's a lie.
---
No npc? You got to learn to add "human" in that sentence. There are Npc. 
---
The overseer is an Npc, you don't have to meet her to feel her presence in the game.   
---
The vendor bots are as much Npc than many of the people in diamond city and they have better catchphrase than your father in 3.
---
Rose is an Npc.
---
The issue is not with NPC's, but with the lack of choice in the quests, that is, the fact you cannot decide to be "good" or "evil". I'd like to have the option to prevent people from shooting nukes. I'd like to have the option to prevent people from producing food, or repairing shit.
---
Wait until you see someone one shot the queen. 
---
He shows up a lot, but he doesn‚Äôt always pick you up. Makes me sad lol 
---
Say you do not have enough resources to build a plan entirely, but you have some. It would be great if the plan could still be applied partially, starting at the foundations and going up, skipping items you can't afford to build.
---
Did you read the plan or is it still in your inventory?
---
Well, the truth is that I create a story to my every character and one of my stories about is a manhating lesbian and her girlfriend(my friend), and they hunt men(literally) at the Wasteland.
---
As well as vendors, I hop/visit the known cap stash locations, with the cap perk they add up quickly. Also SMs drop caps, but those spawns and Whitespring ghouls drop caps,.
---
I get loads of caps while just  legendary hunting, I keep bouncing off max caps and I am always buying plans etc...
---
It‚Äôs not stated on the card so it ‚Äúshould‚Äù work with PA. If it does not it might be another bug ? 
---
If anyone has more info on this i m interested!
---
Protip: the real fun isn‚Äôt the pvp itself, but seeing your pvp cause rage like this. 
---
selling drugs also works fairly well
---
We know. We didn't need thread number 3048205 about it
---
did u still want any serums?
---
did you still want any serums?
---
&gt; I think that people are tired of all of these always online multi-player games that can be stuffed with micro-transactions.
---
There is a shop.  That sells things that have no effect on gameplay. And you get free tokens for the shop by playing.  That's *stuffed*?
---
Then why are you here? Oh yes, because you're a troll with nothing better to do. Sad.
---
Same, idiots will be idiots, spent an hour collecting resources and repairing everything. Always store your arch away until Bethesda comes up with a way to prevent it.
---
Ah West Tek... I see you're a man of culture.
---
thanks for the tip! i'll definitely try this as soon as i get home..
---
by the way the im hitting Level 50 soon, do you think the helmet plan will spawn or is it level restricted? (hoping its not XD)
---
Legitimately in any game where I have played as a female character, is just I would rather watch a female character through cutscenes. Or how the armor looks on females, and because of mods. (Soooooo many mods) . IMO Guys just look boring, while mod authors, or character creators just spend more time designing woman clothes, armor. 
---
The wasteland is a harsh place.  
---
this is what i am doing at the moment, i found a lot of buffouts and other chems... been selling those since i'm not using that much :)
---
thanks for the tip! :)
---
Single player only no chance to go all crazy multiplicative
---
Because they didn't think this through and figured PVEVP would be something meaningful and epic, not a buncha bored PVP players hanging out with an even larger buncha PVE players going about their business and ignoring or avoiding them.  So the PVP players go after the only action they can consistently get.
---
Really hope they realize the next logical step after the unrestricted PVP in survival mode is to remove PVP entirely from adventure mode.  Should've been a simultaneous step, really, but I'm just hoping they take that step at all.
---
Same.  I learned it for the achievement and remember it being really fun.  
---
yeah been hunting SupMuts for caps. 
---
i don't know much on the stash locations but i'll definitely check and try this tip :)
---
The playerbase is already split.  PVP players want an experience that is very different from what PVE players want.  And since PVE players will enable pacifist mode, and block, and relocate or server-hop, the only way they could be more split is if they were on different servers.
---
If they were on different servers, PVP players would be grouped with other PVP players and get the experience they want.  Meanwhile, PVE players would be grouped with PVE players, and get their experience without having PVP players slap them around or level their camps.
---
It's a playerbase that really has to be split, because they're just frustrating each other.
---
Yes that is it, right next to the spawn point. Still no wiser as to why they put it there.
---
Go for the golf outfits in Whitesprings. They sell pretty high for what each one weighs.
---
Chems you don't need as well
---
How much ya paying can build or mod if you have piece 
---
I haven‚Äôt bothered with them you should not even be able to see this post sorry 
---
Have a good day 
---
When I visit the Enclav bunker via the service entrance there are 2 stashed within 30 seconds of each other, with perk there is usually 100 -150+ right there, hop repeat....
---
Geez that does suck. There's kind of an unspoken code when multiple groups are farming whitesprings. Conditions permitting, people should let as many people as possible tag the legendaries. Also people should try to avoid explosives if they can as it messes with the bodies.
---
Sorry you had a bad play session my man. I hope the next one is better!
---
I'll trade mine 
---
I'll mod anything you got for free
---
I think that this doesn‚Äôt show that we need more storage space but that there‚Äôs too much stuff.  It‚Äôs a post-apocalyptic wasteland.  Things should be much more rare.  
---
Wait, you got disconnects in FO4 and FO3?  
---
Maybe you mean CTDs?
---
I just need the paint,  I'll give you 125 caps per piece
---
I prefer female characters. I had a male and female character in FO4, but female characters are just more fun to play and dress.  Just like TombRaider, you only get to play as a female. 
---
Nice thing of course, you can choose which and you not restricted. I have basically 10 female characters and probably won't bother with a male character.
---
As someone else said, doesn't really matter, it's just a character and has no real relevance ...
---
I only need the paint job
---
pretty sure on ps4 it's kosher 
---
Do you have the BOS paint? 
---
This is just somebody trying to achieve the same results as [here](https://redd.it/agjtzm). 
---
Poor baby
---
One additional bit that is interesting, when I went back to look at it just now on this occasion it was wearing a Trilby hat which you could take? So odd.
---
Me too, I think it's better than fallout 4. Fallout 4s story to me was just so bad and boring, nothing like the other games. No RPG in it. Just an action game with extra steps, trying to hide behind the names of the other games. At least this doesn't hide. All I enjoyed in fallout 4 was exploring and crafting and leveling, which so far I think 76 does better at anyway. 
---
Fallout New Vegas will always be my favourite game though with fallout 3 close behind.
---
If it makes you feel any better the two-shot launcher probably would've just put the second shot at your feet to instantly kill you. The laser Gatling you missed out on is woefully underpowered and would break before you cleared the parking lot of WestTek.
---
Save yourself some pain and completely forget about the Whitespring. There are easier and more rewarding ways to get XP and legendaries. Try a cranberry bog circuit.
---
Are you on rn? 
---
sometimes if someone else has already disabled themon the terminal they dont respawn. figured this out yesterday with my friend, he checked the terminals and the turrets were all disabled, probably some other player had tried to go through but had given up because of the massive amount of robots at the time
---
I have seen a few of those suits at vendors, as newer players find new gear they tend to sell them...
---
Yea, I think when most people started on release and saw there was no push to talk feature they just turned it off and have never looked back.
---
I can be
---
Don't pay $10K for it, rather find someone selling it for a low price of around $2K or less. I got two for free from someone I met. Also something I saw today, they heavy on your budget for your camp, I had about 10 letters and looked like it took a good 1/4 of my build budget .. I will have to test it and see if this is the case. Anyway just find someone selling them for cheap and make sure you have a 3 level buying card.
---
Can you get on? 
---
damn b 
---
I have a female character. I do enjoy responding yes in a big bubba voice when they ask if im actualy a girl. I don't realy have a reason why or can think of any reason why not. Don't realy care either let them play as they see fit. Not like any one is being hurt.
---
If you enter and leave trading with him, let him walk a bit and repeat, you can hold him for a good 30 mins or so normally, possibly longer but I have never needed to do it longer..
---
I've held him for an hour before, but apparently he despawns at Poseidon. Good to know, I guess...
---
Go to Fort Defiance. Run Line in the Sand.
---
Sorry : (
---
Didn't expect that to happen, either.
---
Too Literary; Didn't Read. 
---
it‚Äôs all good √∫w√π 
---
Ok, will keep that in mind. Built my base on one of his known routes, he hasn't turned up since. I must have lowered the tone of the neighbourhood...
---
Again as soon as threads of criticism appear the "im having a blast"threads pepper the front page. While I know people maybe having fun, this subreddit always appears its being astroturfed massively.
---
&gt;why one change would change gender in an imaginary scenario
---
have you played the Mistress of Mystery questline yet?
---
Ouch dude, put the controller down. Walk it off. 
---
Gotta say I do like 1. The Nuka Cola stash, and 2. The Nuka Quantum sign, basically anything nuka-cola related I approve 
---
I've encountered that before in a silo. It was really strange. I tended to use them to wipe out a good deal of the robots. That seems like a good explanation though. Haha. Ty
---
Really recommended. Pick a concept and just run it from there. Leave 'Tutorial' (Flatwoods); point yourself into a direction you haven't explored before on another character and go wild. :)
---
Some good suggestions here but a lot of them are dependent on your build, at level 50 you might not have all the beneficial perks.
---
The easiest sustainable way to make caps is to use alts to maximise the amount you can sell to vendors each day. If you don't have a friend to help you transfer items or a second account to do it yourself then this will not be possible.
---
I try to make sure my characters have at least 5 Charisma (most of the time Lone Wanderer and Travel Agent equipped). If you can get the Civil War Outfit plan and the Marine Tactical Helmet plan then at  5 Charisma you will get 22 caps per outfit and 28 per helmet meaning that selling 4 of each to a vendor is 200 caps exactly. This means you can do the vendoring really quickly as you don't have to think about how many of each bulk item you can sell. It also makes cloth, gold, glass, plastic and rubber much more valuable than their bulked vendor price.
---
If you can't craft these items then loot the Golf outfits from Whitesprings. There should be 11 I think on a full lap and at 5 Charisma they vendor for 25 each, so again just spam clicking 8 to the vendor will exhaust all 200 caps in mere seconds. Unfortunately everybody knows about this now so I rarely even bother looking for them anymore.
---
For caps stash farming you will need the Cap Collector perk to make it worthwhile. There are loads of Youtube vids on good locations for these. Maybe add in the perception perks to help locate caps stashes and bobbleheads too as they sell for 22 caps with 5 Charisma.
---
Ditto, he's shown up like three times in the last month. Where'd you build?
---
Just SE of Grafton Dam on the river right next to the road he mooches along...
---
two shots have notoriously bad accuracy. don't be surprised if they only hit 2 or 3 pellets out of the 9(?)
---
and even then it's probably just the explosion radius rather than the pellet itself. you have to mod them properly or else they perform rather poorly.
---
and when I said damage I actually meant DPS. if you're consistently hitting her for, say, 800 every second (with the speedy receiver), she's probably gonna target you instead of your tse shotgun friends unless one of them lands a perfect hit.
---
Fkn hell wth you doing w all that useless junk?
---
On the plus side, every now and then when I fast travel back the mothman is getting spanked by my turret....
---
I found my best weapons at no nuked whitespring
---
I had rank 3 and he showed up a TON.  Like.  A TON.
---
I would definitely take only the first ranks of the Slugger perks and bring along Blocker and Travelling Pharmacy. You'll still one shot pretty much everything.
---
I'd also get rid of some Endurance points, only take rank 1 of Adrenaline and make room for a few levels of Makeshift Warrior in Intelligence as you're playing melee.
---
So, you on xbox?  Wanna Robin hood one of those 50 Cal's my way?
---
I use Gatling against SBs and the Queen and it seems she does prefer such players, probably because a long range Gatling with buffed accuracy from Stabilized does most damage to her while in air. She then lands and starts tickling me why I shoot her in the face. Then the TSE players eventually come in and she switches targets.
---
Vault 76 survived ... but now we locked ourselves out so whe ll die anyway
---
This reminds me of the time I had a scorchbeast dead to rites. I was certain that it'd be my first solo kill. 
---
Everything was going great, all the robots around Watoga were distracting it and then rather than deal with the big flying monster devastating them from the skies the robots near me just suddenly start to target me at range and melee.
---
The Scorchbeast was at a sliver of health and started to fly away. Nothing I did could get in that last shot. VATS was useless even though I was pointing up into the sky. Couldn't even handle manual shooting with all the staggers.
---
Thankfully I didn't die to the robots but I get it's so frustrating when you're so damn close and everything seems against you.
---
Meant to mention this in my other post but yeah, wear armor with +1 Charisma or even Unyielding pieces, take a Grape Mentats and a beer, a Charisma Bobblehead is you have one lying around then talk to the vendor, the price will be much lower then.
---
Happened to me also. I just kinda have the other power armor to a friend. Report the glitch you won‚Äôt be banned don‚Äôt worry. If you made 1000 power armor then maybe 
---
I‚Äôm going to guess they left it out due to the amount of other things that ‚Äúmust be placed in dirt‚Äù that could be worked around with garden plots. water purifier? Indoors. Fertiliser farm? Indoors. Whilst I‚Äôm sure they could flag it as not allowing such in a planter it‚Äôs probably an amount of effort the devs aren‚Äôt willing to expend at this time.
---
I've been trying to replace accidentally scrapped firebreather/responder paramedic gear for ages.  I message 4-5 people per playthrough, no one will sell it.  An add on fo76bazaar got not bites.  Only way to reliably get it is get an alt through the quest and find a friend.
---
You'll just need to wait it out, raise a ticket if you get banned, but I think that's very unlikely to be honest....
---
Thank you. My friend has a lakeside camp. The flamingos are coming.
---
Don't worry, I only have 2.
---
It has to be pure laziness. The planters were in 4 and caused little issues.
---
Unless you dupe a ridiculous amount of items, it's highly unlikely that you'll raise any flags. Don't worry.
---
I just don't wanna get in trouble for owning duped items. I probably own some that I don't even know about
---
Banned no response, I‚Äôve been banned for 5 days nonword that means they have wiped my Bethesda account along with others who got no reply within 4 days all that grinding for nothing, 
---
They need to take a leaf out of rockstars book and strip all the stacked items out of the inventory give a weekly ban absolutely disgraceful worst AAA title game publishers unprofessional and lazy 
---
This is fascinating to read. This was how I play all Fallout games, just wandering round discovering stuff, and haven't bought 76 yet because of all the bad stuff being said. This has made me think I should pick it up. 
---
I agree, if is a good game...However, why are we still having server issues and basic mechanic issues 3 months after release? It isn't good enough. I play when I can but have a lot of work and family commitments,  so I am only level 25. I have found that most sessions are plagued with disconnects, invisible friends and being attacked while stuck on a loading screen. I just turned on for a session and was instantly attacked and killed before I could even move and defend myself. Really?! RDR2 online is in Beta and is more stable. 
---
This is an online only game that I spent good money on (I bought the helmet edition, mock me if you must) and the more I play, the more I feel ripped off compared to other titles (and previous Fallout titles!). So basically, I like the game but know it can be even better. Rant over. 
---
i play on pc
---
Ah, I planted myself near the Top of the World, near the Wendigo Cave. Maybe if you shift there you'll have more luck?
---
You get 100 for the Countdown quests too, but if you‚Äôre doing it for caps, you‚Äôre doing it wrong. 
---
The exploration is top notch. One of my favorite maps ever in an open world game.
---
Lol I accidentally came upon this a couple days ago. Had an old set of T-45 that got turned into a duplicate of my excavator armor with a tricentennial T-60 helmet, I just put it back in my stash box and forgot about it üòÇüòÇ
---
You can already have a cow in your house. I can't place a rad arch above ground level,  though. 
---
Go kill sentry bots?  They always have one on them. 
---
You could also take over a power plant and get the fusion core generator running. 
---
Still, it's the only variation we have to chose from for now, I would love to play as a ghoul at some point that would be great :) 
---
You seem to have a real problem with men playing as female characters, judging by your answers here. What do you say to a irl woman who prefers to play as men? 
---
Do i need to actually block for Blocker to work ? I feel like i already have quite a lot of damage reduction (nerd rage / serendipity / emergency protocols and i m also using the x-01 PA) and i m leaning toward more QoL perks like pack rat or strong back
---
Concerning endurance, i think i could get rid of Rad Resistance as it feels silly to have with Radicool, but maybe i m wrong ? A bit lost on this one.
---
I already have Makeshift Warrior but forgot it also slow down your weapon deterioration, so yeah i gotta make some room for it.
---
Wow, brilliant!
---
Do you mean the winter jacket and jeans? I bought it off the travelling responders bot you can find near Charleston 
---
Same. It's the only one worth using in my opinion. Stone door frames are also bugged in that whatever door you snap to it doesn't go flush against the wall. There's a thread about it right now.
---
It sucks. Have had it happen multiple times. 
---
That said, if you took that long in the silo and got beat up that bad by the bots, you may not be ready for the total cluster that is Scorched Earth.
---
Love It. Was the kitchen set already in place? 
---
well, imagine if you pre order the amazing canvas bag, oops i mean nylon.
---
I would but my CAMP is max budget (only one turret) and custom fit for the river bed, doesn't travel well...
---
can confirm, it took my favourite gun :(
---
1. XB1
---
2. PsYch0 PoTaT0
---
3. ¬´Disconnecred from server¬ª is a well recognised problem amongst Appalachians, and I‚Äôve experienced some times during my playthrough. Once or twice a day, untill today. I just gave up after being disconnected every 5 minutes or so. I kept trying for a while, hoping it was just a temporary thing, but it just wouldn‚Äôt let up. I lost quite a lot of resources because of this.
---
Do you know what‚Äôs causing this?
---
Are you working on a fix?
---
If so, when can we expect it?
---
I included a video just for you.
---
I suspect that ammo can‚Äôt be sold because you can make/ find so much .38 that it would make the selling of anything else pointless. 
---
A more important question is why it can‚Äôt be scraped to make other ammo types. 
---
Yeah I didn't mean you were old. Even if you were you were you'd be young at heart. Anyway, your excitement showed which is what is so cool. 
---
Yesterday I joined a nuke zone, used 7k ammo and broke 6 (over repaired) guns trying to take down the SBQ with others only for her to disappear when her health was almost gone.
---
I had just teamed up with someone who was looking for people to play with here so just said meh and moved on.
---
We had planned to do a silo run but had very little ammo left so had to put that off to another day. 
---
This was it a few days ago https://m.imgur.com/a/Lx0zNoA has grown since lol...
---
No, Wendigos cant speak and scorched don't sound trapped to me, they sound like a proud hive mind "never alone" is one of the things they say + a scorched could never fool me into believing it's a player.
---
I think he might have touched tips accidently and it made him go all 'icky! So Gay!' - That or he's a "Ya'll shud fand Jaysus".
---
One or the other.
---
Most of us probably own a dupe item, still, not worried. But I get the need to protect a char with lots of hours of work put into it, sure.
---
Yeah yeah opps. CTDs. I'm super used to crashes while playing Fallout... it's not ok or anything, I'm just not surprised by it. I tend to plan around it (I'll play till it crashes then do a house chore, then play till it crashes ... rinse repeat etc)
---
Blocker is a passive that works all the time, it's immensely strong in melee builds. 
---
Rad Resistance does seem redundant in X-01
---
This is actually how I‚Äôve played Fallout as well. And though 76 is an MMO game, you much more get the feeling of being ‚Äúlone wanderer‚Äù
---
Sure, you can do fun social stuff, but wandering around can make you feel real lonely, compared to the previous crowded Fallout worlds. 
---
You know what else I love? Tooltips saying that heavy weapons are bulky but excedingly powerful, and that alien blaster is a ridiculously powerful gun.
---
With laser weapons I think something is broken i.e. my explosive  laser pistol, a very useful gun for tagging enemies, does not really do any damage, but somehow when I go to SQB and I place a full magazine in her, I see her health go down by about 6 percent per magazine, which is like 6 percent per three seconds as this gun is fast.
---
I honestly see no way on how it is possible that my TSE shotty does her about 2 percent of HP in full magazine, yet when I use laser pistol that doesn't do damage, the damage output is visible with a naked eye.
---
Alright alright you make a good point, also true that, if you can put it together why not take it apart?
---
This. Whenever I have a bad session like this I just go on a long walk with my mom to clear my head and calm me down.
---
Oh yea also forgot if you just kill the enemies in any area they drop weapons and with the perk you can make easy money outta that too
---
This is a fantastic shot! Nicely captured. [Here's one of my own personal favorites.](https://i.imgur.com/43ii2LO.png)
---
7K in ammo!! And six weapons!! Bring a melee weapon so you can switch to it when she lands. If you‚Äôre a rifle build,obviously you‚Äôll do a lot less damage but it‚Äôs more than zero with broken weapons. 
---
Also, 7K ammo!! 
---
No.
---
Oh, very nice.
---
After some research, it‚Äôs actually not working in PA. Unfortunately there are more perks with nothing stated on the card which are not working with PA ...
---
Nicely done.
---
Anyone who is maxed out, y'all wanna throw this brotha some caps just to be a vault dweller helping out another vault dweller? I honestly would but I'm still on the grind.
---
Thanks, despite being 2 storeys it tucks into the landscape well, can barely be seen from the road, so yet to have any idiots try and trash it...
---
This game rocks to everyone who is not a pretentious snowflake melting under the hot hammer that grown ups call life. 
---
Well that blows. Thanks though! 
---
Thank you! Yours look really badass with those power armors in it!
---
I saw the plan for it at Harpers Ferry, in the same place the Marine Wetsuit underarmor spawns. That's in the building with the hole in the wall to the left of the spawn in point. It has a bunch of empty display cases. One on the bottom floor spawns some legs and I think torso plans, like Marine and Robot were what I saw. Up stairs is a spot that spawns recipes. And in another little part next to the body and the missile launcher there's the spot where the underarmor plans spawn.
---
I think having some roll playraiders in the game makes it a more realistic experience.
---
Adds a level of realism that someone may just come along and ruin your day and steal your loot.
---
Whilst its annoying it can also be quite fun and at the end of the day, the wasteland isn't meant to be a safe space
---
I am pretty sure you can craft one at the armor station.
---
You can recraft it if you pick up the plans. 
---
Thanks man, you're helping me a lot ^^
---
I second cap stashes. They are extremely efficient in getting your caps count up, and quite quickly at that. I can make a couple thousand in a day easy without trying too hard. Just gotta learn the locations and the best way to get around them quickly. You can also collect quite a few bobbleheads and magz this way.
---
Same here. Always aimed for their heads and thought they are really tough, but then a player told me I should aim for their torso and it was much easier to kill them.
---
PS4, Pippy Smudges
---
Multiple bugs:
---
1: on load, occasionally whatever weapon I have equipped will state upon trying to fire that it does not have the necessary ammunition, despite being loaded and my having excess ammo for it. Switching weapons and then back again seems to resolve the issue.
---
2: Nude players. Upon loading into a new area players I‚Äôm teamed with will visually lose all armour, under armour and weapons from my POV. If said player was wearing power armour before the area transition they will also have cryptid proportions.
---
3: Assaultron head: charging this weapon then firing used all the energy cells in my inventory in one shot. All 1300 odd of them. That‚Äôs some kamehameha.
---
4: you do not have the sufficient skill to craft that mod. When I have already got a looted mod and I just wish to install it. As far as I was aware, installing looted mods you already owned doesn‚Äôt require the perk you‚Äôd normally need to craft said mod.
---
5: Power armour entry animation still fails on multiple occasions. Most recent instance was entering from a power armour maintenance frame. Suit failed to animate and my character clipped into it offset to the left, then moved as normal.
---
6: Dropped items sometimes fall through the world, regardless of if in a camp or in open world it‚Äôs a coin toss sometimes as to if it will ‚Äúland‚Äù
---
Didn't address the fact that this game deserved the hate train, Runescape is not really free, and I don't play it at the moment, moved on to ff15.
---
Why am i here? Heard it was a hoot and it's a public forum.
---
Big yikes.
---
Here is my bloodied build:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f58467b&amp;d=lt2lu2l71a12a00ir2c72e82eu0pe1ss2sg2sm0sn0se2ei0sd0l52as2ib2eh2s42pc2&amp;w=&amp;n=LowHP%20Pa%20Tank
---
I like to play with explosive shotguns too so it‚Äôs not 100% focused on melee. Without Adrenaline and chems I do around 1300 with both 2H and Shotgun. I have all necessary Mutations and the EP for the PA.
---
One of the items of Fallout 4‚Äôs Wasteland Workshop DLC added planters for crops, since Fallout 76 carries over a lot of the coding from Fallout 4, not to mention items, it‚Äôs basically just a matter of them carrying over the item from that game into this game which is something they should‚Äôve done from the get go. But this is Bethesda we‚Äôre talking about, it‚Äôll probably be added later on down the road through the atomic shop. After all money talks.
---
i might be up for a couple of nukes, was planning on farming at whitespring and maybe try harpers ferry but prime will do just fine, might get a decent drop for once. IGN helkaexe, level 119, i‚Äôll be online most of the day probably so let me know if you want me to tag along
---
People also sell them to vendors, seen a few here and there....
---
Thanks for the advice, don't know if I'm going to find some today ;)
---
Played Horizon, Zero Dawn. Female warrior. It was cool. Then went back to start Skyrim over and chose a female character. I liked it. She was strong, and I built up her magic. Started a new game in FO4 and played a female. It played the same. Of course, there is no difference in ability between the sexes in any of those. 
---
I'm not sure if I would play 76 as a female. The voice for one thing, but with no difference in the ability of the genders, it is the way others perceive you to be the difference. 
---
It is easy enough to switch sexes in "Change Appearance". So, conduct your own social experiment.     
---
I don't think slugger works in PA
---
I'm a Rifle and strength build so have 9 points in the various commando's and 3 more in the rifles ignore % armour card (Can't remember the name). I can craft a fair amount of ammo with super duper and ammo Smith so not the end of the world. 
---
I was more pointing out that if you let it, it will frustrate the hell out of you but you just have to move on. They will eventually fix the bugs so for now, I just enjoy the many other things there are to do in the world. 
---
I've had issues like that since launch. I found leaving the team, enter game solo, rejoin your teams server and have them re add you to the group. 
---
Ok so i ll get rid of rad resistant and it seems serendipity does not work with PA so taking Blocker should not be overdoing it.
---
Also the drifter outfit.
---
I find it cute when they says "Caps" at the end 
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt it ? I ll double check my damage values but i m quite positive it works
---
But don't pick up anything from a spawn location if it's not the thing you want at that moment, because that will basically stop anything from spawning there for a while. So for example you server hop and in the location is something cool, but not what you want at that moment. Don't pick it up or that will mess up the spawn and server hopping won't work any more to get something different to spawn. At least I think that's how it works. And apparently the respawn resets after 24 hours or something after looting something from that spawn point.
---
You think federal regulations keep you safe but all they do is cede power to bureaucrats.
---
Same worst part is I keep updating that ticket I even tweeted their support twitter. Their support twitter seemed really responsive until they asked for my ticket number and then saw it was canvas bag replacement, and gave me the link [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44964/](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44964/) . So since my ticket says  "Waiting on agent" then it means "We have received all the information we need from you, Atoms have been granted to your account and we'll be sending out further confirmation once the canvas bags are ready to be sent.¬†"
---
But I never got the atoms either. Such bs and since the controversy has died down us minority that bought the product have no voice about Bethesda cheaping out on giving us the atoms they promised as compensation.
---
Unfortunately, the email attached to my Bethesda Launcher is different to the ones attached to both Fallout 4 and 76. Also in Fallout 4 and 76 I don't have the option to edit them either. I only got Bethesda Launcher last summer whereas I've had Fallout 4 since 2015, and I had no idea I had to use same email address for all of these.
---
We were ready and rarin' to get in there and mess up some Glowing Ones! XD
---
single effect legendary's and no fast travel outside of multipule succession deaths. Also no cap loss from pvp servers outside of wanted bounty's.
---
Did you do another support ticket? Or what email did you email to get your atoms? Because I feel their twitter and support ticket is just going keep ignoring me.
---
Wouldn't that make the game painfully grindy? I already need to use a lead extractor to have enough ammo for more than three hours, I'd hate to have to spend literal hours hunting down.twenty bullets, five caps and a single bucket to scrap for steel. The sounds like... The opposite of fun.
---
Of course, fun is really subjective, so take my whingeing with a bucket of salt.
---
I dont think the new one will have survival.
---
In primal you get a nice surprice if you complete game in survival. Expert and permadeath
---
This. When sbq lands, stand back and unload a mag or two into her. Swap to your main weapon and fuck her day up.
---
I doubt we are sending the plastic bag back, that would be waste on Bethesda part since were would their store all that inventory that no one wants lol.
---
Sooo don't spam click. I mean I totally understand how frustrating it can be, but it's a known issue since beta, so you ought to be careful.
---
I do that quest almost every day and I haven't got anything eaten since my batch of ammo's first time.
---
I don‚Äôt really have a decent ranged weapon yet (1* double shot shotgun) and best 2H i ve got is All Rise. Concerning mutations i m good, at least melee wise (twisted muscles/adrenal reaction/marsupial and an other 1 or 2 i forgot), also got emergency protocol
---
I always find more meaning the second or third time around, I find links between stories that I didn't catch the first time. 
---
I very deliberately *slowed down* and took my time with 76, and I still missed things. I've playing my second character now and loving it. 
---
Sometimes ya gotta run across a couple of times in one hop if no random encounter occurs.
---
Why you gonna be a petty asshole and downvote me? You said dumb shit, I was nice enough to correct you politely, then you pretended you're smart. Not happening friend.
---
I‚Äôm more aggravated about not being able to take it apart. Could be done in FO:NV when they had a reloading option. 
---
Of course NV did it better from an immersion standpoint. 
---
Cause I have the option to?
---
More interesting to look at, and better customisation options. I'm a woman who always plays a female, but I get why guys do too. 
---
It's a game, while some people like playing an analogue of themselves, others like to do the opposite. 
---
What I mean is - in cryptid lore,  Wendigos take on the appearance of someone else, or mimic a voice in distress to lure someone in, and then kill them. 
---
There is a difference between a modder and rewriting a code the modder simply slapped a band aid on the problem Bethesda's really fixing the coding errors 
---
It is for a repeatable quest (Forbidden Knowledge) in the Brotherhood of Steel questline. They don't stack so if you have 1 and pick up more you still only have 1 so just turn it in as soon as you can. There is always one in the desks of the bunker before the military wing. If you aren't there yet, you'll need to start a different factions questline :)
---
I don‚Äôt think so. I‚Äôve got 6 right now. Eventually while doing the  Brotherhood quests you‚Äôll get a location to deliver it for rewards. 
---
It happened to me, I just scrapped the duped one and carried on. I've had no issues 
---
All but Whitesprings station. *maaaaa'aaaam*
---
That and also PA. It costs so much to make but yet I get a handful of steel when I scrap it.
---
yes. all the fucking time. it's aggravating as hell because you know they're gonna disappear, eventually. not to mention it's hard to keep track of where the body of that one legendary is with all the piles of green and red shit around.
---
My husband says he would much rather look at a woman than a man the entire time. Makes sense. In FO4 I played as a male character and made him all spicy looking. :)
---
I've gotten it from workshops about 4 or 5 times. 
---
Haha, yea true.
---
Queen has really high explosive resistance, you have higher accuracy, and faster for rate. Your 400 damage per shot is probably doing way more damage over time than they are.
---
Best quote.
---
I think the current build is how it should have been put in beta. There are still bugs and balancing to do, but it would have been an acceptable starting point in my opinion. 
---
Thanks, that worked!
---
Good to hear! Enjoy mate :) 
---
Energy Guns just suck right now, if you want to use lasers get a two shot or quad and just skip using a splitter. If you're using Plasma get a two shot or furious, I have a Plasma Flamer as it's the best DPS option.
---
They both need a durability boost, especially on the laser splitter, damage perks need to be fixed on the Plasma Flamer, and damage needs to be increased on most barrel types of both as right now an auto laser/plasma will not kill anything high level in one magazine.
---
Literally unplayable
---
I dumped one in the sack at Whitesprings station a bit ago. Good luck.
---
Yeah and we need more people using mics in this game to make up for it like intended. Right now Rose feel more alive to me than most no-mic players.
---
You can make the male protag look spicy? I need to see that. 
---
Do you have a trick for leveling quick? I know events/enemies give the most XP but I still feel like I could be leveling faster. 
---
The stealing is the main thing raiders do, everything else revolves around the stealing thing.  Survival requires "work" in some form, be it working fields to grow food or working ruins for salvage.  Raiders dont want to work so they steal from those that do.  If raiders indiscriminately murdered and destroyed everything the instant they came across it they wouldnt have anyone to raid and would need to "work" to survive.  I'll agree the anti-griefing measures neuter the potential to roleplay as a raider; extortion is a major part of being a raider and it's basically impossible when your target can server hop.
---
If raiders behaved the way the griefing assholes claiming to role play as raiders behaved there wouldn't be any survivors after raiders came through.  At least no survivors who had direct contact with the raiders, maybe someone who was hiding or out scavenging.  Abernathy farm in FO4 would be a few corpses and a burnt down foundation not a standing structure with a family mourning their daughter who was killed by raiders because she stood up to them the most recent time they came through for food. 
---
Griefing is any action in which the only potential result is to cause frustration or anger in another.  There is no objective benefit to destroying someone's CAMP and depending on what you destroy you void your ability to steal from it(water purifiers, resource extractors).  
---
What system are you on? I got the plans the other day so I can make you one if you want? I'm xbox
---
bUt ThErE aRe NPCs!
---
Non living quest dispensers that you can't actively interact which do not constitute proper NPCs. They might as well be a message board with the radiant fetch quests pinned to it.
---
its happened to me before when i was placing out my power Armours since theres no way of really knowing which one is which...  i wouldnt worry about it as long as your not doing it a number of times.. once or twice can easily be accidental. there more worried about the people who are making 100's and thousands of items. unintentional glitches happen in every game.
---
go to bethesdas bug reporting though and report your circumstances in as much detail as possible on how you ended up with a duped pa and for good measure i would dump one of them.
---
rAiDeRs
---
I found them in a bag some guy dropped.
---
Doesn't matter what you sell, you aren't getting more than 1400 caps from vendors.
---
they seem to stack for me. (3) currently in my inventory.
---
i just craft marine wetsuit helmets. .01 and they sell for 26 caps. takes like 2 leather/rubber.
---
Ha! That could've been me! üòÅ I have better weapons than that, so yea, I sold it along with a mutant slaying .50 machine gun. üôÇ
---
i hate this so much. i say leave the cap at 25k just give vendors 25k total.
---
In PA you hold 2h weapons with one hand
---
Estheticaly I find female characters more pleasing, thats all. And I love to play with face customiser.
---
Oh. No your level. Just remember to put your veil of secrets back on whenever you go there. 
---
My first character is the one who discover places and stories. I have a second one for multiplayer, but I prefer playing with the first one !
---
I'm on PC but thanks anyway ^^
---
Well there *is* a 'kill an alien' challenge..
---
Once you have the Forbidden Knowledge quest they become quest items and no longer stack. You'll see only one with the quest item diamond next to it.
---
Before getting the Forbidden Knowledge quest they are not quest items and will stack. There is no diamond next to it.
---
Easy.
---
Not much benefit doing it after the quest, rewards are fairly low...
---
I don't have issues with the servers, but I do experience infinite loading screens of death.
---
Oh no!!!
---
Lost my first legendary explosive shotgun to it...
---
Awesome 
---
what stopped you from adventuring on your first character?
---
Holy shit, I must be lucky, I looted 3 TSE's already, and I'm lvl 87: gauss rifle, .50 machine gun and western revolver. Sold the western revolver yesterday, and apparently someone in this thread picked it up after me üòÅ
---
Having no human NPCs wasn't a problem since those robots are so humanlike.
---
It‚Äôs totally because of their *soothing voice*...
---
I am 2400 atoms and see completely nothing even remotely worth even 500 atoms in this game. The only even slightly interesting thing is jungle camo for power armor, and thats it. And it charges unreasonable 1400 atoms for it, why it is so expensive, it is a fucking texture, one damn file with one damn texture without any damn effort put to it.
---
I am totaly OK with fully new 3D modeled and textured outfits cost somewhat of 1000 atoms ot such, but 1400 for a damn fucking camo? No, thanks.
---
I don't think I'll ever be able to read that quote without hearing it in there voice and tone.
---
Where's my Giddyup Buttercup PA paint jobs?!
---
Yeah, maybe more a bug than intentionally difficult, but either way it was a huge pain in the ass for very little reward. At least that one's checked off the list, had tried to complete it twice before and the game crashed on me.
---
Sure, my PSN is Flooping_pig. I don't have any stimpacks rn but I'll hop the mayor's office a few times. Also no mic but you don't need a mic to fall off of a cliff.
---
Was chilling with my brother drinking Mike‚Äôs Hard and playing Mega Man 11 last night.
---
I said ‚ÄúLet me get (pay) you back for pizza.‚Äù and dropped a fist full of bottle caps in hand.  ‚ÄúThat outta cover it‚Äù
---
Will add you (IGN: Semple1990), i've not seen any others about launching nukes yet - seems pretty quiet day.
---
YES YES YES.
---
Haaaaaate those things.  And all the insects in this game for that matter.
---
For the longest time I kept hearing "Next on ..." instead of "Now offering ..." and imagined the vendor bots had their own Pawnstars reality TV show.
---
I still pretend they have their own Vendorstars...
---
Especially those horrible ticks
---
They stack in your inventory, but count as one for the quest (you will loose all 3 when you do the quest) AFAIK
---
Turn on pacifist, and block them
---
It‚Äôs the American waifu. 
---
As if anything absolutely needs to make sense lorewise. This game is not all that connected to fallout lore in the grand scheme of things and might as well exist in its own comfy bubble, catering to series fans both new and old.
---
As for older "fan servicy" stuff like the NCR ranger armor, most were made out of salvaged prewar stuff. For example the elite ranger suit is basically just a police riot suit with NCR insignia tacked on. How does it not suit the lore for Virginia police to have riot suits in stock, especially when the blue collar workforce is rioting like crazy? Then once a survivor finds an old riot suit they add a coat on top to keep the weather out. That's essentially NCR elite ranger armor. Heck they could even make it Responders themed.
---
Bethsoft aren't dumb, they can come up with satisfactory explanations for callback stuff existing in Virginia. And barring that, they can make small thought out changes to make the items fit. Besides cash shop items are at their best when they are fan service. People really want to buy them and Bethesda can have reliably selling items.
---
Also, let the edgelords edge. I don't like that stuff either but the gore party visuals are a part of the series. So let em have their nasty goodies.
---
Just leave that server and join a new one. You can also try Pacifist mode to prevent hitting them back and starting PVP. They can still try to chip you to death, though.
---
I dont see any point in complaining about that anymore tbh, its either they bring  Obsidian back or they do it their way and seeing how little theyve changed since fallout 3 and how stubborn they seem to be i just kind of accepted that this is fallout now
---
Bulking just makes it confusing with stash management,
---
It could be made a little easier if bulk and lose items sorted one after the other in the inventory.
---
We should also be able to play the game for more than 30 minutes without it crashing, or being booted from a server. 
---
Note to alll. *GOURMONDS*
---
Fully agreed! I especially just loved walking through the Whitesprings shopping area, and I liked every single vendor there. But one in particular I really loved to check on every time I went back... 
---
"Ahoy there little sailor! Welcome to... *CAP'N KIDS!"* 
---
pro tip from Arnold, ‚ÄúChilllll Out‚Äù
---
They are only sold by Grahm but can also drop as workbenches rewards. If you are on PS4 I probably have one 
---
Okiedoke, good luck on your search
---
I had that happen on PC and I'm certain it was treasure map related. Did you spam a bunch of maps by chance?
---
There's also this really annoying thing that started after the last patch where I'll lock if I move right away.
---
Here's what I would try, but no clue if any of this will help:
---
Log in, but don't push a single button for another minute or so. You should see the weather effects pop on and all the statuses on your screen scroll by.
---
Try to fast travel to Vault 76. Log out. Log back in. Leave the game sit for a minute or two. Try to go back to what you were doing.
---
Clear your mutations with RadAway if you have mutations.
---
Check your carry weight and see if you can drop some stuff to get back down to normal carry weight (maps related, if you spammed them recently).
---
i checked a video posted on youtube about the cap stash, will definitely do the cap-stash run; i'll also keep an eye out for those plan especially the marine tactical as it sounds nice XD
---
I got the plans for it in Sutton.  They were under the cash register in that first shop across from the Overseer's house.
---
Yeah it would make more sense if its dependent on DPS. And this just proves that I chose the right build. In the beginning I just refused to use OP shotguns because I'm a team player and eant to leave something for my boys to shoot at instead of blasting everyone with an explosive shotgun. But now I'll just get anoyed at my friend because they think that they are doing all the work and they dont even have to suffer the pain of the SBQ screams.
---
It's cute that Wallace ends every monologue with 'Stay free or DIE!', but never aggros on anything, even if we are jumped by a mob of charred federal ghouls during a transaction. Cool cat.
---
Yeah, thanks for delivering it. Now fix it so it works as intended. 
---
Thanks ;)
---
That was a gamble. If your camp was complex you likely would have had to rebuild it piece by piece from the stored tab. 
---
haha thanks for the thought! it's far better for me work my hands and feet to learn the game mechanics more, but seriously thanks :)
---
If you scrap the PA the pieces go to your inventory so no you didn't scape your while set with mods I'm sry
---
I lost all my ammo for my preferred weapon. Luckily a higher level player had joined me and was super helpful but it sucked. My backup was a shotgun which was broken. 
---
Actually i have a lot of treasure map but i didn't think that they could be such a big problem.
---
I'll try all your suggestions soon hoping for the best, thanks for your help.
---
Yes please! My username is zombieunderwear
---
If you want you can hit me up on PSN I should be on and off all day today since it‚Äôs my day off 
---
Why are any of you still playing this game? Because it‚Äôs fun or you‚Äôre addicted? 
---
Ask yourself.
---
Right now the future of the game looks not so bright if you ask me. New beds for atom shop every month, golden guns... what next? I am 50 lvl and lost all interest in the game because I just cant find anything interesting to do. Quests are terribly boring, PvP is useless, exploring is ok but I already explored whole map. I have no friends who bought this game because all of them think it is total shit because of public oppinion or think the game is too expensive.
---
So, dear bethesda, better make elder scrolls 6 and forget about this damn disaster of a game.
---
You know what game has these items complete with thousands of player made skins?
---
Rust
---
ok ill add you now and join my game when you can
---
How do you even grief in this game? 
---
Thanks
---
lol, stfu
---
- 3000 hour Rust player
---
Assuming it's 1400 I'm all set. It may well happen, Camo, Stars and Stripes and Vault Tec exist for PA and standard armour. 
---
I'd prefer they fixed the original Slicked armour first though. Turns out there's a horrific glitch involving the Heavy Metal Left arm: it clips through the pipboy in fist person.
---
I'm also disappointed that the left and right variants are entirely symmetrical. Kinda defeats the purpose of the paint style. In the preview image (clearly not rendered ingame) this isn't the case. If there is a PA edition, expect that...
---
I'd like a percentage of camp budget used for each piece before placing it,, that would be super helpful
---
You can get plans to make it. You can find them randomly all over the place. I found the plans in Flatwoods by the armour bench next to the church, but they can spawn all over the place.
---
Everytime they belt out "I am" (in "I am authorized ...") Almost exactly like Weiland in Stone Temple Pilots song 'Dead and Bloated'
---
Just a random question, if I want to sell some things, etc do I always need to go back to the 1st town or where else can I go?
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Awesome! Meet you in a bit
---
seriously though. the amount of times a day i see ‚Äúmama dolces took my...‚Äù is ridiculous. im also not interested in your camp or your nuke screenshot. 
---
You do the quest that starts with the miscellaneous "investigate harpers ferry" objective.
---
I‚Äôd mini-nuke that so fast. 
---
the downvotes are because they're not cheating by placing their camp and turrets there, it's just a scummy thing to do.
---
false reports is the last thing Bethesda needs right now
---
This character was only level 30 when I took these screenshots.
---
In 76 more years.
---
Am i the only one who loves the really stupid things like that. I find them funny and love using them
---
&gt; After removing my targeting HUD I've crashed one time the last week. As opposed to crashing 2-3 times an hour
---
This is exactly my experience. I was having constant crashes like the OP, was recommended removing Targeting HUD by a fellow redditer, did so and crashed only once ever since (that is, in a week now!).
---
For reference: Excavator PA, I replaced the HUD with the Internal Database mod, but of course you can also just craft a second helmet and swap them out.
---
Don‚Äôt hit back. 
---
Heck they were in Fallout 4
---
Did Bethesda give their ok to that mod? I am a bit affraid to get under the banhammer
---
I would like if other non party players were hidden on the map. 
---
Make each encounter a true surprise. 
---
Why will the next patch change that ?
---
r/boneappletea all over this post
---
Me and my friend thought it could‚Äôve been a meteor or satellite with all the ventilation debris, still doesn‚Äôt explain the radiation in the area.
---
Didn‚Äôt think about that...
---
Pacifist doesn't save you from taking damage or being killed by others. Server hopping sometimes does.
---
**Soothing voice**
---
That's why i am still at level 50, i take time to read terminals, listen to holo tapes and take pictures of those teddy bears....
---
one scene that stood out was that "My angel grave" near a watch tower that is one sad scene to imagine..
---
I am xbox how about you?
---
Block him via the Social Menu ...
---
I always got them right as I was sever dumped. Never realized they were from the event. Always seemed like well this was the 4 or 5 sever we kicked you off of due to the times you can play, here is a little bonus.
---
I miss Curie from F4 so much, she was with me the entire game, could never get enough of her comfortable french accent. If I were to get only one thing to f76 from now on I wouldnt hesitate one second, give me Curie as compa ion and I'll be happy forever!
---
That's ironic since that was a terrible counter argument. You do realize that game time works differently than real time, right? Game time works faster which means you'll be eating and drinking more often. Also, I'm pretty sure their main focus isn't on realism due to the fact that there are mutations, energy weapons (like laser and plasma) and sci-fi creatures, so firearm realism should be the least of your worries.
---
Not everyone plays a game to min/max, many play what they enjoy which makes the game relevant to them. I don't want to force myself to play something that I don't enjoy because then it defeats the RP aspect of the game. So while the cause for stagnation, for me, isn't based on on playstyle, it's due to the lack of content currently available in the endgame. 
---
If your house is a mess, maybe fix the living room before the plumbing ? This is blatant bug that is always visible.
---
What's the location of the cars?  Interested to try this though still low level.
---
I don't care either way. Play who the hell you want.
---
But the justification "hur durr, if I'm gonna be staring at an ass all day I'd rather it be a chick's" makes me cringe so goddamn hard.
---
Then you'd have to note the two gang leaders who clearly weren't a fan of the whole concept, not all raiders are Big Evil Baddies
---
I did that yesterday, level 20 near me with a bounty. I‚Äôm level 14 on this character so thought ‚Äòokay can probably make a go of this‚Äô.
---
Went off to find them and got close enough to see a PA-rocking level 209 with a huge sledgehammer. Gave him the thumbs up and left him to it. He gave me the heart back and was on his way. Soon after a level 60 went sprinting past me in his direction. Went back to watch to see his death. Poor level 60. 
---
There is also the spot where someone was experimenting on an alien, down towards moth an museum. I think it's some underground storage for hazardous materials. I will look up th location. 
---
So basically you're just griefing? 
---
Buy or dont, i dont care.
---
You do know you can "repair all." Your base for free withput spending ANY mats right?
---
There's no scorched inside silos just robots and turrets...N yes they are they same
---
NE/SE is where most of the real action is.
---
I have a sledge that outdamages the hook, BUT i run with the hook almost 100% of the time caus of the "threat range" i find that the hook seems to have a much larger zone where it will make contact. with the sledge (or gronk's axe) you have to be right up on the enemy where as the hook you seem to be able to connect at a further distance. GREAT for glowing ones so that their rad damage is lessened.
---
This completely.  The lack of npcs that everyone complains about immensely adds to that feeling of a being alone and the desolation of post war WVA.  It wouldn't be the same with mindless humans all over.
---
Frog noises are the worst
---
Check train station apparel tabs. I see them alot.
---
But clearly people dont want to deal with that at all, just wanna play the game without the PvP aspect
---
Aaron was also an asshole though. 
---
I've done this event a bunch too and no lining. I'm at a loss to get either protective or shielded lining for raider. #sadness
---
Nms and fallout 76 are my favourite games of the past few years haha I sure know how to pick them!

I bought a really nice pink dress but yeah I would to have some actual useful items for sale, or even just something cool and zany like you said.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I couldn't figure out how to describe what was happening with this bug. Thanks for posting it. (I'm on PS4.)
---
I played since lanch with all the bugs and the camp disappearing shit and yes I agree the game was rushed but I did enjoy my time with this game more than any other game I ever played so I already got my money worth out of it. 
---
If you don't like it demand a refund if you can and  move on and let other enjoy it.

Hmmm must be a lot of ignorant people then. There is a much better method to transfer items. And duper should know it because that‚Äôs how they dupe in the first place. Definitely not a paper bag which is insecure, and very easily spotted also.

Every player is a survivor from Vault 76. We were all chosen as being among the best and brightest to help rebuild. We all lived together in the Vault, preparing for Reclamation Day.
---
Some people on the surface turned into Raiders. None of us were part of that.
---
If you want to go after Wanted as a bounty hunter, I can respect that. In theory, they did something to deserve it. (Although personally, I‚Äôve only become wanted by accidental stray shot or not realizing a container was owned before I looted it.)
---
If you get your jollies from wrecking other players‚Äô camps (which nets you nothing) and attacking weaker players who didn‚Äôt invite PvP, you‚Äôre not a ‚ÄúRaider‚Äù. You‚Äôre just a bully and an asshole.
---
You can tell yourself it‚Äôs ‚Äúrole playing‚Äù but deep down, you know that‚Äôs bullshit. And so do the rest of us who are not bullies and assholes. What‚Äôs going on in your real life that you feel a need to behave that way in a made-up one?
---
sad but true
---
You are scribe material!

I hear this a lot on the elite dangerous sub. Greifers exist in all games and making a post calling greifers assholes isn‚Äôt going to reduce the problem.
---
It‚Äôs part of the game, deal with it

Followed by the next "Inside the Vault" post with multiple fixes/balances that raise the communities eyebrows instead of their hopes.

Once the person is blocked they can't find you anymore after you server hop.

I grabbed it around level 40 I think.

So this is where Roachie went when he despawned...

Either having a buddy on the server or writing down a couple of names of folks on your current server (less reliable, but better than nothing) is good in case you get disconnected. It's happened quite a few times for me, and it would be really disheartening for you if you launched that puppy and then got disconnected and didn't get to enjoy your own zone. :) 
---
Lost an excavator arm and leg while being shot by a  liberator haven‚Äôt gone near that event since.

Same bug but with a different event. Can't remember the name but it's one where you have to defend Corpse Flowers from animal attacks in The Forest region.

I have been killed by slap damage in a full suit of pa

---
You need to make the flux stable. This is done at the chemistry bench.
---
Selecting ‚ÄòRepair All‚Äô ends up costing way more resources anyways. Doing it one by one is the better way to go anyways. That. Or move your camp and it‚Äôll be back to repaired. 
---
Shhhhh don't tell Bethesda
---
Very little violet, though. Which I need for my ultracite 5.56 ammo.
---
So stop nuking Whitespring, help a brother out.
---
Does one stable flux count as 1 pure flux?
---
Actually I want more stuff that is clean. My house is supposed ti be a sanctuary! And if Im building something, it doesn't make sense for it to be dirty when it's brand new.
---
But I'd also like to see debri and puddle and mud stickers. So I can track mud into my nice clean house! :D
---
Farm the SQB for stable stuff. you can definitely get enough before it degrades but you need to have a REALLY good farming spot. Golf Club is only good for Yellowcake
---
you get it as reward for completing Scorched earth as well... tho is rng..
---
I added a bedroom to my place to have a place to put it xD
---
I'm level 408 and have seen 1 TSE drop for me. Around level 200ish. They are extremely rare drops. Duping is what did this. The nerfs that are coming serve to fix that in a way. 
---
Ive got a ton of explosive guns, many bloodied, but TSE is elusive. 
---
So I imagine this stuff is duped because its impossible to get that many good rolls.  How does one know if they buy it that they wont get banned or it wont get taken away? 
---
Probably eventually got bored
---
I also did this and made a little video.  Here's the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acljt3/my_camp_with_a_fully_functional_underground_bunker/) to my Reddit post.

It's directly east of Haven Church.

U don‚Äôt need any mats or perks to install a mod. U just need PA station make sure it‚Äôs the correct mod type. If it only says reactive plate mod it‚Äôs probably for excavator and it‚Äôs made from black titanium

I hate that place, man.

I pushed in for the first time this weekend from the north side. Cleared 5 scorched and ghouls that were 3x‚Äôs my level, but only barely survived because the stimpak hot key (d-pad) wasn‚Äôt acknowledging me pressing it, nor was the weapon switch hot key.
---
Anyway, then I get to the first row of houses or buildings there with the conjoined front porches and I‚Äôm INSIDE exploring, yet *still* I‚Äôm not getting discovery credit for the location. I‚Äôm like ‚Äòwtf?‚Äô
---
Then I died and had to respawn way far away and walk back.
---
Fallout is meant to be a pss about. The whole point of the game is that you can play it first and then once you have finished the game you can just do stupid shit. Thats how i see fallout anyway. By all means fallout isnt perfect but people give it way to much shit. 
---
Also in the cab of a big rig out by aaronholt farmstead.

Well, they're in the files (with plans even) and aren't named like atom shop content is, so they'll most likely eventually return.

I always collect 168 mothman eggs, make them into omlettes while using super duper for the double, and sell them then. Are 8-9 caps worth each.

---
Someone send help please
---
Though I was amused by the reference, I can't help but think you proved the OPs point. The raider is not another foe, but an evil to be defeated. They are bullies, parasitically feeding off the hard work of innocents to survive, generally, though not always, the player is placed in the role of righting their wrongs defending innocents, though not always (gta for example). In video games like Fallout Vegas that let you choose a different path and having that path having ripple effects further along are great mind you, but there is a significant difference... those being injured be they raiders killed, or innocents persecuted, aren't players are not real people.
---
As amusing a read as Aaron's comments are, he's a psychopath. We lock up dickheads like him for a reason. In the context of a game, it allows us to explore the ramifications of our actions, to "be bad" without any real world consequences. games that allow choices with good/evil behavior that result in good/bad consequences are, in my opinion, good game writing.
---
If a player's enjoyment in playing a game is dependent on going out and taking a shit on some other real human being's play experience, then, they're an asshole. The "It's role playing dude. Deal with it." excuse is exactly what the OP said, justifying antisocial parasitic behavior.
---
One of the most infuriating thi gs ever. I do have caps but happily lose 200-400 to teach them a lesson

There's one at the very top of Savage Divide that's pretty popular. Don't have the exact coordinates though.

Also, I've a feeling a certain someone will probably come in here plugging their's in...

Sad butt true

System?
---
Hate speech is a big no no for me as well. So that's not a problem. 
---
good hunting
---
It's okay, at this rate, at least 1 more game mode will be introduced and 2 more months will go by before they acknowledge it.
---
No that's only if we want good stuff any good thing in the game they seem to spot instantly and nerf üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm level 47 and the group experiences and random encounters I have are the best 
---
In terms of Lore I don't know if Caravan would be appropiate, I mean, Caravan is an apocalypse developed game by traders and it's been mere 25 years after the bombs fell. Said that, I think a card game would be an awesome addition to Appalachia and also Bethesda didn't put much of an interest in the lore of the series with all that BoS stuff, so...
---
It also works if you change weapons or put away your weapon as you land.
---
Ha
---
No idea how you can see how many hours. I have an i7 and a higher tier internet and I still come across these issues. For normal players it's not an issue of hardware but a combination of Bethesda not fully fleshing out the bugs beforehand and our own community taking advantage of these exploits, cheating and essentially breaking the game. Players like you and I are unfortunately caught in the crossfire.
---
I'm over 120 and I haven't completed the BoS, or started the Firebreathers or Mysteries ones yet. I'm still finding new locations on the map every time I wander around. I never rush a game so I always have something to do later. I was also in PA when I hit level 15. I had been farming it from level 10. I always look stuff up and learned about server hopping fast when I wanted to find out how to get stimpacks. I found a video suggesting server hop the three areas south of Vault 76 for the leader mobs who sometimes drop a bunch of stims. Then I looked up what is the lowest level PA you can get. Raider level 15. What locations. I farmed a few and then set up camp next to one. Some level 25-35 pieces also spawned in that location so I was farming them too around that level. Soon as I hit 15 and stepped into the PA farming those sets became a lot easier. Some time later I got my T-51b set and Nuka-Cola paint job. I've collected a lot of stuff in the game and found a lot and I know there is still so much left to do. Now I have found I quite like getting a bounty as when people come to collect it I get free caps. I don't want to trash someones CAMP but I'll pick locks whenever I can to rack up the bounty and make myself a little more enticing to higher levels.
---
Lol, yeah idk.  I wear PA 24/7 so idc.
---
Strange, mine didn't make any light at all. I tried them in a cave. Just white balls no light.
---
Good luck. Last person who wrecked my base caught a axe to the head. After I showed him his little two shot explosive shotgun wasnt shit compared to my two shot fat man he got mad and blocked. So yeah you'll get yours too! ‚ù§
---
maybe specify  houses with turretts
---
Same as jumping right when you land lol
---
An item that can recharge power cores 
---
I would not say that.  I received a Bomber jacket that I traded for two very nice pieces of legendary combat armor.  Can also get BoS PA paints.  
---
Please don't say that, you'll get crucified here.
---
A lot of the fixes Bethesda made, were nothing but band aids. E.g.:
---
1. 250+ of the same items in you inventory crash the game (one of the early duping methods), so Bethesda made it so you can't craft more than 250 of the same item. That's  a band aid. (circumvented by putting 200 in an container, than crafting 100 more and picking the others up again)
---
1. Wide screen support still took them almost 2 months and it still stretches out the UI, I.e. it's not better than an .ini edit.
---
To rub even more salt into this wound, modders already made mods for `known plans`, a working `text chat` and better UI. 
---
And the huge cherry on top of that is, that people found what flags are missing from weapons (perks not affecting them) and vendors (see handmade plans in Harper's ferry) and all it would need is a hot fix/ band aid from Bethesda to add them, because modders can't.
---
GTK:TFTT
---
???
---
It's also a game. I'll admit I'm a bit theatrical at times but also I try to keep things humorous. I don't think I'm exactly what the op was complaining about. I'm also not to worried. Honestly I think people cry to much. It's a game and we will all stop playing it eventually.  
---
I would like to see someone try to take a so called shit on my experience as you put. There is always the block feature, server hop and for the love of God stop building in places that attract people. Very few people ever find my spot and in the worse possible case scenario, I'd repair all and move on. 30 seconds of my time wouldn't even cause the need cry on Reddit or over analyze a joke. 
---
I am also interested to know this. I thought once I was in the enclave it would let me but nope 
---
Is that why my 2400k damage fat man never seems to do much to even though it will just about destroy a regular SB if it's a direct hit?
---
Still 30 atoms.  These should be hot fixed right away.  I doubt they will fix it before the week ends.  Which sucks.
---
If it gave 30 atoms and reset then gave another, I bet it would be patched that day.
---
Just to get this straight - you‚Äôre trying to sell these items on the subreddit for real life money? Gtfo lmao
---
Me too. Been playing 1 char since the beta, im lv64.
---
I play it like i have played every other fallout game. Ive thought from the beginning that those playing it like an MMO were missing more than they were getting.
---
What‚Äôs the mask you are wearing?
---
And where did U find that BOS outfit.
---
I neeeeeeedddddd them now
---
Power attacks are dick slaps.
---
I'm down to pick up a field jacket if you have it still later this evening when I get off work.
---
Im with you on this, In my version of F76, I only leave my base if I need to, to grow on the roof would make more sense... but like others a game thats dosnt crash, and has noone cheating is in my list a lot higher up then this!
---
I usually get on 8pm-9pm EST.  Twins that keep me busy....lol

I was farming enclave commendations in the bog and had scorched beast corpses falling from the sky. This bug is hilarious 
---
No, I am not trying, I'm doing it.
---
Well that‚Äôs not allowed here. So bye!
---
Yeh I mean I completely agree with this post. I want more shit like the blackbird paint. Some old faction clothing maybe, other options for gun skins rather than just a handful of ones that aren't even centred on guns that I see being used at high lvls. 
---
Because everyone would be banned then. Everyone got duped items one way or another. Lol.
---
Check whether you or your friends have targetting hud modificstion on. They've changed something with it and now it constantly crashes wearer or even nearby players when there are lots of enemies around.
---
Take it as PSA. Remove targetting hud for the moment. Its causing issues. Use something else.
---
Nah they have no use atm. prolly for quests that aren't in yet or whatever. Theres also a lot of conference rooms and stuff inside the main building you cant open.
---
The worrying thing is that they didn't actually fix the previous single player titles at all. Most major glitches were never resolved, except by the modding community. This may be the first time in over 10 years where Bethesda are even required to try to fix their own stuff.
---
Here's hoping they actually have the expertise to do it.
---
Could have been someone doing the quest the first time. It has the optional step to nuke prime. 
---
I dont know what im doing different, but i have not had a single DC or "controls not responding" in over 40hrs of play since the last patch. Not 1.
---
same üòÇ
---
I haven't downvoted you, nice job assuming stuff though. 
---
very few camp builds impress me, you sir have inspired me.
---
That's not quite true PA mods require mats to install, some of the more exotic ones even require stable flux.
---
As with everything, it's about the journey and not the ending.
---
thx!
---
Sent you a friend request (:
---
A Camp that is Indestructible to anyone you are not in PVP with ! My buddy has given up building a NICE camp because of a level 175 that just destroys A MUCH AS HE CAN of any camp he finds for the yucks of it 
---
I play solo but i may be stealing this idea. I agree, so much more fun to play with friends and this is a great way to make one lol.
---
I‚Äôd settle for an offline mode. If I‚Äôm doing PvE I‚Äôd rather not have to rely on serve stability. 
---
Yup! Around 70% of the traincars are "stock", i did the paintings, flags, one of the safes etc.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, and I may be, but wrecking ball says it works on WORKSHOPS.. not C.A.M.P.
---
LOL thanks i guess :P
---
Hey, stay positive. On the one hand bug might be known since the B.E.T.A., on the other hand they already fixed bug where the *Feed the **People** * event gave everyone on the server **food**.
---
Vendorbot wallace dropping red pills
---
I'm right there with you I was short 800 atoms and trying to do all the challenges I could to get there and just couldn't make it in time. 
---
I've been saving my atoms till it comes back or something just as cool shows up
---
And rolling pins. Don't forget the rolling pins.
---
Hey look at that another gatekeeper post telling everyone how to play "their" game their way
---
Furthermore, of you look into the Atom Shop data mine from a while back, you'll find the Vault 111 jumpsuit ready to go up whenever they feel.

So yeah. Not really a good reason not to throw in some Ranger armour.

What is with gaming companies always having bad customer service lol. Ive  never had a good experience. If you used a credit/debit card maybe try sending them a printout of the transaction from your statement. 
---
Leading newbies into a fucking death furnace.  My kid fell for it last night.
---
It's a carry over from FO4 your companions PA if had the mod you'd be able to see the enemies. In 76 not only will your team see it but sometimes just random people in your general area will see it to. I think that might be what causes the targeting HUD to crash some people because it's being shared to everyone and probably the NPCs as well.
---
Does this go here? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=My2FRPA3Gf8
---
I found one too, but because of some glitch it always did zero damage so I dumped it after getting upset each time I saw it in my inventory for weeks...
---
worked fine for me and friend on ps4 last night, maybe its PC related.  also make sure ur in a team if u launch a nuke on prime, so if u DC u can come back
---
IT‚ÄôS GRAFTON DAAAAAAAY!
---
Hear hear!
---
Guessin you don‚Äôt read on /r FO76 section here too often?
---
If you really believe that the gear a level 50 player has is the same as the stuff a level 150 does, or that the refined and optimized perk deck that a 150 has is the same as a 50s random pack draws and slots full of lockpick and hacker, then I can only assume you haven't actually gotten to level 100+ or you suck at the game.
---
For one thing, many of the best perks aren't even unlocked until the high 40s, so it's impossible to have a decent end game build until well above 50. Second, the 150 will have had time to gather much better weapons (and ammo supplies to use them), armor and mutations.
---
Let's just put it this way: at level 50 I was still stealthing into areas and using silenced sniper weapons because camps full of 68s would kick my butt. At 130, I just walk in in my power armor and mow those same camps down like nothing. I don't even use TSE stuff because I have had horrible luck with drops and have never found any - most of my guns are 1 üåü with things like bloodied or mutant slayer because I haven't found better replacements yet. 
---
Are u talking about learned plan or mods ? I‚Äôm talking about one time use mods they don‚Äôt require anything 
---
You've seen the civil war dress right? Nothing like running through the wasteland in a giant hopping skirt.
---
looks like Good To Know: Thanks For The Tip
---
Crouched down and watched them move around on the map until they stayed in one spot for several minutes. They revealed their camp within 5 minutes of attacking us.
---
That happened to me once too. I think I accidentally did some damage to one of the robots. 
---
Once that happens, it‚Äôs game over. They will all drop what they‚Äôre doing and target you. 
---
Every goddamned robot in Whitesprings is your sworn enemy for the rest of the session. 
---
Came here to say bye? Okay... 
---
Not our fault Bethesda told us to make our own fun. We're the missing npcs so what do you expect when we're bored out of our minds. 
---
And yes like X01 jet pack mod u buy from enclave military wing doesn‚Äôt require anything to install, again I‚Äôm not talking about crafting learned mod plan
---
Ah your welcome :)
---
Came here to get you banned moron
---
I bet you're real fun at parties man
---
Say literally much?
---
Ahhh, this sounds about right.
---
lol u really cant stand the idea that someone has a great life and disagrees with u huh? so salty
---
No procs all day, gun breaks, fixes gun, 3 procs per minute. Oof. It‚Äôs still a nice card, I run 1pt in the gun one and the armor one, I barely have to repair anything. 
---
That's just it. I do like it. So I dont want to see Bethesda crap on and destroy it. And focusing on PVP while neglecting PVE is going to destroy it.
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs required more AP than just one jump 
---
Funny when a modder makes the game less buggy than the devs. Played fallout 4 a while back on xbox ran into a few game breaking bugs looked up a fix need mods to fix it. Them must be some impressive band aids.
---
Yesterday we had a SBQ fight where she kept getting bugged / stuck and hps wouldn't go down, finally we got her unstuck and down to 10% and server crashed...
---
That was a walk away from the computer moment.
---
I‚Äôll keep the wood armor drops thanks.

First time I encountered a player w/TSE Shotgun in PVP it was 1,000% clear that it was absolutely game breaking, so badly OP it's beyond stupid...
---
It's SOO bad, that if Bethesda doesn't fix the broken Perks system behind these insane damages, then we know they're just trolling us and don't actually care about players.
---
It still cancels it tho lol

Hey! What platform are you on? If xbx1, would love to help you out with a silo run.

Yep same! Had just crafted it. And after feed the people I had to go back to collecting springs.
---
Nothing it's the internet man, this is the same as the guy at work talking about all the "babes I've fucked" when in reality he hasn't and just wants attention.
---
I suspect they will be for future content. Same with the rooms in the hotel itself that have the scanners.
---
Don't lie to yourself like that its embarrassing 
---
Gave my caps to a friend and followed him till he left fallout....not the server....until he was offline. Destroyed his base 10x at least.
---
I know lol I was waiting to clown his lame ass. Just wanted to see what kind of shit he could come up with
---
Does anyone have a reliable way to farm it when the time comes? One of my teammates is running around with 34 of them as he hasn't done that quest line yet. If he hands any to me, they don't stack in my inventory. I was thinking he needs to find a place to stash them, start the quest, finish the quest, them grab them out one at a time and then turn them in?
---
Damn I bet he will never wrong another low level again. That‚Äôs some rough shit
---
Because you being passive doesn‚Äôt mean others can‚Äôt fuck with you or your shit like in real life...
---
Either Bethesda makes Demolition not apply to *ballistic* weapons, or they are clearly the us and don't care about players.
---
That's how ***BROKEN*** and OP TSE weapons are currently.
---
They shouldn't even Nerf Two Shot (maybe), it's insane damage multipliers that need to be reduced and *capped*.
---
Melee weapon does more damage than a Nuke?!?
---
Absolutely ***idiotic*** üí© üí© üí©
---
How is picking up a known spawn item an exploit?
---
In the case where you are doing it for humorous intent, to have fun but competitive way, I don't think that's what the OP was talking about, I don't think that would constitute what a Griefer is. Seems like you are extrapolating your own experiences which were not intentional griefing, onto his experiences, which were. As an example, OP never mentioned build location afaik yet you mention build location twice.
---
Someone may not be able to take a shit on your gaming experience, but I'm pretty sure that others who are just having fun building a nice house and a garden and has high level run through and trash it may not feel the same way. The "well you put it somewhere someone could find it" is as illogical as blaming sexually assault on the woman for being in a dance club...the location of the assault doesn't make it the victim's fault.
---
You know Jeff Foxworthy's "You might be a redneck," commentary is accurate here.
---
"If someone blocks you and server hops to get away from you, you might be an asshole."
---
I too would "just repair and move on" in a game, but I also don't feel the need to demean others by refering to their legitimate complaints "crying". 
---
But honestly, I only commented because I enjoyed reading Aaron's quote, but also saw the inaccuracy of it being presented as counter-argument to the OP's point.
---
Dun really care, tbh.
---
Wood Armor is actually the Sneak Sniper meta. 
---
With the Shrouded and Weightless mods, it weighs nothing. Lets people easily camouflage and lowers the amount of weight on them. 
---
They used to give +1 charisma too. 
---
Also sad that most head gear/eyewear doesn‚Äôt add resists or stats. 
---
But it‚Äôs efficient. The purpose of canceling the superhero jump is for efficiency and pls stop off my dms. I‚Äôm a dude. 
---
I will be on tonight 8-11. Categoricshoe47
---
Unfortunately I'm on PS4. Thanks for the offer though
---
you can hack terminals to disabke defenses!
---
lol 
---
No worries. Good luck mate. 
---
YESSSS! maybe the slot machine from FO4 (vault dlc)
---
 Unfortunately it did not help me. Many locations like Morgantwon Airport still lag like hell :-(
---
I haven't sent even sent you one so stop bitching 
---
If people want to role play as Raiders they need to abandon their X 01 pa and fancy TSE and pick up a pipe pistol and half a chest armor. 
---
And I was but it only disables a few turrets and sometimes A bot
---
Nude mod in FO4 was awesome, really miss that playing FO76.
---
Also, I hate seeing all those toilets and not being able to take a piss.
---
The only people I've seen with true complaints about engine, are the people, who can afford cutting edge gaming boxes with state of the art video cards and monitors who can run game beyond max systems settings.   
---
the rest of the complainers are mostly gamers who are jump on the HATE bandwagon types who just like to complain.    
---
The problem with "upgrade engines" comes again to, if they upgrade engine &amp; code game for newer faster machines, the vast majority of people get left in dust yet again unable to run game until they upgrade everything in their system So they Don't BUY newer games they wait 
---
With 76, because the tattered dress looks better on a female. It's the only clothing item (not under armor) that gives a special stat bonus (+1 per) in the game.
---
With fallouts 3 and NV, black widow was much more effective than lady killer due to the number of males you would kill than females. 
---
With fo4, the dialog was different and the rpg was better as you were playing as a lawyer who had to learn how to survive instead of a military vet who was already a killing machine
---
While I don't use this glitch, I'm sure everyone who already uses it are super happy that you just made bethesda aware of it. Good job Helpy Helperton.
---
Perhaps not regular ammo, but we should be able to sell Mini-nukes, Missiles, Fusion and Plasma Cores.
---
Why are you complaining about that?
---
They had this is the previous fallout games, but I think they‚Äôre intentionally trying to restrict the level of caps on the open market. 
---
Following...my camp is right where this safe is - I have yet to find anything as well
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** GymRatWriter! ^(hug)
---
Anytime, "seems legit dude"
---
Very true but it's Shakespeare, most of the characters were just as bad in their own ways.
---
Sadly I'm about half and half because when I group with friends it's too hard to read things when everyone is talking.
---
It's super annoying when your game is running okay (for once!) and the queen decides she just wants to fly off with 25 minutes left. They really should stop her flying out of bounds when the events still running! 
---
yeah but there is similar perks for weapons as well giving you 200% repair and cheaper cost 
---
I actually still use a pipe rifle and pipe pistols on my character people laugh when I pull it then see everything die (tse pipe rifle) 
---
Cryolator?
---
Not OP, but in multiplayer games it's that "competing with the Jones'" mindset I think.
---
do it 2 or 3 times more , it will be easier. a teammate is enough but you can still launch nuke alone.
---
I understand your feeling. When I started dating my husband, I didn't play any games. He turned me into a "gamer" slowly. My first real game I played by myself without his help was Boderlands. Then he got fallout4. I saw him playing so I figure I try it too. I was really bad at the game. But just like you teaching your girl, my husband did the same thing with me. Then fallout76 came out. I ordered the power Armor edition n he just got the regular game. I love this freaking game so much that I dont wait for him to play together as a team.
---
*"gamer" = I don't know if other ppl will consider me as a gamer, so I put the "." for gamer. 
---
Current state of PvP will have no future. Players that have top tier assassin's sentinel gear are unkillable. Unless they remove all legendaries in the upcoming PvP mode, it's dead within months.
---
Damn you're actually dumber than I thought. No. It's like 80th account. I've been doing this for months and a bitter cunt like you ain't going change a damn thing about it. 
---
Id like a actually trading post where you go put some stuff on the table and agree the trade is fair and then its good from there 
---
&gt; My boyfriend didnt find the humor in this photo and is deleting it from our games gallery. 
---
Not cool, not cool at all. The photo is hilarious. 
---
As a PC player this would make PvP too easy, so please no. I actually want a challenge. 
---
Cool, dude! Go sell your pixels elsewhere then!
---
i never said dont enjoy the game, i understand why people do its a fallout game go somewhere run through a cave/location kill some stuff loot etc. All i see on this sub is high praise of a company doing basic things like updates on a multiplayer game.... WoW/LoL/Dota/Destiny/Csgo all do that. its the basic function of a multiplayer game all im saying is they pulled alot of bs and need to be held accountable for it. By all means enjoy the game play it all day but continue to point out the major flaws 
---
Sorry you guys don't understand a role playing game is more about atmosphere than Npc. 
---
Keep on hating, I'm having a blast.
---
they actually had the planters in the preview videos that were from the fallout 4 dlc I am still confused why they are not in the game yet and think it has something to do with the camp sync or something like that 
---
Takes about 20-40 minutes to finish the quest, its not like its amazingly difficult. If you'd have looked around a bit im sure you'd have figured it out :)
---
totally agree with this . 
---
Its probably cause every 10 mins the server saves and you left before the 10 min make making it so you lost the plans and the caps some how its happened to me 
---
Cool, I won‚Äôt be on for a little bit but I‚Äôll send u a message when I get there 
---
Yes, but in my experience, I get more caps if I have 3 on me instead of 1. One of them pays me 25 caps, having 3 of them on me pays 40 caps.
---
This is a great idea. I'm glad someone thought of it. There seem to be a lot more men in the game than there are women, so having a way for women to team up and not have to worry about being harassed is important. I mean maybe there are more women playing than might be obvious, since my wife worked in the video game industry for a few years doing customer support for an MMO and knows quite a few women who played as Male characters just to avoid being harrassed.
---
I have one myself but wife‚Äôs always around and I try to be respectful lol but on vacation this week peol are gonna be hearing some random stuff for sure!! Bwahah like as I am I. Chameleon..yay Father has brought me a new toy! It sure smells pretty..giggles 
---
Just store the one thing u can fix and repair everything else? 
---
yeah its probably one of the best and most expected lines I've run into
---
that and grahm every time I hear him I run like a kid chasing ice cream truck music 
---
They want people to keep playing the game. Sorry they didn‚Äôt think of you when they made this game. Plus nuke zones are end game zones, sorry you have to work for it and are not just handed it with little effort. 
---
I believe that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt include PTT in the beginning. After they included PTT, then nobody uses their mic and wants text chat. 
---
My house IRL is brick with a plaster interior. I use it ingame too.
---
Bethesda is pretty salty at obsidian for nv so I doubt this will happen
---
Alright lets talk updates. How long did it take them to patch the dupe bug? the server crashing bug? imagine if Wow/runescape or any other mmo ( yes thats what 76 is) that has player trading mechanics allow a bug that makes rare end game loot worthless lol.
---
I got a pretty frustrating crash this morning. On the road to vendoring a bunch of junk, I stopped to help new players against a scorchbeast. I died and crashed at the "select respawn point" menu. Bye bye junk. 
---
dude this is brilliant . stealing this for my suggestions list 
---
Free states for life 
---
THIS!!!
---
With the items actually visible in game, and some sort of pose taken by the two characters like at crafting stations? That would be awesome. 
---
Nice! I like the landing but after a while it gets tedious. Especially if it‚Äôs a really low ledge... 
---
Sniper rifle was great up until level ~45, by the time I hit level 60 my Sniper Rifle was tediously bad, I mean ***awful***.  
---
When I found out that the weapon I had been dreaming about, since the day I placed my pre order: .50 BMG Sniper was *weaker* than my already pathetic .308 Sniper, I wanted to scream and cry, and submitted a refund request.
---
I haven't dropped the game off at my local Amazon for the refund yet, but....  
---
I think it's stupid how high melee damage can get w/the broken Perk multipliers, beyond stupid.
---
I've seen it happen to others that weren't my kid....could care less....but mine?....well that made me react lol
---
Also interested but I doubt it based on how other stuff works 
---
Mabey some animations but id be fine with a simple table and what not kinda like the card game tables form new vegas
---
I don't know, if we can only trade for caps and not for items (safely) then it does the opposite of that. 
---
Because fix it good won't always proc visually for me, I usually select another piece after repairing, then back to the repaired piece, to confirm the extra CND was applied. I think it resyncs it to do that, or maybe I'm just superstitious, but it's a habit now.
---
Are you are entitled to playing the game how you want, others are equally entitled for viewing you as an asshole for how you play. It works both ways.
---
Most games complain that all the best items are locked behind micro transactions. This game, people complain the micro transactions suck. That‚Äôs on the devs. No excuse for that.
---
I make a hiabit of blowing up every car before I get near it with enemies... save the worry
---
yeah I have a lvl 95 with all the goodies and I discovered its boring so figured I'd work on a team based medic character got 2-3 friends together and we now run around lvl 19 ish and run back and forth screaming and laughing 
---
Team consist of me pistol medic - a sniper - shotgun bandit - and either a knife rogue or a sledge hammer red shirt depending on his mood 
---
and I laugh so hard I can't breath from it 
---
You would just get a larger forest area.
---
Silos are the same. It took me a couple of hours my first time because I didn‚Äôt have all hacker perks and got lost a lot on my way to the fourth task room.
---
Tips would be to have hacker perks since using the terminals to bypass some rooms/enemies makes the whole process so much easier. I think by my third time I was done in 15 minutes or less. Circuits and steel help with the mainframe cores,so if you have extras bring them and craft them inside to save more time.
---
Agh thank you. 
---
They really need to let people fix their game. There are those (as yourself) already putting in effort to find solutions to our problems. Not saying YOU would, but Im sure there are those who would love to mend this game just for the sake of doing it. Beth needs to let you guys have at it.
---
Side note: Pretty sure 'detect life' was broken on this game a few weeks ago. I guess they fixed it, but broke the whole game doing so. üò£
---
Nope not in whitesprings, it‚Äôs north of it near the lookout spot there.
---
To be honest, if your base is at the Whitesprings you deserve what's coming to you. Please give us feedback on it's destruction :) 
---
But with a geck you could make each zone unique with its product and enemy's 
---
Im starting a New character, a taichi monk who fight unarmed and pr√°ctice material detachment, my own zen play to enjoy the apalachia 
---
You really showed him
---
put a timer on passive to prevent passive popping
---
I think some of these things work multiplicatively rather than additively. Some also have unpublished caps (e.g. Furious).
---
Yea that happened to me last night on XB1. So I just roamed around collecting flux and getting some xp. Weird 
---
That‚Äôs what I should‚Äôve done. When I saw him attacking tho I let my competitive side get the best of me, thought I could kill him, but got rushed by two of his other buddies who weren‚Äôt there initially.
---
Which BoS PA paints?
---
Just realized you‚Äôre probably talking about player to player trading. Yeah idk why that‚Äôs set up like that. They probably just copied off the vendor model. 
---
Initiate and Knight. 
---
Possibly.
---
On the other hand, a lot of players nuke Fissure Site Prime in such a way as to deliberately exclude Drop Site C2, which allows everyone to participate even if they don't have Power Armor.  If you get disconnected at that point, you've got to be ready to swap into that Hazmat Suit or Power Armor when you come back.
---
Stupid plants needing to grow in stupid dirt. 
---
I was infuriated the other day. My queen kill dropped marine torso plans and I couldnt loot them as I had the error where you can see the loot but cant take it. Made me thoroughly mad
---
Hey, did you ever figure this tombstone thing out? Just discovered it myself. There was 2 unique hats on the graves, too.
---
No, I got banned for this.. killed a super took all he‚Äôs stuff which was a lot. So when Bethesda did there ‚Äúscan inventory thing.‚Äù They took it to understand I was duping just because I had a bunch of stuff on me. 
---
Using CS and explaining this to them is like pulling teeth. 
---
just because you personally haven't experienced something doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  this game has fewer griefers than most online games
---
Wish you'd ever been on my server! I always announce it in the Trade Discord that I'm going to launch a nuke and ask for help, and people only care when I say I'm launching it lol
---
The responder bots share 200 caps, so the responder bot at Flatwoods will cover selling things at all the railroad stations on the west side of the map. The Sutton train station is a raider not and has a separate 200 caps and you can get there quickly from Flatwoods. Next sell point is at Whitesprings, then Harpers Ferry, Watoga train station, Watoga shopping center, and Whitsprings bunker. Each of those has a separate 200 caps to collect. There are 2 traveling salesmen, one is a responder bot and shares with the other responders, the other is a friendly supermutant which shares with either Harpers Ferry or Watoga shopping center though I dont immediately recall which.
---
So many robots at Whitsprings say "Yes MA'AAAAAAAAM!"
---
That repeated phrase, subtley-monotoned with a carried pitch, gets me laughing for some reason.  Which has my husband, a fellow former vault dweller, laughing too.
---
My rad shower has never erased any of my 12 mutations. Sounds like a bug.
---
Had this happen last night but it was all 3star Liberators. Lasted about 20 minutes before the server crash.
---
What console are you? I have an incomplete spare one I can give you.
---
Ive used decontamination shower in the uranium fever place about half a dozen times with starched genes level 2 and havnt lost any mutations from it. I have around 5/6. I hope this isnt the case as i didnt want to use all my radaway
---
Making a solo Revenant build? If so, please share!
---
I'm on PS4. Never the less, thank you very much! 
---
Every group request I‚Äôve accepted sounds like some pre-teen yelling ‚Äúaaaaaaaaah‚Äù into his mic constantly. 
---
also that
---
I was thinking this last time I was planting crops. They we're in Fallout 4.
---
Whoever it is in the marketing, finance or whatever function that keeps fixating on producing fortnite style items needs to do a straw poll on here to check the age of the player base
---
What‚Äôs the cap on furious?
---
Me too. Add me Cowz80. What level are you, I'll see if anything is your level?
---
All I want for Christmas is for the .50 BMG Sniper to be epically awesome instead of doing less damage than my pump air rifle that I bought (IRL) to kill rats.
---
Never in any game have I seen anything as pathetically stupid as how low the base damage is for a .50 Sniper Rifle in this game.
---
And the Melee perk damage multipliers are friggin INSANE OP!!?!
---
I'll add you now. Currently level 16!
---
Oh, it is?  Well, that would make it useful then.
---
I never bothered with Blocker because while it sounded like a good idea, in practice, I rarely block.
---
Yes. After you enter the building via elevator you'll need to find these green tube elevators to ascend to the next level. Walk around the elevator you used to enter the building and you should see them.
---
Huge spoilers here.  https://fo76map.com
---
I believe that no one no one can tell how to play a free roam open world game. That said; pascifist mode needs to be set to no slap damage for sure, including camps. Dupers, on the other hand, are/were really taking balance/stability out of the game
---
Yeah, AR15s should be almost as common as dirt - what's up with not having them?
---
I have been waiting on somone to mention this forever now. It is very immersion breaking 
---
Yeah that happened to me too. Had the 3 story building with the stacked staircases and a bunch of decor. Had to build from scratch, so I stopped doing that. Lol
---
A property of gameplay sometimes called "Time until Kill" or "Time to Kill" is really important for satisfying PvP, and if you get rolled instantly with no chance of fighting back that's not satisfying at all.  
---
GTAV gets this wrong too, an hour of grinding deliveries can disappear with a one-shot rocket launcher from some random who was just passing by and had no reason to fire. It's not satisfying, and doesn't feel balanced. It's really hard to fix that when you have mixed level players in the same server.
---
If I don't have any power armor near that level I'll give you a chassis and some fusion cores.
---
It worked! Thanks a lot
---
sure, you'll see, when they split the servers the majority of the playerbase will play on the adventure servers, and when the PvP players realize there is no one on the PvP servers they will just play on the adventure servers and use twisted muscles, bobbleheads, chems, and perks and just run around one shotting other players while the PvP servers sit empty...
---
Same for me, man. Downing that cargobot with a melee character was where I deuced out.
---
That's stupid logic considering if Bethesda didnt want people building bases there you wouldnt be allowed to. Fact is you people have nothing better to do. Unfortunately for y'all neither do I. So I sit and wait for the base destroyers with y'alls pOs TSE shotguns to get owned by a real build. üòÇüòÇüòÇ my count so far this morning is 11-0 poor sods manage to bust one wall before they get their heads knocked off. And the only reason they even get that is because I won't attack somone until I see that bounty over their head. 
---
Another thing to remember is if someone is in team voice chat, it's kinda a pain in the ass to switch to area.
---
Thanks man! 
---
What is a geck??
---
This one is a synth, get him!
---
Okay so there are 7 vendor cap pools (8 if you count Grahm). Once you've wiped out a pool, any of the vendors that share with that pool will also have 0 caps. The pools reset 24 hours after you've last traded with them.  Theres a map somewhere that has them all color coded but I can help break some of it down.
---
Harpers Ferry, Whitesprings Bunker, Watoga Station, and the BoS vendor in Watoga are all unique vendors and do not share caps with any other vendor.
---
Whitesprings resort and Whitesprings station are the only 2 vendors in their respective pool.
---
Everything else (and the majority of the vendors in the game) shares from 2 different pools. Without the map it's impossible to list them for you. 
---
Hope that helps!
---
In my house....we redefine "family game night" lol
---
Yeah he guessed it lol sorry I was smashing a base bully at the time üòÇ
---
Ever since the days of MS Windows 95A/95B, Software Producers/ Developers have recalled hard copy of products if the production disc required a 50%+ Upgrade to make it function properly.   
---
So Bethesda Started the Recalled of Physical MEDIA CD/DVD versions Fo76 games due to multiple Huge Updates, that **must** be performed after initial install of game to have it Functional! It was a logical step and had no Free to Play meanings or inclinations.   
---
This Rumor was caused by 1 clueless retail worker  and one Rumor Mill Youtuber  who spread the False rumor
---
Damn, solid. Agree 100%. If I may also add a slight rant/opinion. We got the same engine and problems as fallout 4 and a lot of stuff from the game, but yet we lack any decent legendary weapon effects or any of the rare collectibles. It‚Äôs like we have less than half a game. Idk about you but I wouldn‚Äôt mind using other weapons if they actually did any kind of decent damage, but out of the 1000s of legendaries I‚Äôve farmed only 6 are decent and they all have the same effect. So what are we grinding for?
---
Idk if I'll be on today but my gt is MrNaglebums. I have 3 kids too so I play randomly. I'm lvl 37. 
---
LMAO bet you 2k you can't damage a single item of my base on the inside
---
Luck tree: class freak
---
Reduces the negative effects of your mutations by (25/50/75%) depending on what level you get it to.
---
Not even close to griefing 
---
Hit you with like 12x MIRV Grenades try me dawg 
---
I dont
---
Awesome cheers dude, I only have a single hacker perk so may wait and get the other two before I try
---
Ah cool man, I‚Äôm only level 40ish so not come across majority of perks yet üëåüèΩ thanks 
---
Perks are ***so*** broken in terms of damage multipliers/insanely high max damages for melee and TSE weapons.
---
Once I went over level 60 or so rifle became pathetic - unplayably weak, until I got TSE Rifles.  They seem somewhat OP in PVE, but stupidity so when it comes to PVP.
---
On PS4, I uninstalled/reinstalled the app after the last patch and have had far less trouble since. I also switched up my PA and stopped using a jetpack. No crashes in days... needed my jetpack last night and equipped it. Crashed the instant I started sprinting. Lol.
---
Please just stop. Nothing is going to make this game better unless you fix the online economy for it. You have given up on that end and pretend it‚Äôs not an issue. No amount of things you add to the game will make it better. 
---
It's in the 40s
---
Using Serums reduces the negative side effects for a period of time while allowing the positives. Don't know if it was a glitch but I had marsupial for quite a while at low level from a serum and though it showed my negative to intelligence in the stat screen it never required me to remove perk cards or showed my negatives anywhere else. 
---
Yeah, isn't it great how you can't do that already? /s
---
Sounds like this person plays 7D2D.
---
Should get it soon then
---
How does autostim stack?  Higher chance?  Lower cooldown?  Thanks!
---
Ah yes. The pathetic high level excuse of "I have nothing to do for fun" that justifies being a dick. Bethesda has other stuff to do atm rather than checking the whole map to see if the camp forbidden zones have been placed properly. Find something other to amuse your moronic little brain or stop playing.
---
this is my issue, 90% of the time im playing 76 im in a team, and its kinda a hassle to toggle area chat mode and back and forth.  would love push to talk options
---
Lets be honest, if melee weapons performed similar to rifles, people would just end up using rifles because how versatile rifles are. The current state gives people incentive to use them. However, I will agree under some circumstances, for example, one-shotting a player with any weapon needs to be addressed. I'd probably would fix that by reducing the damage of weapons against players. The only way you should hit harder vs players is if you're in possession of Assassin modded weapons.
---
dam, I have no idea. I'll have to test it out
---
The best places I've found for power armor is the sons of dane compound with high lock pick and point pleasant on a roof near the bridge
---
If like some sort of condenser so I can build on a cliff face. 
---
Rifle damage needs to be buffed!?!
---
The only nerfs should be to perk multipliers and capping the insanely high MAX damages you can get.
---
Well somebody hadn't realised there are hotkeys in this game they can use.
---
If it just says "reactive plates" and not "t60 reactive plates" then it's for excavator power armor 
---
The other day, me and a buddy met up at The Whitespring. I was standing by a downed Legendary so i could point my friend to it (was bloodbug half under a bus, so not necessarily noticeable). Chaos ensued, the bus blew up, i died. My friend guarded my loot for me, and just as i was running up to collect it, I crashed. Luckily, he didnt and he wound up collecting it for me as it took forever to get back in. 
---
Similarly, died behind the bus at the Golf Club, bluescreened, rejoined friend, but couldnt find my bag. Friend bluescreened, and as he re-entered the server, i bluescreened. Again, luckily, I was able to hop back onto the server through him, just as he bluescreened, AGAIN, found my bag, and DC'd moments later.
---
Glad i found my shit, but Im not always going to have a friend around to replicate these kind of scenarios..
---
REMINDER: Any attempted five-finger discounts will be RECLAIMED and paid for with *said* fingers.
---
you clearly don't know what youre talking about and it's even more embarrassing lmao. Go play sea of thieves then
---
Class freak rank 3 *Luck* will negate the negatives by 75%.  You can also get gear/weapons that increase special attribute points. 
---
I don't have a spare chassis so let me go get you one. I'll be right back.
---
Not sure if it was lag or some  - all I got back was the half used fusion core.  No PA body parts. :(
---
A Garden Of Eden Creation Kit, standard in some vaults to jump start rebuilding the land. You can type it in Google and check the wiki page for more info. Vault City is for example a city based around a GECK.

Yeah, no kidding. I have missiles on mine. Only 2 because I also have a junk extractor and an adhesive farm. They don't seem to do anything. A workshop griefer that was bobblehead stacking was taking shots from about 6-8 missile turrets and just laughed them off. I'm assuming it was bobbleheads because he was practically invincible to everything.
---
Thanks buddy! 
---
Ah right, just not keen on temporary fixes for stuff if you get me. You just reminded me, I have 14 to STR but it shows a (-) symbol next to it, but I‚Äôve looked everywhere to see what‚Äôs reducing it and there‚Äôs not a single thing. You think that‚Äôs just a glitch too? 
---
You know if you deploy it and not drop it from inventory no one can take it right?
---
Not sure but myself and my buddy always run non power armored melee mutation builds so if they were in power armor it wasn't me. Doesn't sound like me to leave someone hanging on a scorchbeast attack. In this video, the person specifically kited the SB to my Camp to try to destroy it hoping the blasts would go through the walls and do damage
---
Thanks man, I'll take a look! 
---
To make 1 stable flux it requires:
---
1 high radiation fluid, 1 glowing mass, 1 hardened mass, and 10 of the raw flux you are making
---
Green thumb + super super are your friends 
---
i did not know that, is use heavy combat armor
---
Do those increases override max SPECIAL stat points? Like I can‚Äôt put any more into STR, so would the gear have no effect? 
---
Lol
---
I think it is but, it might just be that the changes in stats are there and we are not seeing the effects
---
Oh great. More PA mods that crash the game..
---
Am I able to uninstall/reinstall if i have a digital version of the game? Never made a point to do anything like that to know.
---
until I got a new controller the game would crash every time I plugged my headset into a failing but still working controller.  they need a text chat.
---
Gold club is amazing for fluorescent, yellow and cobalt. Go more towards the train tracks, very easy to pick 60+ raw cobalt in one pass.
---
THIS. This need to happen. 
---
You got banned for too much junk?  I don't buy that.  I'm guessing you stole the items out of the container, which... I mean, come on.  You knew those items were hot.
---
I mean, this is the equivalent of "No, officer, that 9kg bag of heroin isn't mine.  I just grabbed it from some dudes unlocked car.  Clearly he's a dealer.  But I'm not!"
---
Hell ya thank you, that could add some interesting dynamics to the games
---
The only thing I've ever bought was the Nuka Cola profile picture and the hot rod paint for the power armor station. The only two items I found that are actually cool imo
---
your a good man charlie brown
---
PSA Guys, abuse glitches and exploits. It's what winners do.
---
Yeah, I had read something about that but it was badly worded and I wasn't really sure what it meant. Thanks for the info!
---
so far i got the crow face paint, race car beds, patriot power armor, and the princess castle bed.I like the atom shop so far. 
---
It doesn't take it, you give it away. 
---
Your gear can just randomly appear in the list when it's not supposed to and you can accidentally click it and transfer it into the container that chews it up thus forever deleting it. 
---
It's a stupid bug that has been in the game since beta and should've been fixed by now. But you can still do the event without losing items, you just got to be very slow, deliberate and careful when clicking and handing in the items, to make sure no equipment presents itself as an option.

set food to presets

get perkcard preset mod 
---
set disease to preset

---
What platform? I had the same problem on XB1 last week spent 30-45 minutes rushing the silo for it to glitch when I FT to just outside the nuke zone.
---
If your on XB1 I have 15 repaired mainframe cores spare from my last run.
---
Just like manure.
---
And then you could nuke the area and get all the flux.  
---
It's OP basically 1 shot everything but Scorchbeasts/queens if I'm remembering correctly Two-Shot is going from 100% to 25% added damage and explosive is adding only 20% damage
---
And at least 5 mutations
---
Can I get more info on that? Must've missed it.
---
No problem hopefully it helps alleviate some frustration
---
No, it is a bug.  Probably a mis-named mod.  I have one too.  I don‚Äôt see it listed  under gamma gun in the spreadsheets on this sub, either.
---
Unless you have the OP TSE + Demolition perk - every time PVP Rifle vs Melee: the Melee guy just laughs at the rifle guy as he just runs right at the rifle dude, basically ignoring the hits, then quickly kills the Rifle dude like he could have done it while taking a nap.  
---
The only thing worse in the game, that's even more broken, is the TSE Shotgun w/Demolition perk.
---
1 shot kills vs players all day long, it's basically not even worth calling it a "game" anymore at that point, call lit "get fucked by the douchebag with the OP weapon that's so bad, it's even worse than the cheaters in other FPS games".
---
On xbox you can get a mutation RECIPE for around 2400 caps
---
Awwww how cute ‚ù§ I must have struck a nerve. Since you have such amazing insight on these "forbidden zones" perhaps you Would like to share the link from the inside the vault edition that says the golf club was supposed to be a forbidden build zone? No? Patch notes then? I mean surely you have some justification to back up your accusations that the area is forbidden right? I mean this is reddit where we back up our claims with proof right? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòé I will keep building my base here and wrecking wannabe hard asses like you all day sweetheart cause your "forbidden" logic is as dumb as you building your base on a mountain some where somebody finds it and destroys it then says well that's what you get for building in a forbidden zone. Fact is you're just pissy cause you probably got your ass handed to you trying to wreck someones base. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Well, it is gonna help with stress but I'm still gonna have to wait around since the frames are dumped in inventory and I'll have to put them back in a stash box. 
---
The duration is tiny and does not affect mobs at all.  Failed implementation.
---
It is weird that out of the 2 known bugs for this quest from BETA, they fixed the beneficial one (that no-one thought was even a bug) and left the one that hurts the player's experience.
---
I think you missed the entire point of his post. He‚Äôs merely calling griefers assholes, that is it. You put way too much thought into it, or no thought at all because you likely didn‚Äôt read it like most of the other people who have responded.
---
I think a lot of you need to retake some middle school reading comprehension classes.
---
I‚Äôll stick with asylum uniforms at 40 each..
---
That's cause it doesnt affect your allotted points. It only affects the bonuses of that special.  I.e endurance negatives will only affect your health
---
I picked up mine in the Toxic Valley. 
---
Take an adictall, sometimes it wont show an addiction, but still takes away the point. I would not try to play without marsupial.
---
Why?
---
It works. Trust me. Same as contractor reduced costs at CAMP. 
---
And they just left all those duped items in the game.
---
Glitch? Maybe but doubtful
---
Exploit? Hardly.
---
Its crops man chill, and grab ur self a snack. If its patched " shrug" if not ...whats the harm compared to physics defying camps?
---
Lol 
---
After 166 levels, I'm convinced I ain't gonna find heavy legendary, let alone a TSE.  So yeah, I ain't too proud. 
---
Two minutes max all of which isn't required to get the point. Please explain how the title is inaccurate?
---
Eh, I think the items are fine, but the prices are absurd.
---
that is the queens drop
---
One would think three months would have been enough time to tweak some numbers.
---
This makes so much sense! I‚Äôll give it a blast (no pun intended). I think I might have to try get it back because I‚Äôm constantly suffering from the ‚Äúoverencumbered for most of my days‚Äù syndrome. 
---
Yeah, certainly. I know it's an old remedy, but I have always given a fresh install on game updates. Habitual holdover from my days of early PC gaming. 
---
I hope you try to destroy mine, the walls are concrete foundations and there are 50 sirens inside! Have fun!
---
Pretty sure it was around 30% more damage
---
Why would you need justification? The golf course is a building like others in the game world. Why would Bethesda allow you to build it there but not on, let's say, the Charleston Capitol Building? You're the type of person that would break social etiquette just because "there wasn't a sing saying not to".
---
My wife doesn‚Äôt play the games I do but tends to enjoy the character creation aspect of it, so I let her do it, she replicates our family, so three male characters and herself, and I‚Äôll play them all with different build styles. 
---
You don‚Äôt want to get me started on my observations about the differences in player interactions I have when I‚Äôm running my wife‚Äôs character model, but suffice to say that it‚Äôs the only camp with locked ‚Äúprivate quarters‚Äù.
---
Someone suggested I remove the targeting HUD from my PA yesterday because my game crashed every 5min, removed it and didn't crash again last night. Don't know if you're using the targeting HUD but, now you know. 
---
My favorite out of all of them.
---
Thanks for thr info, Ill give it a shot.
---
The communities general consensus will dictate what that means. And it definitely seems that the consensus has agreed with OP that certain behavior does classify in the asshole category. 
---
Surely rough and tough raiders wouldn‚Äôt be in the slightest bothered by being called an asshole, right? (The responses to this post clearly proves they are bothered)
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer this was a reported issue since beta, is the team aware of it? Or have there been difficulties in patching?
---
No way that‚Äôs horrible, I thought it was 15% per shot with a cap in like the 80s 90s but didn‚Äôt have any proof
---
Enclave can use the botstop, and  I am a damn general!  Where is my bot?
---
Go back in time to November when we got 500-1000 xp for killing just about anything that was high level 
---
Whatn sick human soul in any curcumstances will cancel super hero landing? It is damn super hero landing, power armor charm is 50% consist of this super hero landing. I will never ever cansel it, not in a million years. It's just too cool.
---
Yeah, Wallace is the best. Free States for life!
---
They over ride that special's max in bonuses only.  They dont add more allotment points for you to add more perk cards. The cap for any special is 15.  Say you have 15 points in strength. If you have gear that adds strength it will only increase your melee damage and carry weight.
---
if you have been visited all locations so you did all of them.
---
I would love to. Add me on Xbox gt eternalscourge next time I'm on and you have time I'll show u what's up. Doesn't matter how many mini nukes hit the walls bc they are invincible bro that's the whole point. And I left no cracks in the foundation.
---
Farming for legendaries is one reason I hate this game.. this ain't Eldor Scrolls save all that magic BS for someone else.. it is immersion breaking to me to have these features.. and it sucks that every player and their mom(I have a few too) is rockin legendary weapon garbage.. I with they would remove them entirely and do some balancing to player damage and npc creature health to get rid of this dumb shit.
---
Happened to me with the Excavator left leg.  This is the only glitch in 40 lvls that made me ‚ÄúUgh.‚Äù
---
Good luck, my camp is literally completely inaccessible without a cooking station, which I remove when I leave üòâ
---
Yeah the one pts don't do much
---
lol rip
---
As previously stated the bounds og the golf club are already set. I havent seen a base yet that is next to a building. You are just trying to summon up some incomprehensible logic to justify smashing peoples bases and failing miserably.
---
Excavator Power Armor has the worst resistance out of all Power Armors, and PVP is broken. But good job for defending your lawn
---
So in the game fallen earth, a horrible mmo of the past there where slot machines and blackjack machines that where litterally a money sink however with enough luck you could walk away with more money than you started with or be broke... I like this idea.
---
Hands off my shrouded unyielding wood armour you uneducated heathen. 
---
Well, if you have just equip starched genes and use the shower right after that it's totally possible. Had that happen to me already twice! It has something to do with server lag.
---
Power Connectors.
---
Plans need to be bought from the Enclave.
---
TSEs are already terrible for the queen, and after patch they'll be much much worse. Look at your perk deck, choose the right perks and you can make any medicre weapon an absolute killing machine lol
---
Ah that‚Äôs brill then. Just making sure they wouldn‚Äôt be a wasted choice in terms of gear üëåüèΩ
---
I already got the plans thanks
---
Your kind praise is much appreciated good sir.
---
He‚Äôs literally just sharing his opinion that he thinks people that fit this criteria are assholes, why is everyone thinking into it so much and jumping to wild assumptions that OP never stated.
---
I've seen tones of people using it so I just assumed that it was pretty good compared to other sets like raiders. Kinda puts me off making it for the quest 
---
thanks ill make sure to take those and cook :D
---
Absolutely worth it! 
---
Campfires also work for placing the pressure switch and other stuff that requires dirt, but they do seem to take up a lot of house budget.
---
Were you disconnected?
---
I want 3 star wood armor pieces!

---
Indeed i am, got the same advice as well. Havent gotten the chance to try it out yet. Thanks for the clarification.
---
BGS needs to get on top of this.
---
That‚Äôs weird because it wouldn‚Äôt let me install the calibrated shocks on my X-01 without the perk active.
---
Wallace is my favorite vendor bot 
---
This is false people got banned because of items from the developer room. While I hope dupers get banned, there has been no evidence that anyone was banned specifically for duping.
---
Rationalize all you want, but if you think developers wanted you to plant things and set water purifiers over burning coals, you're delusional. This exact mentality lead to duping.
---
So, Melee is going to be the only reliable build ? I've tried to play something different, but not having any TS or TSE weapons makes it horribly difficult. I have a gatling gun that does 100+ damages per shot, and two bullets of that doesn't even come close to the effective damage of my super sledge that has the speed bonus.
---
I never saw a game where it was easyer to avoid griefers than in F76. Devs gave so much things to avoid that, it's silly.
---
Yes, for some reason they called it pure flux instead of stable but they‚Äôre the same thing.
---
I found the silo run very difficult the first time I ran it at level 35ish, wait till you level much higher 60-70 and you can run it in as little as 30 minutes if you know the route, hack every terminal to disable all turrets and some bots.
---
they also need to be able to be seen from further away . you have to be right on top of someone to see them
---
Yes that's annoying. If you have access to it, you can use a dense mod on your torso armor to reduce the explosion damage of bus and cars, to the point where you can melee them without getting damaged. 
---
Yea, the perk could be better. The higher ranks of it aren't worth it for a tiny bit more range. They should change it so it reduces the time it takes for a grenade to explode after impact instead, so that at max rank it doesn't bounce, but simply blows up when it hits.
---
*eyeroll* grab a snickers keyboard warrior there is no battle here. 
---
In F4, tactical red did not break stealth, right?  Or less?
---
The only reason people use it is because it gives +100 carry weight while wearing the full set, combined with Calibrated Shocks and you'll have +200 carry weight
---
I got it while running from a Wendigo

Hey man dont forget that no loot spawns on her corpse 80% of the time. After 6 times trying to kill her, finally killed her and she dropped nothing. Was oof. Looked it up and it happens majority of the time. After getting the achievement, I could care less about the queen.
---
Oh caravan is great! Would be fun to play against other players. 
---
Haha i have a photo at that same spot!! 
---
Preach brotha!! Forcreal this is needed for sure
---
Ever played ‚ÄúThe Long Dark‚Äù? That‚Äôs a wilderness survival game that requires you to eat, drink, and sleep (not required on FO76), as well as managing an inventory weight limit, and I can get fully emerged in that game.  
---
Now, I will say that I do lose the feel of immersion when I become encumbered on FO76, where I don‚Äôt break immersion on TLD when it happens. I believe, for me, it has to do with the vast amount of different gear FO76 has that TLD doesn‚Äôt.
---
My friend bought 76 and i was excited as i would actually have someone to play with. But problems immediately arose when id hear him say shit like "wow that quest was dumb" and "i want to do something fun". Thats when i knew he would never touch the game again. And a few days later he went back and replayed Red Dead...god i need some open minded gamer friends who are willing to no life games with me :(
---
You gain 100 carry weight using the excavator set, that's why you see so many using it.
---
It's also bugged at the moment as well, so if you log out wearing it then come back in you gain another 100 carry weight. So potentially 200 carry weight, is i would assume why you see so many wearing it :)
---
If you drawn into PVP with someone wearing PA get in close and be ready with a cola or a stim and you always have a chance :)
---
Not sure how your friend noticed he was acting shady by the stash though if he was a few rooms away and overweight so couldn't get to you for the fight :)
---
There is another user here who posted a GREAT way to block this cave as well check out u/Errl_Harbor great design as well on the outside at least :p but to completely seal off every crack takes work and was extremely frustrating for me with what I was trying to do design wise (and to somehow get the stairs inside the foundation to seal off the edge). 
---
same. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 Curie
---
A day later still acting rude seems pretty childish... kiddo
---
Hmm, that is a novel way yo bait people into pvp. I'd try it if I didn't want to move my  camp. Just build a platform with a few turrets and sit up on the roof with some stealh armor picking people off.
---
I used to use a endangerol stringer on the queen, until I got tired of toting it around just for her.
---
I switched mine out for the +1 intelligent MOD, the sensor array I think is what it's called for the t-60 and excavator. It sucks that I can't see my targets as well any more but, I don't get the corrupted data crash now. 
---
Mutations are 100% worth it. Only wish they had some cosmetic to then as well.
---
Mics are great until you try to use them on xbox granted im useing a afterglow controler and a cheep Mic From Xbox.

Cool story bro
---
Yeah would be a good idea, nothing stopping them doing it to be fair 
---
Have seen this pop up time to time. Were you using the d-pad to swap weapons?
---
What does that one do?
---
That has been a big point of the game the entire time. ‚ÄúMultiplayer‚Äù and ‚ÄúPvP‚Äù brings in a lot of players that power grind for loot. Which is only a fraction of where the enjoyment comes from. Unfortunately for Bethesda, squad based loot grinding and taking time to adventure and read notes are conflicting methods for a lot of people. 
---
How good is ultracite ammo compared to normal? Like .308 to ultracite .308? More damage?

You too lol
---
He never changes his weapon plans so once you pass a certain level all he sells is radium rifles
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt give reasons.
---
I tried this but it didn't work. After turning in the first one pulling out new ones didn't trigger the quest.
---
That HUD causes crashes regularly. I would highly recommend not using it.
---
It decreases a targets damage resistances by 25%, so it basically makes a target take more damage for a certain amount of time.
---
Anti-armor and incisor does.  Which comes to ingnoring 125%.  But I'm sure the cap is just 100%
---
There are still some good legendary effects Instigating is 100% damage on full hp enemies, Bloodied( probably new meta) is the less hp you have your damage goes up. And Anti-Armor is solid on any weapon.
---
Definitely let us know if it works out. So far I only know it worked for me. It may be a solution to lots of players woes.
---
How can I assist *you* today?
---
Oh that‚Äôs pretty good any other ones that I should try out
---
I probably won't play that gamemode, then. I'm sure it'll be good, I'm just not a PvP person when it comes to games like Fallout where you have an inventory full of stuff. I like PvP in other games, like Call of Duty.
---
They should also update Power Armor so that it doesn't take the same amount of damage that a normal player would from something like a pipe  rifle.
---
Give it another year. 
---
Love that batteries included works with my legendary Gatling plasma too!
---
Could be sarcasm?

I haven't really messed with the other ones to much.  The karma one is fun if you like a challenge

I don‚Äôt get CTD, BUT sometimes fast travel to and from locations, trainyards or workshops in PA, I‚Äôll get a HUD black screen.

My only recourse is to completely logging off and quit and it will restore 
---
I'm loaded with all the heavy weapon perks at the moment.  The 50 Cal does a respectable 50 damage a shot, but I'm always in the market for improving that.  Tbh, I have fun without a legendary, so no, they aren't required.  Itd be fun tho
---
Rad sponge perk.  Walk up to a random in the nuke and team up; share radsponge and clear you and your new teammates rads
---
By that logic you are also a crybaby, for responding to cry about his crying.

How sad, I think I might cry
---
Well, idk lol? I never had any problem install PA mod with a mod not crafting a learned plan. And if u go google how to get let‚Äôs say X01 jet pack there are ppl record YouTube video install a purchased mod (not a learned plan again) w/o mats or perks
---
So the TSE issue is being addressed in the upcoming patch, that doesn't mean it will fully be fixed because we have to test it out and see if it continues to be a problem, but people will probably just jump to the conclusion and give the developers a hard time.
---
I have been at the end of getting one-shotted by an unarmed foe and it is frustrating, however, the developers don't know that until they get feedback, which I'm sure they have. The problem with the community is that it's easy to say fix something but don't take into consideration that something that may seem like a simple fix could be difficulty because it could also affect other parts of the game in which they would also have to adjust.
---
The community can be very toxic when providing feedback to developers, but don't realize the reason many games are released broken or unfinished is because publishers rely on pre-order numbers rather than expectations. The business practice is to make half the product, get paid, then either finish the product while monetizing or just focus on monetizing.
---
Agreed. When im teamed up, we are mics on all the time. When im solo, i usually have it off. But when i meet someone i will turn it back on. It makes everything easier.
---
Im on PS4, so text and PTT would be a pain.
---
What useless garbage... 100% yes.
---
I was gunna call BS but ya beat me to it lol. 
---
The rat tunnels in the Bog, just look out for any Charlies down there
---
I just want the planters that are already in the game.
---
I‚Äôve only seen plans
---
I should also give the disclaimer it will remove the in-game photo album it pulls load screens from. The photos are still on your ps4, just not in-game.
---
You click the armor, it shows level 40. You click on that (a leap of faith i know) and it will bring up the menu to craft level 40 or 50
---
Thanks for the help
---
I'm not familiar with the tools they use to set bounds and zones where you can't build but there's just no way that they left **just** that area in that's close to a building on purpose.
---
These would be perfect. 
---
I had to listen to a man tell off his young daughter this morning, it was funny but not very Fallout 5/10
---
Do you know one in the forest ( Besides the one near vault 76 ) or in Grafton ?
---
There's no possible way they left al that wide open area of green fields open for players to build on! There just isn't! And it is forbidden I know it! I cant prove it but it is forbidden! Said the boy who **didn't** live 
---
What happens when you nuke it though? (The GECKed area) 
---
Yeah I just planning on grinding and doing events. It's not that I'm dying a lot, it's just tedious and time consuming after you've already ran the Gambit to get there.
---
When I first started seeing the bombs fall I always built a small house near it. Mostly to just watch and have a place for folks to rest and play some music, and otherwise fix stuff up. Until I ended up on these fallout 76 subs, I hadn't realized what a problem it was for you all. I'm just saying a lot of folks just playing without digging deeper into the community may not know this is an issue, so maybe communicate this to the payer before destroying their homes.

Were you over encumbered?

You're like a real life follower. "I hear that silo is trouble. I'll help you if it keeps them bots off my water pumps."
---
You'll be carrying their crap before you realize it.
---
Yeah, I'm with you. I finally got around to it at level 70ish. It wasn't that it was hard, it's more that it was so... *tedious*. It was definitely a "do it once for the experience" kinda thing.
---
(It also didn't help that my first run I crashed out halfway through and had to start over, either.)
---
I'm just glad that I was able to launch the nuke, get to the surface, fast travel to the Bog, fight the SBQ, down her, and get the loot all without crashing. So I completed the end-to-end experience, and can now check that off my list. 
---
(And as a bonus, my nuke's fight with the SBQ was harder than any other I've done. I don't think I saw a single TSE in the group. Took us almost 15 minutes, and broke every gun I had. At the end I was reduced to swinging at her with my melee weapon in my unpowered PA. It was actually fun)

Fwiw, my toon has lockpick lvl1 and expert lockpick lvl1.

Chameleon armor is much more flexible than chameleon mutation.  Does not have the weightless constraints.
---
More nukeable boss zones, like giant deathclaws, or super mutant Behemoths when nuking locations.
---
Not just fissure site prime
---
You can put food,drink,chems on your fav wheel too. Its not just for weapons.
---
Also do you know **RULE 4 &amp; 7** Exactly that. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Nope, as far as I know those tunnels are the only campable cave in the entire map
---
I'm not sure if that's the one but I remember reading that the drug that makes them more dangerous for a bit before becoming vulnerable is bugged on the queen and doesn't work.  
---
The syringer sounds pretty useless to me, at least for enemies. If it can be used that way, it would make sense to buff your teammates with psycho and heal them on the go.
---
I like the Sunkissed perk for clearing rads
---
It really hurts the knees y'know
---
pacifist mode protects other players from you.  it's so you don't accidentally hit people without meaning to.
---
it only reduces incoming damage, and it has no effect on your camp at all.
---
that said, I want pvE servers.
---
The one that was bugged was the karma syringer.  The endangerol actually work fairly well for me when I used it on the queen
---
That one cracks me up every time. It‚Äôs so annoying!
---
When survival mode comes out, I'm going to make my second character and do this.
---
Eh. I mean I have a mic, I just encounter enough annoying people that I don't care to annoy others with my own mic. That and the fact that I've had teammates where all they talk about for hours is how to grow weed, it gets really old really quick. I'm sure there are good experiences, and I've definitely had some, but I'd pretty much only use it if I had actually friends to play with and not just random people that send me team request.
---
When visiting I presume you mean when the game tells you you‚Äôve discovered xxxxx location? Cause the high school in watoga has a quest when you ENTER the building but you don‚Äôt have to enter it to have the game pop up the you discovered xxxxxx location message. 
---
I‚Äôm talking about the collecting candy while getting chased/slapped around by ghouls (once it was robots) 
---
That's unfortunate. I'm only level 11 so will get wrecked if I go there.
---
I haven't broken either of those. And if anything you're the one not being civil spamming the same old shit with tons of mindless emojis whenever replying.
---
Good tip, didnt know it worked to that degree üëç
---
Doesnt mean they aren't still classified as a 2 handed weapon. It still works to increase damage. 
---
Wet knee Houston, Whitney Houston
---
What is the problem with building there?
---
Yep, after I posted this I leveled up and it appeared!
---
Rad sponge is OP, thats all you need with a team.
---
Pick locks good too to skip the reactor
---
I still listen to them weekly over and over again. Can't get enough of them
---
Pvp will be pointless unless they stop the exploits. So that is what I would want added. 
---
I haven't broke any of these rules! But yet you have no proof to show that building at the golf club is forbidden. And clearly you dont know what spam is üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Wait for Metro Exodus then lol. 
---
I'll be on after work at 2pm EST. Gamertag is MiniAdamO23. Level 36
---
In all my playing I've heard exactly one player over mic and that was before push to talk, the guy didn't realize his mumbling was going out.
---
I've *seen* the mic icon trigger a bunch but I guess somehow every person I've ever encountered that is talking is in a team.
---
That said, I don't talk without prompt either so I'm not exactly encouraging people to be more vocal.
---
Not because they're the closest thing to a NPC in the game
---
It is rather annoying when I have to cycle through my PA to figure out which one a arm or leg piece I found goes to. 
---
Internal Database adds INT, Sensor Array marks enemies with a blip üëç 
---
Sucks were forced to compromise.
---
You‚Äôre a bit of a softie eh? Getting your ruffles all in a bunch over someone calling you an asshole.
---
Hey look you even wrote 6 times as much as he did in response, I think they have some cream for that butt hurt.
---
I like to do this with my jet pack. Just a quick little burst before I land to negate it.
---
Don't forget the ultrawide "official support" causes other graphic bugs like seams in the water.
---
Well shit. This needs imediate attention. 
---
Just a child? My boy why would you wish to venture into caverns to live? Go outside and see the sun! Fret not what dwells above, the vault is in the past
---
Thats way too much to ask for. I can't even unPrime my crossbow, which is simple wood and metal, which is only allowed to fire ultracite bolts. It's like putting on a sock and only allowed to wear one type of shoe forever. 
---
Whether intentional or not, i think wallace remains ideologically consistent in that regard. It's up to YOU to kill those ghouls; you're responsible for your own safety. Live and let live. 
---
Now the bos vendorbot phoenix on the otherhand... stays on the warpath. Ironically enough... destroying technology.
---
I know this spot briefly considered a build there before abandoning it. Amazing work.
---
I just love how you guys tout opinion as if the stuff is objectively bad. All subjective.
---
Taken like a true champ, kudos to you sir
---
I destroy every house with turrets at the door I find. Quick work with TSE and wrecking ball maxed out. I then have my friend kill me then give me back my caps. One dude had 5 missle turrets setup and we finally made him leave the server after destroying his camp multiple times. Only time I will ever destroy someone's camp or attack them. 
---
It honestly does. My leg pieces always need repairing lol 
---
Yay I can answer this. I even had the awareness perk.
---
With an anti-armor weapon and Stabilized, a super mutant with a DR of 80 went down to 22. This is kinda interesting cause this is more than they‚Äôd have if the anti armor abilities were multiplied (DR x 50% and then x 45%). And they definitely don‚Äôt get added (50% +45% = 95%).
---
So in my test the target lost 72.5% of their DR. One way this works out is if Bethesda gives the stacked effects diminishing returns, and only the highest effect (50%) keeps its full effect, and all others get halved (45% to 22.5%). If someone has an anti-armor melee Weapon and Awareness and test to see if anti armor plus Incisor reduces DR to 0 or not we might have a better idea of how it works.
---
Nah man. I'm a rat 4 life. Don't want to get buttfucked by scorchbeasts.
---
Servers. I kept crashing too. Roughly 4 times in 10 mins before I gave up for the night.
---
Well I and the 76 community don't seem to think that proof is needed for something this obvious.  
---
I guess we'll see when it gets patched that I was right. Enjoy annoying others for now though!
---
Fire bolts, poison bolts, psycho bolts. You COULD really have some fun with a crossbow but alas, it‚Äôs pretty vanilla currently. 
---
I know.. you can even favorite armor, but yet not a PA chassis, heaven forbid we. Select a favorite out of 2-3. And the main thing I agree with that he said is the perk card swapping. If we had like  passive points to use aside from the regular ones to put crafting cards and stuff on I think it would help tremendously with this, even just 5 points would be enough just so I don‚Äôt have to constantly swap to repair my shit
---
It isn‚Äôt really though. It‚Äôs barely stable as it is, imagine when they start wanting to add more content. 
---
Thank you. This answer is what I was looking for. 
---
Turrets kill the ghouls which are a primary source of xp farming. And it‚Äôs not like the turrets need to level up but they sure do take it away from other people
---
I'm Interested.  Gt Psizom
---
Shoot me a message on Xbox when you start.
---
It‚Äôs pretty spoken :)
---
That tells me either less people have reported it (so it's thought to affect less people) or it's just a harder fix.
---
Either way it has been since the beta though so needs fixing.
---
 Mercy!
---
I‚Äôm level 16 can you carry so I can get some good loot. I‚Äôm 7 btw
---
Says the guy who is smashing peoples bases just to be a dick. And I am sure if it was going to be patched it would be in the patch notes. But eh have fun being wrong and getting wrecked.
---
Its the Forest Scout Armor Mask from the Enclave.
---
The Armor is called Brotherhood Scribe Outfit, you can get it from the quest Forbidden Knowledge (turn in technical data thing)
---
Probably nobody taking care of the servers over the weekends 
---
Fwiw, 
---
My dedicated game box is win7 64bit.
---
Running both asus for motherboard and Astrix GPU. INTEL board, AMD gpu.
---
32GB ram
---
2TB 7200 SATA drive.
---
Instead of removing and reinstalling game software, 
---
I suggest the checking following, 
---
Antivirus and firewall updates. Are current. My mcaffee was screwing with Bethesda downloader 
---
M$ os is updated, manually.  
---
OS Patching will impact game performance. You don‚Äôt want windows updating during game play.
---
Hardware device drivers are current.
---
Finally, over clocking can make things twitchy, if it‚Äôs overclocked set it to stable mode.
---
Wasn‚Äôt there supposed to be an exotic weapons perk? Maybe the concept was scrapped after release backlash
---
It's worse than that. The list of ingredients can change moments after you open the machine. So, you can go to click on the soy canister and it will change into one of your armor pieces just as you click on it. I'm not sure if that's because it can't handle lag, I'm only sure it should never happen to begin with.
---
This isn't a fucking Destiny raid. Why the insane level requirement?
---
No no no I think you‚Äôre missing the whole point and overthinking it way too much.
---
OP was merely stating that in his opinion you‚Äôre an asshole. What your opinion may be on that, is irrelevant, because regardless to him of how you justify your actions, to OP you‚Äôll just be an asshole.
---
You‚Äôre welcome for clearing that up, can I suggest some third grade reading comprehension courses?
---
Downvoted because casul wants to keep his training wheels on when he plays a pvp mode.
---
PvP survival should be more hard core than the pve mode. Why can't you people accept that? Nobody dares to argue me because they know the truth, and all I do is speak it.
---
With durability perks too one point saves 2/3 repairs on average though pretty sweet deal I think still. 
---
I'm not sure if text chat will ever come there's some law in place now that makes it more difficult.
---
Right ? We can see rain/radstorm from a far but cant flare...
---
Same when you draw your weapon right before impact. 
---
Cool
---
Think you have it just right here.  The floors are good but why no walls.  I don't want a massive empty barn, did that when playing with a team.  Now want something more, that fits with all the Whitesprings plans.
---
I checked out your camp your interior work is awesome :) my  camp has to be fast traveled to and from, so if someone loads into my base they have to fast travel themselves out :p not a big deal but it actually happened the other day for the first time.
---
Finally someone owns up to it like a true raider would
---
Yeah it‚Äôs new now.
---
Before anyone sending the air drops was available to anyone on that server.
---
Guess it‚Äôs now tied to the sender.
---
Take my upvote.
---
So since they made half of junk bulkable then other items should be also be able to be bulked IMO
---
Cuz the more ppl that join it the more powerful the queen is 
---
You win the game.
---
Had this happen to me, too. I was in the Mire, and I had just disarmed the random unexploded nuke mini-event, and the minute the thing stopped beeping a giant friggin' scorchbeast flopped through the trees and landed a few feet from my character.
---
Not gonna lie - I think my yelp of surprise was slightly higher pitched than my wife's when that happened.
---
But he just destroyed my house which was literally just workbenches and I‚Äôm lvl 15 so I don‚Äôt even have reasources to fix them üòî
---
Edited thanks
---
Same as when you nuke a normal place - radiation is still radiation.
---
Huh - but GECKing a nuke site....
---
I can't message in their i got con banned but I can still party and I'll text you on here for start my GT is Jacob Rules 15 add me when your on 
---
Oh, I'm the dick? I don't smash bases, I just support people that smash **the ones at the Whitesprings**. And how can I be a dick if the base that gets smashed is the same one that prevents other players from getting XP and legendary weapons when they should be able to?
---
Look again and think real hard with that pigeon brain about who's the dick.
---
The legendary assaultron @ sugar grove has them..
---
Oooh yeah that‚Äôs just evil. Sorry mate
---
If you're complaining about food and water pick up Lead Belly and Cannibal, you'll almost always be satiated
---
IKR
---
I want mothman crafts. I said it in another post. 
---
Mothman Goggles (night vision) big red eyes.
---
Mothman wings (slowfall) 
---
Thank you. Important public service!
---
I‚Äôd recommend buying the ‚Äúour future begins here‚Äù it manages to make something a lot funnier
---
Stick Em Up... Just kidding. Ha. Ha. 
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
I can't carry they silo unless your a general in the enclave I can get you to it but you'll have to take the time into doing it after I launch my 4 nukes I can it won't take long to do those so tonight I can 
---
Charleston station is a unique spot.  Is it not griefing to eliminate a unique spawn people work hard to trigger?
---
The OP was unintentional, and that is perfectly understandable.
---
There is no way in game to ask someone to move their camp, you can‚Äôt ID the owner.  So how do you politely bring this to his attention?
---
I agree it is shitty design.  But given that it won‚Äôt change soon, this will happen at that location.
---
There are no scorchbeasts in the forest or toxic valley you silly child
---
On top of that, it wasn‚Äôt even in whitespring it was by the mine that has ‚Äúuranium fever‚Äù
---
Is it decreasing it for all players or just for the player who shot the syringer ?
---
This! I want to fire exploding/cryo arrows!
---
Now that is dumb why tell everyone if it hinders you
---
I've figured that out by now
---
It‚Äôs 20 hours 
---
Had some lvl 50 asshat 1st grief THEN team invite me last night. I‚Äôm like What the F*** ü§¨ ?
---
I wish Bethesda would give us a middle finger emote, so it‚Äôs the last thing he sees before I server hop
---
That‚Äôs what happened 
---
Is there any legal way to get duplicate weapons stacked like that unless you've duped them?
---
I'm pretty sure it's for the player who shot the syringer
---
The level and gear grind gets old fast, but its kind of unavoidable. If I play for 2 hours, I'll only do that for 20-30 minutes. The restbof the time is spent adventuring. Ive played almost every day since launch and just now hit 100.
---
Definitely secure, I wanted to be able to utilize one of the entrances on a regular basis however seal it off if I need to!
---
Maybe I just timed it wrong, am out of my routine and don't realize it.  Thanks!
---
Very comprehensive. 
---
With this logic, you too sir are a crybaby. Crying over how someone called you an asshole because you like killing people in video games. 
---
What‚Äôs the point in even responding lol I mean really, huh is just stating his opinion and by you stating a stupid opinion like this you‚Äôve insulted yourself equally as much as OP.
---
Logic man, learn it.
---
It's pretty heavily implied that this is what happened with the Mire. Vault 94 was full of nature lovers with radioactive plants and no guns. When the vault opened shit started going crazy all over the Mire.
---
Being a raider is about a desperation for resources and the inherent nihilism that leads to a hatred and jealousy of traditional systems of Justice and fairness.   Combine this desire for revenge against a cruel world with a gang mentality in which social capital is earned through cruelty. That cruelty also serves as a subtle warning to other members of the gang that no one should dare turn on you. Compare that to someone who spent the last 25 years of their life being conditioned to believe that they have been prepared to reclaim the world and rebuild humanity. So yeah griefers are not role playing, they just ARE raiders.
---
If your interested hit me up if not then oh well if your over 100 then I'd love to have you but if not then this is so long 
---
I have that; just missed it in the list, oops.
---
Nope, have to download on PC
---
My first character from BETA was a guy. Got him to level ~69ish (obligatory lol), and decided I wanted to try a different build. (This was before respecs were a thing).
---
I made my alt a girl because I wanted to see how the equipment looked on a woman instead of a guy. She ended up becoming my main because her build was so much better than my first character's.
---
In most games I just play whatever character seems to have the better story. Like /u/Belkeoki said below, I found the narrative of a lawyer/housewife learning to survive in the post-apocalypse way, way more interesting than jumping in as some war vet.
---
Also, in some games (Saint's Row being a prime example), the female voice acting is top notch, and you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't experience it. I'll gladly play whatever the fuck Laura Bailey puts her voice behind.
---
I‚Äôm on team Wallace, but raider bots #2:
---
Caps available in exchange for pillaged loot...pillaged loot available in exchange for caps. 
---
I just like how he says pillaged loot twice in a row. 
---
this PLEASE ! ^^^^^^
---
I have friends that got banned for duping, after the patch on the 10th I think they instituted a flagging system that flags you if you do the glitch that disconnects you over three times. After that they go through your game play to see if you‚Äôve been duping and if they see it your screwed.
---
Ugh. Thats shitty. Thanks.
---
How cute ‚ù§  Can you get any angrier? I set my base next to the river which prevents no one from doing anything thank you very  Much. But please enlighten us some more about you talk out of both sides of your mouth. üëÑ
---
I wasn't kicked out immediately, no. I sometimes just sit in a chair or rest in a bed and then go do something else. When I come back I've been disconnected through inactivity 
---
WTH? I‚Äôm level 15 you bellend why‚Äôd you destroy my camp, it‚Äôs by black water and doesn‚Äôt have any turrets or walls, not to mention I don‚Äôt have the stuff to fix it üò°
---
Yea... definitely use the endangerol syringer on the queen. You notice a difference.
---
I mean, yeah. It's pretty revealing that people get all in a tizzy when you call them an asshole for acting like an asshole. Even though they're being as asshole. In and out of game! I'm not sure why so many of them have an issue with that. 
---
They have some sort of emotional disconnect where other people shouldn't have any sort of reaction to their behavior because... Because I don't know. They want to be able to "raid" while not being treated like the feculent dildos they are. Even though in and out of game everyone is justified in thinking they're rude and unpleasant.
---
i would pay stupid amounts of caps for a cryo arrow mod
---
This is why my base is hidden and made a pain to destroy lol. I considered building it near where yours is, but I hear a lot of the same stories 
---
Yeah that's true.
---
It's funny to me how many people instantly jump to how mean people are. 5 years ago, no one gave a shit. Suddenly now everyone is crying and whining about literally anything and everything.
---
If you don't like the way someone is playing, you can change worlds. It isn't complicated.
---
Will definitely update when i get a chance to try it out üëç
---
I‚Äôm on it
---
It's the forest operative mask, found at the enclave vendor. Outfit looks like the Engineer's outfit, available from technical data turn-in quests. 
---
Pillage ... Loot..... Pillage.... Loot
---
I generally think people use that specific PA due to explosive bobbleheads/duped items.
---
Are you up somewhere impossibly high like Seneca Rocks?
---
After the patch on the tenth they started a flagging system that flags you if you disconnect and your inventory doubles. I had a few friends that got banned after that hot fix
---
How about... No? 
---
Filthy mutants...
---
Are we talking about Fallout 4 or Fallout 76? Cuz I‚Äôm talking only about the latter.
---
I liked it when everyone was forced to use the mic. Forced conversation.
---
I love spamming the interact button while my buddy is trading... He starts repeating and mocking the vendor robot not knowing I'm causing the vendor to be annoying haha 
---
outside of endganerol i heard that bleedout ignores slap damage if you wanna feel like being a dick to others. (not sure if patched)
---
Blackwater mine has raider power armor which is lvl 15 it‚Äôs right next to white springs
---
Yes! Sometimes a disconnect makes me fully restart my router!! I've never once in 2 years at my current address have had to restart the internet except for when fo76 disconnects me.
---
Rad Sponge, Rad-X, Ghoulish, Sun Kissed Perks
---
Bro I gotta say I‚Äôm cracking up at your responses üòÇ They‚Äôre seriously something a teen in a 90‚Äôs sitcom would say
---
I downvoted you because I‚Äôm a gay robot.
---
Well that sucks, but a good heads up nontheless. Definitely lessens the blow of the loss knowing beforehand.
---
Why is that the case though, if all other data is saved on their end?
---
Honestly.. it feels way to one sided right now with class freak it‚Äôs almost a waste to not use most mutations... which is kind of silly. There needs to be more downsides to the Mutations.
---
PvE.  Everyone I know who plays multiplayer competitive FPS games are not interested in FO76.
---
Yeah, if you go to the entrance to Vault 94 it's insanely overgrown, even though it's in a cave. I expect we'll find out what happened whenever that story expansion lands.
---
Mothman wings ftw. 
---
Downvoted
---
&gt; Now I have found I quite like getting a bounty as when people come to collect it I get free caps
---
If you have a bounty do you still have to let them tag you first before you can shoot back?
---
That seems like quite a disadvantage ...
---
had a game changing experience last night because i was using my mic. it is honestly imperative when trying to play with strangers 
---
*ever. Haha
---
also off topic a little bit but my very best quote in game is when you are doing bots on parade an enclave quest.... OOOOHOOOO new  Costumers ?... ELIMINATE
---
Your friends should play and make up their own minds really. And it sounds like you should move on yourself at this point. I'm excited for the future of this game tbh but only time will tell how it ends up
---
I have a microphone but for some reason no one hears me nor reacts to me I don't know if they're set up to hear me I've seen other people with the speaker icon knowing they could potentially hear me but they've never responded nor reacted for I do not know if they have a microphone to speak back to me
---
You are not missing perks. If you can't craft lvl 50 at lvl 56 it's a bug.
---
Can I just get a pirate outfit to match my hat? Thanks
---
It's usually late in the day to me. I have a mic but avoid using it because it'll wake the family.
---
Imagine being an asshole in the apocalypse. Too bad this carebear game makes it impossible.
---
Rust legacy.. Now that had *real* griefing. 
---
As far as i know i didnt have any perks up to have condition above 100 percent
---
If there was a text "disconnected from server", then the server failed and progress of the last, say, minute or so, was lost. In all other cases items shouldn't have been gone.
---
Oh right you meant it like that!
---
Umm...   I am pretty sure if grouped, you all get Xp and drops.  It's when encountering ungrouped people in shared areas such as WhiteSprings and Fissure Prime that the courtesy of tagging is extended, because precisely of... being ungrouped.
---
And you can place the small water pump on it too. Not the hand pump sure, but the clean water one with the concrete block on the bottom. Looks bad doing that, but functional.
---
‚ÄúFeed the People‚Äù made this bug seem like a feature, these corpse flower stamens don‚Äôt have quite the same charm. 
---
Go into build mode and repair individually. You don‚Äôt gotta do the whole thing, just the most expensive bits. That ‚Äúrepair all‚Äù function is bugged and often requires many times more material than it actually costs to repair.
---
Example: my Brahmin pen. CAMP cost: 4 razor grain and 4 fertilizer. Direct repairs: only 1 of each.
---
its really quite a shame because it shows that beth could make a useable planter camp item
---
Definitely cause the pvp trolls are running hard this weekend. Some advice though. I normally build my base in popular locations where other players do so if my base gets wrecked i jump to a server where it cant be places and move it for free repairing everything. üëç
---
I'm actually currently on the hunt for legendary wood armor, so....
---
Sweet
---
Yeah, a friend of a friend was playing with us and he made it miserable. Tbh I'm pretty sure he himself is a miserable person and "complaining about stupid normal stuff that's in every video game" is just the newest way to inflict his personality on others. 
---
(Seriously, he said, "I fucking hate this" in the most venomous voice when completing a regular quest. Nothing went wrong. There were no bugs. It was a normal goddamn video gaming moment and if it was so horrible it was, frankly, on him and his internalized unhappiness and I'm not even sure why he would play any game at all if that specific thing was so bad.)
---
crazy lag on pc this weekend for me
---
ok
---
Rust is the only reason I want a pc lol. I loved ark but I'm not about dino power I'm more bout gun play and firepower.i know the feeling of losing all progress while offline lol 
---
Don't think I have ever been there! 
---
I‚Äôm about to get on right now
---
Hey OP just a heads up for the future. Whenever a enemy dies under those rhododendron flowers, you can still usually get the loot, you just have to try to crouch and look all around that area in first person. It‚Äôs super annoying but at least it usually works (for me at least).
---
Not sure. Maybe deleting the app also removes the save data and game data files from your system? Save data is just (I think) the audio and control settings. Maybe the game data file is where that album is stored... I know the first time I uninstalled I also manually killed the save data. Lost the album. I took some photos as a control and then uninstalled/reinstalled without touching the save data and the album was gone again.
---
As much as im not where near "end game" currently, this does sound like a good idea, have the GECK quests set at lev 100+ so there is a 2nd level of end game stuff to do, - it could even be deployed via a missile! then all they have to do is sporn new wildlife to cause issues and some buffs to go along with it?
---
I mean I can make you parsley op when, your 50 but rn it'll mean nothing to you so if you want to hit me up tonight if your still interested I'll get, you there once your lvl 50 I can get you to general tonight and tomorrow night I can help you with the process of launching tonight depending on how long it'll take with general 
---
It's not talked about here because it does not have a direct impact on the game in terms of gameplay, performance, fixes, updates etc.
---
Definitely a place to hit up has all work benches raider power armor mole miners the uranium fever event cap stashes mod spawns and is right next to the white springs station vendor to sell all the mole miner shotguns great location 
---
That's a pretty good idea imagine if they had ppl with are minds adding to the game.
---
Ok I‚Äôll send you a message
---
Well you guys could move to discord/TS/whatever, and have push-to-talk for discord on another key, this way you can keep in-game chat on "all" and have your team in private. I do it like that actually, just make sure to turn off discord's overlay as it wasn't playing nice with FO76 for me.
---
They could add an option to eat food on the spot, that would be one fewer instance of having to open the menu. 
---
Now from what you described it doesn't sound like you use favorites a lot? Have 1 and 2 as water and food. 
---
&gt; Open menu to eat. Open menu to drink. 
---
I‚Äôll be on just shoot me a message on Xbox 
---
Putting down your camp again Ellis ruin at least ... Some builds. Was going to say "plenty" but I don't know the extent of it. I certainly would not be able to use that fix on my current camp.
---
yeah, unyielding wood is pretty damn formidable. Assaultrons will push you out of the way as they work their way to your unstealth friends
---
Use "Auto Mode" and Push to Talk.  Makes a world of difference.
---
You certainly do not get xp for kills without tagging.

Ridiculous. Companies alter their release dates so they don't have to compete with the latest Rockstar effort, as they know they'll be steamrollered by it. Why on earth would a developer with that kind of weight feel the need to pay for negative reviews against *anyone?* Let alone a game that released in such a broken state and is still having basic features fixed up. 
---
Bringing up RDR2 when 'talking shit' against FO76 is simply because the contrast between the two is so striking. One was developed over as many years as it needed, and the other was shoved out the door so early that the developers have had to prioritize fixing basic, broken features over working on future content. 
---
DLC 1. I have 45% accuracy with these predictions.

Now I wish there really was a verbally abusive protectron merchant wandering around. :(

Can you put on the sentry bot head and use a voice changer? ‚ÄúSucker identified, merchantile functions activated. We have chems.‚Äù

Remember, if you can smell it at the belly button, go back up.
---
Joke? Sorry bad at getting those over the net. 
---
You can't lie to yourself. Standard "haha im laughing" responses after you've been thoroughly embarrassed ain't going to cut it unless you are from 90's sitcom. Ironical lol. Also what kind of fool would expect someone to listen to some angry bitter child's demands for someone to get off the internet because one makes him upset? Not even a patient in a mental institution would come up with something like that and expect results. 
---
You're still here tho. Am I banned and off the reddit? No. Keep crying. I am getting paid and getting entertained at the same time.
---
I saw plenty on the bags when that controversy first hit, pretty sure I remember plenty of losts about the bottles (granted that one could have been a different sub). Whats the difference? Genuine curiosity, I don't want arguments or fights, just conversations.

Frankly, it's not worth it. I've had all of three voice encounters so far: one guy who complimented my CAMP, one who helped with a Workshop Defense...
---
... and one asshole kid who was just using mic to insult me while he tried to push me away from a vendor (he seemed to think if I sold anything the vendor wouldn't have caps for him). I told him off for being an ass and he suddenly got very apologetic as I walked away.
---
So no, unless I'm on a pre-set team, I don't see the point in voice chat.
---
I want faction flags you can wave around, plus a white flag. 
---
I feel like this is hilarious
---
just you wait till you see my new post that im right now preparing....
---
It is a bad disadvantage. If you can have some kind of control over the situation. Have good armor, good resists, know the spawn in point, get a good vantage point, try to control the situation. And then lower levels trying to claim it, which is weird, like level 30 shooting at level 100+ for a 20 cap bounty but whatever. Dense chest mod and Fireproof will give you good resist against explosive weapons. I'm still trying to completely understand the pvp system and see what ways it can be used to an advantage.
---
Sadly it is nearly all try hards left now.
---
I hate red dead, after playing it a few hours it's just an incredibly slow and boring game.. and the online clearly feels like a shitty GTA with cowboys.
---
Let me put it more realistically- there's zero reason to compare these two games, they've got zero in common and don't even attract the same kind of players. You with your comment makes sense because **I brought up that people compare them**- but where I constantly see them brought up, it is 100% unnatural.
---
I also think it's funny that the people usually bringing up red dead, if you search their comment history, they're clearly Russian. Which I don't even have to click your name to see the connection. Red dead is a very pretty very slow and boring game that puts me to sleep before I can do anything interesting- and honestly nothing in that game is interesting. And a Russian isn't going to convince me otherwise, paid or otherwise to feed me bullshit.
---
And melee weapons that can't be modded.
---
I have a mic. Apparently the game refuses to fucking use it though. Cannot figure it out. Pisses me off.
---
I have my camp high up on a tree. A couple of days ago some dude went up and started destroying things with his TSE while I was crafting stuff. Disconnecting gave me a little satisfaction as he probably fell to his death after my camp disappeared.
---
Though this was the first time someone has destroyed my base (I usually build them hidden well/in difficult to access places  for realism sake). And I've had maybe a handful encounters with greifers so I don't care too much, honestly. I've had worse experiences in other games.
---
Cuz that's literally griefing
---
What‚Äôs the Xbox one
---
I understand the reasoning, and would tend to agree. Except that doesnt explain why some dc regularly, and others can play hours on end.
---
Earlier on, when i was getting more disconects;  it seemed server related. I would get a bad 1 and have problems/lag. Then disconnect and relog and have no problems for the rest of the night.
---
I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúproc‚Äù means so I can‚Äôt answer this question. 
---
Stick em‚Äô up! Ha ha ha, just kidding.
---
I‚Äôm laughing because I‚Äôve already accomplished my initial goal - to waste your time. The fact that I‚Äôve garnered so much of your time and attention to the point where you‚Äôre still responding and cursing at me is already a win in my book.  
---
A wipe would be useless anyway because ppl who start on the pvp server still need to go on the pve server to kill the scorchbeast queen. It is impossible to do the final end game boss on the pvp server, it would be a blood bath. So it is good they let you travel between servers. As to balance it is not the case of high lvl wins. The scaling always makes the low level do more damage. And with the TSE nerfs dupers no longer have an advantage. They just need to also nerf bobblestacking.
---
HUMAN FLESH is not acceptable TENDER here.
---
It can be fun. You basically just described DayZ.  On the other hand, this game is an overflowing endless supply of material.  
---
This is dumb
---
second this.though i did pvp for the stupid ttophy to get plat
---
There‚Äôs a twist
---
except for the bugs, you're pretty much complaining about the core mechanics of the game. gathering, building. you're supposed to waste time.
---
don't think this is the game for you.
---
Sure . You can steal the paper bags of spoiled meat,veg and fruits from my camp. 
---
The fact that you made a point to do a controlled test just to be sure is really satisfying to know. 
---
Kudos to you, good sir.
---
Assholes like this think they are justified in screwing people over but really just like being jerks. It‚Äôs the same thing with people vigilante hunting dupers
---
Both
---
M8 your a strange one
---
what we need is several changes to costumes 
---
1. we should have costume helmets and real armored helmets - the loss of head armor is a major blow since that power armor helmet has stats we should to 
---
2. we need skins for commonly used in game items based off of factions - give us some responder power armor or raider armors so people can actually start to wear the colors of the group they feel affiliated to - like I'd love me the Fire Breathers colors for my excavator armor since it was their idea to use it 
---
3. we need more immersive items but they should be pieces instead of a single costume like I'd love a overcoat I could wear over my armor but still shows my armor under it or a rain jacket to make me look like I'm a bit more in the game
---
these are really just a example of ideas they could implement and get a ton of cash off of - I mean I'm a massive costume and customization person I'm the person they are trying to market to the person who will spend money on this kind of stuff BUT I bought 20$ worth of atoms and stopped not because the prices but the selection of items - most of my atoms go to camp items that at least I can work with in my base to make it feel immersive
---
For balance purposes maybe this will be ok, but I really dont want duped shit or other exploits(that better be addressed if that want this to work) making it into survival and ffs get it out of adventure too. I'm suck of the padded softcore adventure mode tho. So less harsh is a turn off to me at this point but balanced seems like a no brainer and theres plenty of that already needed
---
"Any attempts of five finger deals will be caught and paid for with said fingers" (something like that)
---
nah. there is a riflegaming or similar youtuber and banned 7 times..
---
Spending a lot of time in the Pip Boy in the Fallout series is nothing new, since Fallout3. 
---
Nah.
---
Thanks! I work in IT/Support so unraveling cause/effect in software is a lot of my day. It's also why I have such a thick skin about game bugs... Deal with Windows for 30 days and everyone else seems like they have their act together. Lol.
---
I'd like to know the source and requirements to buy this plan. Seems like you have to under certain level...
---
Because you have to hurry to avoid being killed by a liberator in the Forest area while wearing PA, amirite?
---
So on the perk it says when you attack your target does 10/20/30% less damage for two seconds. But say someone melees you with unstable isotope which causes damage to that target does that count towards suppressor.
---
Report it:

---
This, I think there is a ‚Äúcool down‚Äù for decontamination showers, depending on the server. Had I happen when we used to get duplicate cards from perk upgrades, think it is a similar glitch. Equip, exit server, and try it. 
---
Look at his comment history, he keeps talking about ‚Äúraping and pillaging as a dangerous raider‚Äù he‚Äôs a bit strange
---
Mostly PvE, just cause PvP in this game is so whack.
---
This game is literally about ‚Äúrebuilding the wasteland‚Äù. 
---
It sounds like you‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôs not fallout. 
---
How about a hat my CAMP Brahmin can wear?
---
Played last night on PS4 and it was super laggy. Been this way for me since the last patch tho. Some how managed to make it thru a silo despite  all the lag, half expecting it to crash when I got to the end like it did 6 times the last time I played but this time I actually got to launch a nuke. Killed the SBQ, looted her, was making my way out of the nuke zone &amp; then it finally crashed on my way out. Glad it waited until after all that this time at least.  
---
I'll be on in an hour or so, I'm always looking for people to play with. GT is BrettxthexWhale 
---
I think you are talking about underground plant farm in wes tek ( mutant source )
---
It is . But dont you think it would give people more of a reason to not just level youre place completely. then they lose out on potential caps. take time to acquire stuff. you can pop in and kill them while they are acquiring something . it could force you into a lock pick type screen so the person getting stuff stolen from them could retaliate . 
---
 " .... my sooooothing vooooiice"
---
I still don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúproc‚Äù means.
---
as it is bold 
---
It‚Äôs an upcoming mode. The basic idea has been laid out, but the have stated that nothing is set in stone. Maybe some else can post the article here.
---
I'd love those suggestions because you surely need them. 
---
I got his point. Your edgy, over the top explanation did nothing but maybe make you feel better? Dunno. Didn't add anything to what was being said. Good on you though.
---
Question though? Unprovoked aggression. Do you have Low T or something. A hormonal imbalance maybe? Or was someone just mean to you today and you felt the need to be asinine to a stranger today?
---
Problems keep adding up. One step forward 3 steps back.
---
but i do that anyways . 
---
My buddy and I had power armor suits duplicate during a series of server disconnects before the last patch.
---
We were trying to play and kept getting disconnected and extra suits appeared in our inventories.
---
After the patch he told me the extra suits (2-3) were gone from his inventory.  You should have nothing to worry about if this duplication occurred accidentally.
---
I‚Äôve seen the plan before the whole TSE craze around level 100. There‚Äôs a issue going on right now where the combat and marine have the same name. So it‚Äôs all lick. Just hoping somebody found 2 of the right one.
---
The legendary drops seem to have gotten worse in the past two weeks, along with server disconnects and much longer load screen times.  There's a ton of other weird shit I can't remember. The game really does seem to be in total meltdown mode.
---
That is the fault of the near constant mole rats. I kid a little, but really, animal attacks tend to strike leg armor the most.
---
So spending $7 on a random key site is worth it? 
---
Yes.
---
Proc means when it activates or all the conditions are right to make it happen.
---
biggest change is no slap damage. you shoot people, it's on. full damage.
---
prepare for all your old posts to be downvoted. 
---
Agreed but maybe hope for the future
---
And I just met a casual player yesterday, told him some tips, and it appears to me I had found a unrealised PvP star, but it was only applicable because in his casual way he already had some decent gear.
---
Oh, cool. Thanks. 
---
Boing! *cap noise*
---
It was about 30k of each junk. And bobble heads. 
---
Your comparison doesn‚Äôt apply.

A better one would be if I stole it out of the cops car. As Bethesda created this problem. 
---

---
Because time has passed since launch and even though Bethesda's marketing dept. continues to do stupid shit the outrage crowd has moved on to Anthem currently. 
---
A portion of the player base is so upset over the game they‚Äôve become petty. I saw a player on PC the other day named ‚ÄúTodd Howard‚Äôs Dead Son.‚Äù
---
No, I actually love those types games.. I'll spend days wandering gathering stuff.  My sons are always making fun of me for being a pack rat.. that's what floored me about Fallout 3 or 4 when I first played it....  wandered into an abandoned school building and could gather everything... literally everything and then I could put some of the stuff I pointlessly gathered into containers and come back for it later... squirreling away... I was hooked, completely.  I love rebuilding the wasteland.  It's the way that things are so easily lost from the game that's bothering me.... like the server disconnects and it's all gone... I can't even be on the same server and change the environment... Star Wars Galaxies style... I get disconnected and everything is gone....is that an Xbox only thing?
---
Yeah the explosive weapons have flooded the market and every twat has one.
---
I got an explosive shotgun from a queen but avoid it in these scenarios. It's only fair.
---
Other than the work benches, that‚Äôs all I have. Enjoy!
---
yep, from the BOS stuff. got mine 15 lvls higher than me and just scrapped it :/
---
Thank you, much appreciated.
---
You can definitely solo it at lvl 95, just robots. Bring stimpacks but it really isn't that hard even with inferior gear.
---
Please see the reply above.  Please know, I humbly asking for insights here.  I still have it logged in right now... as I peruse Reddit for Table Top Simulator possibilities...
---
yes u can see the players
---
It's a tie for me. I love Phoenix too, though he's incredibly annoying when he picks fights with the Watoga bots. 
---
It happens to everyone but if it fails for you to connect then reopening the game is a faster option than having to do everything
---
Not really, the 25% less resistance is prolly the best, although if you have armor penetration, it's only a marginal increase in your damage against the target.
---
yeah i lost like 700 rounds of .38 once in that void
---
PVE. Almost no one does PVP. 
---
Hopefully they fix the state of PVE soon. Most weapons and builds are trash, loot drops are bad, and there is no endgame.
---
It's bugged, every time I try to talk, even if it's already set to Area, nobody can hear me. I have to switch it to another setting, then back to Area. I have tested this with another person on another pc in the same room with our characters next to each other in-game. So people probably don't realize you can't hear them and are talking to themselves. 
---
Reported this months ago... keep reminding them.

If that‚Äôs what you called aggression pal, then you‚Äôre definitely the Low T beta boy over here with your flaming sensitivity.
---
That does nothing for you if you're actively in a team. 
---
Marsupial is so much fun, and the extra jump height has become necessary in my play style. Unstable isotope and electrified don‚Äôt seem to do much in the way of damage in PvE, though.
---
How can people be so salty over a video game.... I mean I can understand parts but not the hole. 
---
Because the game is 95% copy pasted from fo4
---
Plus don't worry about getting over-encumbered earlier on&gt;! (lead weights)!&lt;, you can find scrapping opportunities mid-way through.
---
Well against a SBQ won‚Äôt it affect everyone so it really adds up when there are a lot of people shooting
---
Yep. Same here. Love all the story text. Telling story through little snippets you find is the one way bethesda does story well and this game is full of it. 
---
Nope. I've completed that quest, don't get to keep hers and don't get the recipe.
---
oh, ok then. yeah, nah. the servers are just shit. on xbox, ps4, pc. you shouldn't expect a session to last longer than an hour before the game disconnects you.
---
remember how buggy Fo4 was? now add a twist: there's a random chance the game will just shut itself every minute. that's Fo76.
---
Based on what has be said so far, there is no slap damage (it is like everyone is already wanted in current world), caps for killed will be doubled (unclear if this bonus is paid from the player killed), they are considering having killed player drop some of their aid items but haven't committed to this yet.
---
So scrap one corn plant.  It‚Äôs not hard.
---
BGS should consider hiring some IT/Support. Not sure how they have a 'tech' company without any.
---
/s without the /s
---
Well and I thought one can't embarrass himself even more... You're full of surprises. 
---
Shit you must have big goals in life. Spending your own time to make a clown out of yourself and poke at people minding their business and racking up profits. Ha! Even my 8 year old cousin wouldn't make such a silly excuse.

But hey... You're definitely wasting my time and not your own.

1. You just admitted to trolling and seeking attention like a typical miserable and unsuccessful human being with mental issues who has unstoppable urge trying to compensate for them. Like the one I always thought you were. But man... It takes one kind of a tool to fail that miserably and do the only thing a troll is not supposed to do. If you talk shit at least do it right. You're useless. Lol.
---
2. Your initial goal was to get me banned? No? You even called me a moron to highlight that statement of yours. *Facepalm.* How are you wasting my time other than your own while I am the one getting paid, all these replies give my post more publicity and on top of it all you keep embarrassing yourself with nonsensical statements and temper tantrums? Lmao.
---
3. I am cursing you? There is a different between spouting random nonsense because you're angry and being calmly collected and calling things the way you see them. Never in this whole discussion my heart rate went up. Meanwhile... Can't say the same about you. Poor little creature.

My experience nuking near lewisburg, big ben, and uncanny was not the same as yours. No glowing in big ben sadly and only mutants in lewisburg.

Dance emojis and the ability to build while fighting.

People are whining to much man, play the game, overcome, and adapt. This isn't sims its fallout shit will break things will die and war never changes.
---
Fortinite still has haters who can't see that it has grown to be more then just a PUBG clone and is a genuinely good game with massive support from it's devs and continues to grow.
---
Flashbacks to Fisto...
---
Should, guess just scrap away until you get it then.
---
I fully agree.  Bethesda in this game focused on what they are good at wih story telling. Environmental story telling and finding the bits of the story through snippets which encourage you to explore more and find more of the story. This is something 4 was lacking on it had some but it was disappointing because that is what I love most about exploring in Bethesda Fallouts.
---
Not sure where to get the plans but ive gotten pre-modded both legendary and not combat armor pieces from the monster mash event at watoga highschool
---
this isnt fornite !
---
I'm pretty camp placement/budget/items would be big for them. Building checkpoints and battle arenas is probably what they'd like. Idk
---
I assume it does have an effect for all her enemies.
---
add chemist, super dupe, pharma pharma, and diluted stimpaks radaway rad-x to a water farm.  BTW lakeside cabins does 6 water per turn. thats what the water number means, max number of purifiers that can fill per turn.
---
I don‚Äôt give a shit how they do this survival mode if it‚Äôs going to be PvP-focused.  Y‚Äôall have fun taking it way too seriously, I‚Äôll be glad you guys aren‚Äôt on my server griefing.
---
For mini game purposes it can be fun. Make your whole crew tag their ghouls with the bloatfly dart. You'll get as many flys as there are people shooting it. You can also shoot the flys to get more. Try to make a cloud of flys to darken the sky.
---
Sometimes they spawn legendary.
---
battle arenas would be nice if you didnt acquire bounties from shooting other structures although . we did make a boxing ring that worked out pretty nice .
---
New copypasta located
---
"Engaging Food Safety Regulation. Oh No."
---
That's one of the best lines I've seen. Where's this located?
---
you think PA outperforms regular armor? \*snickers\*
---
I'll agree that helmets should have DR as well. that's bullshit. marine does, but for some reason they're keeping it locked away inside the debug room.
---
To early to tell but looks like the game has a heavy PvE lean. 
---
I believe that‚Äôs how the workshops are suppose to work. They were designed to be that way. I‚Äôm more surprised you didn‚Äôt get  PVPed for the workshops like I did, I can take on the mobs but not griefers.
---
who cares
---
That second playthrough is how I‚Äôve played the first time. I‚Äôm at a few hundred hours and level 65 and have only explored the Forest, Ash Heap and Toxic Valley fully, haven‚Äôt even discovered the Mire yet, and helping out low-level players with supplies or basic events like Fertile Soil. I spend my time following up on challenges, farming the food and supplies I need to survive, and still run from Scorchbeasts. I‚Äôve also only died twice. 
---
It seems to me that the people playing the game are all rushing straight to end-game and not looking around.
---
One thing I've noticed is that anything that burrows into the ground will spot you instantly no matter what the circumstances.
---
So angry, and so stupid. Let people know theres a trade sub/forum. Stop getting your panties in a twist. Ya stupid duper ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
If you can safely watch the bombs fall you‚Äôre not in range to be a nuisance. I think he‚Äôs talking about people building right next to the clubhouse 
---
If anything that‚Äôs bethesda decision to not add more strategies for griefers to use
---
regardless of what I‚Äôve said, maybe having the option or activation of that to be only available on the pvp gamemode which they‚Äôve introduced but what bethesda wants is to find ways for people to participate in pvp and not fuck up their entire character from a destruction and endless of raids in adventure which is aimed to be a safe mode unlike pvp
---
As more players level up and get better weapons and character builds it makes sense that nukes would become more and more frequent.
---
Now if Bethesda ciuld just get the servers to stop crashing.
---
Ah, cool.. been absolutely forever since I did that. I played a bit of fo4 between the beta and release but I guess I didn't get that far.
---
Gotcha Forest Operative mask

Enclave vendor in Whitespring Bunker?
---
Something similar looking was leaked awhile back, while not being exactly like the mosaic it has almost the same looking colour pattern I uploaded an image of it here:
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/wWTBrLN
---
You can trust the leak as well, which is a bonus. All of the leaks I‚Äôve seen so far have proven true. Some might be scratched out along the way but all so far are proving true.
---
The only thing Hacker does in the silo is deactivates turrets and opens up short cuts in case you die, like the door from the repairing mainframe core area to the first hallway
---
Okay, cool. I saw it once on a lvl 26, but it's probably just super rare. Btw, which vendor? I forgot mine.
---
It needs to be expanded somehow like how other 'mmo' and 'mmo-lite' games have multiple currencies, it's a bit of a mess atm.
---
It has been quiet lately.  The few nukes I‚Äôve gone to are in non-traditional spots (Charleston, Monongah Power Plant, in the Bog near Fort Defiance).    I could use some Whitespring nukes to restock on Hardening Mass.
---
They also nerfed the xp glowing ones give you at whitesprings.  They were 500+, now about 150.  So may be less enticing.  (I'm not complaining, 500 was too much)
---
Watoga for me
---
I've been noticing drops in the playerbase for a while now. at least on PC. started on January 1st, probably due to the y2k bug. then a couple weeks later.
---
this weekend has been particularly bad. another drop.
---
It should do a thing to the enemies there too like a new variant. Imagine the mole miners but covered with moss and breathing spores or a shaggy mega sloth.
---
What does the boatfly one do
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can build you a set with shocks if you get the mats
---
I wouold add the Junkie Legendary effect...I get way too many of those.
---
I probably would enjoy my second character more if laser weapons weren't complete shit. 
---
Since I want to dedicate him to laser weaponry it's been a painful ride so far with this shit damage and shittier weapon quality
---
Yep, the terminal in Production specifically. It won't always have it available (it stocks a few different pieces of forest operative or urban operative armor each time) so you might need to hop a few times.
---
I am on Xbox but I don‚Äôt think I have the mats
---
I don‚Äôt want to talk to random people on the internet so I don‚Äôt have it enabled. I wish text chat was built into the game
---
It's sadly more prevalent than you would think. And the "fix one thing, break three more" mode of operation... not exclusive to BSG or the gaming industry either.

Bold of you to assume I'm male
---
Spawns a bloatfly from a enemy once they die
---
Considering the white spring do farm don‚Äôt exist anymore...
---
I see
---
I'm never doing a nuke outside of survival servers once they come out so I wouldn't be betting on uselessness of those. Agreed that bobblestacking must go. As with meta builds,  low level pvper is just another type of guy for which you need a defense strategy and an attack strategy. TSE was, at no point, meta, it just looked like one until the top 1% learned better. After the nerf, it is still going to be 3rd most powerful perk combination, just as it is now.
---
You can also swap weapons before landing as well and it'll bypass the landing animation.
---
Yes, thats why i keep going solo. I don't like playing the tagging gme.
---
The funny thing about your comment is that the people who *truly* care about PvP are all calling for a fresh start, save a handful, from what I've seen.
---
I believe that's if you guys really cared about legitimate PvP, you'd realize it's not possible with our current characters and gear. Even if they fixed the bobblehead issue, fixed duping, banned cheaters, etc. they'll never fix the damage that's been done via glitches, cheating, etc.
---
I'd be happy with a character (level, name, perks, special) only import, but that doesn't seem like a good compromise because you and OP seem to be focused on the gear that you've worked toward more than the character itself.
---
They haven't, but they wouldn't say either way tbh until private servers are out. If your worried then don't use any mods. I would be really surprized if anyone got banned for mods though since they (Beth) made the infrastructure to use them. 
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt either. The fluxes are hard to get
---
Explosive shotguns will only damage the queen any noticeable amount if you stand basically right underneath her and shoot the ground below her stomach and neck. Otherwise they basically barely damage her at all. But if you do find those sweet spots, you will see chunks fly off her bar. 
---
Also Gatling guns are great all around consistent damage and guns in general. Not to mention I think there is some hidden effect that makes enemies gravitate to the person with the loudest gun, or maybe it‚Äôs the biggest gun?
---
Explosive flares would mainly be for players under level 15 who don't have access to the m79 yet. Its also easier to craft flares than grenade rounds.
---
Oh we had a few pvp battles.  The fun really came while I was playing with my nephew building the workshop up to working together to defend the pve... the pvp seemed to be some pretty brutal griefing... had that happen once actually.. they showed up, just to knock stuff down... but I guess that's what pvp is.... When I watched the E3 presentation on this game, I was blown away... you mean, we could work with our friends playing together cooperatively to rebuild the wastelands?  I have watched my son and nephew play Fallout 4 together (online and voice chat because they're 2500 miles apart) for hours... which is to say, they were playing the same game together while talking about it... fo76 completely dumped that on it's head... I keep asking my son if he wants to play.. he just shrugs.. he doesn't like glitchy... he's too young for patience quite yet.
---
Yeah, and it looks pretty cool :p 
---
Well if you bothered to read at all, you'd see I touched some what on logic for females playing as Male. 
---
As for having a problem with it, what indicated that? Or do you just assume you're always correct?
---
Exactly my sentiments when i made a similar post last night. 
---
I feel like they havent added anything or changed much in the last 2 months, that have effected me personally enough, that i would rather just have the game back in the state it was. Right after the initial STASH increase üëå Otherwise, anything thats been fixed is shadowed by how horrible this games stability has been.
---
Considering Beth couldn‚Äôt even dynamically design an area to look like an *actual* nuke zone - I.e. craters, desolation, general deadness instead of vegetation still as thriving as it was just before a fricking nuke was launched on it - I don‚Äôt think this is a realistic ask.
---
Great idea, but I‚Äôd like to see them get the vanilla content down pat first.
---
Maybe a workaround is to pack up and at least predictably exit when things aren't appearing stable...
---
I find it so strange how different my experience is to these posts. I don't *think* u do anything different. I'm on PC. What do you play on?
---
There was already a thread about it, just it's boring AF so its already slipped away 
---
I am in agreement that exploits must go. I do believe that harshness must come from never knowing if the encounter will be peaceful or not. Not from knowing you are at a severe disadvantage because you have obligations other than F76.
---
Lol, keep trying. Maybe one day you'll get it right.
---
Till then, have a good day and enjoy yourself on reddit. You seem to need it, Mr, low T. ;)
---
well i agree that low levels needs some sort of explosive weapon that in non granade but i disagree that flaregun can be a good and legit granade laucher IMO rest of your ideas just like i said are brilliant to me and i like them
---
Nah, there's plenty of recent examples that are incredibly unnatural for them to bring up red dead with this totally unrelated game.
---
For example, here's a [YouTube video from two weeks ago](https://youtu.be/7mUb_JaohlQ) that had nothing to do with this comment https://imgur.com/qflAPb3.jpg just read the comment, how Rockstar created a "masterpiece".. the video has nothing to do with the engine, or anything remotely related to Rockstar, and it's been so long since release it would make more sense for them to compare **any** other game released before/after fallout 76.
---
Quite honestly, you'd have to be a useful idiot to see any comment like the one I took a screenshot of, and **not think** that's fucking unnatural as fuck. To compare these two completely unrelated games months after they were both released.. makes zero fucking sense. Zero.
---
Whys there outrage at that game? Wasn't it Bioware and EA that did that one, figured those two names (At least post selling Halo Bioware) would have tipped people off it probably wasn't gonna be what was advertised. 
---
Thanks for your generosity 
---
Cool version, that back wall really adds alot to the open 'roof' space of the train.  
---
Gonna try to mod my camp and build one too
---
I think I made the original post a bit unclear. I was talking about wearing armour with Chameleon. I was wondering if the effect was worth the annoyance. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what to do for you?
---
the rng in this game is complete ass.  I don't have a useful legendary anything, although I was lucky with the X-01 mods, I have nearly every body part modded with the mods I want, including the jetpack, and I only have one calibrated shock, the other is the only mod I am missing for my X-01.  it only took about 6 hours total of server hopping, over a few sessions, to get those mods, that's not bad for this game but holy fuck that's 6 hours of my life just for a fucking jetpack and **1 frigging calibrated shock!!**  and still no useful legendary anything for my character, and that's after countless hours of farming Whitesprings...  the last few patches, and the upcoming one, have been/will be good, but that only addresses bugs and a few minor gameplay tweaks, the majority of gameplay decisions made in this game are crap imo, everything from inventory and weight to balance and mechanics, all crap.  and that's to say nothing of the complete lack of irreverent humor in the game, it's so far in the other direction it's ridiculous, this is a depressing as game, every holotape ends in tragedy, just so heavy, dead bodies everywhere...  like 2 interesting NPCs, and it doesn't have to be that way, just because there are no human NPCs doesn't mean there can't be any interesting robot NPC's, I mean Fallout's lore is filled with interesting robot NPCs, we have 2 in this game, and one non hostile super mutant, if you can ever find him, and why isn't there a robot host to Appalachia Radio?  Idk, I just realized I wrote nearly as much as the OP, rant over...
---
Your talking about Bethesda not fixing stuff cause it's hard when they a billion dollar company and I say modders do it for free and you says modders are just band aiding the game when they fix more shit than Bethesda. Have you not heard the meme modders will fix it. When the same easy to fix bugs that modders fix every game date back to morrowind. Then that means the company has a problem don't defend them.
---
Same lost my t-60 chest piece in there
---
Never saw it I guess. I really just want conversation from the people who still defend 76 and Bathesda. I want to see their side, cause all I hear is sunshine and rainbows type of positivity from them, and I'd really like that from my experience, and I'm sure plenty others think the same.
---
I‚Äôm ignoring all of that and play it fo4 style. 
---
Like a single player game. And when i do encounter a player with a large clown head i just grin.  
---
Explain?
---
PC related issues similar to what FO76 had at launch and an infinite load screen that seems to hit a lot of people. 
---
I will be fun seeing you how you waste 7000 bullets on the scorchqueen beast just so a camper can kill you in the last minute and steal the kill from you :D ... i'm very excited for the pvp servers :D
---
well, yeah, obviously. but you shouldn't really on workshops either. they're hardly the best way to acquire junk and are mostly pvp arenas (that nobody use).
---
Sometimes there's an Event for these plants. It rewards the participants with Corpse Seeds and other players in the region with Corpse Flower Stamen, which is weird, because Stamen is more sought after.
---
You can put purifiers over camfires?
---
I have given up on it too, not even because of the disconnects and loading screens. I gave up on it because there is zero eng game content. Nothing. Not a thing to do end game that is worthwhile. I dont even count the Queen because it DC you most of the time. Should I farm white springs until levl 10000? That is the only rewarding thing to do in the game. No point in doing quest when at the end you will get some useless garbage and 3 enemies worth of exp.
---
Moving on to better games, there are A LOT of them out there.
---
You get disconnected
---
It is also mentioned to contain a group of religious leaders
---
when throwing junk in a ground fast enough into a bag the same can happen. its any container
---
Trust me it ain't sunshine and rainbows just the same reason it was at launch.  People still have fun with the game but stuff like the bag, nuka dark and now the stupid jacket really have no bearing on how the actual game needs to be improved. 
---
I turn off voice chat because I've been jump scared by too many people hacking up a lung into their mic, yelling at family members etc out of nowhere.  It's an epidemic of horrible mic etiquette out there. It's a shame because I would actually like to talk to people.
---
Jesus, an option to have fonts double size would help the terminal aspect. Nothing has made me feel like an old man this year more than not being able to read notes and terminals from the couch on my huge tv. 
---
Thanks a lot for this.
---
Yup, more and more people are starting to realize this. Kinda sucks since it‚Äôs seems to be the only useful pa helmet mod.
---
Yeah.
---
Yeah the social system is screwed. Mine has been bugged for about a month. When I check my friends list names show up for a split second then disappear showing that I have no one on the list (not even offline, just empty). People do not receive my invites. I receive other peoples invites only sometimes. Often it claims I‚Äôm on a team when I‚Äôm not.
---
Tbh though this is all par for the course at this point from Bethesda. Would have been just lovely if this was on steam instead 
---
ty &lt;3
---
I do miss the decision making aspect, fallout was always about that for me
---
the point is there are too many duped legendaries out there to allow them to be brought over to the PvP servers...
---
I‚Äôd like to play more but there‚Äôs not really anything to do. I think we‚Äôre at that point where people who started at release are out of things to do. Beth keeps adding to the cash shop though...
---
So what would you lose by simply not having that PvP character started until survival mode drops?
---
I can somewhat understand some people who have been focused on PvP with their main toon since day 1 being worried, but if you're making a new one anyway, why not later and completely equal?
---
Let‚Äôs fix the explosive flamer too. That gun is just.....hell I don‚Äôt even have a word for it.
---
Amen.
---
Just ignore the workshops and find a deposit map online . Build a base that's easy to relocate so you can move if you need to farm a different resource.
---
Workshops are a broken endgame boss fight where you take your crappy weapons and armor and fight the boss who bought all of his duped weapons and armor on eBay with his mother's credit card and has a special ability of 200 stacked bobbleheads.
---
I actually have three going right now, each in different areas with different paths. I'm level 45 with one and he hasn't even gone to the NW part of the map. Whoops.
---
Different styles of camps, too.
---
Or what if we could mutate the wildlife and make some vile flora monsters?
---
That was the impression I got when the launched the game, however it doesn't seem like there is much rebuilding going on. Especially when servers jump you from one to another that doesn't save progress.....the downfall of a multiplayer online game. It's too bad this cant be played offline as a totally different game with npcs and a rich story direction 
---
I heard I kid get bullied for having a dark skinned character sounded like a damn clansmen ffs we dont need that and screaming children/asthmatic breathing 
---
I got bored once or twice and did PVP then realised it was more fun to help low-level players with quests and supplies
---
It's an example, I think you're missing the point, it should repair all it can except what it can't, then you can sort that as and when.
---
As it stands the whole thing is fucked unless you individually repair each and every thing you do have mats for.
---
You can also use a jetpack to help break your fall and cancel the superhero landing. That's what I do. 
---
I think in the patch notes it said they changed it from 0,01 to 0,001 so they do have weight but not really noticeable 
---
Dupers and griefers
---
I'm sorry about your drops, bro. I got super lucky, and got 3 different explosive gun pretty quickly. I didn't know that they were good though so I traded one for 5k caps (panicked and said yes), and the other for 35 cans of dog food (dropped the ball there). 
---
For how close it's been since the bombs fell it already looks like the area was GECK'd
---
Pay to pass Doors 
---
There's still decision making, you can either decide to Role Play and suck ass or exploit everything you can and be powerful.
---
You made an entire response with no context, why even respond at all lol just a waste of time. Also your low T insult makes no sense in the way you‚Äôre using it and every bit of sense in the way I‚Äôm using it. It seems logic goes way over your head.
---
Hmmm...I‚Äôll have to go look again, because I thought the change was from 0.10 to 0.01. 
---
Its high damage with long reload honestly id sell it if its not a legendary one
---
I mean you could use push to talk so your mic is only on when you are holding down a certain key. "That guy" is usually only reserved for people who blast shitty music with an open mic. 
---
I mean, I guess in my eyes its a big picture thing. The game was broken and objectively bad at launch, they haven't done anything but release patches that only cause more problems, and when people say its gonna get better my mind goes to outside the game at decisions Bathesda is makeing like these three things as showing they just don't even care. And they don't even talk to us about whats going on (I don't count Inside the Vault as them talking, thats just a vauge and not really good patch note log)
---
I have the tactical means, the knowledge and the equipment to make sure I can live despite such danger. If they take my equipment away, I still have the tactical means and the knowledge to do so, my pack just needs to recreate the equipment which should take us less time now that SBQ finally begun dropping decent loot once per a century, not once per a millenium, I guess about a month to recreate the first phase of godhood.  
---
I also wont waste 7000 bullets on her. When I shoot her, I see her HP go down.
---
Normally I love pvp games, and spend countless hours in them. Your post though is basically the reason I am considering dropping fo76 for awhile. 
---
The amount of players that have full sets of sentinels assassin's armor and good tier weapons through ill gotten means destroys the possibility of a decent pvp experience. I've done 100s of scorched beast fights, vendored easily around 1000 legendaries and never find drops like that.
---
The idea of being dropped into an arena with players that have 90%+ dmg mitigation, and weapons that do 20x my characters hp bar hardly sounds fun. Especially after I've spent over 200 hours playing and do not have even compatible gear sets. 
---
Clean wiping does nothing, these same people will be first in line in their duping communities to have these unattainable sets of gear and as you say holding any decent farming location. 
---
Yep definitely seems somewhat related to time.. seen the same thing happen myself. I have seen the same 40 cap cost on a long-distance move in a 5 minute window as well though.. just not consistent.
---
It actually went from .1 to .001 so you are both half right lol
---
I am sworn to carry your burdens. 
---
But it shouldn't be the only story telling device, save the raider robot. I felt really let down by how it not only stripped the life from the world, but most of the personality and lore. Where are the non-feral ghouls at the least?
---
What i think is funny is i didnt even get decon shower form the queen i got it from the brother hood technical data quest 
---
I agree. And the thing that bothers me is that Fo3 &amp; NV did work for me, quite well in fact. Even though they didn't quite have the depth that CRPG games had. On the other hand Fo4 while being a fine game overall, did even less RP stuff, did away with skills all together and essentially removed dialogue systems with consequences from the game. They are capable of doing fine choice driven content as shown by Far harbour but they choose not to.
---
Bethsoft have been gutting the RP stuff out of Fallout so hard that I'm getting really afraid for the Elder scrolls series.
---
Bonus points for the belaboring of some old one off jokes to the point of annoyance (NO nuka cola does not equal Fallout).
---
Now we have Fallout 76, which is a whole different game and cant really be compared to the main series, but it still seems to chafe against the IP. All the cool things the atomic shop could've offered, cool callbacks to older games, unique new things etc... And they instead go with stuff straight outta the sims games for some reason.
---
SUCH a good game. Damn now I want to go back and start another play through...
---
Being a thief would've been easier with NPCs. Stealing was actually my favorite thing to do in ESO.
---
Yep, I just saw...lol. 
---
Thanks to both of you!
---
Worse drops? Have you been to the SBQ lately? Last 3 runs, AAE Handmade level 45, Furious explosive gatling 2 star lvl 50, Unyielding Sentinel +1 STR Heavy Combat Armor... what servers are you playing on? I am on PS4. I also have 15 luck build with a full unyielding set so my Luck is like 38 max with food and ect, 43.
---
Crevasse Dam in the mire has a few
---
Took me this long to lvl up, and do the quests needed to launch my first nuke with my son last night.  Only had 1 CTD, funny enough it was just as the SBQ landed and just as got my first blow on her backside with my SkiSword she farted and I was left looking at my desktop.  Rejoined the team with my son and took her down.
---
TSE are getting nerfed to only do 20% extra dmg. There are pvp servers coming out in 2 weeks with no pvp restrictions. They fixed a lot of stuff in latest patches. Duppers are getting banned in mass.
---
Might have to steal this location
---
Christmas noobs
---
Hard to tell, but I stopped nuking, because Whitespring nuke zone always DCs after 10-60min. Overall the increased amount of DCs don't incentivize to clear silos.
---
Ooo, nice. Getting real sick of developers. Honestly, this type of stuff is happening way to commonly now.
---
Use tesla coils to tag.
---
Bethesda, Fix this!  Your hopper in this quest stole my Chameleon armor.
---
Even though I am guilty myself if farming Whitesprings.....
---
I absolutely hate Whitesprings! It's so cheesy and it reminds me of the original 'loot cave' in Destiny. It's sad when you have a bunch of players huddled in one area complaining because someone killed a cheesy legendary  before they got a chance to hit it. Although all loot based games are essentially just casinos...... Whitesprings is the penny slots where the most degenerate of the degenerate gamblers hang out.
---
I think it also depend on where you live.
---
For exams I live in Holland, but when I'm on a server I have people from different countries in the server, most of them can't speak English or do it so terrible I don't understand what they are saying.
---
Germans are the worst they just keep shouting German into their mic :(
---
And I live in a busy house hold and I don't think people will enjoy vacuum, dogs and all that
---
What is this SBQ you speak of? 
---
happened to me a few times. have no idea why.
---
even got a couple legendary ones.
---
How do I apply
---
While they have similar ideals, the Followers have their roots in the West Coast while the Responders were all local to WV. 
---
Oh wow, after all the things I read in past about "you can only get it off the queen" you got it off the technical data quest? Nice going!
---
If you want something a bit more immersive - go into first-person mode and use the Mining Helmet/Mining Hat as your flashlight.  Feels like an entirely different game when you see it from this perspective.
---
That said, I get immersed in 76 despite playing in third-person.  I think part of what creates this is that the Pip-Boy and navigating menus don't stop the game.  Neither do NPC interactions or VATS.  That Deathclaw is coming toward you whether you like it or not.
---
I can't talk about spoilers if you don't know.
---
It's super rare spawn. I have only once seen that in nuke zone.
---
Truth
---
Beauty 
---
Your lucky, last 4 queens, 3 of them people join and just shoot the adds, the 1 that was killed, had zero loot and no reward.  Was it worth the bullets.......
---
The bobblehead issue would go a long way toward making this reasonable (no stacking, like chems), but that still wouldn't solve the damage that's already been done. A large portion of Assassin's Sentinel/Cavalier gear is duplicated, for example. I know you probably won't agree because it would mean that your full set is mostly the product of cheating, but it's true. Also, even without bobblehead stacking, cheaters already have hundreds of the items saved up. Bethesda won't delete all of those, so that's already a relatively large damage margin active 100% of the time.
---
To be perfectly honest, it seems like the players worried about the wipe are the ones "crying about it" because you're worried that losing gear (which you *know* is mostly glitched but won't admit) won't make you better than 90% of other players right out of the gate. Pretty sad stance.
---
If you've been playing for PvP since launch, you can still do that.
---
I think it was a mistake in the code or something i got it when i was lvl 35 or so and just trying to survive ive gotten gear from the wrong pool before 
---
thanks for this. i know im not alone, but it feels better to know other fans are frustrated too. im a patient man and it makes the fallout games fun as i put in the hours to get great weapons and what not. youre 1000% correct on this and the legendary roll crap and other things like it make me wonder why im still playing, but then i boot up my pc and smash face and remember why im here. i just wish my experience was more fun and less jaded.

Campfires are considered dirt, so you can put water pumps and crops on them. 
---
Duping is almost gone, but servers are worse. Crashing same as launch.
---
I had some higher level radscorpions chasing me all the way across the Savage Divide. Some enemies get tired and give up, but not these fuckers.
---
I figure the reason they gave them any weight at all post-patch is so they could sort by Weight to the top.
---
Yeah I got a few level 1 legendaries lmao.

As far as Luck, it improves your condition of items and quality of items found. However, its luck. Just like in real life, it is hit or miss. But, I pull more than 1 legendary off ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ mobs all the time and they are usually pretty decent.
---
Ahhh I just realized what the SBQ stood for. I've only been able to do it once so far 
---
You don‚Äôt get it. My dishwasher sounds like the beaches of Normandy during WWII. I dunno how things don‚Äôt come out clean but broken. So when I ‚Äòpush to talk‚Äô it literally sounds like I‚Äôm in a car, windows down doin 80 while trying to say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm in position‚Äô. When I wear my headset it‚Äôs so I can drown out the sounds, not temporarily relay them to you via mic for shared annoyance lol.

Stahp with the creation of fan categories. Please, it's so pointless and unreasonable. I've been playing Fallout since the original over 20 years ago and I don't share your views and I find nothing antagonistic about Bethesda's design direction. I also think your comment about a young generation and instant gratification are insulting oversimplifications. 
---
Generalizations are stupid, and btw, gliching things or doing things quickly isn't a new concept. People have been doing this shit since the '80s...
---
I play 1st person. 
---
This isn't true.  It will show the requirements as if you had the plan and wanted to build it from scratch, but you can install the mod just fine without those materials.
---
The blog posts said that pvp will be turned off during events. SBQ is an event, so it is very possible to kill the queen in Survival.
---
Lol someone downvoted the word clothes 6 times. Holy shit you guys need therapy
---
That is where Serums and a lot of nice plans drop. But, kinda boring farming nonstop
---
unplayable on a 970? i was running this game fine on high setting with an i5 and an rx460... 
---
It seems to vary.  Sometimes I'll get a server where people are nuke crazy - the same person will fire off three nukes in succession.  And other times I'll play for hours and no one launches one.
---
I tend to savor the latter when I find it, because those servers are often more stable.
---
I do agree though, it *feels* like the player base is declining.  I'd imagine the high-leveled players are bored and are dropping out, and I'm really not seeing too many Lv. 1s emerging from the Vault anymore.  It used to happen several times a day.  Now, maybe I see one a day, if that.
---
Based on information I have acquired, a G.E.C.K. Malfunctioned or something. 
---
I posted a thread about this. I only use pipe guns, knuckles, raider armor. Never power armor. I shoot a few shots at something cheap to repair(usually a wall), if the person gets upset and doesn‚Äôt engage then I leave, if the person engages then we have a bit of fun before going our separate ways.
---
Role playing is great and one of the only ‚Äúendgame‚Äù options, particularly after you‚Äôve gotten all the good SBQ drops. However it‚Äôs important to find a balance between role playing a raider and shitting on someone‚Äôs gaming experience. If you seek out higher level players a surprisingly large amount of them will engage with you and even add you as a friend after.
---
Good for you, I guess. I hope this thread has opened your eyes to the fact that everyone likes different things. 
---
Exactly!
---
That would be awesome. Nice ideas :)

It's like a 4 second moving gif that we were all amazed by when phones first started using them. It doesn't even transition into a perfect loop which kills me on the inside. To top it off you have to power it or the robot fish stays inactive. 
---
I'm not a fan of the terminal one, or the stealing paintings one. They just don't seem viable. Maybe the static box, but I'm not sure. Stealing would greatly increase with NPCs though.
---
Yeah, don't go getting all righteous on people who just have little shacks and crafting stations without turrets.
---
If you do, then you're just a flying, angry nutsack, haha
---
That is my kind of evil. Subtle but effective. 
---
I'd really just recommend hopping to another server where a CAMP isn't located at Charleston Station. It seems unfair to destroy somebody's hard work over something they may not have known, especially when it takes far less time to server hop than it does to rebuild a CAMP that some stranger decided to orbital strike.
---
So I've got a bug thread going, and it I have some strong evidence of a "Seeded RNG", because I know some guys just like you, insanely lucky, like multiple TSE's in a single WhiteSprings run lucky..
---
So you play in 3rd person?

Are these weapons going to stop breaking after 2 minutes?

Thank you for coming here to tell us you don't give a shit, and to throw in some insults.  
---
It can be either:  
---
You're playing a kindergarten version of wasteland survival game VS you shitheads should get a life
---
or:  
---
Please let me play the harsh version, thank you VS Please let me play the cooperative version, thank you  
---
I prefer to have it civilised. Adding a PvP mode is a win-win situation for the whole community. There is no point at throwing insults at each other. Being a PvP oriented player is not equal to being a griefer. I myself have most fun from looking at map, seeing a trap, going right into that trap and dealing with those 'bad' guys. It's absolutely okay to want to play with similar people, and the game should allow that, and I see no justification in rudeness caused by the fact that such thing is to be implemented.  
---
Example situation on what I understand by fun PvP:
---
Yesterday I seen a guy with pretty decent Bounty on his head, level \~140, on the map. After opening and closing map for a while, I found some more high level players (130, 200) appearing and disappearing - must be sneaking. I waited for three minutes, and seeing that the bounty guy does not disappear, I decided they must be his support. I move in, I see a big exposed territory, shitloads of hiding places, CAMP exactly in the middle, and the wanted guy inside of the camp. I come near, reload all my guns, take some chems. I now have a sprinter build and I can take a decent punch as long as I am moving. The doors open up before me as I approach, the wanted guy inside. I enter, right after me a chameleon enters too and closes the door. I shoot the wanted guy, removing their bait, and get killed in the closed space. I seek revenge. What enused was an hour long session of killing each other back and forth, where they had better understanding of the particular spot, good combination of weapons, and an advantage of numbers, and we had better communication, greater understanding of the game mechanics, better builds and artillery support. This was a blast, definitely dozen times more engaging that anything PvE could ever provide, at least as my understanding of fun dictates. We friended each other afterwards.
---
LOL
---
I actually was running with a wooden Unyielding leg recently until I found an Unyielding leather piece to replace it.
---
I'm still trying to figure out if using my full set of mismatched 3* armor is better than a full set of Unyielding with 1* wooden legs and leather arms.
---
It doesn't help you now but my stash is like 90% junk, a few rifles and grenade launchers etc. that I can't reduce carry weight of. I carry literally everything else and switch carry wight perk cards around all the time. I have Excavator with Calibrated Shocks and Party Girl and Whisky on hand etc. for emergencies  You have to know you can lose junk, so the only way to mitigate it is to have it stashed at all times. I fell asleep playing the other night and lost a bunch of junk I had gathered in that session. It sucked. Woke up to find I had no junk. I also had a near experience with a bunch of gathered Hardened Masses and other stuff. But I joined a random "friend" and somehow managed to find my bag again. But yeah they really need to let you rejoin for all the time you put in to get stuff like Silos, Nukes, Workshops, etc. to lose it all because of instability of the game should be number 1 priority to fix. How difficult can it be? If server is full when you disconnect it reserves the space for you to rejoin. When you click to play it asks do you want to rejoin previous world. Simple.

Yep, I have 4 characters and I've inky done the quest on one. Seems like a really sexist group, not including men and all that. Every other group in the game allows both. Plus that dress is ugly af
---
Yeah try putting the comment you originally put. You shouldn‚Äôt joke about mental health either. I can already see the type of human you will grow up to be 
---
Definitely good for farming low lvl legendaries. Sometimes I prefer it :p
---
I dunno. I think if you read the snippets it really adds a lot of personality and lore. It helps that they are all themed together even when they are not part of the main story they still help paint a picture. And Bethesda‚Äôs fallout stories are best when they are about what happened pre war/during the war. And this game‚Äôs story is pretty much focused on that. Their main story for the character always is lacking and not the big push that gets me interested to explore. Something that I enjoyed about New Vegas, even the side stories helped paint an overall picture of the main story of the world. 
---
Glitching, and error and bug exploiting aren't new, no. But they just happens to act in the general detriment of a multiplayer game, and to be much more relevant than when playing multiplayer Pong in the 80's.
---
Depends on how Survival will actually work. You are overestimating how many other players I meet. For most parts it feels like Im alone on servers. If this will be the case on Survival, then it will be Adventure with an occasional player encounter. Not a hardcore war on low lvl players.
---
That machine ate all of my .556 ammo and I was pissed
---
And? 4 days now.
---
Bobbles and blocking people in game are why i have 0 interest in both pvp and survival.
---
Hello members, we've gained intel on another.... pest problem. Activate the beacons for an orbital strike. That is all.
---
I do feel with the latest patch notes that the people making decisions have no idea who their player base is.
---
In my experience it doesn‚Äôt matter the order I do anything until I reconnect in the network features. Just happened again. This time I tried just closing out the game. After 3 tries no luck. 
---
The problem with sentinel/cavalier armour is it‚Äôs just too good, it needs balancing, a reset would just help whoever gets super lucky and finds a decent weapon/armour early in the beta, if we carry characters over atleast everyone has had plenty of time to gear grind. And if people are dropping aid on death we can only hope this includes bobbleheads magazines etc
---
Sweet, did not knew about that.
---
No I do not. I have a file man build,  but the perl to add that extra .50 damage is a waste imo. Double damage is already enough if you spec your build correctly. I dont even have a 2 shot gauss rifle and it does insane damage when all my damage buffs start applying. 
---
Just gonna upvote this as I think it covers things.
---
The reason I can allow myself to enjoy this game is because fo4 already destroyed the lore for me. So I just goof around and have fun with 76 without thinking about the story too much. I suggest you try the same and maybe you'll enjoy the game more.
---
Please don‚Äôt stab other customers while they shop!
---
I belive you forgot polymer on combat armor
---
There's also a fantastic pair of robots on the road near Deathclaw island that discuss, in depth, the meaning of their own existence. 
---
Dude if you jump off cliffs, take all the pieces off of your power armor and jump, i do that and I never have to worry about my power armor
---
Just make a new char u'll find the dips... Was playing with a lvl 6 was on my other he's 22 had a band of 50's just rolled up and only shoot at him. So I logged into my other higher char. Asked y their picking on him? Response was cause we can. So friended the lvl 6 then just opened a can. About 20 min later I get the question y did you do that "Cause I can" is my reply....lol wow some people like being the bully but most can't handle it back...
---
Game was broken but not objectively bad if it was it wouldn't still have a sizeable player base.  And you said it yourself, outside the game decisions.  Bethesda Austin are the ones responsible for development and no one is entirely sure how things will be in the long run. 
---
Almost always, yes. 
---
&gt;!Whitesprings bunker!&lt;
---
Someone just told me pvp is disabled during events so i don't know what to think on the pvp servers anymore.
---
Yes if pvp.  For pve you may not get enough incremental benefit for the annoyance.  I like it, but i guess i dont hear the sound.
---
https://m.gamestop.com/trade/quote/xbox-one/games/fallout-76/163237
---
Or full price if unopened and you have the receipt.
---
It‚Äôs a game console. 
---
What system u play on? 
---
So you play the game as a female because of one particular item? Did you start out a Male, learn of the item, then switch to a female? 
---
I played as a Male in NV and never had an issue killing anyone. Never chose the lady killer because I felt is was a waste. Humans are the weakest npcs besides ghouls, which are technically humans. 
---
Now I did read an article that was published a while after FO4 released and the author described playing as both genders and found it's an entirely different game as the wife. While I thought that was great on Beth's part, it still didnt compell me to switch 
---
Just imagine, looking for a good lonely spot to take a good dump in peace when suddenly someone violates your privacy. Lmao
---
What‚Äôre you guys playing on?? I‚Äôm on XB1 and rarely get a disconnect. When I do it‚Äôs often due to my own connection issues with my router. How often are you disconnecting? Have you called your internet provider to ensure all proper ports are open?
---
It's being scrapped when you are bulking your junk. Supposed to be fixed in next update I believe. As a rule don't bulk steel until the update. 
---
Oh no, I need to have my leg pieces on. I have this issue with my foot one time while trying to fast travel to Watoga. I pulled a muscle right between my foot curve thing. Had to go to a responder bot to prescribe me some comfy power armor booties. :/ 
---
I mean I literally could have fixed this by now after 3 minutes in fallout edit. What's going on over there at BGS.
---
What materials do they have to build it I may have enough but not the plans to make them
---
Did you build anything? There was/is a bug that auto scraps them if you can use the resource. 
---
I had that happen before, bought plans, exited trade menu, opened pip boy, no plans...
---
It‚Äôs unfortunate. Not only that, but I‚Äôm the inventory, the ultracite laser looks like a normal laser rifle
---
Damn really? That‚Äôs a terrible bug. Wish I had known that before lol
---
Can't remember where I got the revolver, but the other 2 came from the queen. I had about 8 fissure prime nukes I joined in a week, mostly plans as loot, but 2 separate runs gave me those weapons. 
---
Note: I haven't launched a nuke myself yet, I only joined other people's nuke events.
---
So you like fashion? Cool beanos, that a legitimate reason. Never played tomb raider, and I'm also impressed you have 10 girls when the game only allows five. Lol, but hey, keep on playing playa
---
It is odd that a game that defaults to mic always on is so silent, I've only ever heard one guy speak in the 2 or so months I've played
---
In my experience, I think the core bug is fixed, but sometimes the bar seems to regenerate before correcting itself, either on its own or on the next hit.
---
It's kind of like how Super Mutants with very low health can be stabbed, and they'll keep walking for a second or two before they suddenly realize they are supposed to be dead.
---
Yeah, pretty sure this is the case. 
---
So even with a return to last server feature, your stuff would have been gone, sadly. 
---
they say they did. it's clearly still in the game, though.
---
This too. 
---
Expect players looking for PvP and slap damaging by way of an invite.  A few fixes but nothing that's making quality if life any better really.  Lots of good locations for farming are now well known, so more players server hopping.  An absence of those early hard charging players that were doing lots of Nukes.  Lots of players buying up plans to sell on the market place.  Lots of Legendaries for sale on the Marketplace.  Everyone hoping for new content.
---
Yea I rebuilt a base last night, but I had plenty of every resource.
---
You missed my point. I'm not arguing that the harm of glitching is equivalent to the harm it caused in older games. I'm arguing that glitching has nothing to do with an age category. The original post is heavily generalizing and it's a useless thing to do.
---
Second play through for me was exactly like you described. I walked everywhere no fast travel, made sure to stock up on supplies for a journey to delve into a location I had previously blasted through on my main (even though that character, too, I took through relatively slowly). Currently on my third character, surprisingly superior rng funnily enough as I've found weapons for my other two characters with far few hours played but am still overall having fun time. I did take a few weeks break but have returned to explore and find other fun spots to build camp! 
---
As much as I want new content I'm still happy with what was given ad the world is very far from "empty" like those blasted youtuber claim. 
---
I want everything in your camp
---
I would imagine you could simply return it, provided it's still shrink wrapped and everything.  It was a gift, after all.  Hopefully you got a gift receipt.
---
Thanks for the trade!
---
So I am having something of the same issue but different. I did the Nuka Quest line myself, no friend was with me, when I got to the bunker the clothing was there but no Paint Plans. Anyone know if Bethesda removed them from the gsme or something? I have tried on 2 different occasions/days to find the Plans but no such luck. Any ideas?
---
That's well annoying! 
---
Honestly i think they have an array of ideas and stuff ready to go. But because of such huge backlash and anger they are trickling items into the store. Could you imagine them loading in large piles of atom store items while eveyones screaming about the game being broke. Hell half the time i was screaming inside about how it costs 18 dollars for one power armor skin. If they brought us a bakers dozen of skins for that price before fixing anything reddit would have had an aneurysm. 
---
Honestly, I think more people do have them than you think. The BETA and pre-PTT experience really ruined voice chat for a lot of folks, myself included. Bethesda absolutely broke that and there may be no fixing it. 
---
I am thinking of starting a new charactor today.  Sick of my 103.
---
I dont play 3rd person in this game and I'm surprised that people do. It's just not that great a feeling to play with the camera like that. 
---
Also, ots highly suggested to look around at and at everything else besides your character all the time or I'd imagine its hard to move around places
---
You lose the quest and marker, but the bag is still there.
---
No push to talk for controller schemes is just yet another lazy oversight.
---
It also works if you pull out a weapon. I have most luck with a melee weapon.
---
Whenever a nuke drops I team up with literally anyone in case I get dropped
---
I will agree they need to be doing weekly patches and catching the low hanging stuff. At this point, a little is better than a lot. With some things. But maybe they are afraid of breaking more stuff.  
---
Possibly. I can't remember. I had just picked up all the guns to scrap from the npcs I just cleared. I didn't consider that the game considers death under the same rules as fast travel. I guess next time I'll make sure I don't do that.
---
Don't worry done it countless amount of times never been banned oh and btw ive done this since release so its probably not gonna be patched
---
I mean...logically thinking you are not right. 
---
I don't agree with the poster abover you, but fundamentally, your argument is super flawed.
---
If a=c and b=c then a=b, but his statement is not making the same assumptions that OP is. Therefore b=d. Which means "a" does not = b. Meaning, by following logic of course, you are wrong.
---
That's logically thinking.
---
Either way, as a bounty hunter, I enjoy griefers. Gives me easy caps.
---
Some of the emotes you buy with atoms are similar to the default non-atomic emotes; let us preview them. 
---
There should be a white flag emote or something similar that shows you aren‚Äôt looking for a fight. 
---
The spelling would be atrocious 
---
Ask em. U/brogadyn you ever get the sweet realise of death?
---
So theoretically, if you are playing on a server with friends, drop a bag. Log off. Come back to that same server a few hours later, the bag is still there? 
---
GameStop Employee here.
---
If it‚Äôs still shrink wrapped and you have a gift receipt you can return it, but if you don‚Äôt have a receipt you might run into trouble. GameStop is only giving ten dollars in store trade for it right now.
---
tell me bout, 'specially with the cost of plans!
---
But that would be fun, we can't have fun.
---
completely off topic.
---
Along this line of non-vendor bots... the "blackwater mines" line at uranium fever gets me laughing everytime. It's just the way he says it.
---
could have been in the menu or map or atomic shop
---
Well, at least you'd have someone to chat with. LOL
---
I've spent 8k atoms without putting a dollar in. While the items themselves aren't exquisite and exceptional, I enjoy the poses for my photo album, and the cosmetics for role playing even if I'm playing solo. Sitting on about 900 now waiting to see what's next for my adventure! 
---
(Play on words for lack of macros..)
---
hahahahahahaha yeah !!!
---
See those are all respectable legitimate reasons. I dont agree at all with any of it, but its logical and it doesnt seem to be a mental health issue. Cheers.
---
So much truth in this post!
---
Half the team if your getting any nuka from people their duped, not 5-6 I mean if they say hey here's 250... They have 20000 probably
---
I see your point but I can't agree.
---
Firstly Fo76 is not FOnline or Rust, it is extremely casual compared to these games and the fact that you can't establish in a server for more than few hours will kill any type of "alpha", organization, or privatized areas.  
---
Secondly, the game heavily favors RNG &amp; grinding over skills which is a big issue for PvP. The "meta" was built on insanely rare duplicated items which were avaible to anyone on trading subs for overpriced ammount of caps.
---
Transferring the inventories of dupers &amp; legit players who bought dupes over to survival PvP server would be a huge mess IMO. Also starting fresh would ease the burn for when bethesda address some serious nerf on some legendary effects.
---
I am part of this, I geared myself on the trading subs to min-max and most likely 80% of the items I bought there are dupes but "nobody can prove it" even thought by now I see everywhere the copy pastes of said items on trading subs. I took advantage of that without really knowing, I am overpowered and "meta" because some people used duplication exploits that is all, porting my character to survival would not be fair.
---
Weird flex. But okay
---
I doubt it would be there for a few hours. But definitely some minutes at least. I frantically searched for mine and couldn't remember the exact place I died. I probably searched for 5 or more minutes but I did eventually find it. Not sure how long bags stay in the world for when dropped.
---
well i'm up for a trade if need caps etc...
---
I dropped one cavalier leg from SBQ, bought one chameleon/cavalier for pennies by looking at stores of people who were not interested in market prices, dropped a bloodied explosive gattling that I marketed for two cavalier pieces which I then marketed for armor pieces I haven't really needed but were more expensive than mine, which I marketed for more cavalier pieces.   
---
Thank you for assuming ill gotten means.  
---
FYI, I have had a chance to test different weapons on different meta enemies, and I guarantee you, there are easily available (less than 10k caps) tools in the market that allows you to fight against any particular build. It's just matter of finding the right tool.  
---
It's not simply the gear that is the weapon of the PvPers. It's mostly research, and testing what works on what with friends, hundreds of kills on people on your discord.   
---
This is the greatest threat that casuals will have to face in survival, and current market situation, where a decent (not god) gear is easily available, is something that favors the casuals, not the researchers, which casuals tend not to know as they are not interested in doing homework for an online game - and doing homework for an online game is not something you can reasonably except from anyone.
---
My TSE Shotgun and TSE Gauss usually heal SB to full. It's so bad.
---
Out of curiosity, why do you prefer it over 1st person?
---
Hey check out my route 
---
https://youtu.be/Y7B6gHwPLnA
---
I love the robots pronunciation of Appaa-latch-eeeya. It‚Äôs almost snooty
---
Even after you logged out of the game and completely restarted it? 
---
Ive never had a legendary drill from anything, wish I did see some TBH
---
I'm sorry?  every comment on that post is at zero
---
It because they can basically blink to your location, the only way to loose em is to find some water because they can‚Äôt swim. 
---
Since you have to join the enclave to nuke areas in order to use the geck you should have to join yhe free states i feel factions need more to them such as the Bos, raiders, reaponders and other factions could have something like a nule but with diffrent effect any ideas for other factions?
---
I think I'm the only one who could give a fuck about end game content. I've barely touched the main questline,  and only a few of the side quests. There's a huge would to explore and I haven't even touched half the map. It's not WOW,  it's fallout. 
---
You know, one thing I've been thinking about for CAMPs are doorbells and mailboxes.
---
Doorbells: Right now, you don't know who owns a CAMP you some across.  That's probably by design to make it harder for griefers to seek-and-destroy a specific user's CAMP, but it also means that if you wanted to help them out, complement them, or whatever, you have no way of doing it.  A doorbell would preserve this anonymity and notify the user who owns the CAMP that someone is ringing it and wants to interact with them at the CAMP.  You'd want to have a cooldown on it, so a person couldn't ring it over and over again.
---
Mailbox: A more simplistic means of player vending, especially if you are less interesting in putting a price on things and more interested in just getting rid of something you know is potentially valuable to someone.  Put stuff in your Mailbox you don't care about, get stuff that other players put there.
---
What does the Shrouded mod do specifically?
---
I was trying sneak last week with a full weightless marine set and even had two harder to detect affixes and was still occasionally being chased by a pack of ghouls now and then.
---
That sounds good I‚Äôll take it! When will you be on again?
---
r/thathappened 
---
That stew got me through a few rough patches 
---
Darn, looking for one as I got dense armor mod for the metal piece 
---
I dropped some spare 90%+ fusion cores for a level 90-something player in PA at Whitespeings and he took it. Then he wanted to trade and basically wanted stimpacks for free? I declined since I am stocking a few for my travels and he started chasing me and shooting at me. I‚Äôm a level 42 and in pacifist and he would not leave me alone. It took about 5 minutes of me walking away from him and the sounds of gentle shots fired at me with 0 damage before I got annoyed and logged off. 
---
Side note: I wish I could log off and switch worlds in real life sometimes. 
---
I can't say for sure if it was a crash or a disconnect. My memory is foggy on that part.
---
I agree but it makes me sad that we have to celebrate the one drop of npc interaction Bethesda gave us :(
---
I guess this event puts every participant in a same team, so you should be safe as long as the SBQ lives, and be in danger as soon as you receive the rewards (the event rewards, not the SBQ rewards)
---
If you're just going to give others free ammo just drop it, that's what I do. 
---
Ahhh no receipt:/ ty tho 
---
I gave up trying to min-max with 3* armour peices. Wasnt worth the time trading. You can pretty go armourless with the right perks - and still do almost max dps.    
---
    
---
Once you make that leap you just end up going for the armour that you think looks the nicest. 
---
The point is that there is no point in doing any of the quest when there is zero chance at getting anything good. The game is 100% about gear and weapons and the only real way to get it is farming legendaries. Story isn't and never was the selling point of the game. I'd say you are in the minority. The quest arent very fun and get boring quickly. 
---
What did you get banned for?
---
It‚Äôs misguided when you‚Äôre mad at someone for doing what you did‚Ä¶ but better. 
---
I do notice this.
---
The lack of rebuilding isn't because its a online game. Its because we are forced to server hope and our settlements disappear so no one keaves s lasting impression. I'd also like for squad mates to be able to combine camps. Increasing the budget for each person that adds to it.
---
I fully agree, and that is what i do.  However, the frequency of people building there, perhaps unaware, is growing.  Without a way to communicate politely, i think others are just giving the signal to relocate.
---
Would make my CHARISMA based character a ton of fun to play! 
---
I fear they have gone the path of PvP though, my guess is we won't see Vaults until March/April.
---
Yes, the art direction on the notes is terrible. The fonts are too small and the textures make them illegible. This was a problem in FO4, someone even made a mod to make the notes readable. But there are no mods allowed in FO76, so you're probably out of luck.
---
You still interested in a jetpack for x-01 ?
---
My point is that games were different and your exploits didn't affect others. Kinda like farting. If you are alone and want to do it under the covers and dutch-oven yourself, it's kinda gross, but no harm done. On the other hand, if you are stuck in an elevator with 10 people you should really try to contain yourself instead letting one rip and saying "Hey, farting has been around forever and it's natura!".
---
We've officially reached peak retardation.
---
If they're there when someone drops a nuke things get really fucked up. The glowing bloateds spawn but are somehow still flagged as robots, so every time a legendary goes down you get the surprise of a ghoul self destructing. 
---
I feel ya man I have three kids but I'll be on at 1 if you wanna play 
---
Good tip, I'd rather we were just all able to go HAM and share xp though.
---
I use molotovs as well for mass taggage.
---
Ah then probably someone just looking for a rise.
---
sorry for necropost but can you tell me specific container you found it? I really need that cap. 
---
Agreed!! The best moments in this game are coop  events!!
---
My boi let me ask you something you ever watch WWE? 
---
Sadly they‚Äôre focused on PVP, I really hope they start updating PVE so we can enjoy the game 
---
What kind of hole?
---
I can think of at least two mods for my Grognak! 
---
A similar thing happened to me, but it wasn‚Äôt that glitch. I was fighting 2 SB at Firebase LT and used marsupial to jump onto the top of a tent. As soon as I did the game registered me as being unreachable by the SB which was still attacking me since I guess he didn‚Äôt get the memo, but my damage stopped registering and he started regenerating. As soon as I jumped down it fixed it and I started doing damage again
---
Doorbell has been added . Mailbox has been allready added ( bottom part of post in misc ) change the name of it and remake the idea and it will be also added. I dont want to change the name of your idea without your permission
---
Useful idiot, eh? I see we‚Äôre into the ad hominem already, nice. 
---
Recent examples of games that are still no.2 in the games chart right now? I just told you why they‚Äôre compared, and the comment you linked to supports that. Do you honestly not see why someone who posted a video entitled ‚ÄòBethesda have done something amazing,‚Äô would receive a comment related to the title and not the video itself? Right or wrong, that happens all the time. So this guy, to paraphrase, says ‚Äòit‚Äôs not amazing. They‚Äôre lagging way behind with their engine etc. It looks bad next to RDR2, which sets a new standard.‚Äô Many people are currently playing RDR2, so they‚Äôre going to be comparing it to whatever else is out there. Especially a game that‚Äôs as notorious as this one, because there‚Äôs such a big contrast. 
---
Fallout 76 has been piled on because it had a really bad release, people think Bethesda took the piss, and fixes for all its problems are still very slow in arriving. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs an utterly terrible game, or you can‚Äôt have fun with it, but those are the realities. There‚Äôs no conspiracy here. 
---
My first two queens were two showers and since then I‚Äôve been getting explosive vents like there‚Äôs no tomorrow 
---
We need these raids and more coop events 
---
If your using heavy weapons like the gatling gun i would recommend moving into power armour so you can take advantage of the stabilised perk (intelligence) which gives you much better accuracy and 45% armour pen.
---
I've seen it occur about 6 times now with Protectrons and Liberators, but it has only affected the golf club itself, not the surrounding areas. A few times nearly every protectron has been a zero star legendary.
---
sometimes mole rats near the service entrance bug out and will spawn as scorched beasts.
---
I think it's a bug. I've seen topics reporting the same before, plus I've experienced it myself.
---
iv suggested a THIEF aspect wher you can steal items from camps in a previous post 
---
I'd have to say I'm close too. In one day I had 2 disconnect from server while not wearing power armour. Both times I couldn't retrieve my junk as it respawned me into a nuke zone on a different server, where I died instantly, then while choosing a location to respawn in I had a fatal error and was thrown off the game entirely. So bye bye junk forever twice in one day. It's not an odd thing to happen, so these days I'm trying to stay in power armour, but I'm close to running out of fusion cores and wanted to save them. I've also spent a long time gathering Chameleon armour, and have a full set, and my perks support no power armour. But when this happens through no fault of my own, and I'm making an effort to gather screws, which takes hours, it's very disheartening.
---
Chameleon armor is nice for this.  Also it took me awhile to realize, but if you sneak it hides your gamertag and takes you off the map.
---
I realize this may not have worked in that situation but maybe itll help in the future.

there is an issue of players building on the back of the golf club with turrets and taking(killing) all spawns of the other player's enemy npc's of that building. to the point it wipes out all but 3-4 that come out the front door. i even repeatedly with a super sledge in hand go through the enemies and close the back door so the player coming can get his fair share. the c.a.m.p. owner opens it and i close it . we went round 4,5 times of this. he/she certainly got mad for me helping the other players get their loot.
---
No, I was talking specifically about Fallout 76 and its updates. You may be talking about all that, but I was specifically discussing Fallout 76.
---
Literally NOBODY agrees with you.
---
I'd love if they did this. Sadly only items that they keep making or have plans to make are more "fun" or are assets from Fallout 4 that they want to charge money for 
---
I've been playing it like any other FO game and I couldn't imagine wanting to roll a second character
---
My brother lives in a house like that and we tolerate him on discord with constant broadcast, lol
---
A blue screen fatal error is the game.....I get these all the time. PS4 player.
---
Lol look at the length of that garbage I‚Äôm not gonna bother reading. You must‚Äôve taken a lot of time writing that üòÇ
---
I didnt know that, is that the same with both the ones spawned in camps and the ones bethesda placed? Im guessing it does, thanks for the heads up.
---
They will never know. Should have left a paper bag with 1 ammo or something.
---
I think it‚Äôs only as verdant as it is because no nukes were dropped super close to it. FO4‚Äôs Boston was in close proximity to a nuke, so it was heavily devoid of fauna compared to WV.
---
Have you seen all major explosions in the past? That is probably out of their league with the amount of places you can nuke.
---
No its not like that. 
---
Explosive damage currently is +100% damage. With demo expert +100% that makes it go to +200% damage. 
---
After the nerf, explosive damage is only +20%. So with demo expert that +20% is now only +40%. 
---
Equaling a 160% damage nerf. At least thats how ive heard its going to work out. 
---
I chuckle every time I hear the vendor bit call me a chump.
---
Started this one as a Male, figured there wouldn't be much difference, then I found the dress and thought doing the post apocalyptic hero in drag thing would be entertaining, cause +1 perception for wearing a dress is better than no bonus since I play a stealth vats sniper and, after a while, figured I'd change over from drag to female as the dress in drag doesn't look too overly good without a good wig and some make up...lol
---
Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam
---
I think this idea is good, and I think a good way to explain it would be to replace fissure site prime with a ‚Äúglowing sea‚Äù after awhile. Considering the vault dwellers blowing the fuck out of Appalachia is canon,  it could make sense if they wanted the world to change over time.
---
or pink beds.... that also fits to fallout and thats the reason why im making this whole post beacuse somone is making a joke with that bed i think
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
My second character is 100% more fun than my first for hundreds of reasons. 
---
Too bad, that we cannot start the game with original character after the main story is ended. This would give use more meaningful stuff to do to get better stats. But starting again from fresh is fun too :D
---
I honestly never use any of the legendary armor so I wish legendaries just dropped guns. If I'm fighting something I put PA on. If I'm just walking around I don't wear armor. What's the point of regular armor? It pales in comparison to x01.. I don't know any regular armor that can give 1000 DR to all three damage types. 
---
It hasn't changed at all since you been off.
---
I really want flags/flag poles. I'm surprised they weren't in the base game or even a reward for completing the faction quests in FO76.
---
Also logic gates so we can wire up powered doors properly.
---
Yeah should of said, two accounts, two xboxes, 10 characters. I am working on my 2nd and 3rd character builds now. I use the others to get me across the map since I am over encumbered, so got camps spread out over the map so I can just fast travel without having to walk every where.
---
Not really, but the girls have some cool outfits or just look better than guys, just a fact of life ..
---
Just a character at the end the day, really doesn't matter, spend most of my time in PA so can't even tell if it is male or female. They do look sharp in the Enclave Officers uniform though ..
---
Only time will tell, yes. But game have issues so deep in it's gameplay core, that it basicaly cant be solved by any small patch or simple fix. The roots of problems of the game is realy, realy damn deep. There are some good points to the game, like exploration, visual design, roleplay sistem, ambient storytelling... but it has horrible optimisation, hundreds of bugs, graphical glitches, overly complicated and clunky inventory and menu sistems, obsolete survival elements, unrewarding PvP, lack of voiced story, non polished melee and ranged combat. Game got realy fucking bad things in it and I am sure the worst ones will never be solved, because they are too hard and complicated to fix.
---
So, I am pessimistic about the future of F76. But who knows.
---
I just think there's a major disconnect in Bethesda. Higher ups want this game to be something it isn't: Fortnite. 
---
This is probably never gonna happen, but i feel like taking legendary weapons and armor away from survival would fix a lot of issues. Duping wouldnt matter as much because getting good weapons wouldnt be as hard by eliminating RNG legendary drops. However legendaries are clearly made to be a part of the Fallout experience and thats doubtfully gonna change. I also doubt the community would wanna get rid of legendaries for survival servers
---
I do enlisted into a gang after 190 levels of being a lone wanderer, and I say from own experience that:  
---
I will shoot on occurrence to anybody not conforming completely to the rigid set of rules of cooperative farming. A group stays somewhere and they all wave at you to join them? Join them or get wrecked.  
---
The experience of being in a PvP oriented group differs much from being a lone wanderer as you are actively searching the map for threats and rewards, and are under surveillance from other such groups.  
---
There are some griefer assholes that will be hunting low levels to deny the exp, and pursuing them even after they estabilished childish relative dominance. Currently, they have to lure somebody to get any fight. In open PvP, they will be initiating the encounters.  
---
That ain't my idea of fun, but my idea of fun ain't also being unable to shoot the guy who makes my life harder by blocking the doors and standing like an idiot, so the spots we will be occupying will be playing by our rules, or people there will have to try establish theirs.
---
Gatling? Probably PA for stablizer. 
---
I had a friend you tried saying that. When I explained that you can‚Äôt lie to Beth bc they have access to all logs. He admitted and said ‚Äúok, I duped once but I didn‚Äôt even dupe anything good!‚Äù The truth eventually comes out. 
---
Yes , you can purchase it from watoga its fairly rare though or people buy it a lot, will require a lot of server hoping.
---
Both people were upset enough to post a complaint about it. And if slug views people making posts such as this as crybabies, then slug is also a crybaby, by his own logic. There is no b and c, just a, as slug has defined a, bother users fit a by doing the same action.
---
Seems like your defending the younger age category a little too much. Makes you wonder...
---
I had 10k shotgun shells
---
10k 5.56
---
And 1000
---
Stimpacks that was traded to me for a piece of sentinel armor I found and I‚Äôm apparently banned indefinitely stupid game company release a broken game that people can exploit and trade items and anyone who has a lot of items gets banned,
---
It says that my ticket is closed as duplicate if anyone would care to shed some light on what that means?
---
Take my downvote
---
This happened to me on xbox...luckily I just lost a piece of armor that I re crafted...
---
That's very cool, and also broken. :/
---
Lol right. I'm just so closed minded. I never knew anyone could like different stuff. Now I see though, because of your comment. It changed me
---
Did you get it from an event? I‚Äôve never seen one don‚Äôt even know what it looks like
---
THAT was exacly my thinking .... am i playing fortnite fallout now.... ? I can bet that more people would buy a skin for atom bomb explosion to make it look green or whatever than this...thank you for helping me make a point here
---
That‚Äôs like 100% accuracy 45% of the time! I like those odds! 
---
Yes you can I have all the plans bought it from people
---
Yes, you can acquire the plans from vendors.  The two in Grafton tend to be a good source of this.  I didn't server hop and managed to acquire them in a couple days.
---
Well, for us old farts they also put in the "Ouch, my arthritis" function, where you'll be walking along minding your own business and all of a sudden you'll make the ouch noise for no reason. Yeah, that's just aging pains.
---
Yeah, i understand what your conveying, I'm just pointing out that logically, your wrong. You told him to learn logic...but you don't understand it yourself. 
---
As a person, you are better then that. Just saying, i won't be commenting further. Have a good day.
---
Ok look ma bwai you need to grow up and grow up quick. Some guys like girls. Some girls like guys. Some guys like guys. Some girls like girls. And both sometimes like both. It‚Äôs fine. This is how the world is. Get over it. A 20 woman plays her character as a 40yo male. Not strange to you. But 20 yo man plays his character as a 40 yo female and suddenly that shouts creep?what happend to equality? World ain‚Äôt never gona change with narrow minded people like your self. 
---
Pretty much. All of their decisions to this point just don't make sense. This game could've been something truly amazing, but they keep deciding to do random projects only a few people are asking for. It's almost like they're making what they want Fallout to be: Skyrim with guns.
---
I've also played sinve the "B.E.T.A" release. But I've played as you have the entire time. Slow, lots of sneak and exploration. No fast travel, fairly basic weapons and armor, NO power armor although I've collected 10 chassis with varying sets of armor. Finding a million plans and making "good gear" in my eyes. I'm only level 33! This is my only character. 
---
I figured since the game released in it's state of weirdness, I would take it very slow. Hoping the game would slowly improve, and it has. My damage resistance is only around 80 with the way I've crafted. My armor is ALL deep pocketed aside from my legs, only pocketed. Fair carry weight IMO at 250. Have 2 lucky weapons, the elusive handmade(found legit), and a double(capacity) explosive shotgun, no TS. 
---
I rarely team up, usually only to help players by invitation for fast travel. I've had the opportunity to help higher level players. I scavenge intensely, so I find/have a ton of ammo I don't use yet. So I drop .50 MG ammo, 5mm, .44, 2mm, fusion cells, cores and plasma. 
---
When encountering lower level players I drop all my extra plans and recipes. I'll drop 5 Stims, 5 RadX, 5 Radaway, 1 MedX and 2 Phsyco. 
---
The game is lonely and sad. But I wouldn't expect the apocalypse to be anything different. The storytelling is good, the scenes encountered are interesting. I thoroughly enjoy 76. See you out there!
---
Forgot wood armor existed. Such a missed opportunity for a "wood elf" mutants.
---
I guess you assume all those cavaliers items were legit too? 
---
Character not Account Names
---
Helmets with Stats
---
All weapons be viable (a flaming pitchfork, a spiked baseball bat should be just as viable as a super sledge!)
---
Text Chat
---
What about us that dont use PA? 
---
I would really hate to have my stuff stolen. Tbh I like it when people leave me alone. 
---
No just found it in that building in whitesprings with the car park.
---
Who said I have a problem with it? I'm just trying to understand why it's so popular. Not my fault everyone decides to be an ass about it. 
---
Also, jesus 2 accounts on 2 consoles. I wish I had the time
---
Thanks everybody for letting me know :)
---
Thanks. I think I‚Äôll replace it as soon as a better piece comes along. 
---
Also, this game should be ftp.
---
Queens have been bugging out, flying south, off the bottom of the map never to return.
---
Yeah I'm on ps4 and lag out every half hour suddenly with no issues with psn or my router so I think Bethesda did another uh-oh
---
Naming and shaming is not allowed i don't think 
---
witch hunting is illegal
---
It automatically switches between Team and Area mode.  What fails is when people just leave themselves set to Area so they cannot reply to someone with Auto.  Honestly if more people just used Auto, they wouldn't have issues. 
---
Nice looks great, like the idea of using the half floors for a balcony around the outside of the house.
---
"Flipping back and forth from passive mode"...
---
...you realize that only affects his damage to others, not the damage you can do to him, right? If he's got passive on, you can still shoot him.
---
It helps to better control your character, how he/she connects to the environment and most importantly it look more spectacular than first person. More to that first person has "flying hands" syndrome and lack some of the feelings IRL which help you with situational awareness, for example, you feel where your legs are etc.
---
wow thanks I will look for it there.
---
The thing is, i felt this way before yesterday my experience was ok, i got disconnects and bugs but never this many in such a short period. My friends had it worse than me before this thats why they gave up. When it works the game is ok, but when its bad, its literally unplayable and infuriating.
---
Also; destroying camps, one shotting mobs, kiting SBs to low level areas, camping early areas.
---
Plenty that I'm forgetting. They're not as common as you'd expect from this sub though.
---
It's very easy to just block them and go about your merry way
---
Do you just like die a bunch when you fight deathclaws and scorchbeast?
---
 Yeah my explosive shotty was killing me more than anyone else till I got the BOS Heavy and the 3 Fireproof perks. Now it barely hurts me when I blow stuff away right in front of me. Dense will be sweet.
---
If they didn't want it played like an mmo then they should not have put in MMO elemets like leveled gear, I wanted to take my time and savor the story but I also didn't want quest reward gear to not be max level so I ended up grinding to 50 fast so I could use all the gear I wanted to 
---
Are you saying I should've stopped clicking on that grenade because I was supposed to feel bad about doing it? 
---
The one thing I miss that has been a trend in every Fallout game......is my story.....I have none. Other than going forth to build anew, that's it, but instead we blow everything up and kill everything to gain junk, mods, weapons and armour. What happened to our story. I'd feel more involved if I had one. By the way, I've played every Fallout and Wasteland game, and I'm of that generation that was at the birth of computers. This game, I'm sorry to say, was marketed at the younger "shoot and run" generation, instead of the diehard Fallout fans like me. 
---
It's sad, because I have a room in my house that's basically a shrine to Bethesda. I have every special, bobbleheads, guides, books, lunch boxes, you name it, I've spent good money with Bethesda, but they aren't thinking of the old faithfuls like me, they want to make a quick buck, but Bethesda, you forget, we pay for the kids to buy these games too. Think again and fix it please.
---
I think if they knew their player base, a pve ONLY server would come before a new pvp mode.
---
1000%. Please and thank you
---
I've never seen one again and I've had it since just before Christmas. That's why I thought it might be rare.
---
Just block and log out.
---
Lol I never said it wasnt okay. I'd also bet I'm older than you. And lose the fake accent. Some of us did grow up in texas watching stone cold steve Austin come out to chig beer and whoop ass. 
---
Sounded real
---
Also the fact loot can be level.locked forcing you to grind to use gear that you want to 
---
Gear and cosmetics that reflect the play style, skins for weapons and camp items similar from nuka world.
---
A section of the map that incentivises exploration through strong mobs and world loot that is a free fire zone. No slap damage and passifist mode turned off. Maybe in the mountains where the raiders originated.
---
Meaningful factions that have specific reputation gains through play, leading to unlocking cosmetic options that identify one's self as belonging to said faction. This system would lead to rival factions like raiders vs regulators seeking one another out and fighting to increase thier reputations. Maybe with some kind of territory system to claim locations or workshops (flags or spray paint). 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call that griefing lol
---
I can't even begin to tell you how much a 2nd character has helped me out with this. Used to play GTA, same deal, you can start 2 missions quests etc. That's all I have is time, not healthy but hey .. saw similar posts about this on the GTA forums and males shouldn't be playing as females, but got scammed or something was funny ..
---
Maybe find some regenerating armor pieces, they heal you up when your not in combat so kinda gives off idea that your like patching your self up through the armor or whatever if you know what I mean 
---

they pretty much said that they are working on updating PVE as well. go look at the community managers post.
---
PVE is not abandoned.
---
Boo
---
Does anyone know if you can report someone for being a bellend? 
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre referring to lol was there a glitch involving grenades?
---
Im glad that they are communicating a bit more on here and it seems they do listen to our feed back but it does feel like its not being implemented very fast. The game requires a lot more patches I feel, hopefully it wont be too little too late as i do think they have the base for a potentially very good game.
---
I will keep you in mind. I do a lot of whitesprings runs and have sold multiple 3* sets to vendors because I thought it was trash and not even worth the trade offer. I'm learning that there is something for everyone in this game. 
---
That link/post only shows stats at the minimum level required to use the specified power armor.
---
Can Do is so beyond good for a lvl 1 perk. A necessity.
---
As a medic you should use auto stim/lifesaving 2* with vanguard bc you need high total health also should probably use combat armor
---
Give me your best offer then :) 
---
I sometimes have that issue with my Anti Armor Handmade modded with Hair Trigger.  I can put three rounds into a critter almost as fast as an Automatic receiver, but the grey bar refills when I let off the trigger.  When I see that I usually slow down my shots to let the grey bar slide over before I take the next shot.

---
Fair or just is besides the point. What is not besides the point is making the game as enjoyable as it is possible, to as many people as it is possible - at least from Bethesda point of view, which tied continuous enjoyment to their profits.  
---
I do wish the game well, and I seen what happens when you put bunch of guys who researched the environment extensively to the same box as those who didn't, and then you strip them of equipment and characters. Researches eat everything they meet for first three weeks just to be sure they will not be slowed down.  
---
I don't think I need any additional advantages. I don't need other people like me need such ones. I do think a server wipe will be an extreme advantage for our bunch, compared to the benefit for casuals. My agenda is not to protect my character and my items. I can start fresh just to prove the point. My agenda is to make the game as enjoyable for the majority of the casuals, because I need happy casuals if I am to have any competitors anytime soon.  
---
Pointing at case studies by pretty much every other online game ever, the proper way to manage broken meta gear is to demote it by implementing new gear that outclasses the old meta.
---
With the blood spatters? Like 5% of the time it‚Äôs a punjii board but most of the time I see nothing. 
---
I also have a bloodied super sledge with 40% reduce swing speed
---
The crossbow is a good lightweight, silenced weapon. Mods that increase critical damage or cripple limbs would be nice for snipers. 
---
I‚Äôll take it off you 
---
Oh you play them at the same time? That's pretty dope. I play on pc and have been wishing I had a way to play a second character at the same time since my buddies have stopped playing all the time. 
---
Auto stim and life saving as extra effect on vanguard armor
---
How do you place 12 turrets without cheating?
---
Because of this I'm done when I pop the Platinum trophy at level 100. 
---
What the other commenter said. 
---
PsPro. I rarely 'disconnect', i suffer from severe game crashes. Entire game crashes to "desktop".
---
Nope, I made it all up. Have a great Sunday 
---
If you can and your on Xbox I'd love to give you the materials for a lvl 50 ultricite and calibrated shocks at 200 percent if you have fix it good 
---
That isn‚Äôt true of events and ‚Äòdailies.‚Äô
---
This reminds me of those anti-piracy ads you would see at theaters before the previews 
---
"YOU WOULDN'T DOWNLOAD A CAR WOULD YOU!?" Fuck yes I would download a car, who the fuck wouldn't?
---
Maxed out 
---
You know what? You suck!
---
Thank god 
---
My fault the band aid thing was someone replying to the comment I made to you I thought it was you.
---
You are talking about bugs they not fixing aren't simple so that's why they taking time I was saying modders already fixed them for free which is why I mentioned Bethesda being billion dollar company probably not a billion but a multi millon.
---
Nice try buddy but I'm 26 and your are defending a company that makes millions that modders fixed there shit for the past 20 years. That's called a shill.
---
I mean, just minding your own business walking around. The weird small damage that has no visible cause. 
---
Yeah I can do that. Would you throw in some caps too?
---
I'm happy to trade what do you have?
---
Yeah what‚Äôs with the longer loading times. It goes to a long load screen, then to a black screen for a few seconds then back to another long load screen
---
I did that but for some reason I kept being put back on the same server! I eventually hit block enough so they showed up blocked but they were still on my map and running around!
---
logic gates ... ? 
---
I don't care, I will call out trolls all day and put them on blast! 
---
Added you. I can offers caps 
---
Got a 3* instigating pickaxe.
---
If you‚Äôre just walking around why wouldn‚Äôt you wear armor if it has perks like increased carry weight etc? 
---
Yeah I somehow managed to sneak while they were distracted going after another mob and lost them, didn't realize water stops them tho!
---
I agree with your post for the most part, but it's not just younger audiences duping. I believe the main problem with players who duplicate items is that they feel powerful for doing so, like you mentioned. At the same time, people are selling their duplicated items on EBay and other sites. This is something I highly doubt most kids are capable of, for that you'd need an immature adult. 
---
I don't think we can blame abuse of a bug entirely on one age group, because it isn't about age. It's about selfishness, immaturity, and ignorance of the communities that want to play their game. 
---
The Charleston Harold has a lot of fans and typewriters. I can usually find a good amount just running through Whitesprings (the hotel and adjacent buildings)
---
Because we are already starting now. They already stated what they are doing in the last Inside The Vault. We are bringing characters over. Get yours started now. If you are waiting for a fresh character, it isn't happening. 
---
I don't care, I will call out trolls all day and put them on blast! Being an asshole bully should be illegal! 
---
If you remove wood armor legendaries, then what else am I going to get besides ultracite explosive vents?
---
Sweet cheers for that ill look onto finding pieces
---
What Are you playing on if psn I could try to help 
---
I honestly have no idea what they go for, so you're better off telling me what you want for it and I'll tell you if I have enough caps 
---
I have a card that I can put on for +40 carry weight if I become overencumbered, which happens less because I don't have like 50 pounds of regular armor to carry, just a 10 pound power armor chassis. 
---
They're all over the place, once you look for them. There's at least one bunker that has an entire grow room full of them, and a watch tower that has them on nearly every landing. They're also inside the agricultural building at Flatwoods.
---
Sugar Grove is a good run through for screws, springs, and gears. 
---
No craters was a bummer...the world just gets a filter and slight modifications to enemy sliders resulting in the increased difficulty.
---
Used for advanced power connections, using Boolean logic gates. XOR NOR OR etc
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Logic\_gate](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Logic_gate)

And with 3D printers you can
---
Please add cryo bolts at the very least
---
This could be such a great weapon
---
I‚Äôve been busy. 
---
have them duplicated by a common bug that duplicates your structures after you move camp
---
You can tag screws for search, too, but I forgot how you do that. Hand cuffs, toy cars and trucks, "Portable Fuel Tank" has a screw, typewriters, desk fans, Giddy up Buttercup, regular "Clipboards", not battered ones
---
generic standard armors versus standard PA the stats on PA is by far superior
---
now legendarys and such help but were talking standard versus standard and when it comes to radiation defenses PA beats everything but hazmat suit which isn't combat oriented 
---
Yeah dude, just report and then list the reason why you're a little bitch lol
---
2,5k caps and it‚Äôs yours
---
i'm on Xbox 1 sadly dude. 
---
I have an Instigating Gauss Rifle if you'd like to trade
---
So one big Pro to every faction. Sounds great. Some have armor already, but that pales to the power of a nuke...I agree!
---
The ideas not the spelling dip shit.
---
Some terminals allow the area robobrains to be disabled (i.e. Chief Engineer), which can help, though how I usually do it is to just disable targeting parameters on the turrets for a minute to clear out the enemies, then deactivate turrets and make my way through.
---
Lol What accent is that? 
---
You can't add more perks over 15, but you do get the effects of whatever special category you're getting.
---
Yeah but a deep pocketed piece of trapper armor weighs like 4 pounds and gives you an increase of 10 so you‚Äôre always at least 6 pounds ahead. I just don‚Äôt get how that‚Äôs a negative 
---
I only have like 1500 caps I could get more from daily vendors but I could give you a weapon I've been farming for it I don't need it since I changed my build but I do have the weapon if you would want it depending on your build 
---
Hahaha I'll pass on the pickaxe but would be willing to talk caps I'm really hoping a legendary gauss of some capacity
---
Now i got you ... good and simple idea . Added
---
Ok also you should go for assassins as well if its PvP and try to get a medics gun that has good vats perks on it
---
Happened to me yesterday. RIP x-01 bright lamp helmet
---
Right there with you man.  Im 43.  Was playing with a few guys last night in their 20's.  We were discussing what needed to be fiexd and their ideas were so out of the realm of what our generation is looking for its going to be impossible to find a middle ground.  All they want is OP gear and instant gratification.   They would rather buy everything and be maxed out on day 1 vs spending time playing and exploring the features of the game.  
---
There are already light bulbs that can have their color changed. You just need the assorted lights blueprint
---
Guy kept hitting me with a cane while I was in a trade screen, literally the most annoying shit! Then kept showing up even after I blocked him. Not sure if your aware but the game is full of bugs and a lot of functionality like blocking and friend's list stuff is broken!
---
So you‚Äôd commit a felony if the effort was very minimal? But where would you draw the line? What if more crime worked this way? What if it was possible to ‚Äúdelete‚Äù real people, would you do it?
---
What console? I have like 500 or so I oukd part with some.
---
Been trying to find a link for it but can't seem to find it.  There's some law that was passed that affects game developers to incentivise the inclusion of other methods of communication since apparently some people can't use text chat(?) and that is why the voice chat is on by default and not a lot of focus or resources on text chat.
---
I'm no mathematician, but I checked the math and this is correct
---
Lol what accent is that? You said you didn‚Äôt watch it ? What kind of lie are you making up now lol
---
That‚Äôd be great, if you have a TS Ultracite or laser, I‚Äôd appreciate. If not, just a few caps is good. Not looking for thousands or anything
---
&gt;...I was saying modders already fixed them for free...
---
What Fallout 76 bugs did modders already fix for free?
---
&gt;Nice try buddy but I'm 26...
---
Could've fooled me.
---
Just to be clear so i can have every colour stable like just blue or just red ?
---
A lot of things are Bethesdas fault.
---
Playing very slow. And despite misgivings, I jumped back in today. And really enjoyed exploring.
---
Bitch? Little? Did you just assume my height and gender? 
---
The had this problem in Fallout 4 too. The solution is simple. Add a plain text view that we can toggle similar to how it‚Äôs done in Uncharted. Or if they wanted something more unique, hire voice actors to read the notes to give some more connection to the past.
---
Crashes have nothing to do with internet that's what most of us have issues with I don't get server disconnects often but crashes all the time on a xbox one x and pc.
---
Interesting. are there any other effects?
---
a roll of TP would have been classic 
---
Whats ur gt?.....I can show ya how "nothing" happensüòÅ
---
Well, that sucks. What a load of bs.
---
Yeah its a shame really.
---
For this game its swung out of control too. Many ppl think every time they dc its a duper and every time they die in one shot they must be a duper and whenever a high level and a low level are in proximity of each other they must be duping.
---
Reality is ppl got shit connections, the netcode is bad, they have no clue about pvp perks and heaven forbid ppl plsy video games together.
---
How many caps I might have a TS laser maybe even explosive also a heavy Gatling laser as well I gotta look at again tho tbh 
---
I'm pretty sure anyone can be a bitch. Example A: you
---
I'm hovering around 2000 last I remember but I can log in around 3 hours from now.
---
Can you please add me, my PSN is dtb7591, and I'll see you soon?
---
Thank you very much, you do the same. 
---
Was probably me, I do that all the time.  Take the dogs out or get a beer or something 
---
Sweet! Thanks man
---
Black Titanium can be mined if you take control of the Gorge Junkyard Workstation.  I got more than I needed in one evening.  Was kind of surprised how easy it was.  Now I need to find the 60 screws!
---
"Ain't" is southern. And the only real state worth anything in the south is Texas. I said I dont watch it now, but I did when I was a kid. 
---
Have a quad gauss rifle
---
Lol and your nearly 30??? Fuuuk man. I feel bad for you son. 
---
I have all the plans for t51 except a leg. 500 each. I also have the jetpack plans for 4k
---
How much caps tho
---
Just play FO4 again. That's what a lot of people are doing.
---
list of mods and what they add including SPECIAL buffs.

---
they add on to your current total, so if you have 15 str and have motion assist servos you would get +2 str, totaling in +17
---
I would‚Äôve loved this game so much more if PVP wasn‚Äôt cradling and was actually like in should be in a wasteland where you fight for survival.
---
nah its cool i've got a trigger hard manic of a best mate for the heavy gunning its my job to make sur he doesn't blow himself up XD plus i like healing so handy for Queen and stuff so i look forward to squading with ppl
---
I m not sure i ll still be on in 3 hours, if i ain‚Äôt message me i might be able to do a quick log in for the trade
---
I'm on ps4 and will be on in like 3 or 4 hours. If you're still looking, let me know. My psn: wowmuchtough 
---
Yes. But I have forgotten. I'm not able to log in for 3 hours. When can you log in? My PSN is dtb7591
---
I think most of these should just be stuff you can make without spending atoms on it
---
Sure, I could do that. I might fire it up just to practice with the components, but that's not an answer to why this stuff doesn't exist in FO76.
---
That, and I'd really like to be able to do this stuff in FO76 and share it with other players. 
---
While most people I have chatted with are super cool sometimes I just don't want to talk or can't talk! 
---
I thinking really low, but I would really appreciate the weapon if you‚Äôd look
---
If you say so. I‚Äôm about as southern as it gets where I come from. I guess in your small brain America is the only place in the world right? Shoulda stayed in school bwai. 
---
I always run in when I see someone in a silo.  I‚Äôm impatient and I just want to see the nukes fly.  It saves me some bullets.
---
Hell, I run in with extra keycards and codes ready just in case they haven‚Äôt done it before.  
---
I've enjoyed the game itself. I've been annoyed with crashes, disconnects and players lower than lvl 20 coming in swarms to the SBQ fight and not contributing anything.
---
Okok thank u very much
---
Man I love fallout and this is a dumpster fire that wont got out and ppl keep defending the shit out of it like nothing or very little is wrong this game is so empty compared to all other Bethesda game studios games. The bugs are just the accelerant to the fire. But that's just an opinion I've formed through 2 100+ characters on pc and xbox.
---
Thanks, I'm not really sure what is because some people get triggered way to easily.
---
It's 4:45am, I just got up for the dog but I'll quickly come and log in now because fear of loss is the main driver of commerce :)
---
I only have 1500 caps ill sell some stuff so i could get enough for at least the plans
---
Id like to see one in burning mine, the one in the Ash heap. Requires special flame retardant gear (fire breathers set). 
---
Also unlocks new areas of the mine all the way down to some sort of boss monster. Super high level mobs and the reward is a set loot table. Maybe put modifiers on that affect the amount of stims you can bring with you and other such limitations. 
---
Ahah i ve got the same sickness lol
---
Yeah all the time, I can share the digital copy and live subscription so only really costs me a 2nd xbox. I have a. projector and a smaller 43 screen. So many things I can do, I can watch the map for trolls etc. Both are fairly levelled up Level 95 and 81. 
---
Can you setup a 2nd maybe cheaper PC or something ? I assume you can't run a virtual env on your machine and have 2 running ?
---
I'm putting off starting a new character for this reason. I lost a lot of the story by giving up reading because it was too hard to see.
---
Ok so my advice is get up to lv45 or 50 before doing a lot of workshop stuff so you can defend it'll be a lot more fun that way
---
Of course! Hopefully Bethesda will eventually realize it too
---
Yeah I would download a car if that was possible in a heartbeat, that sounds like some incredible Star trek shit to me.
---
Downvoted because you used ‚Äúthere‚Äù instead of their.
---
Whitesprings is typically the Go-To. You can also get Flux as a reward from defeating the Scorch Queen.
---
Thanks, been aging my whole life so far
---
We found recently hit Monongh, just to the east of the city. Had some cobalt, yellow, and a third one(cant recall if it was violet or crimson).
---
Sure man I have of I got one I'll be sure to give you. I know the heavy Gatling laser give TSE and 250 resistance while reloading the rifle I gotta look at again I don't know it off the top of my head 
---
True Some of them i agree should be from basic events/quests/factions
---
But we dont have them... but the topic says clear those items are missing.... so maybe devs will add them later on free of charge and even so... you prefer pink beds or those items that i have gathered here ? hmmm ?
---
I laughed quite hard at the truth of this post. You are most certainly correct in your comparison.
---
I wasn't sure wether it was on other platforms as well. I'm just glad in the end it was an easy fix and wanted to let others know about it before they think about doing a reinstall. Which I found out later deleted all my photos. 
---
I can see why you say that. 
---
Perhaps a realism mode would be preferred. 
---
"Hardcore" mode as it is. 
---
I want both. I want to play the game for leisure but opting in to a higher difficulty would be good.
---
Pretty sure I have all of those, how about 2500 caps for the lot?
---
Does anyone actually use the syringer? Worst weapon of FO4 and 76! 
---
It's all a simulation. Every group is built on the myths that the future groups tell you. More than likely they're related. 
---
ok so for the medic's weapon what ideal effects would be good on one? 
---
 Mine is on. I talk to people, yell at em' sometimes and its always a nice surprise to get an answer. ;)
---
High five jcarter315 if you are playing on ps4 please let me know
---
I got a LEAD PIPE!
---
I see you are just as pleasant as I thought you'd be
---
Are you 14? Cause you seem slow. 
---
Well there are already some quality of life mods for 76 but I didn't mean fallout 76 cause Bethesda won't let ppl mod it easily like all there other games. Modder fix the shit out of bugs for every Bethesda game only reason it's not happening here is cause they wont let them because of the servers so modders can't make this game great like they have since morrowind. 
---
I'm done talking cause it sounds like I'm talking to a Bethesda fanboy. 
---
there was a vault like that in.... new vegas, i think, as well? someone building those vaults really liked the potential for carnivore plants, i guess.
---
On oc and getting constant server disconnects 
---
Just sent in another ticket, the first ticket was approved for my replacement, then second got me the atoms quicker
---
I agree except for the one shotting part. To be more realistic all damage would have to be increased a lot. One head shot from any gun should kill anyone.
---
Arghhh, need kill, come out now blue suit!
---
We need a Mothmantician!
---
The only way to get back the Fire Breathers gear (as well as the Responders police and paramedic clothes) is to check vendors to see if someone possibly sold them off, or maybe find someone willing to part with theirs. Good luck with that though, I've been looking for the paramedic uniform for two weeks now. The game really should give you the plans to craft them again later.
---
As per [Ella's terminal in Harper's Ferry](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Harpers_Ferry_terminals#Vault_94_3) the GECK is _at least_ responsible for why the Mire is covered in fog often. It likely is the reason for all the overgrowth, too, since it was used by Vault 94
---
From the perspective of insurance companies, it would be Bethesda's fault for not "locking the front door," as it were. Good luck getting a claim on a theft if you didn't take reasonable measures to protect your stuff.
---
That being said, dupers saying it's Bethesda's fault that they are duping is ridiculous. If the glitch was something that just happened through the course of normal gameplay, they'd be correct, but they have to go out of their way to *exploit* the glitch for their own benefit.
---
So, no, it's not Bethesda's fault that you're exploiting a glitch, but it's not your fault the glitch is there in the first place. 
---
If you are naked.  If you are geared up and in PA. No.
---
For me I think it is to late and all the new ppl they pulled in with the multiplayer probably have a bad taste in their mouth now. I think now the only thing that will get me playing consistently now is private servers so modders can do their thing.
---
Better not take the stuff off my shelves!
---
Oh wait..
---
Oh and whenever you do see my inventory don't freak out just to let you know I've been farming the queen like it isn't nothing and everything I got is from here I'm not gonna wear my armour I'll be having deep pocketed forest scout armor on
---
My GT is Jacob Rules 15 shoot me a text and I'll invite ya 
---
It's almost like telling people that a product is finished and ready for sale, then releasing pre beta version and going very very quite whilst fixing on or two broken features every few weeks.
---
Dupers are bad, Bethesda is worse. They new items could be duped and ignored it.
---
I‚Äôm adding you. We are running right now. You can join us. 
---
Watoga is no man's land. Seriously watch out for non brotherhood of steel robots out there üòÇ
---
Hopefully, a lot of things like that will show up in future DLC.
---
Oh no I was insulted on the internet by a 10 year old what will I do.
---
Just farmed a set for some dude a few days ago, it's on my route. I'll slap a set together and hand it over later today/tomorrow if you want.
---
Honestly, that is my favorite line from any vendor bot.
---
Level 4 turrets take up 10% 
---
That‚Äôs circular logic. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt because we can‚Äôt.‚Äù OP is suggesting that Bethesda needs to change how it works.
---
The theater ads say "You wouldn't *steal* a car", not "download.
---
When you try to build something and like compnents there is an option to tag them, also if you have a component in junk you can examine it and tag there as well.
---
Nuke the queen and have green thumb. The pitcher plants aren't everywhere so it's best to nuke the whole area instead of just the fissure. You can craft a extra violent after and you get a lot of flux after she's dead as reward
---
Just realised it was your reply to someone else about the Targeting mod that I read. Thank you so much. I don't think I would of ever figured it out on my own.
---
&gt; would of
---
You probably meant **"would've"**! It's a contraction of "would have".

Awesome!!! Thank you so much!! Just message me over xbox when u do!!
---
You get your other profile to upvote those or what? 
---
the trade interface in this game is a complete joke. I was playing MMORPG's 15 years ago with far better ones.
---
I'll do what have for that. Give me a few to get on, painfulkilla187 if you could send me a message I'll join off it when I get on
---
I've used both builds maxxed out and evidence speaks for itself.
---
I was keeping my TSE for queen killing but it doesn't compare.
---
The main reason I think furious is superior is the fact that it's accurate in vats and takes advantage of concentrated fire perk and you can target specific body parts, you just can't do that with TSE  weapons.
---
Do you remember if those things were in FO4 vanilla, or if they came with DLC? If it's the latter, maybe I just need to be patient. üòâ
---
Just seems like since it already existed, and since they brought in *some* of it, that they could have brought in *all* of it.
---
We don't know the inner workings of the game, though, so maybe there were some good reasons for not including it all with on launch. 
---
 Now I am old. I'm 72 and the game is delicious cake. An absolute blast and immense fun.
---
 Scorchbeasts are an amazing monster and I love fighting them. My level 45 trolled a level 68 one out of, I believe, the most northern fissure and beat her down to 10% then she ran away back to her fissure. He put down 2 at Whitesprings Service Entrance but of course the staff got in on those.
---
 The best Fallout game so far. I have thousands of hours in the previous ones.
---
They did take reasonable measures. They put it in the TOS. Also this is apples and oranges.
---
I hear over at r/fallout, there‚Äôs a draft system and once per day a lucky hater gets to go downvote everything in the name of the Revolution. 
---
* 4 armor pieces have assassin for -32% total damage
---
* 5 armor pieces have sentinel for -75% total damage
---
* armor chest piece has dense mod, dont know the exact reduction but ive heard it is -66% explosion damage
---
* fireproof 3 for -45% explosion damage
---
* dodgy perk for -30% total damage  
---
Eats most TSE shots for less then 3 hp per hit when standing still, unless they are using bobbleheads
---
Yeah definitely. I think PVP and raiding is needed especially late game. People are going to get bored of just doing quest fighting bosses and getting loot and should be able to have the chance to have fun with PVP and some kind of raiding.
---
Ye it's the same with molerats :P
---
Try to outrun them without marsupial, jetpack 1-2min later they are most likely still aggro'd.
---
It‚Äôs especially tedious if you have Marsupial and you venture into the trench riddled SouthEast of the map. And start creating explosions with explosive vents.
---
Well, if they're commenting based on the title rather than the content, then they're just creating spam and looking for an excuse to compare two totally unrelated games. It doesn't make sense to bring up red dead when you have other games that have come out or had betas since- at least not for people to compare that game to fallout **100% of the time**, and never something else.
---
For you to say this is natural, the comparing of two games that have absolutely nothing to do with each other.. finding any excuse to bring up this particular game- why don't we see any other game being brought up, at all in the same way? ü§î
---
That's the point, this isn't a natural phenomenon, that's why you don't see someone bringing up red dead I'm anthem comments, or anthem in fallout comments (even though comparing how another games demo/beta release went would make sense rather than continuing to compare an unrelated game that's months old now)..
---
Arguing that it makes sense to continually and consistently see a cowboy game compared with fallout 3+ months after both were released and **never see another game compared** is the kind of useful idiot argument I'm talking about. You'd just have to do mental gymnastics trying to make a case for something that very obviously doesn't make sense- at least not at the sheer scale this excessive phenomenon keeps occurring.
---
So sure, keep trying to convince me it totally makes sense, when this doesn't repeatedly happen with just about any game with any other game, over and over.. You putting in effort to try to legitimate an ultimately illegitimate argument only lends to the very point I'm making. The argument belongs in the past when the argument was relevant- the longer we are from release, the less the argument even matters.
---
I very much dislike the Bethesda ones in general, not because they are bad but because only like five or six of mine get shown through a single playthrough. 
---
Will do.
---
BOS plans are sold at Grafton Station. May take several server hops to get all of them though.
---
I see we're being down voted by the younger generation......just proves my point really 
---
That‚Äôs an amazing idea, hopefully they make something like this 
---
I've only got 2000. 
---
The tagline was basically fallout with friends.
---
But I aint got no damn friends.
---
So I wanna kill peoples friends and not lose caps or sleep over it. 
---
We need less griefing and more raidering
---
Pretty much all the other vendor lines are okay or nice but god I hate that one. It feels it's really overdone and I just wish I could kill him to make him shut up.
---
You got a chat or party I‚Äôm on your game 
---
All apologies if my question makes no sense :p
---
And people are super vulnerable to bleeding, guess it's okay to go ahead and just stab away.
---
 LOL. BOS Heavy Combat and 3 perks in Fireproof and I went from blowing myself up all the time to exploding stuff right in front of me with very little damage. 
---
Ahhh ok, then somehow place 12 of them without cheating. Got it.
---
Yeah they should tank up PA but otherwise drop the bullet sponge crap. And add some ballistic armor for your head.
---
I think there are two distinctly different groups of players when it comes to 76.
---
There are players who play the game more-or-less like a traditional Fallout.  They scavenge, they explore.  Most importantly, they adapt.  They take whatever the game throws at them and make it their own.  If they have to tuck tail and run from a Scorchbeast, so be it.  If they have to make do with a sub-par gun or armor, that's part of the fun.  You can't always get what you want, but you get what you need, etc.
---
Then, there are the players who have zero patience for that.  They want top-of-the-line gear for minimum effort, up to and including paying real money for it.  And what do they do when they get it?  They'll sit there for hours grinding at Whitesprings.  They tend to burn out pretty quickly because, well, they never stopped to smell the roses.  They don't care about roses.  They were obsessed with being "the best" in a world where, quite frankly, no one cares.  So, they eventually turn to raiding and harassing other players for kicks.  Those nerds who refused to play *their* game.  And even that is fleeting.
---
Here's the problem: It's that latter camp that seems to command the attention of these developers.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afz7u8/customization_discussion/?st=JRF77Y3S&amp;sh=ac79ef71 
---
here are my suggestions for it sorry it‚Äôs too long to type...
---
Whole not having a text chat and mic only, was cool experiment, but if they actually bothered to analyze design choices, they would knew that having no text chat is not going to work, already alone from point where there are people who can't speak or can't hear. 
---
...And same thing is happening again. They don't analyze, they don't think how things should work, they just trow randoms things and hope it works. I am talking about their new mode. Having more PVP aint bad, but the way they are doing it just shows how little they think through design choices, if at all. 
---
Thx for the reply, but its soooooo odd that my legendary weapons are nerfed. My explosive Gatlin plasma has base damage of 48!
---
Takes 1k rounds to kill a SB lvl 50 while it stuck on the ground and I'm in its face...any idea why?
---
My 2 shot gauss rifle is decent with a base of 280, but it's still weak relative to my melee sledge which does similar base.
---
????
---
This is one of those games, no reason to come back. Until they forcibly add more trophies/achievements through DLC haha
---
Yes!
---
You can call me a 10 year old all you want but you spell like a 5 year old and act like a 3 year old, grow up
---
yeah, i'm with you. i like the stories i'm reading just fine, but they're all dead stories that my character can't affect. with intelligible ghouls, at least there'd be some potential to be helpful, or to participate in drama as it unfolds.
---
If I want to use my mic or not, that's my choice.  You can't expect people to adhere to your own wishes for the game.
---
Home depot.
---
Seems I‚Äôm lone wandering it!
---
Thats kinda disappointing 
---
Ugh man I'm on now 
---
That's the irritating thing for me because I didn't have an issue with FO4.
---
We found a seller last night. I'm sorry
---
that's exactly what I meant
---
Many other weightless armor is also 0 weight. Or with pocketed even less.
---
Do you play on PC? 
---
Shrouded mod gives you: faster movement speed while sneaking, reduced weight of armor piece, and less visibility while in dark areas (essentially better chance to avoid detection). 
---
it has potential on of its mod can reduce damage resistance by 25%
---
but it's bugged so it is still useless
---
Well for some of us that's all we carry. I have a bloodied power fist but it one shots things too. It's not intentionally, that's why when I find a legendary I try to gun bash it unless I see its health dropping too fast
---
I don't even do this event anymore for that exact reason.
---
I'm diggin that idea 
---
 Yup. I can't work a controller. ;)
---
Unless you're a melee character.  Then you might consider waiting to level 50 so you can get a max level All Rise. 
---
100% agree. But I guess that‚Äôs what games like rust are for. Just wish there was an actual PvP system cause fallout would be awesome that way.
---
Regular armor is weaker but doesn't make you constantly die.
---
The part of the code of the game that defines our characters may well be 1000+ lines, maybe a several thousand, in fact. OF course, your character isn't an isolated object, there is a huge amount of code that allows it to interact with the world, which is basically the whole game code.
---
Code usually does not change once it's running, only values stored in memory (or elsewhere) do.
---
What perks would you recommend
---
Do they know tho?
---
If you message me on here ill most likely always be down to run it
---
Yeah these guys piss everyone off I'm sure. Usually just leave the server when I see these guys come into an event area.
---
Day before yesterday, did you happen to give up Lakeside Cabins to 2-3 players because you were singing off for the night? 
---
Thank uuuu‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§today maybe i can't but tomorrow maybe
---
#Me too, I loved that gun
---
I'm littlebiggughy
---
It's really bad when you die in a nuke zone while encumbered. Can't fast travel to a location inside the blast zone, and can't go to a spot farther away because you are overburdened. You can, however respawn to a teammate who is in the blast zone. So there's that. As long as you are on a team.
---
 Watoga is easy. The bots, outside of our lady of the red ray, do very little damage. Leather Armor is all my low levels use there, and they have been doing this since level 13 in one case.
---
I mean....forget TSE. A regular rifle does far more dps than any explosive weaponry atm. And exponentially easier to play with (ammo/durability). 
---
Yeah. Play the game.
---
I very much dislike the Bethesda ones in general, not because they are bad but because only like five or six of mine get shown through a single session. 
---
I disagree with the one shot part. If someone is skilled enough to land a headshot using a rifle with this games terrible gun play then by all means they deserve a one shot kill. But to be fair, VATS needs to be reworked to not work on other players 
---
I have the plans to make explosive vents for the Excavator armor? Is this the same thing or did I win the lottery?
---
Are you a government employee? lol Nice work.
---
Hope you don‚Äôt care if I add a link to my suggestions 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afz7u8/customization_discussion/?st=JRF77Y3S&amp;sh=ac79ef71
---
You have to go to a chem station and create the stable flux. You‚Äôll need, Glowing Mass, Hardened Mass, High, Radiation Fluids, and Raw Flux (x 10)
---
 Not me. I did do that above Watoga on a CAMP I had there a few weeks ago though.
---
You unlock the mod for whatever you scrap, if you scrap an arm and get buttressed then you have that mod for only the arms. You need to repeat the process for chest and legs
---
He is referring to using PA, so when using that, the armor pieces and their pocketed effect is not in effect.
---
Of course most weighless armor is really literally weightless, and can be modded with pocketed. Not a heck lot of reason not to use that.
---
I don't use energy weapons because of this weakness.  But they're so cool!  
---
Yeah, they need to be buffed to where ballistics are.
---
Are scorchbeasts resistant to energy weapons maybe?
---
Bethesda Fans using the excuse that "it's the dupers fault for the game being bad" is like the Third Reich claiming that Germany lost ww1 because of the Jews.
---
Dupers are bad but they're a scapegoat(especially here on reddit) for the more serious issues. 
---
Bethesda is at fault too just like a store owner when he doesn't secure his items properly. But this is not an excuse to dupe/steal. Good post, had to be said, thx.
---
Yeah I haven't seen anything yet that 'i have to have' so I'll just wait. 
---
Thank you!!! And that can be used to build the decontamination shower?
---
A specific place? A specific gun to use?  Luck in my special? What do I need to get more legendaries?
---
got two of those last night doing the queen events. 
---
Yea. The bunker had lists of what plants turn into what flux so you can nuke the appropriate places to get what you need. 
---
Strict pvp zone. Pass through a door and it's a free for all. No team play allowed (or team only), pacifism auto disengages.
---
Say we turn that giant fucking drill in the ash lands into a small pvp tower event, id have fun.
---
Games last 10-15 mins and the area is locked off from other players entering until the round is over. 
---
Hell, pull a loading screen outta your ass and make pvp challenges, your spot in your server is suspended, and you get moved into a pvp map, when its over, you're ported back to the nearest location you can fast travel to.
---
well...say you were this "store" and knew theifs existed. wouldnt you lock your items up more carefully? ive been to Targets where they have video games thrown around a shelf in the back of the game aisle and maybe a few of them have the security boxes on them. so i wouldnt be surprised if someone took from that pile and ran. the "stores" and Bethesda are assuming the risk of being stolen from if they do not lock their things up properly.
---
Um...what? You can't do that already.
---
In my use, every time he shows up he 100% picks you up, just need to be patient and hope you don‚Äôt die while he shoots at the critters that killed you.
---
For common legendaries I always follow this route:
---
Whitespring golf club, walk inside the building in front of the tennis court and lead them out into the tennis court. Good chance of 1* legendaries with a low chance of 2-3*.
---
Once you clear those, walk along the houses outlining whitespring and kill those ghouls. Before leaving the area, dump out or sell any useless items at the resort.
---
Other almost guaranteed legendary locations I've found are:
---
Thunder mountain sub station in cranberry bog.
---
Watoga emergency services - at the top.
---
Also, look out for the following events:
---
Uranium fever - 3 legendary chances up to 3*
---
Heart of the swamp - 1 legendary chance up to 3*
---
One violent night - 2 legendary chance and one guaranteed legendary up to 3*
---
Hoard events are also guaranteed 1 legendary mob.
---
Yeah, the first part doesn't address the issue directly. The last part does. Basically, dupers blaming Bethesda for their actions are wrong because they are not compelled to take those actions by Bethesda.
---
It is still Bethesda's responsibility to fix those vulnerabilities, however, since some people will exploit them. 
---
I got a TS drop for one of these but havent used it yet, are they any good?
---
The enclave bunker? Can you tell me where in the bunker? Thank you!
---
Some people hate you playing or enjoying this game.
---
Haha thinking about running revenant, might have to run my own tests to see
---
That's not an accurate comparison at all
---
That is really nice i wasnt expecting such a blow up of great comments .... if you think about this post... everything is just basic gear that represents every faction and some things from fallout 4 ... but its extreme motivation for me to read something like you just wronte thank you   [**u/thepassionofthechris**](https://www.reddit.com/user/thepassionofthechris/) 
---
Lost a bunch of purified water i was transferring to a second account and a x-01 stealth mod that disappeared awhile ago.  I‚Äôm trying to enjoy this game but they sure are making it difficult.
---
Maybe they should make a gambling/casino DLC
---
Nah he‚Äôs bugged. I‚Äôve killed myself trying to get my unyielding to work, nothing around, he shows but doesn‚Äôt pick me up, happens a lot 
---
all for it the more customization and balance we add early on the longer people will play and more content we will have 
---
I like it to a point.  That point being, wow, I'm going to feel stupid if they raise the Stash limit next week.  Or the point where I question how player vending is going to work.
---
It pays to be thrifty though.  The only weapons and armor I really hold onto, other than the ones I use in gameplay, are the Legendaries from non-repeatable quests.  No, I'll probably never use the Pyrolizer, but it won't be straightforward to me to get another one either.  I also try to collect every outfit I come across (that really doesn't amount to much at 0.1 WT apiece).  I hold onto magazines and Bobbleheads in the vain hope that I might be given a way to display them someday (and, if not, I'd sell them).  I tend to hover around 540-600 WT in the Stash.  Most of the time when I flirt with 600, I can bulk and sell obvious things I'm not using.
---
I‚Äôve been doing the whitesprings method a lot, and it‚Äôs paid off. I can‚Äôt really kill the ghouls efficiently though, so I tap each one of them to get the XP and then lead them to the protectrons and sentry bots, and comb through their loot after.
---
The YouTuber Open World Games runs the best one I've found, but eve it's dying.
---
How do you do that ?
---
Our Lady of the red ray,lol. You got that right.
---
I think it might be improving some. I feel like everything was nearly silent for a long time but I have increasingly heard others using mics in the past couple weeks. I'm hopeful!
---
It's very similar to Hearthstone. I like the game.
---
I think in the military wing  on top of terminals and boxes.
---
For all PA EXCEPT excavator you are correct. However the pocketed effect is not cancelled out when you wear excavator, it‚Äôs all added together.
---
So basically.....
---
I‚Äôm 255 capacity with no pocketed armor
---
305 with full deep pocketed armor
---
And 450 with deep pocketed armor and wearing excavator 
---
So I am getting the carry weight boosted from both the deep pocketed and the excavator at the same time
---
... the difference being that someone's duping isn't illegal and won't get them sent to jail.
---
I'm not sure how you made that jump.
---
It needs to be separated and also legendary weapons need to be removed from the PvP mode, have you ever played against tse's and players with full set of assassin's sentinel armor, it's no fun at all.
---
In the mire the strangler vines seems to have gone crazy, frozen in place in ways that make it seem like they once moved fast enough to take out living creatures. But these vines are also found occasionally elsewhere on the map. Usually crushing raiders, or found inside Cult of Mothman locations, with human bones still caught within them. Someone was walking the wasteland who could control these plants and use them as weapon.
---
I'm guessing the Vault 94 priests and these vines are somehow connected to the Mothman cult.
---
All good.
---
I want junk items to be useful too, and customizing your gear would be a beautiful thing.
---
Only concern is I bet it'll bog down the gameplay somehow unless they implement it right.
---
If it were a single player game I wouldnt care what excuse people used but cheating in a multiplayer game is just lame
---
Carry something else.  Someone almost one shot the wendigo at the end of one violent night.  I would've spent the rest of my fallout 76 career attempting to find and kill him.  Luckily the legendary regen kicked in.
---
That said, Bethesda needs to make Legendaries much harder to kill.
---
&gt;...I didn't mean fallout 76...
---
As I said, my original comment was talking specifically about Fallout 76 and their bug fixes. Not previous Bethesda games.
---
You're arguing against my comment by talking about what happened in previous Bethesda games, despite the fact that I wasn't discussing previous Bethesda games. So really, you're arguing against something I was never discussing.
---
You are good. 
---
The nature of the matchmaking and faux "serverless" infrastructure they're going for means a lot of compromise has to happen. It's trying to be an MMO and a 4 person co-op game at the same time. The size of the world would never allow for a permanent large servers, even with say 32 people max online at one time, you still have many times that cycling through the server leaving their stuff everywhere. If you've ever seen a populated Minecraft server, it's grand scale chaos within a week and they have nearly infinite space to use.  
---
I am hoping for self-hosted servers and mods in the future, so we can have some permanent world building with small communities. But it would never work for FO76 and it's current server/matchmaking style.  
---
Agree with combining camps though, that would be rad. Perhaps even forming permanent "clans" with your mates so that if I log in without my clan, all their stuff is still at the camp.
---
Run the dishwasher before you go to bed then? You don't have the thing running 24/7 do you?
---
Lol I don't think they got the joke.
---
Interesting, I‚Äôve used the perk quite a bit and never in my uses has that happened to me
---
Yeah its been brought up many times.  They haven't really addressed it though. 
---
I might be wrong, but it's not duped items, it's people who grabbed dev room items causing some of the bans.  So you should be ok. 
---
Np, I love how much thought you put in. There are a lot of things I miss about FO4 and am hopeful they will be adding in. We already know that we‚Äôll be able to craft vending machines, so Im stockpiling all 2* 3* legendaries, as well as rare mods AND precrafted PA torso w/ Jetpacks so I can be an Arms Dealer of sorts.
---
one of my chars has been bugged for like two weeks and has technical data on him at every login.  I never have to collect it.  It is quite an interesting bug.   I have turned in a truckload.
---
I find it reminds me of Demon soul's story telling where you just kinda piece together what had happen yourself, leaving it more to the imagination. I quite enjoyed how it played out in my head at least.
---
This. Stop looking for an "I win" button. Don't roll in here, buy or dupe a 1337 weapon, then say it's too easy. That's like crapping in your hand and complaining about the smell.
---
Lol chill out you're fine. For anyone reading this unless you dupe currently, have a inventory over 100,000, or are showing exploits to the public you're fine
---
I think that since it is supposed to be a suvival game (somewhat) and that the rng mechanics was pretty clear, atleast to me, even before I picked up the game, the reasoble thing is to adapt the build/playstyle to what you find or can build.
---
I hear you that the loot rng can be really tough depending on expectations though. I changed build between lvl 160-140 from VAT rifle to non VAT heavy. Sharing and trading with friend, new and old, from the start has reduced my rng issues with loot.
---
As an older gamer (around 40) that has been playin pc games online since i was on modem I think it is not only new generation that wants instant gradification that like the setup of f76. I love the potential for a huge f4 online type of game, scenery and sound is awesome, increadably social game across levels and gear levels of players, love the perk system etc.
---
Then again most of the stuff on your shitlist I agree with, just not as catigorical. I still think it is a good idea for a social fallout game, but still very unpolished.
---
My 2 caps
---
I hear you that the loot rng can be really tough depending on expectations though. I changed build between lvl 160-200from VAT rifle to non VAT heavy. Sharing and trading with friend, new and old, from the start has reduced my rng issues with loot.
---
I‚Äôd love if they add a double jump mutation to the game. It would be good to combo it with marsupial.
---
It does work on SBQ. I try to use it only when she lands, to conserve ammo, but it works in the air, too. Cryo capsule mod gives you better range.
---
I'm. Not. Saying. You should *steal* from the park. But. My. *bobby pins* are. Very reasonably priced.
---
They are irradiated bats... 
---
What are you talking about explosive ammo? There is no such thing the only types of ammo are regular and ultracite. As for guns breaking don't you think it a real gun was "explosive" it would break faster?
---
Lmao you dont get to tell other people people how to play and what they can and cant use
---
I imagine if it‚Äôs obnoxious enough that OP can‚Äôt use his mic, it‚Äôs going to be too loud for them to sleep with it running. 
---
Tl;dr:
---
It‚Äôs those damn millennials and their avocado toast üôÑ
---
If you want no risk in terms of server crash or random cameleon thief, you should sell it for 0 caps instead. 
---
If they are using field medic perk, then not using stems means they aren‚Äôt able to share heals, so it might be worth while not to auto heal.

So last night I was camping the munitions factory while someone had nuked the world and I was about to leave and the second I was going to I saw.     ‚ÄúDeath from Above‚Äù start and I checked to see where it was and I was in it... So I left the server early. Lol I thought it was pretty funny especially bc I had scrapped everything I could before I left. 
---
Want do I do if I only have TSE wepons tho üòâ
---
Not, it was extremely fun. 
---
Yes it is highly annoying happens a lot too
---
They‚Äôre talking about mini nukes and missiles 
---
Take my upvote. What a voice of the people you seem to be. This is well written, well planned, and well received. Thank you for taking the time to post this.
---
PC hot keys which I assume is basically the same in the games eyes.
---
Its survived logging out &amp; back in 3 times now, only two shots left in but I'm saving em for something worthy haha
---
Yes I know you're talking about fallout 76 and its bug fixes. They are slow and you are defend why it's slow the point is modders do it faster for free and they can't here because Bethesda wanted and online game with no private servers for the first year to get micro transaction money. In turn Bethesda has never been good a fixing anything you can ignore the older games all you wan't modders have always fixed their game for them it's not hard their just lazy and an online game just gave them a news flash.
---
Also like the other guy said quit trying to tell people how to play, I'm going to go to uranium fever even I see it now
---
Same
---
People here are saying that they were banned for having a duped item without knowing it
---
In the military wing, by the vendors. They are scattered around on papers.
---
If someone‚Äôs got an easy to Hotwire car, and doesn‚Äôt get a steering wheel lock, and you come steal that car, is it their fault or yours? 
---
if I'm in such evet i always give enough time to to shoot him too only because of that. 
---
Saw this sort of bollocks on, like, the 5th comment to the letter Bethesda issued about exploits. Someone arguing about the legal definition of ‚Äúexploit‚Äù. There‚Äôs no need for them to define it, and they probably have in the EULA. 
---
Trying to get an excuse built in early doors. Almost certainly someone making hay with the exploits and now wondering when the banhammer will fall. 
---
Yea, but I can try to let people know they're being rude.  If you don't care there is nothing I can do.  Why Bethesda needs to not depend on people playing nice and make some adjustments.
---
You shrugging it off just makes you one of those people who ruins the experience for those around you.  But, like you said, I can't make you do anything.
---
Ayy lmao
---
This almost sounds more like Fallout than other Fallout games, if you see what I mean. 
---
Dude there is no need to put on an act it's not like we're expecting the bgs inquisition or anything you can admit that the fact that someone can pay so much for so little even voluntarily is still grossly exploitative and anti consumer like the rest of us.
---
Well, to me the crashes and disconnects mostly hurt when I try to grab some workshop or keep it. Won't do much for other kind of gameplay.
---
I get them plenty, but I'd like to take and keep workshops far more than I dare.
---
What level are you 
---
:) happy to help
---
1. I mean missiles, grenades, 40mm, nukes, etc. They do less dps than a pistol.
---
2. No. I don't think guns in a video game should break within minutes. That isn't how Fallout usually works, or really any game.
---
Try moving your base. Sometimes they get set up near enemy spawns 
---
Thanks!!
---
Yeah. Perceived issues. 
---
Perceived does not in fact mean "real". 
---
Also, this sub is not a majority of 76 players. 
---
Why should we even be entertaining the opinions of the majority of this sub?
---
A sub that will buy into the existence of an exploit that was backed up by zero evidence. A sub that will dismiss evidence and fact to maintain their own opinion. A sub that bought a light survival game and complains they can't keep everything, despite inventory management being a staple of the genre. 
---
This sub's opinion is largely worth fuck all. It's not even their opinion. It's an opinion they heard from some YouTuber or another redditor and pass off as their own. 
---
I'm starting now if your still interested 
---
That's your biography. You didn't have to read it but we both know you did because you're an attention seeker with a small penis and big ego...
---
That being said, if anyone is garbage its a person not only who behaves but also openly admits he's a troll who considers wasting time of other people a lifetime accomplishment. Not only you're absolutely miserable you're also stupid. That makes me sad just thinking about it. I can't even imagine how you feel deep inside when you take a glimpse at successful people in real life. Damn... However, I'm glad at least my posts on reddit bring you some joyüòÇ, otherwise you would seize to exist like the smallest of bacteria because you are that of a weak minded and fragile being grasping at straws.  
---
üôè
---
Depends on the thief and context.
---
Haha well... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I've heard it can synergize with Undying armor, but cannot confirm. I'd be curious to see what you come up with.
---
Just buy the card again and rank it up. Are all your cards level 1? I don‚Äôt understand. 
---
Ok then that even favors my latter point, it's realistic, sorry but while it would be cool I wouldn't like a game where a missle weighs as much as a 5.56
---
Had 90 stability minutes.   
---
Platform?
---
I'd love proximity chat if people would role play in an RPG.  That means I don't want to hear your sister or yoir mom or your Playlist.  I would like private servers so we could get together and RP.  Play Fallout like we are at a tabletop. Someday. Maybe. 
---
 Swapping weapons just before landing also works.
---
Obviously there is an etiquette to online play that you are completey oblivious to, so good luck with that.
---
In power armor?
---
I camp there too, near the rickety wooden bridge. I recently shifted the camp to place a resource generator over the oil seep nearby.
---
Everyone's welcome to stop by and grab some oil or purified water or make some veg starch from my farm. No doors, no locks.
---
Whitespring for everything except violet. The Queen‚Äôs area has a ton of violet. 
---
It's nothing like that, for two reasons:
---
* Grocery stores lock down razorblades but not loaves of bread, and most don't sell military grade explosives one aisle over
---
* Video games aren't real
---
Lost all my shotgun rounds to it and had to finish with whatever I could scavenge. That was the last time I bothered with this event
---
Seriously, getting a weightless weapon, even a bad one is super easy to find and carry, terrible excuse for bad manners
---
So you just want to run around like a entitled ass? "I don't care if you didn't get a chance to tag it, DON'T TELL ME HOW TO PLAY :*(. You child.
---
Lol players will scatter like cockroaches after she dies :))))) ..really hyped to see how the pvp server will turn out
---
Here‚Äôs the thing‚Äî maybe my post wasnt as clear as it should have been. I carry a TSE as well, but I try my best to allow other players a chance to get a hit before I shoot.
---
The situation I mentioned before was there were 5 people participating and as soon as the legendary spawned a player would one shot before anyone else could engage.
---
No matter how you cut it, that‚Äôs an dick move and if anyone says otherwise they are justifying their asshole tendencies.
---
On xbox half the time people are on the Xbox system chat that mutes in-game chat. It‚Äôs refreshing when I hear in-game non intentional voice. 
---
I usually mute my mic until I see the voice icon pop up them I‚Äôm like ‚Äúhelooooooo!‚Äù or when there‚Äôs a random trade request. Ahem engage in conversation first.
---
Is this your first time
---
Coming from some one enjoys griefing, and actually enjoy ensuring no one else gets a tag... So I assume / as the cut and paste weak responses reinforce.
---
Try doing a hard boot on your Xbox. Hold the X button on the Xbox down for 5-10 seconds and then power it back on. That should clear the system cache and let you launch the game proper after.
---
Quite happy with my look with the scout armour (Strengthened, reinforced and shadowed) and Bastion (+ Perception) as torso armour with a treated marine wet suit. Am a sneaky sniper with a TSE Gauss and Under lever for low level. Grognecks Axe (+ Ghouls) and All Rise (Rocket Sledge) for everything else that gets too close.  Most of my perks are weighted to strength and perception, but found the perks White Knight and Lucky Break help with not having to repair armour all the time. Only downside is rads when farming ghouls with melee, so have started carrying my X-01 around for the golf club. To me the look is more important than stats, and have only post level 100. Bothered to buff out my armours (including power armour). Took quite a few server jumps for the shadowed for the scout armour. 
---
Been a very similar look since about level 45.
---
[https://imgur.com/q4hSRCA](https://imgur.com/q4hSRCA)
---
Get a weightless backup weapon, easy and cheap for low end ones, terrible excuse for trying to make sure no one else gets a tag on the legendary mobs 
---
They could save the game if they try!
---
Yeah- next thing you know they‚Äôll add emotes. Wait a minute!!!
---
/r/gatekeeping/
---
He‚Äôs saying what is and what isn‚Äôt role playing. That‚Äôs the definition of gatekeeping.
---
I like the raider vendors trying to sell me on the raider lifestyle.
---
Some guys glitched into Vault 94 and did found a G.E.C.K. but I'm pretty sure the video got shut down
---
It exists tho
---
Turn the blitz perk from fallout 4 into a legendary effect for melee weapons. I'd give up my bloodied gauntlet for that.
---
EXACTLY!!! Bethesda needs to see our suggestions!
---
I picked up a small cap bounty for something and a guy tried everything to kill me and I just stood there. He was impressed. I wasn‚Äôt carrying any junk so I just took off all my armor and let him kill me. 
---
I was there the other night when I got mobbed by a bunch of scorched instead of ghouls. First time that's even happened to me.
---
I understand why they would break fast, they want high dmg weapons to be cost heavy. Like you said they‚Äôre missing the entire point why they‚Äôre even in the game: high dmg. Beth is probably at a crossroads if they give them the buff they seriously need, will the TSE era switch to quad missile/fatman era. The weapons need buffs regardless.
---
&gt;I do think a server wipe will be an extreme advantage for our bunch, compared to the benefit for casuals
---
Then I'm afraid you're extremly wrong.
---
Average Fo76 player or "casual" have nothing to lose, most of the playerbase don't even know about trading subs, most have for equipements only what they've looted. Knowing god rolls are supposed to be extremely rare (getting a 3* TSE Handmade has a chance of 1:2,000,000 or so), it is safe to assume average players are far away from the meta.
---
On the other hand, "our bunch" have top tier weapons &amp; armors because people massively dupped and sold god rolls, said gears we won't be able to recover once dupe is fixed because of how scarce they are. We have everything to lose vs the average joe Fo76 player.
---
&gt;Fair or just is besides the point. What is not besides the point is making the game as enjoyable as it is possible, to as many people as it is possible
---
Well that's too bad because what makes a good &amp; enjoyable PvP to as many people as it is possible is balance, fairness &amp; rightness.
---
&gt;My agenda is not to protect my character and my items. I can start fresh just to prove the point. My agenda is to make the game as enjoyable for the majority of the casuals, because I need happy casuals if I am to have any competitors anytime soon.
---
Then understand that casuals will be hightly disadvantaged because YOU, I and all other people who feel entitled to their overpowered weapons, which +90% were duplicated, will roam in the same servers that average joes with shite gears that did not took advantage of dupe exploits to some extent.
---
Making everyone fresh start is the first step to have happy casuals that will be hooked to the game and eventually become competitors.
---
Placing our fellow casuals in a pool with overpowered gods who own OHKO weapons and their armors that make them impervious to dmg would just make them straight up quit survival and make them rather stay in "PvE".
---
&gt;Pointing at case studies by pretty much every other online game ever, the proper way to manage broken meta gear is to demote it by implementing new gear that outclasses the old meta.
---
I don't even know TBH, I hope I'm wrong but I believe there is no future for the PvP mode if it favors RNG &amp; grinding over skills - PvP get people hooked if it is balanced &amp; skill based.
---
Molotovs work pretty well if you don‚Äôt feel like crafting a ‚Äútagging‚Äù weapon or picking up one of the tens of thousands of weapons dropped by enemies including the ones in the very event described in this post 
---
What's spelled wrong btw?
---
Breaking the TOS in such a way is enough for a legal suit in itself
---
Didnt work 
---
Well I guess it must just be running all day then, my washer only takes an hour if that I never really timed it, it can't be running non stop whenever the dude wants to play the game can it? lol. If it is running that much damn that guy is wasting a lot of water, wait for the washer to be completely full before running it not just a couple things and try and practice reusing some things throughout the day, like rinsing out a glass when you are done with it and use it again instead of getting a new one every single time you want a drink.
---
What about a billable robot vendor for your CAMP to sell things or give them away?
---
They just need to put Dawnguard fire/frost/lightning bolts in Fallout and we're good! 
---
Eh complain to bethesda about it. I have already been submitting video evidence of why the guns shouldnt even have a explosive perk on them and once they snatch them out of the game 90% of these trolls will quit fallout. The rest will run to pvp servers when they're released only to realize people are better at the game then they are in which case they'll rage quit then. üòÇ My pvp count of TSE losers today? 43-1 in my favor.
---
They had radios in CAMP in beta, but they removed them!  That was the only thing that made my camp feel like a home dammit!
---
Notice how you can't put a camp somewhere and place hundreds of plants to nuke them and get the flux. It would work the same. 
---
It‚Äôs OUR minds, not are minds. 
---
Remember the nuked Charleston area in the game's trailer? I thought nukes would do that. 
---
Yes, this would be great.  With all respect, there is no evidence that they are considering this.
---
Have both maxed, really slows down the need for repairs.
---
In the previous fallout games, the radio station evolved over time and reflected your impact on the world. Why not add audio cues for "brotherhood knights, automated defense systems active, fort strong under scorched attack" instead of events cycling
---
Fallout has always been rich with lore. But now, the universe feels dead and it destroys everything fallout taught us. We can't even fulfill our mission, to close the fissures or stop the virus.
---
This is a great list - bravo. I really miss the bobble head stand. Trouble is, what happens when a bloody scorchbeast destroys my camp? Hope the bobble heads survive. 
---
I‚Äôm a woman and the REEEE is real. Haha
---
I've got a bug thread going, I swear there is an "Seeded RNG"..  I have friends who have looted countless TSE's and find rare plans and all the X-01 mods they want in an hour.  
---
Then there is the other side, that checked the BOS robot non-stop for 8 hours and got (1) plan that wasn't "Motion Assist" or "Rusty knuckles"
---
Yeah what he said, i can even excuse you shortening people to ppl but that was the wrong word entirely you used, then got super defensive over it instead of just laughing it off
---
That's proper grammar not spelling I just use broken English but ill change it for the grammar police.
---
Xbox.  Crashing all the time now.  Lots of times spawn in can't see my teammates, not even the tags.  Can't move if I open my pip boy when logging.  Stuff disappearing in my inventory.  Stash magically increasing itself 
---
Nuke zone will cause at least one crash or if I'm running into an area it will just freeze.
---
After nearly 600 hours I'm calling it a day.  I find my own fun with teammates and myself, but the crashing and poor performance is wearing me down.  Rather than rage and do myself no favors, i'll just come back in a future patch and lurk until then.
---
I saw somebody do this, so I used vats to melee-port to them. Then I couldn't get out.
---
ya that also happens to me most of the time and i somehow manage to go through it but I suppose the only possible way to prevent this or to work around it is to be patient while waiting to connect thru it but ayo what u gunn expect from bethesda 
---
I'm still pretty annoyed at the lack of flash before the bang.
---
It's like... remember how you felt when you stood in Tenpenny Tower, the Big Red Button blinking stoically at you, waiting patiently for your decision. 
---
I dunno about most people, but I really felt the weight of the choice on my shoulders, and my actions were rewarded by the sheer amazement of watching as my hand ignited the Fires of Hell itself.
---
The nuke is FO's most visible mechanic, and they really had a chance to make it an intense and beautiful experience that could be shared by everybody in their own way. Instead, like all things Bethesda, we just got this watered down endgame 'super grenade' that has absolutely zero emotional investment, and thoroughly fails to impress.
---
LHM in cigarettes inside dropsite v9. Probably a developers initials
---
That would be even more strain on the server, likely causing even more server crashes tbh 
---
On the unmutated character?
---
&gt; was the intended way that Bethesda wanted you to play it.
---
Solo that works.  You can become immersed in the stories and the lore.  
---
In a multi-player it's impractical at best.  I'm not sure what the Bethesda gang was thinking - or if they even knew themselves how/if it was going to work.  
---
Haaa, glad to hear somebody think like that! I'm just using the red leather armor now even though the resistance is low. 
---
What I‚Äôm curious about is why these people running around with TSE weapons are still even farming for? I mean really. So you get insanely lucky/dupe/trade/buy on eBay a TSE. Congratulations you have now effectively beaten the game. I mean I don‚Äôt want to shit on Bethesda here but there really is no end game right now. It‚Äôs literally just farm for legendaries or do boring events or kill the same boss. Why even keep farming once you have one? Left clicking and one shotting everything must get boring eventually. They seriously need to either add meaningful end game content or give players the proper tools and support to create their own

Does she still spawn? I went there today and she wasn‚Äôt there.

No prob. Just let me know. I'll be on tomorrow evening EST time.

K I‚Äôm on my way. I‚Äôm level 12 but I have a sweet short rifle I found.

Rad x gets rid of mutations radaway surpresses it. As long as you have starched genes 2 card on and class freak 3 on it will stay unless you walk through a decom shower
---
Ight man I'm ready and on the game now and ready for you 
---
As far as i know gum is pretty much useless (imo)
---
My husband and I both play together, he was at my Camp while i went on a supply run one day and some guy showed up and just started shooting missiles at my house. I logged off as quick as I saw and my husband was still there when my camp disappeared. I watched on his screen and the guy just walked away. Didnt even try to pvp my husband. He just wanted to destroy my camp.
---
Some people are just dicks.

That is weird.  Safes like all containers are instanced, so no one can empty ‚Äòyour‚Äô instance.

I didn't get defensive you're just trying to be a asshole grammar police on the internet yeah I have broken English if it would have been something like stuped instead of stupid yeah I'm dumb okay. But using are instead of our is shitty grammar just like how I don't put commas and periods properly. love how everyone on the internet thinks English is ppls first language. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it. Bethesda is looking for people with a ridiculous amount of duped items. One will be seen as an accident 
---
These are just aesthetic things but they would be easy additions, just textures for the most part:
---
- Floor-to-ceiling window walls and/or railings that don't block the view and make my modern house look like a shack. I end up leaving the view wall open to outside and just acting like there's glass there. 
---
- Non-broken windows? Please? I mean if I'm roleplaying searching the wasteland for clean furniture and modern lamps, and hauling heavy stuff like jukeboxes and port-a-johns to the camp,  shouldn't I be able to find unbroken panes of glass too, and have a house that isn't wide open to the elements? Make them require glass to build in addition to other materials. 
---
- And how about some interior wall finishes. I'll buy them from the shop just like flooring. You build a modern space with modern couches and lamps, and the walls are bare wood or metal on the inside. 
---
- Why can't a doorway and stairs going up share space? Doorways and stairs going down work. 
---
They got the Blitz perk from Fallout 4. 
---
Rust not on PS4 though.
---
Yes, craft the lowest lvl possible and you can scrap it for mods. 
---
Hi can you make a power generator for me Please sir?   I am on Xbox 1.    My gamer tag is Hardass.      Email is Txusguy328@gmail.com
---
Again, just getting defensive, i made a joke at you since you had a jab at bethesda, but apparently you get super salty at it, if your gonna dish out salt, expect a to recieve a salty meal yourself
---
Rust not on PS4 though
---
Yep absolutely true, I was merely pointing out that this post reeks of the same whinging of every other generational ‚Äú this generation is ruining this‚Äù news story, post, anecdote, etc. has about the subject for the last 4 or 5 generations. 
---
Hold PS button, press square. It‚Äôs an accessibility feature which zooms in. 
---
Try it. Night and day. 
---
Like the person who took that picture? https://i.imgur.com/Do7FzCP.png
---
Logically I am not wrong. And according to this masters degree I understand logic very well.
---
I‚Äôd love to see that in the next update it‚Äôd be really cool but knowing Bethesda I doubt we‚Äôll see a GECK any time soon
---
We need area looting. 
---
I shouldn't have to compete with people to get loot that I'm standing 1ft from. 
---
Any creature that dies within a field up to 2x the size of camps (point of origin is player of course) can be looted by the player.
---
Xp is only awarded if tagged.
---
I cant even tell you how much shit has been stolen from under my nose by some asshole with a TSE.
---
The drive to continue playing just keeps dropping.
---
Buying weapons for fallout 76 is a bitch move. Straight up. Unbelievably lame, the dupers suck too, but it's the clowns who can't have fun without being the strongest that create an economic need for duping. Play the game, it's not even competitive. 
---
Hey thanks, that saves me a lot of time deciding which mods are actually worth it. Though I was really hoping to be able to get extra perk card slots, 10% capability of perk card usage was a terrible way to go from static perks. 
---
Also with the PC version of fallout 3 and newvegas (I personally haven't confirmed it with 4) the came comes with a software GECK which gives you the ability to create mods for the game that can include your own story, buildings and other neat little things. Unfortunately (my assumptions are) that the software was to complex to implement into console to allow players to create their own areas. 
---
It's a hard program to learn yourself and there is lots of videos on YouTube to learn how to use the program. But like the previous person mentioned it was included in come vaults (vault 87 fallout 3) to allow you to remove the radiation from a location to produce a clean environment like it was before the war. 
---
Now just a random fan theory that I have is that there is a possibility of finding a place that is not at all affected by the nukes ant it's almost like nothing has ever happened where the water is pure and the animals and bugs are normal.
---
I think you have that backwards 
---
I updated my comment too late. it's that ppl like doing that shit like English is everyone's first  language. It's just annoying you how much of a pain it is to convert Spanish to English.
---
The game we have right now basically is PVE mode. Thats why no one plays PVP. 
---
Since the glowing ones patch i rarely see any nukes.  I've fired a couple in other areas just to see since no one else on the server seems to be using them.
---
Radaway will remove mutations without starched genes.
---
Decon shower will not remove mutations with starched genes 2.
---
That's how i have played all the FO games. It's not a race it's an adventure. 
---
It wouldnt surprise me. either way i have 7 mutations and i can take rad x and rad away because i have starched genes level 2 and class freak level 3. The only thing that will take them away is a decom shower
---
Eesh idk 
---
Actually I've have to move my CAMP like 8 times because of this.  Even if the e other person is like 20 feet away it still says I'm too close.  I'm having to look again now
---
Everytime I've been killed, I've been at full health in power armor and have been 1 shot.  That's above level 50 as well.
---
Whatever their goal was with pvp engagement rules, they failed.
---
Maybe make it so bobbleheads dont stack pr something.
---
Its safe to say that the game needs new content.
---
Don't get me wrong i love it. But I'm also lvl 168 and really bored i have everything i could ever want in the game and nothing surprises me anymore!!!
---
Tried that. Had the veil, garb, and the dress all equipped. Can not get past the security grid. 
---
We need half-width walls.  We have half-height ones, but not half-width ones.
---
This sounds absolutely hilarious 
---
When will you be on 
---
You could have just said "English is not my first language" instead you decided to call me a dip shit, a 10 year old and an asshole
---
An hour or so hopefully
---
Gatekeeping definitely sounds like some made up new age bullshit that people tell themselves is a thing and they should be offended whenever someone else thinks they aren‚Äôt what they say they are.
---
It‚Äôs again really all a matter of opinion because in matters like this no one can definitively say who is or isn‚Äôt fitting role playing, or gatekeeping, since they have such vague and subjective definitions.
---
I got a drill from the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
It‚Äôs a shotgun by the way
---
Need an answer quick
---
Itll be called a prime automatic receiver. Im not sure which weapon though
---
Naw you can find a lvl 50 for same price 
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt see anything I had with it but will look again later when I have time.
---
So since you don‚Äôt know how the perk cards work, why comment at all? I was asking about chewing/bubble gum. I am well aware of the starched genes perk card. If you re-read the story, you‚Äôll notice I am currently level 18. Therefore unable to use starched genes.
---
No. With the patch coming don‚Äôt pay more than 500. 
---
Do you play on console or PC?
---
I exclusively play a medic build. Honestly I don‚Äôt know if autostim is the way to go. Forgetting to spam the stim button never seemed to be an issue I skipped the auto stim perk for this reason.
---
My preference is to add deep pockets with chameleon. I‚Äôve considered weightless since I have the invis mutation. Marsupial, speed demon, healing factor. Jumping to inaccessible areas and crouching while stiming
---
I would recommend favoriting disease cure, radaway, radshield, diluted radx, purified water, dog food, nuke cola, super stim, canned coffee, and sugar
---
Can do for canned coffee and purified water. Pharma farma for Stims. 
---
I was only trying to help and assist with what i knew on the subject of starched genes card and mutations. My bad 
---
Thanks, just saved me from being scammed
---
The fact that a nuked zone changes the plants and mob types. Servers die a little after 2ish hours (3 nukes to instantly die). I would want server stability to be solid before adding anything new like that.
---
That has nothing to do with slap damage.
---
Now to play the devils advocate on duping ect...  
---
Its not all going to be these newbies coming into the franchise and their "instant gratification" era, a lot will stem from people who are Fallout veterans who have always had console commands, mods and cheats to help them play the game, and don't like that its been taken away from them in multiplayer  
---
EDIT: I should also add that I in no-way condone this, but thats where I think some of the problem is from
---
According to your master's degree, your philosophy professors are rolling in their grave. You should have studied harder.
---
Because its their vision. Not ours. It may attract different players, who knows. They want the game to be that way.
---
How about to hell with microtransactions.
---
Well I'm sorry you don't know how much that happens your not a dip shit your very intelligent.
---
Especially when  your tryin to debate someone they pull the you dumb see your grammar fuck up no shit you try coming from Mexico and learning English from southern ppl that cant speak English good themselves.
---
I saw an explanation for the goofy shit that other players do that did kind of tie things up but also didn't explain a lot of other stuff
---
The baseline was essentially that V76 wasn't housing "The Best of the Best" in a control vault, it was a test vault housing psychos who were consistently being pumped full of a drug to stop them from indulging into their insane ravings and various crazy activities, it explains why you sometimes bump into someone wearing a full clown suit at least...
---
&gt; Bonus points for the belaboring of some old one off jokes to the point of annoyance (NO nuka cola does not equal Fallout).
---
I didn't understand this one, would you mind explaining? 
---
There's an "Ultracite Laser Pistol" and "Ultracite Gatling Laser". Specific weapons; maybe one of those?
---
You've finally given me a reason to pick up toilet paper! If only there was a way for me to tag a piece of junk to prevent it from scrapping
---
By the way Witches costume sells for 50 with Hard Bargain 3 I think, and Straight Jacket sells for 50 also with Hard Bargain 3 and Unyielding set boosting Charisma. So it's nice and even 4 for 200.
---
I don't have the time, nor desire to level a character up from scratch, and farm all my plans, armor, weapons, etc. again.
---
7 times now 
---
Pretty sure it was a planned ambush, trying to get my loot off me. Oh well.
---
Can we please repurpose ammo. Can we have the ability to break down ammo we don't use into mats to make ammo we can use.
---
To hell with that. My kills, my XP, my loot. If you can't get a shot in before I destroy everything around, that's not my problem. I play how I want and nobody's going to change that. 
---
A scope and an enhanced bow are absolutely needed. I can't see any reason there aren't trigger and stock mods available as well. 
---
The problems are the TSE weapons. As soon as you get engaged in PVP any TSE gun will kill you really fast. You dont need any Bobbleheads for that. Im glad TSEs will get nerfed soon.
---
Id really like an "eat/drink now" button
---
I look forward to making you my bitch.
---
Lol that'd be great, sorry that happened to ya friend
---
When I bought it, I was a bit overeager to learn it and not figure out which it went to. Since I don‚Äôt have many laser weapons that could be why, since I didn‚Äôt explore those.
---
You wouldn't happen to be the gentleman painting the power armor helmet someone posted before?
---
Very nice! Don‚Äôt forget the interval switch they left out, we‚Äôve got a power counter but no interval switch! What fun is that
---
I'd totally buy it off you lol
---
In the future feel free to message me. I‚Äôm always pvping lol psn Ysobutthurt 
---
Does he actually do anything? I mean that's expensive as hell
---
When he sings the song about meat
---
Good luck with that pipe dream.
---
This is a fantastic idea. You get an upvote.
---
Like junk piles that you find in workshops.  They can be aluminum or scrap or various stuff.  But u use your camp instead of a workshop to mine it. 
---
lol You need to contrast what OP and I wrote with the actual meaning  of circular argument.
---
Plus, construing my post the same way you‚Äôre construing OP‚Äôs post, I‚Äôm offering a reason OP‚Äôs choice to not damage other players or their camps should not extend to OP being able to prevent other players from damaging OP/OP‚Äôs camp. Luckily, the odds of BGS changing a fundamental (and already heavily carebear-ed) game mechanic to suit the whining of players like OP are zero. Perhaps one day they‚Äôll offer PvE only servers, and OP can have the option of permanently banishing their characters to one.
---
Ight
---
yup, lvl 198 here. Nothing to do except for SBQ. Joined Server - Disconnected from server. Joined server again - game crashed - Joined Server another time - xbox crashed. Fuck this game
---
Confirmed: Lost a heavy leather leg with the legendary chameleon mod on my first go at the event. Haven't attempted another since. 
---
But if you insist, find me on PS4 under this same name. 
---
Side question: Weren't all the vaults supplied with GECKs?
---
I had this happen to me yesterday.  It gets a little buggy when you place things on the sides of the tent.  I think it‚Äôs because the walls aren‚Äôt tall enough for some things, but I may be wrong. 
---
I‚Äôd have preferred to not have whitespings like it is but have more random legendary enemies with better drops. The problem is that the odds of a decent drop are so small and you don‚Äôt get many outside of farm spots.
---
Slug made a post calling people crybabies who make posts complaining about others. But slug is also making a post complaining about people and calling them crybabies for it. Thus by slugs definition he too is a crybaby.
---
I‚Äôm not seeing how this logic is flawed. And you aren‚Äôt explaining why it is flawed, just claiming it is. It seems I have a stronger argument, because I‚Äôm the only one with one.
---
Missed opportunity cause holy shit that‚Äôs a good idea 
---
There is a thriving "black" market in FO76; you can buy duped items, stuff from other players -with "real world money" (i.e., pay to win)
---
Not sure how you're unaware of this, but whatevs. 
---
Are you aware of the submerged acid source?! I was on my way to the silo when I came across a camp with an acid extractor in the middle of the pond (not the pond adjacent to the silo Alpha shack, a pond NE of the adjacent pond)!  
---
No but what would you mod it with in the first place? 
---
Interesting 
---
Maybe, but I can't even place a bed or any crafting stations.  Even just a simple bed in the middle of the tent, completely away from the walls, causes issues.
---
I know there have been bugs with tents before, so just seeing if anyone else has this issue, of if this is a me-only issue that I need to just deal with.
---
Yup! Lost my excavator left leg to that. I was pressing a little too quickly. Such a dumb bug.
---
Love the idea of moon moon being that one guy who doesn't use TSE weapons and everyone cant stand having him around but keep him around for some reason.
---
What platform is your team on?
---
I got your pipe right here üòÇ
---
Ah, I thought it was a combination of the 2.  I mean .. why not dmg cap each hit or make it do nothing at all if they havnt returned fire?   The current implementation is very half stepish.
---
I remember a post here about this, but I thought the thrust of the argument was the (more sensible) opposite: the game is currently failing that law by offering voice chat but not offering text chat.
---
West Tek always has a legendary somewhere inside. Sometimes there's one outside, too. It's a tough spot to make it through alone, sometimes even in a group. Lots of higher level mutants. Make sure all your junk is stowed away before you enter and only pick up junk you're willing to lose when inside. 
---

---
Not all vaults got a GECK, Vault 76 didn‚Äôt have one. I guess some did some didn‚Äôt.
---
Increased range possibly
---
Talk talk, I talk to you, in the night, in your dreams, of love so true...
---
Yeah. I'm expecting 94 and its geck to definitely become a part of the story in the future. 
---
Go to watoga. The roofs of buildings have power armor frames with cores in them
---
I‚Äôve never even seen that card to be able to even unlock level 2 base defense. That‚Äôs the main issue
---
That‚Äôs odd
---
This. Even though I got downvoted for saying it last time lol people were insistent you could scrap 100 arms and unlock even chest mods. Which I've never encountered, despite a *lot* of crafting and scrapping.
---
Something similar happened to me last night. Was logged in as my lvl 16 Alt character and was at my base doing some crafting. Noticed a lvl 6 outside. He was doing the follow me emote and heart more so I went out to have a nose. He done a few more emotes then shot me. So I retaliated. A few shotgun blasts to the head and he died but before I could do anything else his lvl 133 mate who was behind me TSE'd me and started levelling my CAMP. So I quickly logged off (knowing I'd already saved my stash) before my base got too smashed up. Don't get the "fun" of smashing Ok I people's bases. It's hard work base building and takes a lot of time and resources. 
---
You can only use 1 between the 2
---
Love the idea...though I wouldn‚Äôt play the game...I would just set up my HAM Radio and do some broadcasts XD 
---
Basically nothing vanilla is going to do. You always have to have an immense amount of damage or it seems like everything is a goddamn tank
---
Can you post a screenshot? I don't even know what that looks like!
---
Using the mic weirds me out. I have no problem speaking to strangers irl, but talking to avatars makes me uncomfortable. I think it's the lack of facial cues and body language. 
---
I thought of it when I came across [this](https://i.imgur.com/FwEHFNr.jpg) the other day. I was hoping that it wouldn't be as useless as the ones in previous games have been but it was. 
---
Or NVGs!!! 
---
So fan made mod after months of promises but no results lead to a salvage attempt by bethesda to rent private servers and let people host modded versions? /s 
---
Definitely. Did a search on /r/fo76 and it turns out that I'm not the only one wishing that. 
---
Karl has truly transcended time and space.
---
They got rid of it
---
So? I can carry and use whatever I want. Why would I carry a crappy weapon when I already have good ones? That's stupid and a waste of inventory space
---
I get the feeling the Forest is in the condition it is because someone used a GECK in it somewhere. Hard to explain otherwise, nuclear winter should've ruined everything for quite a while.
---
I believe some of the sentient ghouls ended up heading to the capital wasteland, and some members of the BOS fell back that same direction... but, yeah, it appears everyone that stayed (and weren‚Äôt in a vault) got scorched or were converted to Supermutants.
---
Not sure how to I'm on Android and doesn't have any options to all I can think is to post it to one of the markets and paste a link here
---
Well, this is what happens when people stare at Bethesda through rose-tinted glasses and refuse to see the fact that they're ruining the franchise, and that the best 3D Fallout game wasn't even developed by them.
---
I don't really care if they kill the mobs.  It's a pain keeping all 3 ore deals up sometimes.
---
I DO care if they instantly kill the legendaries, that's just being a dick.
---
**HINT:  Make sure you have passive on and step in front of them FREQUENTLY.  They'll end up killing themselves with their own explosive blast, especially if it's a TSE shotgun.**
---
Weird how the vault that was intended to open and contain people who were going to rebuild America didnt have one of the devices that literally terraforms the environment to be verdant 
---
It's not like that. Prime receivers (plans from Scorchbeast Queen) *only* use ultracite ammo. You need it. And you get the workbench plans for it from the plan you get the receiver from. Prime does the same damage as hardened, plus extra damage to SBQ and SBs.
---
It wont let me past the hand scanner.   Do know why by chance?
---
The "clicking so fast" glitch has nothing to do with server lag.
---
In the case of the former carry-weight glitch, for example, they made the choice of storing the user's weight and simply adding and subtracting from it. Where instead they could have chosen to recompute this value based on the state (equipped equipment, active drugs, player's strength and base carry-weight) whenever said state is updated. Sure, it requires more computation, but it's won't allow server lag to screw it up.
---
Also, letting a value that should never be negative become negative is pretty much a rookie's mistake.
---
Bethesda games have always been ridden with bugs &amp; glitches. It's only become more glaring and daunting for me ever since I've become a developer. And seeing this kind of lack of quality is what drives me every day when I push back against duct-tape fixes, "it works if everything is right and goes as planned" code, and push for tests, CI or mere code reviews.
---
Hopefully when private servers come out we won't have to here from these winning bitches anymore
---
No, only a handful had them, which is a major plot point in Fallout 2 and 3.
---
Hmmm good question, but the only character I think might still be alive is the overseer.
---
All notes are found near dead bodies or the notes themselves hint for the death of who wrote it.
---
It would be tremendously cool, if in the future we stumble across any of the npcs figured in the notes. Especially the lady who leaves behind stuff inside a chest and a very sad note implying that she was the only survivor of a group of refugees (including her daughter I think), and asks the player to take something from the chest but to put something of his own in return for fellow travelers. You can find this chest beneath a bridge in the ash heap, in the road right next the truck drawing on the map.
---
The other chest is at the entrance of cranberry glade (beware of the mirelurk queen).
---
Thanks guys!
---
Damn. Sounds like people really hate the way I play. üòÇ
---
Have you done the enclave quest line?
---
Silent, with reusable ammo
---
Leave that job to /u/WayneGSG who said this in a similar post, brilliant.
---
&gt; I can hear it now...
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Gooooooooooood Morning West Virginia? I hope all my fellow Vaulties packed some extra Radaway with you this morning because today is going to be a skin burner for sure. That rad storm will be moving in from the east and I would suggest seeking some shelter come noon time. If shelter is eluding you pump up on the meds, suit up, whatever it takes to stay safe and alive.
---
&gt; In other news, it has been reported that Jim Billy has gone missing and his camp just north of Ohio River Adventures has apparently been ransacked. If anyone out there discovers any sign of ole Jim Billy, he has some concerned friends that would like to know if he is dead or alive.

&gt; Wanted! Wanted! And Wanted! There are no less than three cold blooded murderers roaming the countryside folks. Have fun, be safe and don‚Äôt forget to reload my friends. Travel with companions if you have them and be ready to run if don‚Äôt.

&gt; Now back to my limited selection of tunes. Donations always accepted and appreciated if you happen to stumble across anything better for me to play at WGSG radio‚Ä¶

If you are not engaged in PVP in any way, then the damage is capped. It has been proven on this sub just a few days ago. 
---
But as soon as you own a workshop or are engaged in PVP in any other way, people can do damage to you.
---
The regular in game greaser outfit is better because it‚Äôs r/wellworn
---
And when you log back in it should have corrected itself. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened to me multiple controller  throws later. Lol
---
You would get solstheim
---
Just the overseer and maybe some none feral ghouls out east.
---
They guard your camps. They really don't do anything, it's just a cool feature
---
The "explore the world" gameplay is what bethesda excels at. It requures you to be curious and chase down leads, and maybe even write things down to follow up on them, but its always rewarding. I have found several stories in notes that do not initiate quest markers and they have all been great but required me to hunt them down and follow the clues. I wish they would have added quest markers or at least markerless tasks when you read them, but Ive enjoyed the one I remembered to pursue. 
---
I just about managed to not break my TV this time
---
*This time*
---
Put a suppressor on that beauty lmao
---
I love the noise they make when you pick them up
---
Nothing.
---
Food for thought, they mentioned the mode before xmas, a month later they announced a beta.
---
Maybe mid feb? We're just guessing
---
You may not like it, but those are npcs 
---
How to be a crybaby according to above post:
---
A. Be griefed in a video game.
---
B. Be upset enough to create reddit post about said upsetness
---
Conditions A and B must be met simultaneously to be a crybaby, according to above poster.
---
Where did above poster meet both conditions to be a crybaby? 
---
It's funny because Charleston just always looks nuked because it was flooded
---
Is it really a toilet if the plumbing is out?
---
Its a weird time of day to be dcing that much.
---
Are you on Wi-Fi?
---
You can click on the light bulb once installed, not the regular ones though, they are reddish and you need the plans but when you click on them they change color and there is a lot of color choices. Great to give ambiance light.
---
As far as I know the gum only slows down your hunger for like 5 minutes.
---
I now have a nice all metal camp at the end of the dry bed next to sunshine meadows. It will remain there until I decideto put points into my home defence perks and move to water near Harpers or something. 
---
And he's wearing excavator armor to aid in the process if need be.
---
3* wood? You sure?
---
Plus bird bones
---
Look and see what Ultracite ammo you can craft, maybe that‚Äôll narrow it down?
---
But they're daily. Just go back and get it again.
---
Hi, thanks it's working now.
---
Because weapon balance is horrendous atm.
---
The perfect scenario for focusing on pvp.....
---
What is your carry capacity with Excavator on and no other armor..??
---
Ah yes, that too
---
i put up a banjo with small letters behind it saying   ‚Äúplay banjo is my doorbell‚Äù lol
---
It will do nothing if you have herbivore
---
I disconnected 4 times this morning. I took a couple workshops right next to each other and haven't fast traveled onced and I haven't been disconnected in two hours. I love paying to beta test this game for them. /sigh

You do realize that when your a grown up, you might not be able to play games for hours at a time right? You may just have work to do even after you get home from your job. *gasp* I know right? Then maybe you get an hour to yourself before you should really get to bed but unfortunately, that long awaited hour, comes AFTER others responsibilities are either done, or put in motion. 
---
Your entire comment just kinda whispers ‚Äòdouche‚Äô and the username doesn‚Äôt argue against it. I mean, you choose one example of loud background noise and go off on a tangent to include how you do things better. 
---
Could just be me though. 
---
Good day. 
---
Direct lan to PS4
---
This will do it.
---
I usually record a lot of my trades for risky items like that so that way if I do get banned I can contact Bethesda and hopefully clear it up (while at the same time getting the other person in trouble) but with the Hunters Long Coat you‚Äôre fine. As long as Bethesda cares you can get it legitimately.
---
It might have been mad luck
---
I‚Äôll be back on in a second. You ready?
---
Even if you're not at that workshop?  Hmmm, this guy was killing me and all my friends.  Even on fresh life, no engagement the guy was 1 or 2 shotting us without fighting back.
---
Maybe we had a workshop, but we weren't in a workshop.
---
What is the cap?
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer u/kindofsquishy u/ladydevann
---
&gt;More than one legendary off 3 star mobs all the time
---
Wait... Really? I have 150+ hours and I have *never* seen 2 drop on the same mob. Lots of people say luck doesn't affect number/quality of drops, just durability... I think that may be bull.
---
And I‚Äôm pretty sure 94 had one because they were set up as a peaceful, loving community whose entire goal was to establish peace in the wasteland. 
---
That doesn‚Äôt sound like a duper
---
If you're set to auto and in a team, then people can't hear you in area chat. That's what I'm talking about. 
---
Whatcha got for sale?
---
The pa I have isnt modded and gives me roughly 500 dr. My combat armor and perks gives me 450dr. Unless there is radiation around, I dont use the pa. Its so much nicer for me to not have the pa ui crowding my view or hear the clunking of the pa. I can also sneak with regular armor and get bonus damage, which I dont get with pa.
---
I‚Äôve wanted open PvP since the beginning. Funny thing is, the radio station that lets you do this with consenting players never has anyone in it. Most of my PvP comes from defending other players from base griefers. I‚Äôm not going to create a new character after putting ~200 hours in my current character, especially now when I get all of maybe 2-3 hours to play with school and work.  I‚Äôm just not going to play it if that is the case.
---
I think that resetting everyone will only benefit those that have countless hours to put back into the game and it is unfair to the players that can‚Äôt re-grind the nuke zone for hours at a time. People keep complaining about speculation on how it is even going to work and it is aggravating. If you don‚Äôt want to get one shot, don‚Äôt play the survival mode. My character is a glass cannon and could one shot you even without a legendary (full rifleman dragon anyone?) so TSE weapons aren‚Äôt even the problem. Just one of my quantum grenades could kill you multiple times over.   Same thing applies to a melee build, especially with the multitude of mutations that make you the Predator. 
---
Thanks.
---
I am killing assasin sentinels. I don't get damage from most TSE's. You don't need any legendary equipment to survive few TSE shotty shots.
---
But I actually like no legendary weapons in survival mode idea.
---
sounds more like trash legendaries someone threw away after doing a white springs legendary farm i do shit like that all the time most of the junk legendaries i get go into the lunch pail outside the golf course 
---
Same here, I have been playing the Anthem demo all weekend and its a really nice game after putting all that time in fallout. I have 644 hours in fallout and the crashes have been getting to me, tired of lack of attention to problems for the game. 
---
All weekend I crashed twice in Anthem. Tried to play fallout early this morning and crashed 3 times in less than an hour. 
---
I agree, its definitely lacking a bit in comparison to 4 (not to mention other series), and from what ive come to understand, 4 was lacking in comparison to all the previous titles. That being said, i loved 4. Theres so much that was in that game (not to mention what eventually was added) that i dont understand why theres been so much omitted. 90% of what was in 4 should have been in this game (item wise at least, and the ability to display teddies üòâ), and everything theyve been drip feeding us should have been completely new assets.
---
Blah blah blah other ranty stuff. Its seriously been exhausting. I love Fallout and i want to love this game. Ive been playing it exclusively as of late, I just want it to be better.
---
It may as well have been SP. I play like that mainly to begin with, but its discouraging to try to team up and BOOM! games crashed..
---
Wow, Godwin's Law on r/fo76 of all place. Impressive. Anyways, your comparison sucks bc there was no real reason to blame the Jews for anything post-WWI, whereas dupers can definitely be blamed for the part they played (however big that may be) in making the game worse. 
---
Weird.
---
Maybe try some resets. Could be the game but 7 dcs in a short amount of time is abnormal.
---
Pretty sure? I honestly have been dropping or taking them straight to a vendor because I didn't think they were good at all. I fully accept I might be wrong though.
---
Okay fair enough
---
You understand that the dishwasher was but one, and I believe the most relatable, example right? I could live in an older house close to highway which noise I may find soothing but others may not feel the same way. 
---
Na, only the first update after the game launched mentioned it.
---
Same with vaults and other things that have never been mentioned since.
---
When my group does a whitesprings run we put the legendaries that we don't want into the ice machine next to the golf club
---
Recon effect(same effect as recon scopes where it puts a marker over things you look at through the scope) would also be pretty useful, though it would need to be changed so the markers don't disappear as soon as you switch away from the binoculars.
---
I am just entering what I suspect is 'end game' at level 105. I only just finished mistress of mysteries andys BoS quests and already feel like the quests i've saved are running out.  Love the idea as a 100+ criteria so people have something to dive into late game. As an expansion it would be an awesome way to continue the story, while opening some open world involvement like the nukes do now. 
---
i mean the easiest way to look at it is that not every drop can be useful. Any game with 'legendary' drops has a ton of garbage that can drop as part of the loot table as well. 
---
Not to mention just because one person thinks it's useless doesn't mean that everybody does (look at the wood armor, for example).
---
This. Posts like this one make this sub a toxic shithole that only leads to harassing people who want to play together. Notice how all the comments about people saying the game shouldn't have launch in such an unfinished state are all downvoted into the negative.
---
People on this sub honestly beleive you cannot criticize this abysmal launch without being a duper.
---
Yes, I have had this happen more than once.
---
No, i wont do it because I have nothing to prove to you. You fail at basic reading comprehension. Its funny you thing my pc is incapable of playing this game, yet I've been playing it with minor annoyances. Again thanks for the input im done talking with the real troll, you haven't provided one shred of valuable input. good day. 
---
You did so good with these ideas that‚Äôs all I have to say just great job. 
---
I run a vats critical build and have a lever action with +50% vats critical damage, tried to kill a player that had 200 caps bounty with a vats crits sneak headshot and it barely did anything to him, he just turned around and sniped me with his explosive shotgun. Respawned, rinse and repeat. Barely touched his health with constant vats crits and I die within a second and that's good PvP to you? 
---
Its totally useless - Bethesda needs to fix tents big time.  About the only thing that fits seems to be sleeping bags.
---
You can use showers too.
---
And you can use radx diluted to not surpress mutations.
---
Is that also what happened with far harbor? 
---
There's one other (quest) character we're led to believe made it to a vault although it's left unclear. 
---
I don't want to say more than that.
---
That's because the plants are objects that would take damage and be destroyed. Plants are like walls on your CAMP. Ever notice how plants created by the game can't be destroyed? But plants created by you can?
---
I wasn't in power armor. No. 
---
There's some kind of problem with loading base id and skin. They seem to load differently. I've had self destructing mole miners and mirelurk king screeching mole rats.
---
Yes there was an infinite xp glitch with a grenade trap.
---
I appreciate the offer and HAPPY CAKE DAY üíï I‚Äôm on PS4 though :( 
---
Simple solution everything that you want to show/put needs to be also in stash.Also we need more stash space...
---
All I can say is ahhhhhhmennnn
---
You're exactly right. This had to be junk legendaries left after a farming run.  The trash can outeside the shop in Whitespring with the power armor stations amd workbenches is a common place for people to dump stiff they don't want.
---
Lol yeah you have to go into these games with a certain mindset. And my friend was in the "fallout 4" mindset and he was sorely disappointed. Also you have to commit to these types of games, its very grindy. And to a casual gamer its a huge turn off. But to people like me who love the excuse to dump time into a game, i love it.
---
&gt; Video games aren't real
---
Video games exist. Are you trying to say that the events depicted take place in a fictional universe, and are thereby devoid of value?
---
That's easily refuted. The characters may be fictional marionettes but they are animated by real people. People value their time, and from that flows an expectation that the time invested is not subverted.
---
Moss Covered Mole Miners
---
I'm not defending anything, I'm pointing out that generalizations are stupid. And it doesn't take a genius or a specific age to make that point.
---
The OP's points about 76 are alright, but there was no need for the introductory blanket prejudice.
---
Xbone
---
Charleston station vendor has excavator mod?
---
Hey i forget to put in my gamertag for you it is Pure Objectivez
---
but what if I nuke an area and the G.E.C.K it?
---
I absolutely get your comparison but I am at a loss for as to who is down voting you.  However hyperbolic, you are effectively agreeing with Op and agreement is actually getting up voted.  Generally any talk of responsibility on the dupers and exporters part is received very poorly in this subreddit.
---
Ive been able to (xbox) but you have to look almost at the ground for them to appear. But if you place then move you can get around that
---
Run away coward troll hahahahahaha
---
I've never even seen a crossbow drop. 
---
It‚Äôs really more about someone upsetting someone in a video game or over a video game. Because the point is being upset over a video game is childish and thus makes one a crybaby. 
---
Both people are upset over what someone else is doing in relation to a video game. So again according to slug, both parties are crybabies.
---
This really is a pointless argument that only a troll would continue to debate. But keep at it pal.
---
Thanks, I'm glad to hear it's not some intentional mechanic. The idea that someone could completely shut down a crit build with a single mod or perk scares me.
---
https://support.xbox.com/en-AU/xbox-one/errors/error-code-8027025a
---
...I don‚Äôt think you know what a scam is
---
Whenever I see the event pop up, and there‚Äôs already someone there. I don‚Äôt even bother. But yeah.. it‚Äôs annoying. I was running around actually defending them and repair. Dude just chilled on top of a shelf and 1 shot every enemy. Including the legendaries. 
---
Technically I would have lost 1000 caps so it is kinda a scam
---
A lot of this should be added in to the game. Not the atomic shop. It‚Äôs actually pretty jarring that you‚Äôre all for spending real life large amounts of money on these items. I remember playing Fallout 4 and just downloading mods for free including over thousands of items. Now everyone‚Äôs just willing to drop $5,$10,$20 on one item....? It‚Äôs a shame to what gaming and this community has become. 
---
Well, on this character specifically, I have logged over 250 hours. Definitely have had more than 1 Legendary drop off a mob before. Not sure why people only read what everyone else decides what "is" the standard. I guess if I made a YouTube video proving this then everyone would have to say it happens or it's a glitch. I honestly have a great time playing my luck character and I have access to other loot tables than regular players with low end luck, 9 or lower.
---
As an amateur radio operator and avid fallout fan this is my #1 request. 
---
A bad deal maybe, but by no means a scam. A scam would be if he took your caps and gave you nothing back
---
Or let us make custom perk layouts and map those to a hot swap.
---
I will admit to gaining access to ones camp by using the crafting bench exploit but in my defense they were not there, I was finishing up my walking over the map collecting junk run, I was over encumbered and half my armor was destroyed and needed repair. I did my thing didn't wreak anything in his/her camp then fast traveled away after leaving a gift in a dropped bag of 1x bulk everything. 
---
Anthem demo out this weekend. All of my friends have been playing it instead.
---
Some of them sound like they‚Äôre saying mum, catches me off guard a lot of times lmao.
---
Agreed. Why the fuck is everyone so for them in this game. It‚Äôs sickening honestly. I downloaded mods in Fallout 4 that consisted of thousands of items and now people are wanting to dish out real life money for 1 item. 
---
I hope so.. getting banned for a dress is a joke...
---
That would be awesome
---
Whenever I get a defend workshop message. I immediately loot the generator thingy a the ammo factory and prepare for the game to crash.
---
I found those plans south of the bog. Between the grove and the fissure site (not prime) you'll find a bunch of trees where a trench leads to some tunnels. There's two skeleton here, one holding a random "rare" plan in his hands.
---
A zooming effect would be cool. So would NV.
---
Underarmor is the only thing.
---
It's a random thing to find occasional mods that just read as Tesla coils or rusty knuckles etc. If you check the details it should read that it scraps to Black Titanium, these are for the Excavator PA. I have got the coils mod on one chest piece, and one that increases my carry weight. But explosive vents will be what I really want to equip for SBQ battles to deal with adds.
---
Haha - That stupid phrase will randomly pop into my head during the day and Ill silently chuckle to myself. 
---
They scripted the bots very well. The humor works perfectly. Like dad jokes - but from a emotionless, logical robot. Lol
---
I fixed it
---
I feel the same. I only briefly carried it, too heavy. 
---
The OP clearly just wants to feel superior, as do the people upvoting him.  People were doing this shit in Diablo 2 18 years ago.  Unless this "younger generation" was crashing servers in their diapers, it's not a generational thing.
---
I remember duping, exploiting, etc, in online games going back farther than that.  I remember it happening in MUDs around 1995.  BBS door games in 1992.  I have 0 doubt it was happening in the 80s on the MUDs of that era too, but it was before my time.
---
OP doesn't actually know what he's talking about.  Odds are he's just a noob to online gaming.  For anybody that's actually been playing multiplayer games online for decades, it's easy to tell how wrong the OP and his upvoters are.
---
Downvoted and reported for not having Spoiler tag. I already knew this but would‚Äôve been pissed if I hadn‚Äôt.
---
This is happening to me off and on.  I thought it was because of somebody in game doing something they aren't supposed to.
---
Well, I would say nothing and everything is a toilet now. 
---
Yes, but I would imagine "GECK plants" would have a tag to allow them to be destroyed. 
---
Yeah, and the snallygasters are probably the most mutant looking creatures so the whole thing really suggested that nuking an area would bury its buildings and spawn hellish mobs. 
---
Most of the time the chat simply doesn‚Äôt work for no apparent reason.  I think the coexistence of party chat and game chat are a buggy combination because this isn‚Äôt the only game I‚Äôve had this problem with, but it‚Äôs a bummer.  Need an ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt hear you‚Äù emoji
---
Is it in Norway or in Sweden where trying to escape from prison is not punishable, because they understand that it as normal human instinct to try escape from prison. So instead of creating shitty prisons with weak security and then telling how it is prisoners fault for escaping the prison, they make sure that prison actually has security that prevents inmates from getting out. So I'd say it is Beth fault for not testing their "Prison".
---
Afraid not. Haven't actually been back since I posted this and totally forgot to check back here.
---
See. Here's the issue. Everyone talks about how the silliness of the items in fallout is a rip-off of fortnite, despite the fact that Fallout has a longer history of the absurd. 
---
But instead they want them to rip-off other survival/building games and drop a big part of what makes the Fallout setting standout. The contrast. The seriousness. The silly. The sad, the hilarious. The vile. The Naive. 
---
I largely assume the people are less Fallout Franchise fans and more survival building fans. 
---
Cause anyone who claims this game is more silly than the community's darling, Fallout NV? They obviously didn't play through Big Mt. 
---
Notice a lack of humour or light heartedness in this item suggestion thread or any others. 
---
It's always Armour racks! Military stuff! I want to build a bunker or fortress! 
---
At least this OP had more variance as I did quite like the responders stuff.
---
Right? Even with an unarmed build I one shot the ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù there now, so I grab one of the regular shotguns off the miners and use that to tag until everyone has tagged.  It‚Äôs not hard, don‚Äôt be a dick!
---
I got to the last part of the glass caverns at level 30, totally unprepared to fight the scorchbeast. I popped a stealthboy, ran onto Taggerdy's corpse to grab the holotape, and ran out without even breaking a [caution]. Didn't get to enjoy the scenery all too much.
---
A gek has been shown in a locked vault
---
Swedish?
---
Only if the clothes are under armor
---
I've seen that but I think they still work even when they're not moving and no light comes out of them. It's definitely annoying tho
---
Also you can't move them without them snapping to the wrong place, you have to store them (remove them) and then replace them.
---
Just make sure to scrap the wires first because "orphaned" wires still count against your budget and are impossible to free up when they're banished to the shadow realm
---
That's cool.
---
I feel like it's forgotten. It could be an epic weapon with different ammo types. Real life arrows are designed to do different things.  On top of the real stuff like bleeding you could go all Rambo. Exploding bolts, a bolt that was a homing beacon giving everyone a better vats chance to hit, a Hallucegen bolt to daze big critters, the possibilities are endless.
---
How did you do that slow cinematic traveling when you play guitar?
---
Poor you üò¢
---
I want a coffin bed. 
---
Do you think these exploits shouldn't have been found or discovered? Do you think Bethesda should NOT have any back end or security features?
---
Many people have no interest in using mics in fallout, myself included. To each their own, and by the count mic vs no mic... it looks like the majority don't want to use mics either. 
---
This is honestly why you have to limit what the online version has because every object you add is another for their back end system to track.
---
Fallout 4 is a single player environment that has a dedicated machine (your console or PC) keeping track of that locally.  Fallout 76 is an online game that now has to interact with a server online to track all those objects.  That‚Äôs why increasing limits to CAMP sizing and such are exponentially huge an impact to the server back end.  That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt just make everyone happy with limitless storage containers or all things Fallout 4 had.
---
This is why Bethesda said a few weeks back when they were going to increase limits on CAMP storage, that they do so when they know the servers can handle it.  Increasing those limits need to ensure the servers can - and those improvements only happen if the server code is optimize to run faster, more memory/cpu/disk is added to run it, the back end database is also increased/optimized, more DB fields to track new item types, the network communications can also handle it and so on.   The world of local vs online games is totally different... once you realize that, then you start to become more realistic with what you ask for.
---
Thunder power station, then the lake by it with mirelurk queen.
---
Both parties are found guilty. I've played games where duping was found and the instantly locked servers within an hour and did a roll back and fixed the issue.
---
Yep, you will need a terminal to change them all at once
---
you can change them all at once with a terminal 
---
I just wish the paint schemes worked for a larger variety of items. 
---
Never thought of this back when i said it while doing GTAs glitches and exploits for infinite money buts it‚Äôs hilarious 
---
Good advice. I‚Äôll look into those. Thanks.
---
No, according to slug (i clearly laid it out above) he doesn't fit the profile of a crybaby.
---
You can't make up words in his argument. There are more words in your paraphrase then there are in slug's comment.  Use only what slug said.
---
How about storing all but 1 in your stash, then the mission is repeatable by taking them out 1 at a time? I've not tried it, but now I think of it! 
---
Yeah sorry it's hard to relate when your dishwasher is on a different floor entirely from your gaming setup and even when it's on it's not very loud. Hopefully things work out for you, you seem to be having a bad day.
---
Wait until you have a perk point to spend,  click ‚Äòchoose perk‚Äô and it will be under Agility. It unlocks at level 22 so it will be there for you for sure. 
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
I think you missed the point. My issue is why are they so much heavier and harder to upkeep when they do **exponentially lower dps?**
---
The damage should be doubled to tripled. 
---
General consensus seems to be that wood armor only comes in 1* and no one has been able to provide a pic saying otherwise.
---
Would really love it to be possible though
---
Yes 
---
Is there "police" going after them or something? 
---
Shoot me a text on here so I can invite u

If you could get legendary mods people would get overpowered guns with the snap of their fingers. Not gonna happen. I do agree that it can be disappointing but I play the game to be rewarding and not easy 
---
*slow clap*
---
Would be a fantastic idea. They could even hire a radio DJ and stream 24 hours a day. Just make it live.
---

---
More 'grit' wastlander stuff. Not wastland theme park. 
---
Or more vault stuff. Which I feel should be cheaper in price then any other. Its the brand ID let more people have it quicker.
---
I would like some cosmetics tied to achievements in the game. Not just the quest achievement ones. Like the whole things you earn atoms for. Switch out some for strait up rewards. People will feel like they have earned more and keep trying for others.
---
Did it not turn into spoiled meat? Food goes bad in Fo76
---
&gt;Not sure why people only read what everyone else decides what "is" standard
---
Because this isn't something that is easily testable, so there isn't much else to go on...
---
I'm not saying you're bull.
---
I'm saying what I've been hearing is likely bull, based on your experience. I haven't heard anyone else talking about multiple drops from the same mob.

No offense, dude, but how fragile is your masculinity that you think the character on a computer screen somehow defines you?
---
Did you refuse to play Tomb Raider, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Portal because it had a female protagonist? When you got the part in The Last of Us when you had to play as Ellie, did you throw down the controller in disgust and say "fuck that, bro. I ain't gonna play as no chick. You need to man up Joel."
---
Let me hit you with some knowledge. There are only two reasons why people play a given gendered character in a game:
---
1. Because that's the only option presented by the game.
---
2. Because they want to.
---
That's it. And trying to fit people into a box because their "want to" doesn't match your "want to" is stupid.
---
The only time i think its a duper is when i get one shot by someone, and we aren't in pvp. 
---
It does I think but i fast travel oncce and my 70 stack of food goes away and ive farmed it to keep me company for a few days only to disapear all at once
---
I don‚Äôt need the armor but I‚Äôll use kt
---
You have a mic
---
Does anyone know where you can find that blue jumpsuit? 
---
You can also switch to the 3rd person view when landing. ( depends if you play 3rd or 1st person )
---
I actually stopped playing fo76 solely because the sensitivity was so fucked. I've become so accustomed to the customizations of analog stick deadzones and sensitivity differences between scopes. Playing fallout feels so primitive in the first person shooter aspect. I know it may not be "needed", but it does no damage adding it anyway. If you don't care you won't use it but the people who like fine tuning their aiming will be so much more pleased with the game
---
Plans for Ultracite Automatic Barrels are for the Ultracite Laser gun. Plans for the gun itself can sometimes be found on the Watoga vendors, and the weapon is also a rare drop on high-level enemies.
---
So part of it is that I use Good Doggy, Cola Nut, Lead Belly, and Slow Metabolism when I eat/drink. Those let me significantly reduce my inventory space if I only carry Nuka and Dog Food. So it‚Äôs either swap perks or be bogged down. But I don‚Äôt want them active all the time, so every time I eat it‚Äôs a Perk change. I suppose I could change my play style, but a lot of menu work could be done away with if perk cards were removed.
---
How do you know the gun/items weren't purchased or found legitimately? The actual issues here is in the programming.
---
Could you fire one bolt and pick up two?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar/comments/akfl6u/price_check/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
I havent used it yet! 
---
The plan for these is often sold by the Watoga vendors. (The laser pistol at least; not sure I've seen the gatling for sale.)
---
Some of this stuff should be in the game without giving them another 20+ fucking dollars
---
I have had it with the scorchbeasts.  They are no fun at all. I am a melee build so I already have e to use weapons I don't like, and then I just aim at the awful Sonic attack, trying not to have a seizure while blindly shooting. In the rare event they do land the fight becomes fun and interesting, but it does not take long before they are in the sky again. I can appreciate a tough fight, I can't appreciate an annoying one that makes me not want to pick up the game.
---
I came to say this basically, things that affect gameplay such as the doorbell (great idea by the way) should be put into the game as plans. 
---
Cosmetic and ONLY cosmetic plans (ie different walls, carpet and door skins) should be in the Atom shop. 
---
Under no circumstances should any player be able to get any kind of advantage through the Atom shop, that starts us on the slippery road to ‚Äúpay to a win‚Äù.
---
mmmmmhm, you taste that? tastes like bait
---
Wdym
---
I‚Äôm not even talking about ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù aspect. 
---
Resetting modem?   I am over 10 drops now...last few have been immediate upon landing in the world.

They are like supersized rats from hell given they can burrow and pop up right by you.  Run and they just keep teleporting near you far longer than your sprint can ever do.  Honestly alone makes me go another way when I see them.
---
How is that in any way morally similar. It's like you think every crime has the same moral implications.
---
I don't want to hear anyone's voice. That is the opposite of immersion to me.

Oh yeah I see where you‚Äôre coming from too I just expanded upon it. No dev will turn off a revenue stream though, no matter how stupid it is. MT‚Äôs are too widely accepted and that sucks for gaming in general.
---
I‚Äôd rather the lesser of two evils if you catch my drift?
---
They are investing their time into a zero policed reality.
---
Always thinking if people like this also cheat at board games they play with friends and family.
---
Does it give you a sense of pride and accomplishment?
---
We‚Äôve done variants of designs before however We won‚Äôt be rereleasing this design.  
---
&gt; This is something I highly doubt most kids are capable of, for that you'd need an immature adult.
---
I'd hardly call someone immature for making real money from exploits in a game.
---
Personally, I hate it. Hackers, dupers, all that shit in every game gets on my nerves.
---
But looking at it from a different perspective, it's wholly the developers fault for allowing these practices to exist and for people to profit off of it. If you couldn't dupe or cheat so easily then the problem wouldn't exist, or at least not at a large enough scale to worry about. As it stood for 2 months, any idiot with an internet connection could watch a youtube video and then recreate the dupes.
---
At this point the servers need a hard reset, or go down the diablo route where there's 'seasons' with fresh characters and leaderboards. If they actually make the new survival mode able to use your old characters then I truly think that will be the last nail in the coffin for a long-term player base.
---
He did you dirty. That‚Äôs why I never put things up for trade until I get my items first.

Had one last night rush the gate by the station with a bunch of other SMs. Surprising.

I cant find the post right now. But some dude posted a video where he ate a lot of bobbleheads and then tried to kill someone. He did 5~10% damage. The anti-pvp protection is strong.

And then you could offer up caps in exchange for juicy rumors, or battle stories occurring in Appalachia, that you could broadcast to your listeners.

I get that the Fallout franchise is suppose to have humor to it, but Fallout 76 to me crosses the humor mark straight into just bizarre, goofy, unrealistic, child like , stupid and cheesy. 
---
I read the first line and I read it in Arin‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúThis game is fuckin AAYESSSSS‚Äù 
---
I've tried a few things to see if I can trigger anything but no luck... I wonder if it was originally something for a quest that was cut

Random event - she spawns anywhere.
---
No, I was asking why Charleston cuz usually ppl server hop free state and Watoga those have better chance for PA mods. And as for excavator explosive vents I ve seen it multiple times yesterday when I was looking for T51b mods
---
Crashing, infinite load screens, team members being inviable, and other bugs that force your to restart the game have gotten ridiculous. On top of that half the time when I play I am managing stash space, and the other half I am being bombarded by an endless wave of scorch beast echo attacks (I really hate those things. They are not fun to fight. Give me a death claw any day or high level super mutant or something. I don't want an easy win, I want to not be annoyed). I like the game, but I am liking it less and less everyday :( 
---
See I was stupid but i don‚Äôt really care about the trading thing. It‚Äôs just the ban
---
How the fuck have y‚Äôall gotten to level 200 already
---
Proctor Teagan-bot, I like it lol.
---
You think so?  It isn't as if you are making money from it so I would imagine you could play anything
---
You mention a lot of aesthetic, mostly fluff‚Äìnot that it means they're bad or not worth doing just that they should only be pushed after we have basic CAMP management tools we still don't have yet‚ÄìCAMP additions. 
---
For example if you expand your CAMP and find there's some slight obstruction or just need a tiny bit more of space between your CAMP and that flag pole or whatever, there's no easy way to shift all of your CAMP over by just that tiny bit of distance you'd need. You'd need to manually break down everything (which is a headache in itself because you need to pointlessly do it in a certain order lest you get another dumb "Cannot remove... would make part of CAMP inaccessible yadda yadda..." or either pay the move cost just because you need to move a few feet over or server hop until your spot is taken to get it automatically stored. 
---
The real kicker is that the blue print system doesn't really function for almost any kind of intricate CAMP you build because it's almost a certainty that there would be some part of the structure that system just doesn't like for whatever reason and now has to break it up into a bunch of pieces that you might not even be able to fit together and just have to start from scratch anyway.
---
______________
---
But anyway while we're on the topic of ATOM shop suggestions I'd have to say I was completely dumbfounded at the sheer stupidity that the floor/foundation texture set I bought off there only had the full sized floor pieces available.
---
I mean the designers obviously had to know that there's also 1√ó2 and 1√ó1 floor size pieces and people would be expecting that the floor cosmetics would apply to all the floor types and not just 1/3^rd of them. That's something that would really, and rightfully so, piss people off if they spent actual money on that kind of ATOM shop item while it only gives you some of what it claims to offer.
---
Had the same happen twice, the other time i found a legendary eyebot. 
---
Why is something like this downvoted? It's a gigantic flaw in the current trading system.
---
Still the same as you left it.
---
What are you talking about?
---
In short, they have no idea what they are doing still.
---
Yeah. But Bethesda may get in trouble for ‚Äúpromoting‚Äù players to make radio stations with copyright music. I mean I would love player radio stations.
---
Ah, my bad. I was just floating about that side of the map. Running from station to station to see what they had, it just threw me when this crop farm showed up next to the station there
---
You play the game to be rewarding. When you work hard for the reward do you feel a sense of pride and accomplishment 
---
Because I would say almost every item being sold like that has been duped. Hence why they were making money from it
---
Do you even know what a duper is? 
---
As of what has happened so far, they locked the front door then thieves broke in through the window. They repaired and reinforced the window then they came in through the vents, they've blocked off the vents and now they're coming through the sewer
---
I play the game so that the time I‚Äôm spending on it is working towards a challenge. If it easily gives me everything I want, there is no sense of a challenge for it. 
---
How could tou legitimately gain enough damage to one shot someone when you should be doing slap damage?
---
I haven't dropped one in awhile because I'm pretty over fighting the SQB. It feels like a resource drain without a good pay off. There are better place to farm legendaries and experience. 
---
If I do drop a nuke it's normally on some random part of the map to see if I can find anything new. 
---
I‚Äôve always had a fear of that happening but they just block you. Never heard of it actually happening let alone someone getting you banned. 
---
Thank you
---
Same happens with. 50 cal or other stuff which doesn't have replacement receivers, they forgot to add standard receiver as an option on them.
---
I‚Äôm not making up words, his comment implies it. If you read the OP, it mentions nothing about being killed, and slugs comment is calling OP a crybaby for complaining about getting killed in a video game. 
---
I have seen a lot of people complaining about how they have to swap perk cards to unlock a terminal or a door lock, but that's just when you want to do too many things at once. 
---
Personally I've stopped swapping and the game feels much smoother. When you say
---
&gt; I suppose I could change my play style, but a lot of menu work could be done away with if perk cards were removed.
---
you mean having static perks like in older games? Because that's doable.
---
I don‚Äôt really care about him taking my stuff but that ban is hurting
---
&gt;So you‚Äôd commit a felony if the effort was very minimal?
---
The existence of law enforcement is proof that the answer is 'Yes' for a not-ignorable number of people.
---
Their logic: It's totally possible for me to kill people by running them over in my car. The police didn't **prevent** me from doing it, so it's absolutely fine and all part of life.
---
What, now they want to try and *ban* me from society by going to prison? Total BS!
---
Conclusion: just because you *can* do something; doesn't mean you *should*.
---
Maybe following NMS in the sense that it is improving over time? The first major patch with actual changes which they seem to be shooting for in March will be a pvp-enabled mode with no slap damage (full pvp), limited respawn, no map blips for players, and when you die you drop some of your aid items as well, plus a leader board. Essentially this will be a Raider mode. They said they would make new content announcements closer to the release of this new mode
---
I noticed that the orphan wire thing goes away for me after signing out and back in. Although, I use very little wiring because I‚Äôm OCD with conduits.
---
I would love explosive and fire bolts, even if you have to craft them specifically (since they don't seem to plan on having explosive legendary mod).
---
Can just be similar to crafting a grenade, but as we do in America, put it *on a stick*
---
Hmmm, I'd be curious as to what lead to me to the situation described above then.  Maybe workshop
---
Get off my lawn! Lol, I camp there as well!
---
You think so?  It isn't as if you are making money from it so I would imagine you could play anything.
---
Hang a family heirloom out on the front porch with a sign saying 'I won't do anything if you take this' and then try and claim on insurance. See what happens.
---
Cosidering the Fog Crawlers and whatnot, I'd like to think so :)
---
I was givin the materials, just had to find a weapons workbench, which was on the 2nd level 
---
You are merely repeating the justification mocked in the OP - but your explanation simply exposes how cheap an argument it is: reality is most certainly policed in this instance, both informally (the community openly loathes and decries cheaters) and directly (they get banned).
---
Yeah i know i had the same issue aswell on xbox. Just be patient when u load. 
---
I can't remember the full line but it ends with "but if they do... no refunds"
---
I see your point although I don't think it would hold up in court.  I've been blasting Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie the last couple days.  I guess we'll see what happens!
---
I‚Äôm picturing big bulky power armor, with some of those little slip cover hospital booties on now. And I can‚Äôt stop giggling. 
---
Yeah but you have to de-equip any cosmetic clothes. You'll show as your character with armor pieces and underarmor instead. There are various types of underarmor but you usually can't see it well under the other pieces.
---
I can't be sure, but I think the winner gets a baguette,  some foie gras, and a red balloon.
---
Yeah I always have to do this, sometimes I load in then get another loading screen after (PS4)
---
Make sure you understand mechanics though.
---
For instance if you own a workshop i can start and stop a take over of it then come find you and kill you as there's no slap damage involved. I can level your base bounty free as well.
---
And until you logoff that sticks.
---
Then layered on top is being in a team. Everyone in the team gets flagged in the above scenario.
---
This is the worst trading system i have ever seen since i started gaming in the 90s.Even MU Online had a better trading system 20 years ago. TWENTY years ago. Bethesda is like 30 years behind with online games.I see a lot of people trading items on bazaar and i'm like "yo wtf am i supposed to give an item for free and trust you do the same?" 
---
Drills and syringers I agree with but I see no reason to remove wood armor.
---
Weightless Shrouded is awesome for my stealthy character, and goes great with the cultist theme.  
---
&gt;For those who didn't know wood armor can only be one star, atleast that is what i have been told, and i have never gotten more than 1 star on wood armor
---
Then you fix it so it can get more than one star.  You don't shoot the cook.
---
Not many people play Luck in general because there really aren't many good perks from it. It's a weird playstyle but can confirm that I have had multiple Legendaries from one mob. It doesnt happen often.
---
I would assume that our characters are objects (basically a big box filled with little boxes) so from the programmer's perspective we're just a nondescript box (object). 
---
To see the values of certain aspects of our characters (e.g inventory) the programmer would request a specific aspects of the character with
---
 printf(character.inventory); 
---
In terms of the size of the code for the actual object (what dimensions the boxes are and how many sub-boxes are in the prime box), that is dependent upon how the data structure itself is set up.
---
For example, complexity can be removed by abstraction (basically replacing several lines of code with a single call to a separate program, called a function, containing those several lines). If all abstraction was removed, a programs size would increase considerably. 
---
There are modders who would be able to give you approximations of how the character looks, from mining the source code, but MMOs usually have some data held server side, so it's hard to know definitively.
---
When we're logged in, the character (object) is constantly updating location, not instantaneously (if you've been sent back to the door after you enter a building quickly that's caused by the delay), but close enough to it. Other sub-boxes might also be continuously updating, but other than that, it will be contingent on what the character is doing, e.g whilst shooting, your ammunition depletes server side.
---
This is all generality, and I'd be interested in knowing how it's different, but I hope it's helpful
---
There‚Äôs a crossbow ??? 
---
I totally get that. My favorite game of all time is Borderlands 2 and my favorite thing to do in that game is just farm for weapons. 
---
I enjoy the grind in this game as well, but there is just less to acquire (comparing to BL2) and when you don't get *anything* that is useful in about a week of farming then you start to get a bit discouraged. 
---
Ik east of whitesprings theres a behemoth in the middle of a lake, maybe it came from there. 
---
Those who do this do it for the express reason of ruining it for others...
---
I think we might get something similar with the loose ends at A.T.L.A.S. so we can control weather.
---
No honor.
---
Sucks dude. They have a block player switch servers option intended for this scenario. If it helps I‚Äôve witnessed a level 15 full raider power armor take out a level 70 also in power armor three times in a row due to weapon scaling. (I was stealthed out of sight and healing him in the background so that helped)
---
What console?
---
Is that a reference to la ballon rouge? My dad loved that film!

She's still alive out there, and she's pissed

Wouldn't the brighter mod have a name that says it's brighter?
---
I think you answered your own question, sorry.
---
They "fixed" server hopping
---
You trigger a 20h cooldown before you can loot those springs again by being on a different server
---
Thanks for the update.

There's a roleplaying board game based on Fallout, and I was in my favourite geek store when I saw they had a pack of nuka cola caps for this game there. I bought the caps and gave a handful to each of my Fallout playing friend with their Xmas gifts. I have a small pile of em on my table for the times I need a stimpack. 
---
Morgantown is full of them.
---
I sold alot of 10mms to the Morgantown train station to get my 200 caps
---
How about... instead of ban hammering everyone you fix the exploits? How about not blaming people that have paid you money for your product? There are people that have done nothing that violates your terms and agreements and they are being banned. Do you not sense a class action lawsuit brewing? If tses weren‚Äôt so rare or glowing ones weren‚Äôt nearly impossible to fight without either a melee build or tse, people wouldn‚Äôt be exploiting. Bethesda has sat on their hands and allowed all of this crap to happen, then they ban people that have given them money and some nothing wrong. I‚Äôve never personally experienced a complaint so blatantly mishandling enforcing their terms and conditions. Ffs you could shit down the servers for a limited time and fix these issues. Why did you allow the board making glitch to exist for so long? Why are you banning people with no warning? Why does it take just one air apple to file a report to have someone‚Äôs account banned indefinitely. Unprofessional and disorganized doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe the problems Bethesda is facing. I can‚Äôt believe no one has started a class action lawsuit. Bethesda is stealing money from people. Not to mention taking part of the soul from people that have put 1000 hours into their game. With the flip of a switch, Bethesda can just erase hundreds of hours of people‚Äôs efforts and take the $60 they were given for their product. This just ain‚Äôt right and something needs to be done. 
---
You can still server hop at dolly sods and get springs off the two Yao Guai that spawn there 
---
Quick tip max out your contractor perk or have someone share the maxed out card with you. Dramatically reduces how much flux you need for the decontamination shower
---
I don't think you understand what he means. The Excavator comes pre built with a headlamp. He knows it's not a bright one hence the stupidity of the mod.
---
Also there is no bright headlamp for the excavator, another stupid detail that's been over looked. Surely you'd want the mining armour to have a nice bright light?! 
---
No prob 
---
So true. Wish there were more machines and functional items and appliances of all kinds.
---
Did you miss the part where she was stabbed? 
---
Thx!!! Off to Morgantown..I'm going for a pistol build this time around
---
Yeah, its worth a shot.
---
Also if you dc quickly try waiting for the world to load.
---
Going straight to pipboy or map is sketchy on login
---
Bethesda isnt used of doing online games lol
---
Same for me on, PC.  And not just clipboards, anything in the open world.  I feel like items that spawn in the world are on an account-bound RNG timer.
---
Make sure to check Camp McClintock, all the blue bins inside the main entrance has clipboards spilling out of them.
---
Ive put countless hours in farming gear. I do have a full set of legendary marine but not all 3 star or the exact stats i want. Guess what im not looking on ebay to buy my items. It should be very difficult to farm these items. Thats what grinding in a survival game is all about. We want player trading. It the duping that is the real problem. I think Bethesda has patched it out finally but the damage is already done. Lets just pray these duped items dont make it into the new survival mode.
---
I got it from swarm of suitors
---
Bit of a pandoras box.
---
Can't just do that for one type out of many
---
There are problems EVERYWHERE. If you say you aren't having any problems, then you aren't playing the game or you aren't being truthful with yourself. 
---
I know that,they could have hired people with experience with online games.It's not rocket science
---
I've done this before and it doesn't exactly "freeze" for me. It just hangs for a looooong time. How long have you waited after opening the Pip Boy and it hanging? Sometimes I have to wait for almost a full minute.
---
You can use the spoiler tag to obfuscate your comment.  I've done all the quests so you aren't going to ruin anything for me.
---
Vats crit sneak headshot did barely anything to him? You must have been tagging him. You need to shot him with any other weapon first, so that the tag damage is registered, and then do the vats crit shot. Rinse and repeat because you have been tagging em all those fights, probably, as the seek revenge doesnt work well vs bounty. Good vats headshots rip through anyone. The problem you just described is lack of knowledge of game mechanisms, and bad slap damage mechanism, not innate damage balance problem.
---
I think it entirely depends on the rpg elements you select.
---
I actually feel sorry for those of you who spent hundreds of hours farming that whitespring ghoul cave. 
---
If you're randomly doing it you have potential trouble but if you set up legit trades on reddit, discord and I guess the FB trade group then you have a little bit of recourse as you can then hurt their reputation for trading. Making off with one or two items isn't worth the fact they won't be able to trade anymore
---
I don't think this is the game for you.
---
I've played all the FO games and I felt that this was what it would feel like leaving a vault. No stupid missing kid or water purifier chip, just vault opens and off you go. I felt overwhelmed and a bit scared. I had to learn the hard way what I could kill and what would hand my arse to me. If they want to go on eBay or social media for their weapons and ammo, all power to them. I don't. I admit I tried to sell/swap some legendaries but quickly found this unsatisfying. I, like you, am all about role-playing. My character (Clifton Peeves) doesn't have access to social media (she also doesn't have children or a water purifier in need of a chip). She also doesn't care how other people are playing the game or the bugs or the fact that every now and then I disappear for a minute or so when I get disconnected. She just cares about surviving whilst learning about what happened before and after the bombs dropped
---
I did buy it from the Watoga vendor boy at the train station... thanks for the help!
---
It's odd, back before push to talk was enabled, I'd almost always hear some background noise from anybody I came across. Now it's usually silence, even with people I trade with. It's more an issue of human nature than anything else here
---
I wrote a long-form blog post to respond to this but its scope goes beyond what you're talking about. I respect that you've lasted this long in the franchise but let's be honest, Fallout 3 was only the *first* red flag. The original Fallout was deeply critical of American capitalism and it would have been clear to any marginally politically educated player that the US very clearly was responsible for the end of the world, but when Bethesda took over its fanbase shifted from grizzled anarchistic RPG fans to a child-minded example of Poe's law largely composed of bootlicking fascioids *unironically* supporting the Nazi cartoon characters of modern Fallout. We're talking about people who *openly* joke about hunting down communists like Pinochet dropping communists from helicopters, the type of psychopathic reptillian freaks raised in a post-Soviet world, who see communism as a boogeyman of the past and not the real and present struggle of the global working class.
---
*(I wonder how many idiots on here joking about "dirty commies" are even aware of this week's imperialist coup attempt in Venezuela, for example, or whether they even care about the result of it beyond a passive observation of a fluctuation in gas prices. I wonder how many of them know that in this same week, the federal shutdown was only ended because airport workers threatened to strike and by extension shut down the rest of the economy, a political act far beyond the powers of Trump and Pelosi.)*
---
By celebrating the formalization of American slave capitalism, Fallout 76's namesake all but justifies every crime against humanity the US has ever carried out, and its fanbase almost unanimously applauds this choice.
---
The real irony is the general handwaving of the fundamental unsolvable technical and design problems of FO76, made possible by the near-comatose consumers plaguing the playerbase like a kleptocratic miasma of Yeltsin-brained opportunism, who think they'll somehow be rewarded for kowtowing to the BGS legacy of entry-level game design. Ten years ago, not one BGS fan would have tolerated a whiff of something like the Atom store, but now we have people trying to rationalize and bargain with these merchants of digital wares:
---
&gt;Hey this is overpriced, I would maybe pay $10 but not $18
---
&gt;Hey fruit hats are dumb, I'd rather spend the same amount on a cool jacket
---
These sorts of amnesiacs haven't the slightest awareness of the problems in the real world, the kinds of screen-damaged first worlders solipsistically debating the value of a digital product in a post-Keynsian world dominated by technophiles with total monopolies over their personal identities and consumption patterns.
---
Fallout is dead, the idea of it as an exercise in political entertainment died a long time ago, and this subreddit is its post-mortem.
---
Haha yup.  I remember seeing that when I was a kid.  Many, many years ago. :)
---
I've got heaps of items from the atom store and never spent a cent. They're all ridiculously overpriced but at least you can consistently earn atoms for free.
---
Wait, FB trade group ? Can you share it,please? I joined some facebook F76 community, but it's the same kids crying that they got killed at the workshop. Is there an actual group for trading only?
---
What would have happened to her.  Her holotapes say if we're doing the quests for her she's probably dead.  I realize "probably" doesn't mean she is, but what's ambiguous about her?
---
They should have, i still enjoy the game though, i just dont get a multiplayer experience.  Ofc you encounter ppl and do some trading but thats about it. I miss an in game chat tbh. At least for xbox. Because when you team up its like trying to figure out what he or she wants to do. 
---
Point Pleasant, lotsa Scorched, drugs, and Mothman eggs
---
As cool as this is we shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for them. They should already be in the game seeing as they were free in fo4.
---
It's to 75% Bethesdas fault. They didnt develop any tools to monitor and moderate the game. That is beyond common sense. Exploits were to be expected! That was more than negigently and till today, they have no tools to clean that up or track down those items and dupers. The fixes for those exploits were way too late. 
---
How does that make me an entitled ass? In what possible way does me getting better gear than you make me entitled?
---
Thanks! Added you and will look for you sometime!
---
Nice one. That's my home two. Got a nice 4 story house there (including the basement). Only issue I have with it is mobs spawning at my front door.
---
Fantastic! My dad was proper impressed when I ripped it off YouTube for him haha the cinematography in that film is exceptional for the time.
---
Nah, leather is always better. 
---
Thanks. Added and will watch for you!
---
I thought that quest was funny because everyone gets some equal food from a commie factory
---
The pronlems start when you spawn into a nukezone. Trying to get a hazmat suit on or PA is guaranteed to freeze the game. Even pulling up quick inventory will do the damage. If your unfortunate enough to die during this time also a high probability that you won't be allowed to spawn anywhere in the map either. Forcing you to switch server and lose and dropped loot.
---
 I've seen 3 legged giraffes that are more stable than Bethesda servers!
---
Nah, more like "it's the store's fault because they left all of their merchandise out on the sidewalk unguarded all night"...
---
Thanks! Added and will watch for you!
---
Brilliant I am going to do this with my tuba
---
Idk, I just hear people talking about it in discord. Seems pretty big because I asked a guy for powered armor (AP refresh) and he had like 3 pieces in an hour. Unluckily I didn't tell him a specific type but still seems like a good haul
---
God yes. I posted about this a while ago but it got shot down. So I'm not sure how popular it would be. I'd love it though.
---
I'd like it to be possible with in your existing team of 4 (so you and friends can do it together) or random match making. Quests like 1) you have to go into a radioactive vault and can choose to go to the armoury, overseers office, infirmary. Different rewards in each. Can't do all though because you can only unlock one. In the vault it's exactly like a nuke zone. Crazy rads. Dark. But its small corridors and rooms in the vault, so your TSE is a problem. 
---
Or 2) you rescue a vendor bot from a cavern and escort it out. Afterwards it does 1 lap of the map (about 60 mins worth maybe?) Before the dumb thing gets stuck again and people can do the event on that server again. 
---
Or 3) players create a factory on a certain point on the map. You can use your own resources to cut it short but it's really demanding and probably not a good idea. It's best to go through the quest to get resources sourced and start up the construction bots that build it up prefab and it produces stuff for everybody on the server.
---
No it is not slap damage, I was fully engaged in PvP. Don't try telling me that it's lack of knowledge. I have a level 160, level 120 and level 50 character. 
---
Dupers are literally as bad as murderers, didn't you know?  
---
Edit: oh god, I was just joking. [But, someone actually said it](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ake1q9/dupers_that_used_the_excuse_its_bethesdas_fault_i/ef4g4ve/)
---
It's for if you change the color and then decide you want the original light on it again.
---
Good to know there's one. Gonna find it sooner or later 
---
To make it super hardcore it could be that similar to Conan exiles everything, weapons, armor, power armor, junk etc. drops on death. Duper‚Äôs lose all advantage the moment they die.
---
Course it would make disconnect deaths that much more painful
---
I'd definitely do that over fast travelling

What if I don‚Äôt change servers
---
Thanks! Same xb gamertag as reddit?
---
I just cant believe that I can one-shot sentinels with similar weapon vats crit and somehow you cannot.
---
And I will be telling its lack of game knowledge to anyone who gets oneshot by a TSE shotgun because I have all the proof to base such thesis upon, as you don't need any legendary items not to die like that.
---
This is a great idea.
---
I remember playing Fallout on the shareware 3‚Äù floppy in the beginning. Awesome game with tons of potential. It really threw me off when I placed armor on my character and I didn‚Äôt see it. Hope this game isn‚Äôt the demise of the Fallout series...
---
That being said, I will continue to play as I hope to see more additions in the future as the main story and side story went way too fast from start to finish. But I am slowly losing interest in this game as I look forward to the release of the Division 2!
---
How does it know when to switch while you talk?  I thought it just switched when you joined/left a team?
---
And scarecrows. Campfire scarecrows are the best scarecrows. &gt;:D 
---
Ight I'll add ya 
---
? I'm confused. 
---
Is it really an issue with silliness or simply disconnected Bethesda dropping things like cloche hat and expecting people to want to buy them ? We just want more fallout stuff and useful stuff, especially since most of the list is from past fo games 
---
But she wasn‚Äôt dead. She said hopefully it wasn‚Äôt the end.
---
There are no other colours for the excavator! That's the point he's making
---
Better yet, I discovered the Nuka Cola vendor in whitespring yesterday (upstairs from the other vendors). She carries a few exotic ones (from Nuka world) including orange, grape and dark.
---
They are both leather 
---
Another day, another baby crying about stupid shit on this sub. 
---
No, no you just have to teach them manners. Stand in front of their guns. They'll switch to a melee
---
Constantly, constantly, CONSTANTLY losing server connection. I've tested my Internet and it doesn't seem to be a problem on my end, and connecting to servers for other games works fine. It's incredibly aggravating, and discouraging, to clear an area... only lose my server connection, load back in, and then have to clear the area *again*, after I'd already spent resources to clear the area out the first time around. I had to redo one of the Mistress of Mysteries quests (can't remember which one) because I got all the way to the end and *just* before I picked up the key item to take back to the bunker and fabricate... OH HEY lost connection. The same thing with the event to repair the Poseidon reactor. I had about two minutes left to finish repairs when I got booted... then respawned *outside* the reactor with a fresh set of enemies and all my repairs undone, but with two minutes still left on the countdown. I quit. That was almost an hour of solo work, wasted.
---
If the servers are going to be this unreliable, then rework the game so that players spawn into the same server and their game is in the state it was when they got disconnected.
---
Believe me, I really, really want to enjoy this game. When I'm not getting booted off all the time, it's a lot of fun and I get a kick out of exploring. But this issue is close to having me quit because most of my gameplay at this point seems to be redoing stuff I already did and my enjoyment is clouded by wondering when I'm going to get disconnected again.
---
I was the same played since BETA day 1, got to the hundreds. Ended stuck in a cycle of the same enemies, the same places over and over.
---
Then last week I started a new character and just played it like I would any other Fallout. I reserved my allegiance to any faction until I'd finished their questlines. Afterwards I decided the Brotherhood while still flawed were heroes and fought to the very end. Buying everyone more time in the process.
---
Once I got my BOS guy set up, I decided to RP a scribe, and travel Appalachia logging everything I learn. Some of the stories you come across are just damn heart breaking. People got the idea this is an MMO and played it thus. It's not, I didn't realise how much of the game I missed on my quest to get a decent legendary drop. But now Scribe McGregor is my main, only level 35 and I aint in a rush. 
---
Ad Victoriam.
---
I cant really figure out where in the holotape timeline that is supposed to fall, nor could I find her body in the area, so its not clear if she is actually dead (likely but not clearly stated as far as I can see)
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **6th Cakeday** Freakypotamus! ^(hug)
---
Crap, I thought the original was just cloth. 
---
It's impressive how cleverly they manipulated us
---
Caps are obviously limited on purpose, I don‚Äôt think they are interested in giving you more ways to earn caps.
---
There have been jack asses like that in the game all along unfortunately, plenty of stories around. It's happens in every game I guess. Fortunately these arseholes appear to be pretty rare though. Sucks that it happens at all of course
---
sooothing voice
---
Then you're in for a loooooong wait of 20hours on the same server
---
Awesome. What is on your head?
---
Agreed.  Let us break it down into lead, steel and plastic at the very least.  I can make ammunition out of old money and a tin can but not out of other ammunition.
---
I would like an alternative to mutations, like cybernetics for example that you could get in different ways, but would have different drawbacks.
---
He only mentioned he thought it might be the brighter light, and I don't use the excavator armor so I wouldn't know what colors it can have since I don't look for it's mods. 
---
Oh shoot. That's nice. You could get a look of of caps for that. I've never even seen it before.
---
You don't want to give a Llama to a backwoods West Virginian... 
---
Well, they increased the max limit from 5k to 25k when offering items for trade. They will be introducing craftable vendor machines to sell items at your camp...
---
That stagger is so annoying, and makes no sense when it happens from only a few feet from the ground. I'll see if I can get that trick to work. I feel like I've done it a couple times unintentionally.
---
They can‚Äôt swim, in fact nothing can swim, not even Mirelurkers which is fucking stupid especially since I think someone at Bethesda themselves thought they could when they designed the swarm of suitors event. If you‚Äôve ever tried this event, it‚Äôll task you first to get to an island and then ‚Äòdefend‚Äô it from mirelurkers but because they can‚Äôt swim, you go to them. 
---
Anyway the rule is that things that spawn in water will aggro you and fuck your day provided they haven‚Äôt left the water since spawning. But this only really applies to like mirelurker queens. 
---
I usually go to sugar grove, then camp mcclintock
---
Ive seen him near the look out to the east of Whitesprings a few times, but most often Ive seen him by Charleston station (4 times since beta)  
---
Don't know where the other guys "bro do you even fallout" comment went but I'll answer anyway.
---
I was going off of AlternateHistoryHub's video in which I believe he states each Vault had one. 
---
76 is my first Fallout game. I've played 4 and New Vegas for a good half hour each. 
---
I myself like that idea very much and I do think it would make the game more competetive.
---
The non-ferals were either hunted by free-states and killed, or left to travel to DC. There's a note in point Pleasant telling ghouls to go to DC. Most likely to found or join Underworld.
---
I still have the quest even though i found all her holotapes
---
Is this normal???
---
Honestly, I think they would be better off dropping the perk scaling entirely for explosive weapons. That's the only secondary effect I know of that scales off of perks.
---
Something else that would be nice is if they changed the energy weapon explosive effect into the tesla gun explosion, just for variety.
---
Good tip, thanks.  This will come in handy.
---
But with the dated engine and server instability as is, unlikely the game could handle too much stash size increase or display items (having to remember ever piece on a shelf etc) 
---
Yeah ... I always dump the legendaries I don‚Äôt want in the ice machine in front of the club house ... probably what you ran across and not a duper
---
Yes thats what i had in mind while writing it, i have never personally had issues with the game working, its always seemed to work the way it should for me. But im hoping that it will improve with time in all areas.
---
If you play odd hours, as a dad of two, I only get to play after the kiddos are in bed. I will typically always be playing in the evening. Xbox1 GT sidedaddybear. Feel free to add me. I do sell runs and can use the diversion from inventory management.
---
I‚Äôm getting a kick out of some of these gamer tags
---
I lost 500 ammo...
---
There are no factions, just vendors 
---
Explosive weapons are fun, until someone stands in front of them, and you suicide, and drop all your junk. Not saying you should do that lol, but if you did, it would just be karma doing its thing.  xD
---
I don't fall into either of those groups.
---
This explains a lot.  Lot's of situations where I ended up crouching behind some bushes, always wondered why the roving bands of misfits ended up not finding me and talked openly as if I wasn't there.  Good to know this is how it works.
---
The little warning is hardly nothing. I've missed it every time. I feel like there should be some sort of *ding* sound or something to alert you. I've come back to a completely destroyed camp and had no idea. :/
---
Ok I agree but sometimes its kinda their fault because I duped only once before on complete accident. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who had this happen too
---
I've noticed that anytime a location trends on reddit as a good farming location, it gets swamped by players in general.  I used to do Uranium Fever and no one would show up, then someone mentioned it was great for 3 stars, and now its always packed.  
---
It's not available again when logging in, as well as having lost all the progress I just made. 
---
No, nobody thinks Bethesda shouldn't have security features, that's a stupid question. Are you trying to defend caustic behavior here, or being rhetorical?
---
About that much...
---
^(What level is it | is it painted | what mods are on it)
---
One thing I've noticed with Beth games over the years since Morrowind, they seriously do not know how to do proper levelled lists (which controls loot &amp; mob spawning). I've modded every game, and every time I worked on Levelled lists, and each later game required more work.
---
if it doesn‚Äôt, i‚Äôm killing myself
---
The balance is coming for tse. The thing tse right now, like I have a tse dragon and can 1 hit a 65 scorchbeast with 5 in demolition + rifle/glow perks when it's on the ground, but flying explosive doesn't seem to hit. My tse handmade got me away from using gunsmith entirely and just run demo. 1 shot is better than 2-3 with a maxed out gunsmith for repairs. It's better than any other mod and they're fixing that.
---
Far as griefing.. It's part of every game with pvp in it. At least you weren't this guy today [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NysNrPW\_E4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NysNrPW_E4) xD
---
Don‚Äôt get any ideas..... CHUMP
---
Their ability to deal with problems within the community is awful.  Not only are they not dealing with the dupe problem they are not dealing with any problems.
---
I have an issue on my account that has prevented me from playing the game since 12/27/18 and all I can get from Bethesda is that they won't fix the problem, generic condescending remarks and racism.
---
Weird thing. Just as I commented this I got my first explosive weapon (pump shotgun) so I can‚Äôt say i‚Äôve been having that kind of luck.
---
With all the mobs we were fighting in the caverns it woulda had to be a big warning to notice.   I am curious to see how much damage they caused while I was away.  It was just about time to pack this camp up for a new view.  I‚Äôve had a lot of visitors show up while I was ‚Äúhome‚Äù, first time someone attacked camp.  
---
Maybe the game is sending you a message ..?
---
What makes stuff trash in his first comment doesn‚Äôt need to be only defined by the level. A TSE combat shotgun is powerful regardless of level while a nocturnal rolling pin is useless trash regardless of level. 
---
Five points of damage on the base weapon isn‚Äôt that much but a level 20 vs 50 makes 15 points on the base damage and the modifiers are based on that.
---
The legendary effect and type of weapon makes a bigger difference, but level isn‚Äôt insignificant.
---
It tells me Bethesda doesn't care about the bad bugs. That's why they haven't fixed the half dozen bugs in Social that actively prevent me from even seeing my friends let alone allowing me to play with them on a daily basis.
---
Fo76 didn't get you banned 
---
You bullying someone who taught you a lesson did
---
That is what happens to me also. The last 3 queens ive tried that is exactly what happened. I launched it on my own and then.... level 30s everywhere just buffing the queen not hurting it at all. A couple level 100s tried to help me out,  but it was a joke. We barely put a dent into the queen
---
&gt;Why is something like this downvoted? It's a gigantic flaw in the current trading system.
---
What flaw? Op got scammed, learned a lesson 
---
He's now blaming the game for his mistake
---
Bethesda can't figure that out. Maybe they shouldn't have done a half assed copy paste to make this buggy game.
---
Doorbell seems like a great way to ambush the owner of the house.
---
This is something I don't get. "True" Fallout fans crapping on a spin-off game for not being Fallout RPG enough. I'm an old school fan of Fallout and few of these things bother me. It's as if canon is frozen conveniently around New Vegas and anything after that is heresy.
---
Also selection bias, picking and choosing situations that have existed in past games but are conveniently overlooked, a la random legendaries cause Fallout 4 had the same issue.
---
Anyone passing near a camp can sometimes spawn random mobs that may attack that camp, or ignore it and wander off. I've had to save a few camps from being destroyed this way.
---
I've had people standing basically right in front of me for a few minutes, and it's like my brain just skips right over them. I suppose because no gamertag.
---
Does your friend play? Other option is to have a disk to get someone else with an Xbox to play. 
---
I fought the scorched beast 2 times and not once have i gotten any sort of drops from it.
---
I want LMG mods! It has all the slots for mods but only one mod exists. 
---
It‚Äôs level 40 I believe and it has Tricentennial Paint
---
They dupe the bobbleheads and stack them with the curator glitch to do insane amounts of damage and no normal person would have that many/waste it on a random person that‚Äôs not initiating pvp just cause 
---
It gets worse with every patch, instead of better. Bethesda either doesn't seem to care, or have such piss poor programmers they just keep making things worse instead of better. Bethesda put too many resources on bullshit Atom Shop items instead of fixing this game.
---
r/whoosh
---
Probably future dlc is the cause of it not being removed
---
Only 3 steps back? That's optimistic.
---
Yeah. I still have that open as well after collecting all holos. It‚Äôs a small part of the reason I‚Äôm hopeful for more content about her. Or it might be just another glitch.
---
Heeeey! I used to live there a long, long time ago. Loved that place, but then I found my current gem that had a better view. Good work buddy, it looks awesome.
---
Its ok if its a one star aslong as its an instigating
---
Most of the hardcore gamers in my gang wants the fresh start as they believe it will let them dominate even more. I will believe opinions of those who spent dozens of hours researching the game, not those who complain they got one-shot by a shotgun.
---
I don't feel entitled to my gear I worked hundreds of hours for, because I myself favor a scenario by which legendary gear would be completely inexistent in survival mode, which I doubt is gonna happen. I don't even need insane gear to fight the insane builds. I am not against starting from scratch. I just have enough gaming experience, and enough F76 experience, to be completely sure that if such move, as to separate the characters, would be benchmarked against making the game less proHardcore, it would score negative amount of points.
---
If you think you need legendary gear to survive few shots from a TSE weapon, which like 99% people think it is, then you are proving my point as per how the research is the greatest advantage of hardcore gamers, not the gear.
---
I think one of the BoS got a tank working but it got bogged in the marshes.
---
Yeah even if it would just reset the daily quest so we can complete it! I hate losing a quest just because I happened to get D/Ced
---
Then it wouldn't be fallout
---
Yep, if the Chosen One was able to fix up an old Highwayman in FO2 so should we. The Responders seemed to have working fire trucks at one point (?) Even the BoS mentioned getting some tanks working but unable to drive them out of the bog
---
How many caps do u want for it if u have it.
---
Ok.  Lol.    The game does not want to be played today.   15 drops ugh
---
numb 2 - they always was there.
---
It is and is still have it
---
What does that even mean?
---
Edit: Didnt think id have to explain this. 
---
I log in, go to train station to see whats there. I see someone with a tse. He shoots me, goes into his inventory, then shoots me again and i die. No pvp involved, and his initial hit did almost no damage. 
---
Todd lied about PVP being completely optional. Sure, you didn't PVP, but that should mean your camp is safe from PVP dickheads too. I guess when he meant optional, he meant you could optionally quit and stop playing altogether.
---
Fallout doesnt have vehicles 
---
Actually, surprisingly plant life does unusually well in nuclear blast zones and in the face of relatively high background radiation from fallout.
---
Many [older trees right in the center of Hiroshima weren't too bothered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibakujumoku) about being nuked ‚Äì the list of species of trees that survived in downtown Hiroshima through the A-bomb is further down that page and is over 30 long.  Their are still over 170 old Ginko trees in downtown Hiroshima that survived the blast and are  very much alive and healthy today.  There is some initial sever radiation scaring above ground, but the plants regenerate from it surprisingly fast from nutrience and (relatively un-mutated) DNA that persists in their roots through the blast and fallout.
---
US government test: [here is a real video of a stand of trees being nuked back in the day purely for government research purposes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IteNFhPuOk4) ‚Äì because they sway with the blast they actually tend to do a lot better then most buildings do.  Yes their above-ground portions get heavily scarred from the radiation and heat, but again they store a lot of back-up resources in their roots that are OK.  The damage they suffer from such a blast may actually not be too much worse then one might think relative to a year of a very harsh winter plus burrowing parasites or disease.  Indeed as all their insect, fungal, diseases, and other parasites may be sterilized from the area by the blast, over multiple years the trees may actually have a much easier time regenerating from being relatively close to a nuclear blast then if they had been scoured and pitted by a combination of parasites and harsh winters.
---
If you want one of the few IRL examples we have, here is a quote from John Hersey's [Hiroshima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima\_\(book\)) about an observation made less then a year after the blast:
---
&gt; Over everything‚Äîup through the wreckage of the city, in gutters, along the riverbanks, tangled among tiles and tin roofing, climbing on charred tree trunks‚Äîwas a blanket of fresh, vivid, lush, optimistic green; the verdancy rose even from the foundations of ruined houses. Weeds already hid the ashes, and wild flowers were in bloom among the city‚Äôs bones. The bomb had not only left the underground organs of the plants intact; it had stimulated them.
---
Interestingly randomized mutational effects on animals are far more deleterious then on plants on average.  Animals are high-precision machines so small alterations in just a few key genes can be the death of them in short order.  One example: cancers kill animals pretty effectively, but plant cancers usually just manifest as [burls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burl) (plant tumors) and plant life-spans seem relatively unaffected by the formation of burls.  Plants will happily live for hundreds of years after developing burls and faithfully reproduce every year during that time.  If you want to be needlessly picky you can complain that Bethesda didn't cover the forest with enough burls.
---
  Additionally unlike animals which are mostly pretty strictly diploid (two copies of each chromosome) with additional copies of even a single chromosome being heavily deleterious (see chromosome 21 and Down Syndrome ‚Äì and that is actually a better result than many other possibilities as a number of chromosomal duplications are just strait fatal instead of merely stunting) high-polyploidy (more then two copies of each chromosome) is very well tolerated by plants.  While speculative, there are some suggestions that this has been a key strategy in plant evolution: increase chromosome count to provide multiple redundant copies of critical genes, then wait (usually geological time periods and many generations, but some radiation might speed that up nicely) to acquire mutations in the redundant copies of genes in the hopes that some of them will be useful "gain of function" mutations.  Then do a little DNA clean-up over a number of generations to slim down the amount of "loss of function" junk DNA if burdensome and reorganize things into new chromosomes via chromosomal rearrangement before repeating the whole process.  So while it is a bit fictional (though lots of fun and part of what we are all here for) to have mutant animals with all sorts of powerful functional mutations and few deleterious ones after nuclear war, there may actually be some truth in that for plants.
---
One of the worst IRL fallout areas is Chernobyl.  The meltdown there produced far worse and more dangerous fallout then a bomb blast.  Instead of a relatively small amount of more radioactive but fast decaying isotopes as would be produced in a bomb blast, the Chernobyl meltdown produced large quantities of the longer lived caesium-137 making up for its less per-mole radioactivity than bomb fallout with bulk quantity of this longer-lived fallout material.  So the multi-year environmental impact of Chernobyl should be worse then a bomb, and yet apparently [life is thriving all the way into Chernobyl's still-dangerously-radioactive exclusion zone](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/05/wildlife-thriving-around-chernobyl-nuclear-plant-despite-radiation).  After studying the health of the ecosystem in the Chernobyl exclusion zone recently, scientists noted that actually life was doing better there then near human settlements leading to the unfortunate concern that suburbs and even farms may actually be more damaging to the ecosystem then intense nuclear fallout.
---
I‚Äôd be happy with Liberty Prime to come and to stomp out the red menace. 
---
Do you need to be above a certain level to cause one to spawn?
---
Do you play on xbox? If so what's your gt? You're the only one that's going to be someone bitch
---
It is a just an instigating. How much do you want to pay for it
---
I'm on PS4. I have no doubt there's lucky people who've had next to no bugs, and people who may have had the odd major bug but otherwise lived with it, but there's also us who, as luck would have it, are inundated with the things. The Ounce of Prevention bug has no fix as of yet, and the only advice I've received is "start a new character", which, for obvious reasons, is a hell of a thing to hear when it's no fault of your own.
---
Like you, I appreciate the game for what it is, and the differences from every other multiplayer game are my favourite thing about it, but the bugs are real and do need to be a priority fix for Bethesda, followed closely by content. Here's to hoping they pull it off. And they one day use a new engine...
---
So, they just took his word for it and banned you?
---
He sent in a report that you were bullying him and they just banned you without checking logs or asking him for proof, which I'm guessing he couldn't supply?
---
Dude negligence is absolutely part of insurance. They‚Äôre not gonna deny your claim because your car door was unlocked. Terrible example. 
---
Hell, not only did I get one from the Queen last night, I got one from another SB in the area two minutes later! Ugh. I've only killed the Queen twice now, but I have five of those plans.
---
They said the survivor mode beta was targeted for March.
---
I know the mechanics. Its not possible unless items were duped. Check my original reply. 
---
That's some great fallout roleplaying there  *rolls eyes*
---
Indeed. For anyone who wants a reminder of how cool it seemed: https://youtu.be/QuJAwDTYDTY?t=108
---
Well yeah. Customer support isn't tech support.
---
They probably told you to make a new character then and they'll continue to say that as the folks answering tickets don't have character related tools.
---
It sucks but trying to squeeze water out of sand is hard.
---
The guy I originally responded to specifically mentioned level 40 3* weapons, and how anything under max level possible bothers him in an OCD like fashion.
---
I'm really not sure why you're trying to change someone else's words to give you a point to argue.
---
I'm totally liking this - but my wallet is already having fits from the thought of all those items in the Atomic shop!
---
i don't think this happens in common areas.
---
but gg
---
Exploits were required to be found and made an issue in order for bethesda to wake up and implement back end features.
---
There wouldn't be craters. Just 'pushed down' places. Nukes detonate above the ground (2-5 miles). There are a few areas on the map that DO have that. 
---
Why they don't just have the world load first before putting the player in it would make more sense.
---
I think it's random, I've run into two now, although I forget where I was each time it definitely wasn't near the museum as I hadn't even been there yet.
---
You sure you found it in the world? So far I thought its event only. If you can really just find it, its not worth so much.
---
Apparently it is really hard to not be a dick for a lot of people. Especially in an online game with no GM to punish them.
---
Yeah, everyone knows the *best* 3D Fallout was Interplay's Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel
---
Easy way to deter scams: better trading system
---
It was fun to see him hatless!
---
The flaw that we cvan't trade item for item. That's a huge flaw.
---
I'm not a 100% people a saying it was an event thing and so does fallout wiki I might be wrong I've had it a while 
---
cant sell it with that paint or any from the atom shop
---
get fo4, fo76 gets boring if u play solo due to there being no story line like fo4
---
Camp McClintock is great.  30 clipboards
---
I just had this today. There is a description of an hour long fight we had yesterday within this post. We jumped to those guys today, and somehow a fight enused near a soon-to-be-prime-nuke.
---
We could fight until SBQ event started. Then the event started, and they could kill us after the event started, but only thanks to seek revenge mechanisms, we couldn't shoot back.
---
Then there was peace for the event duration.
---
Then when the event finished, hell enused.
---
10/10 those guys were sad we are not russian.
---
Spotlights are useless. My turrets still won't fire on anything attacking my camp, unless I let them live for a good minute destroying everything.
---
If you have to choose between those two, get FO4.
---
Useless. They are all talk and no action.
---
Mutations 
---
I think one of whitespring vendors sells all the resort stuff
---
You're right, they're setting up a fight, and talking about if they should use fists or boards.  
---
I caught French players playing Statues (or Green Light, Red Light, or whatever you call that child's game) in a middle of a Nuke once.
---
I want to use my mic. Almost every time I play I run into people and most seem friendly. But I rarely hear anybody speaking. I bought a new headset the other day with a mic and kept jumping around to where other players were and none responded. Kinda of a bummer. 
---
Actually it's been so long since I've heard anybody I wonder whether it's even working for me. I have it set on Auto. 
---
I bet you one person didn‚Äôt understand, downvoted, and then the downvote train commenced. 
---
U should ask r/fobazaar
---
Last night's Atomic Shop was when I picked "Social" and I couldn't exit out of it! Had to reboot the game. 
---
I find the text chat mod to be trash. Not in it's function, it works fantastically, but with its audience. 
---
I'd always thought the mod original intent was for in-game chatting between characters without mics but in reality it's just an in-game Discord, complete with spammy conversations, item trading and occasional duper/exploit discussions. Turn off Global and Trade modes and you really see how it's failed as a mic replacement.
---
The current meta is to not use mics much at all. Well, at least that's my experience on PC. I think a ton of people have mics but just choose not to use it. I'm one of those. I've only ever used it either when someone is talking to me (sometime not even then) or it's just more convenient in terms of trading. That's it.
---
You have to remove the paint to drop it without destroying it
---
And level 40 armor isn't worth anything but the few steel it'll scrap to
---
They are different groups that formed the same beliefs and goals. I get the feeling the Responders were more directly active in terms of fighting the Wastes, while Followers seem more pacifists, preferring to work through mercenaries and intermediaries. ButbI could be forgetting stuff from the LA Boneyard, and I am sure early on the Followers did their fair share of running and gunning.
---
Bethesda needs to purge the inventories of anyone who has done the dupe glitch or delete their characters. /
---
Everyone and there mother is figuring out you can stack bobbleheads and kill people through pacific mode. This needs to be fixed ASAP. People are just trading mass amounts of bobbleheads..... 
---
Some times completing missions like "back to basic" will give you new poses and picture frames.
---
I don't think the engine really supports vehicles, besides, the roads are all busted up. You wouldn't make it very far. Especially with the highways completely destroyed in sections.
---
More realistic would probably be horses. We're in a rural area so Radmares/ Radcolts could totally be a thing. Could also provide a portable container to carry more and I really just want one to complete my cowboy look. 
---
This guys says he could kill me in my godbuild and he already said enough that I know he is right, he definitely could.
---
Also, you are completely right with regards of unlimited time supply being insurmountable barrier for first few weeks of survival mode.
---
Anti-griefer? High five bro.
---
I've been around since the game went live and remember at the time when the glitches for stash, weight,  and duping were barely in the infancy period.   I can see how in those days it was easy to go do those things and not think anything about it from a 'moral' perspective (in a video game mind you).  Personally I don't remember reading or agreeing to anything that said don't dupe, don't glitch, don't XYZ at all.  I just remember the game being ready to play, launching it and creating a character and starting my journey that I still enjoy today.  
---
So I remember how it was for people that did this stuff early on to just do it because it really was in the game to do just as easily as say being able to drink a nuka cola to get a little bit of HP and a bottle cap.  It was nothing in those days for ease and steps to take, of course now apparently you have to jump through hoops and crash servers so I get that.  But in it's early days a lot of people did it as it was as easy as consuming an item.  It's insane to think the state the game was in back then now thinking about it.  The dupes were super easy to do and people weren't complaining about duped economy, server crashes and in general posting a thread about this topic every single day.  
---
Back in those days I had really crappy items that weren't dupe worthy but I can see how if you had really good TSE's it would have been hard to resist the urge to go find the plans to build an artillery and dupe in seconds.  
---
I'd say in the beginning, duping was probably part of the game playing experience for a large number, but as the rammifications started to be realized it then became a dillema and you had people stop and others just continue only caring about having all the items in the game in large quantities. 
---
I'd say the early people I can see them being outside of this 'all dupers are bad thing' as it really isn't so cut and dry, and those that continued once the community realized oops stuff is breaking the game then making their choice to be more nefarious. 
---
But I don't compare this game's bad aspects to real life crimes as games are supposed to let us misbehave if that be our form of entertainment, but now Beth has the EULA to hide behind to cover for their inability to squash dupes so that's a more recent development than anything that the community now has jumped on.  
---
I mean heck, hunting dupers has become another emergent game playing experience as end game content lol.
---
You can't. It simply doesn't turn up when looking under notes/misc, if you try to put it in your stash. Great suggestion though!
---
This, this, this.
---
Yes, please.
---
This.

Marsupial and Bird Bones mutations plus strange in numbers
---
Not hacking...
---
Oh dammit!! Wish you were on PC!! This is hilarious ... dammit Moon Moon!!!
---
Marsupial + Bird bones mutations will give this effect. Marsupial for higher/longer jumps, bird bones for slow graceful descent.
---
4 days, and no word. Just more proof all of you Bethesda employees are all talk and no action. Should have just done the usual copy paste of "I'll pass it along to the team." How about all those Social bugs you've left in the game since Beta? Every single fucking day I can't play with my girlfriend because we encounter one of half a dozen bugs in Social that actively prevents us from playing. Or countless other bugs you're ignoring. I'm still waiting on the option to switch servers when someone has my camp spot. You know, the feature that was promised in an earlier patch? Just more lies.
---
Is that where you walk slowly up behind someone and try not let them catch you moving? Because these were doing that too! If you're on ps4 it could have been the same group haha.
---
Today you learnt that the "report message" system actually works on xbox one.
---
Not going to lie, I used the pocketed infinite weight glitch to fast travel with the attitude of ‚Äúuntil Bethesda increase their stupid limited stash cap....‚Äù Same with refilling fusion cores with the attitude of ‚Äúthis is Bethesda‚Äôs way of apologizing for sever crashes‚Äù
---
Mea Culpa
---
Admittedly it is the attitude of a kleptomaniac. If the baby didn‚Äôt want his candy stolen he would have had a tighter grip!
---
Joining a team allows players to see where your camp is and they will most likely wreck your camp. Do not join a team
---
Belly Of The Beast was the final main line quest I did - it was fun, this was on my 3rd character and current one.  Didn't grind/level or get into trading, etc...  just played the game by my lonesome most times, barely ventured into nuke zones.  Was around lv 70 when I did it and it wasn't that easy.
---
&gt;!Triangulation around the Watoga area attracted Scorchedbeasts, I failed to realize you had to do it all at once and had to redo this, then on my way to the Glassed Caverns I had 3 of them all come at me at once.  The cavern were pretty epic too - seems like that boss at the end disappears into the caverns and reappears later all the time.!&lt;
---
Been grinding since and changing up my build, done plenty of queen fights now, etc...  I'm still happy, but because I took the time to explore I didn't feel the urge to continue with another character I created (he's still a lv 5 currently, my 4th).
---
Nah with the nerf coming just wait until you hit level 50 ... or grind White springs and hope! 
---
Cultist Mask.
---
Wow, this question...
---
How did you get your windmill on your roof?
---
You can't trust their patch notes. The last three(four?) patches have lied about fixes. I know, because I've encountered each bug after they lied about fixing it.
---
It‚Äôs not so much about the purpose of the device for me as it is aesthetics. But you have a point, when I was using turrets with spotlights it didn‚Äôt seem to have a positive impact.
---
You can't legally play music on HAM irl either.
---
The emotes and camera mode are great for social aspect of the game ! I have a friend I met at level 2 on my alt and we only communicated through emotes; follow, wave, thumbs up etc. and played not stop for a week or so together. Never use mic in game since the horrible open mic issue on launch 
---
Not true, they‚Äôve been very responsive. I don‚Äôt expect a reply today. Wanted to queue it up for the work week. Pretty sure they‚Äôre based in the US and it‚Äôs nearly 5:00pm EST on Sunday here.
---
Hey, good to know, I stand corrected. 
---
Bethesda better hope they know the disconnects are from duping, because I get disconnected multiple times in a row all the time. I'd be outraged if I found out I was banned for duping, with their only evidence being my frequent disconnects from their broken servers.
---
Military is unlocked when you finish the Brotherhood of Steel missions, and join.
---
Much like you get salute when you launch a nuke.
---
Behemoths have been in game since Beta, but are still rare to find.
---
Awesome idea. Doubt it would ever be implemented though. 
---
Just seen that aswell, has anybody noticed lore mentioning it? 
---
I don't think this has anything to do with the Pip-Boy, I had this issue and it happened if I tried to go to the map or even if I just waited and tried to walk off after a minute. Sometimes the game just doesn't want to fully load the world and doing anything will freeze it. Restarting seems to fix it.
---
I would totally love to hear 'please help me' on the radio only to fall into players trap.
---
The two biggest problems I see are
---
1-if you need to start from scratch, it goes further than you starting the first 20 hours from launch and locking them out. Anyone who starts days or weeks after launch will never be able to get into good farming areas and wont be able to build up in the safety of casual mode
---
2-dupers wont want to leave their duped goods and will stay in casual mode trying to attack everyone who doesn't want to pvp
---
I somewhat agree with you. Somewhere along the lines dupers became this boogeyman that ‚Äúruined the game for everyone‚Äù. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. They‚Äôre pretty pathetic for cheating at what is essentially the point of the ‚Äúend game‚Äù here. That being said, my husband gets accused of being a duper TSE user one in five times of taking someone out at a workshop or PvP encounter. He‚Äôs literally never owned a TSE. He‚Äôs just specced and geared decently for sniping. It‚Äôs absurd. Even people ACTUALLY using a TSE make these accusations which is honestly hilarious because they of all people should be able to tell. 
---
I‚Äôve had one spawn by the southern greens at whitespring. Near the junk node and bear cave. 
---
Play on Xbox, has been very stable for me the last few weeks.  Even before that my only big gripe was invisible enemies for a couple weeks but that's a thing of the past thankfully.  Been playing since it released and I think overall it's been fairly stable, nothing a team or simply looking at xbox recent players list to spawn back into server can't fix.  
---
Idk there were dogs in fallout 76
---
This is like saying they took the measures of law basically saying it is known to violate the law by stealing but yet they still didn‚Äôt lock the doors. In the eyes of the insurance company Bethesda would still be in the wrong. This comment is a more clear representation of what‚Äôs going on than the OP post. 
---
Yes, they talk a lot. They don't actually do anything. "I'll pass it along to the team" Seems to be code for "I don't care just shutup already." One employee posted four days ago in one of the DOZENS of topics complaining about the weekly challenge being bugged, robbing us of free Atoms. Not a peep since. Are their teams really this clueless that they can't get any information out of them?
---
i bet he got it bc they found something else in the communications with the dude to some what support a 5 day ban. i my experience xbox just don't take peoples word for reports they actually look through the amount of time you have been reported and logged communications to find support for the claims. 
---
I want logic gates, we had them in 4
---
- Need exterior / interior paint and wallpaper (any color we like).
---
As it stand every camp looks the same, it's totally lackluster.
---
Theres nothing more entertaining than gliding of a cliff landing on your feet an turning around to see your level 30 friend plumet to his death lmao
---
If you attack it blood spurts out, definitely is/was alive 
---
I had my favorite moment in the game because i DIDN'T use my mic.   
---
I was in my camp, and another player came up and was looking around, and they had their mic on and i could hear that it was a young kid. I braced for the worst, expecting it to be like every other time i encounter a kid in a game: cursing, loud screaming, and a lot of intentional stupidity. Possibly some griefing. We emoted a bit. The kid wanted to take some pictures together, so we did that for a while. Then i was invited to their camp. As we walked, the kid was singing a little song.  
---
Now, to make sense of this story, you need to know i am an adult male, but i play a female character. ...After looking at the kid's camp a bit, helping kill a few lowbie molerats, and putting some kitten paintings in the camp, the kid was like "Just so you know, i'm a girl. I'm glad i found a girl to be friends with. Boys are mean."  
---
She said she had to go, so i dropped her a bag of supplies and random extra things i had, and emote-waved a couple of times, and she was gone.  
---
It was just supercool to come across a NICE kid, who was really polite and sweet, and it totally wouldn't have happened with my mic on.   
---
Not saying using mics is bad, but i thought i'd share. ;) 
---
Seeing how the game has been it wouldn't surprise me in the least if that was the case. Or maybe its a hint towards a future quest? Hard to tell really.
---
I always either put away my TSE away during an event, or if the other person has a make coordinate them hitting legendaries before I take it down.
---
Not everyone does that, so when someone rolls in with a TSE being a dick I stop doing the event and spend all my time and effort jumping and strafing in front of them. As it turns out, it's a great farming method for junk. Dudes blow themselves up carrying all kinds of goodies. Bonus if it's a nuke zone and I get their hardened mass too.
---
Well, I've just ran into my second vengeful mothman in the same server, so maybe for this server it's a little less random haha
---
I also don't want to bother the people I live with with my talk...
---
The balance in this game seems completely random. Marine armor should have the biggest resistance out of power armor, Metal and combat armor are way too strong. T 60 should have more resistance than t51-b, energy weapons should do more damage than pipe pistols and hunting rifles, etc. 
---
Explain REEEEE? A form of mistreatment? 
---
Man #that #gun was great.
---
F in the chat boys
---
My guess is that the mod was supposed to be a bright mod, but was added incorrectly and missed considering there are plenty of other more pressing issues to resolve than a headlamp mod. 
---
There is all sorts of legendary enemies, it's quite funny. Here is a [legendary eyebot level 1](https://i.imgur.com/uH9pw7d.png).
---
Get off my Praperty!!!  That where my CAMP is also located ... I had to load 4 times today to get on a server where my my camp could be loaded ... I may need to move but it‚Äôs such a great location!!
---
Not really your fault. Nobody really seems to understand insurance. I‚Äôve always maintained that it should be taught, at least the very basics, in high school or something. Everyone ends up needing it eventually and it can be so important to understand. 
---
Different flavours do different things like disease ward extra ap or extra damage resist.
---
Also using radaway whilst mutated only gives a chance to remove mutations, not guaranteed but seems to have a high % ie I had to suck down 6 radaway in a row to remove herd mentality.
---
**HINT:  Constantly run in front of them and block their shots.**  Watch them kill themselves repeatedly because of their own explosive effects.  Grab all loot, change servers :)
---
That's cool. Had no idea squirrels could be legendary. I wonder if I've ever passed the frogs at whitesprings and one was legendary. 
---
The spotlight targets mobs for me when it actually shines. I wired a switch and power cycling the spotlight seems to reset it.  
---
Yeah I know, hopefully we get GTA 6 soon enough. 
---
Figured this out the other day after doing it 5 times and restarting.  I think it's stopping your ability to move because you opened the pip boy.  But, the pip boy never opened and only closing the pip boy will allow you to move again.
---
That's it! I'm on PC though. Another group having fun!
---
2 days ago, I went for my first SB Queen kill.  She was at half health when I get the "application has encountered an error" on my ps4.  I have yet to try again but I dread it already.  Its been the 6th one of these errors in a month.
---
It's more like 50%, it's either true or false
---
Something that the OP left out of his post as it doesn't fit his narrative perhaps?
---
You guys need to back up off my pretty princess bed. I didn‚Äôt see all this whining about the racecar bed dammit!
---
Ikr especially so many times I log in with dead character either died to attack by invisible enemy or log in to a nuke zone ...so they put ur character in the world w/o fully loaded and u have no control over the character  
---
Same thing happened to me.
---
It was around that amount of time before I quit to the main menu to try another server. 
---
Yea... nothing beats some dude dressed in a cat costume one shotting every fucking ghoul at whitesprings with his explosive whatever. So fun.
---
I‚Äôm left farming for any half decent legendaries. The Queen fight is very resource intensive and not all that exciting tbh. And that is how I feel now playing, like what is there to do?? 
---
So why comment with a 'factual' statement when you don't even know!! 
---
R.I.P. Alvin T\_T

---
I've been playing less than 30 hours and have found him 5x along with seeing the vendor bot multiple times. I'm on a mission to find his home. Lol
---
I've needed to make a couple claims and that's how I learned about actual cost value and replacement cost value.
---
Thank goodness I must have read a quick FAQ when I set up the insurance I chose RCV. I could easily have been burned by my ignorance.
---
I like your idea for including this in high school education. 
---
I don‚Äôt remember where I read it, but I liked the idea of breaking down bulk ammo for the same types of crafting materials it takes to build ammo.
---
Can‚Äôt sell with TriCent or any atom shop paint. And an unmodded level 40 set probably won‚Äôt have much value. Value is only in top level items, and unmodded t60 isn‚Äôt too hard to build a set of if you know all the spawn locations.
---
You can't server hop anymore that got patched, literally every building has clip boards, just tag them in your inventory and pick them up when you see them. So you can't server hop for clipboards, but you can server hop if you know there will be bears, so a good place for springs if you have the ability to kill bears is any camp ground, there is one just north east of WhiteSpring Resort, the ones with the green roof. Just server hop and you going to get either bears, rad scorpions or honeybees. Both the bears and honeybees (I think that's what they called), I get bears a lot, so you can server hop and just keep killing bears. Both have decent loot. Rad scorpions suck, so just server hop if you see rad scorpions they a waste of time.
---
It was specifically a pip boy issue. I heard the noise of it being opened the whole time even though it was not appearing on my screen. 
---
I just saw her too! Sorry I can‚Äôt help, but I‚Äôve only seen her once too, near the giant teapot. 
---
You bastard. From where? 
---
I was unable to close it even after my game loaded in fully. 
---
Dude, calm down. They have no reason to lie about it. Their job is to monitor the subreddit, make note of the issues, pass it along to the devs, and communicate back to us when there‚Äôs an update for the community. I‚Äôm sure the devs prioritize the issue based on what‚Äôs already in the pipeline to be fixed. The criticality and complexity of the issues are factors as well.
---
The stupid thing is it‚Äôs not a great place for /top level/ legendaries, since the enemies top out at 40. I‚Äôm not sure what people are expecting farming there.
---
uhhhh mf tse binoculars
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs not a realistic expectation for this type of game. Just imagine the mess of the game and then add in the nightmare of zoning for players that made different choices. Definitely an unrealistic expectation no matter how you look at it.
---
This game is a scam and you saps fell for it ;D
---
The plots are already an asset. You can see them all around Flatwoods. 
---
Anyone have luck?
---
easily my favorite part of fo76
---
I had Liberators earlier this week.
---
Thanks for the information. The spotlight seems to be the only powered item in my CAMP (wired or wireless) that needs a jump start to work correctly.
---
Those are used for a quest.
---
FUCK LEVELING.
---
We should have to craft our gear to upgrade it. This is a TECHNOLOGY based universe.
---
Right there they could have implemented "jobs" (Gearhead), but who wants anything other than a generic "game".
---
Because the fact is that's what that mod is for, it makes no difference if the others aren't there. The original lamp is to revert it back if you change it. Just because you can't doesn't mean that's not what it's purpose is. He wanted to know why there was a lamp mod that was the original, not are there other colors.
---
I think we already have the cash register when we score a kill while using a scope. 
---
They are strewn all over the floor too. I missed those the first few times I cleared CMcC
---
I‚Äôve duped since launch- you can ask me anything. Not here to be a douche, but if you want my honest response- I‚Äôve duped for a shit ton of people that wanted to experience the cool end game weapons but never got the items from their tiring and unrewarding grind from this poor game design, and some friends that don‚Äôt have time to grind for the possibility of some cool items but they wanted to experience them to actually have fun in the game.  I didn‚Äôt do t for griefers but I did it so people would have fun in the game and actually keep playing....I understand your analogy but to play devils advocate- the comparisons don‚Äôt weigh the same. I can do whatever I want in this game so long as I can, because there‚Äôs no real penalty. I still dupe now (yes there‚Äôs some exploits still). And so what? But if I were to steal something from a store and get arrested that‚Äôs completely different. If you think duping in a game is unlawful we can discuss  unlawful practices that Bethesda has done since launch and count points and ‚Äúgot ya‚Äôs‚Äù.  I feel like people who hate the duper‚Äôs are hypocrites because they‚Äôre mostly the same people who argued ‚ÄúI enjoy this game so stop talking about how bad this game is‚Äù when everyone was crying about all the issues this game has had since launch. If giving people duped items makes them enjoy the game then why not support their enjoyment? Since enjoyment is all that matters right?
---
There are no robot companions :(
---
or any companions :*(
---
it's lonely...
---
So stealing isn't wrong if it's not locked? The law doesn't agree with that. Even if scummy insurance companies would ding you for it 
---
Berserkers is actually perfect for any level 1. 
---
To actually balance this game I totally think legendaries should be mods we can apply with the right perks/levels, just lock them behind perk/level walls and what-not to give people goals to play toward. 
---
The only way for it to truly be fair is for anybody to be able to get a TSE not from a random drop, but from a path they can follow and earn thru hard work but still get the guarantee that they will get one.  RNG gives you no guarantee, and Beth has never confirmed how its done or if any player will ever get one or by what level generally give or take drop %'s.   
---
I don't give a shit about trying to play it like a lottery reward system as this is a Beth game and they can do what they want to make it their own.  As 310 combined levels in I've never once seen an actual TSE drop for either of my 2 characters despite 290 of those levels being legit legendary farming.  The drop rate really does seem like it's seeded to something that predetermines for some to get them and others to never, ever, everrr see them.
---
Until legendaries can be applied manually, I fully support the duping community providing a valuable service to allow me to be able to afford to buy the TSE god rolls of somebody willing to risk getting bannd doing it as it levels the playing field for my own game playing experience otherwise I would of given up a month+ ago on this damn game that I do enjoy a lot.  
---
Legendary drops are broken, and I think a lot of people really dismiss how some people cannot seem to ever get them to drop despite really hard concentrated efforts and just hide behind 'well it dropped for me at level 30 with 5 luck, tough shit it hasn't dropped for you at level 250 and 15 luck; you got RNG owned LOLZ, get rekt by my TSE continuously newb'.    
---
I‚Äôve had that. It‚Äôll be a normal one, then a high contrast one, then full black, then the game will start. I‚Äôm on pc. 
---
There is a creepy random encounter with a bunch of mannequins and a note in which the writer blames the vault dwellers for everything that happened since the great war. The writing style makes it looks like a child wrote it.
---
The note also gave me the impression that the kid is probably still alive and immune to the scorched plague plague or he/she is really good at hiding from the scorched/scorchbeasts.
---
I hope you're not speaking from experience....because it sounds like you're speaking from experience....
---
Not the squirrel king
---
Fallout 2 had a working vehicle you could fix up and drive around, even had a special shop to buy upgrades for it. It was a huge hassle to unlock though
---
Only way I could see this working is if legendaries didn‚Äôt exist on it.
---
I made an irl dog in Texas mad by humming/singing on the open mic once. Maybe the Enclave bots are humming along to the radio on a Freaky frequency. ;)
---
also an eyebot you can find along tracks sometimes that will not talk to you if you arent whereing a responder's uniform.
---
I have 350 both ballistic and energy armour without PA, so yes legendary armour has its builds 
---
The doors were still never locked. They just stated basically what I can say is ‚Äúgame law‚Äù just like we have our laws to abide by in our civilization. So to the original comment to the post he would be correct. They didn‚Äôt lock their doors they just said it is punishable if caught basically just like in our law if you are caught you are punished. Nothing against the original post or the intentions but their analogy is off. Duper‚Äôs are wrong for what they did and some are getting caught for what they did and being punished. The initial responsibility is BETHESDA‚Äôs though. If we take Runescape as an example. Their was a glitch that happened recently where basically gold on death of a player would give you a max cash stack. As soon as it was known, the team for Jagex (the company that works on the game) took down their servers and rolled it completely back by where it first started. Runescape has been out for years so it is slightly a different scenario because they just rolled back to the release of their last update for the game which was a few hours after the glitch occurred. For Bethesda the thing that happened was the glitch was known since beta and wasn‚Äôt taken care of release. They could have easily delayed the game (this has been done by zenimax for elder scrolls online for console for about a year) until they tested it further and the dupe was out and just pushed out a second beta to further test or something. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm not justifying duper‚Äôs but I think this ultimately boils down to incompetence on Bethesda‚Äôs end that started this whole thing. Domino effect basically. 
---
This is such lazy thinking. Unless you‚Äôre trying to min/max you can be moderately powerful with just about any weapon/gear. I don‚Äôt see how it hinders role playing at all. Yes you‚Äôll have to work a little harder than sledgehammer power armor man but it‚Äôs definitely possible. 
---
&gt; Capped carry weight at your max, so people can't take all your shit and still carry their shit
---
This is excellent. 
---
Unless a group keeps jumping some duper and takes all their stuff
---
Well you two are the only two cunts who got it, so whoosh back.
---
Prick.
---
This game was meant to be Bethesdas
---
Warframe/Anthem/Division/Destiny.
---
Ofcourse they're going to cater to that style of experience. 
---
Real shit. This guy is happy with what he got, while also realizing it could be much better. But noooooo, we can't have that. Someone genuinely enjoying a game despite its faults?
---
And, while I'm glad they covered their asses, that's so sad that they wrote a MAJOR part of the universe out by leaving a random snippet on a holotape.
---
Idk. It kind of feels like Bethesda went fishing and told the fish "the bait isn't important, just bite" and I did, and now I feel like a dumb fish for trusting them without waiting for reviews. Very few companies left that I give money on faith and feel rewarded after. Bethesda will get that back, but lordy will they need some good dlc.
---
Read my comment a little further down I just did a huge paragraph on this explaining that I‚Äôm not justifying it just how I think Bethesda started this and they should hold most of the blame. 
---
im a level 112 so i did all that stuff too. only thing im missing from camp menu is powered doors and all the over priced whitesprings items. also found a tse early on and a 3 star lefendary scorched grognak axe. you have to admit that after the 10th sbq you started looking online for something funner to fill the hours between. 
---
If your flux goes bad and turns into inert flux it‚Äôs only worth 1 cap at vendors so your better off drinking it as it hydrates but also gives disease prevention for a while, be aware though inert flux weighs a lot so drink it up quick üëç
---
What's the max damage output on it
---
At about 12:30 PST I was killed with one shot by an invisible NPC through the roof of Relay Tower EL-B1-02. I had wandered around the place completely and up on to the roof and didn‚Äôt see the assailant. There were Scorched when I arrived that I killed, they were level 14 and 16. I was only shot at while inside the relay tower.
---
My character is level 39 and all I was wearing was the Order of Mysteries armor set. I don‚Äôt think I lost much, but I was unable to respawn, after like 10 minutes of waiting for it to load I gave up. My detection indicator listed ‚ÄúDanger,‚Äù but whatever it was was missing consistanly for a couple minutes so I stuck around. It appears I was killed by a silenced weapon and not by a player since I didn‚Äôt lose any caps. Just wanted to report an apparent bug.
---
the solution for this is a TESLA pistol/rifle... the arc will tag chain...
---
also, MOLOTOV COCKTAILS !! (cheap to craft, tags everything in area (use explosive radius perk for mass tagging))
---
Thanks. 
---
I feel like you can let them exist, but I'm not super high level yet so I might be speaking from ignorance. Someone with full gear would be hard to kill as someone with crap gear, but if you manage to, you get EVERYTHING. 
---
I don't know how super long term fun that mode would be, but if it was like one month season style it could be fun. 
---
That‚Äôs not what I want
---
Before you run off thinking you've found a great hack....anything you place on a campfire float way above it. It's an aesthetic disaster. For me, aesthetic form precedes function.
---
I got a sense of pride and accomplishment when I bought my first TSE off a duper, I went from being owned at PvP to being able to hold my own enough to not get absolutely slaughtered and lose all my caps in the process by not being able to touch a TSE wielder.  
---
It was still hard to raise the couple thousand caps so that gun was and still is 'my baby' in the game and we've been through a whole hell of a lot.  But that's WAYYYY better than 20k+ caps they were going for at first.

He means his IRL dog but there's one on a cliff next to some skeletons if you look for it in-game
---
Nukacola was a relatively small joke/flavor item in the past games, another one being dogmeat (whose existence I don't resent though).
---
Dogmeat was originally a reference to mad max, and really a kind of poor companion character, as it tended to charge into its death. It is more or less canon that dogmeat killed itself by running into a forcefield... Now the fact that our actually useful doggo companion is named dogmeat kinda means the original joke flew over bethesda's head.
---
Nukacola is just, everywhere in Fallout 4. While thankfully less in your face in Fo76. They made a DLC focus on nukacola. They made skins, suits and weapons based on nuka cola. A joke soda drink. They stuffed the thing full to the gills with nuka this nuka that. I don't think nukacola was originally conceived to be a huge part of the Fallout brand, nor does it give it any extra value.
---
This is strictly just my opinion, but the joke of nukacola got old ages ago and the fact that the joke "brand" is overused and spammed absolutely everywhere is boring (mostly in Fo4). Sure people are allowed to like it. But the amount of resources put there is just astounding, when they could have instead made something more creative.
---
Sorry for the long rambly answer, also the chip on my shoulder isn't as big as it seems i swear!
---
If you managed to go to Whitespring Golf Course when the spawn point was bugged, they spawned relentlessly. Lots of level 1 gear to start a new character, but yes. They also wander about in the chemical plant and sometimes the observatory and surrounding facilities.

Ah. I see you have excavator PA. I‚Äôm currently slaving away for that. Such a pain in the ass but so worth it.

I also would like it if mutation stacking wasn't a thing. I wish the negatives of the mutations were more impactful or there was a limit of two or three. A limit would help each character become unique in their own way instead of everyone being damn near the same mutant. So, if you're going a melee build you would have to choose if you want to be durable, agile, high dps, or maybe a more spread out combination. If you wanted to go scaly skin, grounded, and twisted muscle for a durable build you'd be giving up speed and agility but that would be a choice you have to make. This way if you want to jump around like a kangaroo while running fast you can, but you'll be sacrificing durability and damage for that. Greater negatives and one mutation blocking others could be the solution too, or even having the special reduction actually effect the amount of perk cards you can put of that special. The class freak perk is honestly part of the problem too, IMO needing a nerf or some kind of change.

---
Godwins law is usually used for when there is a stretch of logic, my point is that people are using the duping as a scapegoat tactic. Downvoting me obly reinforces the point. 
---
If you're on PS4 I can put one on. Your mats, my time. No problem
---
Yeah, if you've got a shit build for TSE it's gonna be bad. Obvious statement is obvious. No furious factually caps at 30% damage increase, look it up instead of making it up.
---
No, I meant I don't use the campfire for my purifiers, sorry.

So I just need to build a trap to find him....

I can confirm this seems to be a TSE Laser weapon bug. My TSE Laser Rifle does not at all receive damage increase from Demolitions Expert. Lame.
---
For real, I've gotten like 7 of the things in total now. Somewhat ironically I guess, I've only ever gotten 2 ivory grip mods that I can recall.

Or let people do what they want because they're not hurting you, and you can leave them alone or hop servers
---
You can always just bash it....

When do you want to buy that vampire knife so I know

Good idea.
---
I'm on now GT Ceruleancapo1 
---
But it's proven impossible to one shot in pacifist mode.
---
You say that because you yourself do it. And yes it does hurt me when the server keeps stuttering. I don‚Äôt even have to go to Whitesprings to be effected. I can hop servers sure but it‚Äôs annoying when the only good loot rolls happen to be on the server some idiot decided to let his turrets clog the servers with. Bite me if you think I‚Äôm wrong 
---
I have Broadsider.  Send me ur GT

yeah if you build turrets near the golf club thats basically a decoration of war on the server.

I mean...the dupers aren't the ones who sold you an unstable game...

EULAs are usually pretty useless. Hard to enforce and filled with loopholes if they bring them to court.

It‚Äôs just been worse. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone playing with serious vision issues

Lol. Bethesda aint listening. Whats the point in these suggestion threads
---
 If tom gave a fuck about the fans, fo76 would be a completely different experiance. I bet half the shit on ebay is stuff that Bethesda is selling. Fallout turned into a scam. Clash of fallout will be coming out next
---
I‚Äôm sure this has been mentioned before, but please add armor and weapon locking so we don‚Äôt have to worry about accidentally scrapping or selling them. 
---
This also goes for those who purchase and use duped items.a
---
How do you get the event
---
How can you state its a fact unless you work in Bethesda, there is no evidence to support it. No alternative colours, no brighter headlamp so at this stage it is a pointless mod. You could've been a little bit less cocksure of yourself and added 'I think it's because...'
---
 I swear millnials will ruin this world. 
---
Oh absolutely. Never has a better Fallout experience been so expertly crafted and so well executed before, and it might not ever happen again. Oh wait, 76 did it too... :^)
---
I'm not meaning to point fingers or anything, but I'd like to propose a possible explanation.
---
You spend too much time on this subreddit, where everyone would have you believe a number of straight up lies about the game. The  "Trade steal glitch" that was unable to be reproduced in any other thread/attempt is one, the belief that TSEs could oneshot you *out* of pvp protection before the bobblehead glitch was found was another, or the fanatical witchhunting like behavior towards anyone with more than X springs as if they were a duper is another (Yes, I've seen this happen many times in comment sections) just to name a few.
---
Don't believe half the shit you run into that gets upvoted here. Most stories about "crashing duper parties" are likely falsified, most stories about some game breaking bug without video evidence is, again, likely falsified. 
---
I hate saying it, but this subreddit has made me incredibly frustrated with the rest of the Fallout fandom. I've never experienced the levels of pure unintelligent dribble that I've seen spring up in the comments here and I actively go to search for those things in most subreddits.
---
It's likely you heard the story and then attributed it to the reason you died while you were marked for PVP unknowingly. It happens and it was just your brain trying to deal with the frustration of it. Owning a workshop flags you for PVP, as does a lot of other things that don't really make a lot of sense. As of right now, even with the huge % increase damage of stacking bobbleheads, you can't kill someone if they're not flagged for PVP. You know why? Because the anti-pvp protection is a % of *your* health based on the damage done by the weapon then reduced by an level discrepancy. PVP in this game is terribly implemented and the people complaining about them making a game mode where it's *not terribly implemented* doesn't make any sense to me. The game is practically PVE right now anyway, workshops being the only part that is not. 
---
It's like complaining about someone putting out the fire in the room next to you when you've got a single candle of flame in your own room and acting like you deserve the fireman's attention first....terribly frustrating and conceited to deal with...
---
They also seem to have been listening to community input ("Why is it so monotone?") when the earlier Bethesda games were mimicking the desert palettes of Fallout 1, 2, and NV.  
---
Did you equip the bloodied weapon?, the damage will then update 
---
Have a natural spawn chest in my base works great for a random extra loot drop.
---
HAD,... the geck malfunctioned and caused the wildgrow and blockage of the vault now.
---
( Early attempts to explore the interior of Vault 94 using glitches indicate that a malfunctioning [Garden of Eden Creation Kit](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Garden_of_Eden_Creation_Kit) is responsible for the unusual plant growth )
---
  A terminal in Harpers Ferry confirms this by stating that the vault ‚Äòexploded‚Äô and released a cloud into the air and soon after this strange plants started appearing, implying that Vault 94 is the source of most of the strange plants in the Mire. 
---
Do you really need revenant? Do you get revived so often? Not sure what I would use instead, but I feel like more slugger or shotgunner perks are better than revenant.
---
Yeah sometimes the robots get a virus so they get quarantined at the golf club
---
No, Xbox.. thank you for offering to help
---
Oh I read your comment. The problem with it is that it only works if you pretend nobody agreed to TOS. Which everyone does when they start playing. Also read my original comment about apples and oranges, how an insurance company would handle a theft claim isn't comparable in any way shape or form to duping in Fallout 76. And it certainly doesn't lay the responsibility of people using exploits they agreed not to at Bethesda's feet.
---
Berserkers are actually perfect for any level 1.
---
This would make crafting more valuable. 
---
I dont think you can unless you have some kind of program that would let you run a virtual desktop along with your actual one assuming it wouldnt hog so much ram/cpu/gpu that you could then run fo76 in said desktop and your actual desktop. even then you would still need separate accounts.
---
I'm not sure if xbox actually looks at messages or what but I was in a party last night where one of the guys on got banned shortly (and I mean like within 10 minutes) of tangling with another player on a diff server.  
---
He was goading the other player about recking the players power armor so he wasn't innocent, but if his word is to be believed he didn't cuss but the ban hammer sure came down fast lol. 
---
Definitely. I still wish I could go back to when games didn‚Äôt have any. I‚Äôm so looking forward to Kingdom Hearts 3 with none of this nonsense in it 
---
Ahh I think I did not equip it. Let me try it out thank you!
---
Nah legendaries are an absolute nightmare for balancing. Especially in full-loot PvP.
---
One dude who was lucky enough to get a TSE Dragon would terrorize everyone who didn't, and there would be no way to stop him.
---
Bobbleheads could have been server hop farmed, or purchased off many other players. My point is that you all are focusing on the wrong problems. The problem is within the programming. Stop focusing on these players.
---
No idea dud, but thanks for help ^^
---
Can also adjust the brightness of them all after you select color. The terminal is a surprising useful object.
---
You took your time. I ran out of non daily quests by 60. I spent the last 40 levels killing, farming, scrapping, building and nuking SBQ.
---
Around Watoga are like 5~10 spawn points for level 50 power armor. Thats where I got my T51.
---
Lost my excavator armor to this bug
---
A sign that we can type a message on! There could be a digital sign or wooden with "written" words. That way we can type long messages on our camps for when we are away.
---
 I would like to have a sign to tell people to take what they want out of my garden, water purifiers, and junk extractor. Right now I use the red rocket gas sign with individual letters. Its ugly and a pain.
---
I can‚Äôt put anymore points into strength cuz it‚Äôs at 15 already, and my team and I have a dynamic where we get downed on purpose and revive each other whenever we face a tough boss/crowd of enemies.
---
It is fine to set up there and it is fine fore anyone to blow it up if they feel it messes with their gameplay in that area or for any given reason really.
---
If it does not have turrets i bet few would bother. And if it is not placed behind the back door of the club house i would say even fewer would blow it up.
---
My camp is Messing with no ones gameplay, in fact it is open for all and does only protect against pesky rats. But hey thats me.
---
Have fun either way you go about it.
---
I try to take the time to level any turret camp i see at the golf house back door. Worth the caps for me since i think it is a bad placement for other players but feel free to place it there.
---
with BOS mod it offers the highest ER in the game, and second highest DR
---
What happens when u put a water purifier over a campfire? 
---
Overseer Logs confirm that by rebuild America they met "control all the nukes."
---
More protection per lb. Its just better
---
Yo hit me up tonight? PSN BlkBeltAzn95
---
Yeah I figure it would make workshops more valuable too, but also riskier. 
---
Crafting being more valuable, and more people running around in shitty gear, sounds more like fallout to me. 
---
You wouldn't often roll out in your strongest stuff, instead save it for big PvE stuff. 
---
Someone didn't read the included material.
---
so either heavy or non heavy combat armor spawns? and you cannot change it?
---
Oh dang Im stupid. I shouldve seen that you are at 15.
---
Well if it fits your strategy, then the build looks solid overall.
---
Heavy is the top tier of the combat armor. It provides more protection at a heavier weight, you can find the plans, ive only found the heavy arms so far. But they are craftable and they are drops. You can get legendary heavy combat armor as well. Its always a good practice to look at the base protection of legendary armor pieces so you have an idea if its light, medium or heavy üëç
---
Like vault 21 I think it was in New Vegas. The plants pretty much take over.
---
Getting on
---
Ok, I'll say it again, u obviously missed it, I've used both builds maxed out.
---
And yea I didn't say furious didn't cap at 30% also don't know why your telling me this tbh.
---
There was a level like 80 account and a level 18 account nearby so that‚Äôs what led me to believe it was duping. But like my edit says, definitely a strong possibility they were just trash legendaries. 
---
No worries pretty sure that should sort it :)
---
Strong possibility, for sure. 
---
It‚Äôs alright it happens lol. Thank you for your input! üòÖ
---
Low chance but yes. It's a very fun weapon. Have a Quad ammo one that takes forever to reload but you can rapid fire then in one vats rotation. Major style points.
---
where do you find the plans?
---
The easiest way to deal with this aside from Bethesda blocking that area from allowing camps to deploy would be if a bunch of people built their camps there with no turrets at all and the people putting up the turret camps could never find a server for them.
---
Watoga has at least 4 PA spawns (that I know of). Pretty likely at least one has t-51 parts. 
---
*1 Roof of the High School near the Train Station 
---
*2 Center of town at the crashed vertibird
---
*3 Watoga EMS roof
---
*4 directly north of Watoga EMS on the roof next to the intact vertibird 
---
Server hop until you find all the pieces you need. 
---
Do you have to have the other lesser under armor plans before you can get the shielded plan?   Or can you repeat this quest and skip straight to the shielded without needing the other bos under armor plans??
---
I don‚Äôt mind people at Whitesprings in general. That is quite alright. It‚Äôs some of the best looking camp spots. But the area that can‚Äôt be used for camps needs to be broadened specifically at the golf course. I can‚Äôt afford to level camps so I always make sure to at least close the doors to the back whenever I see them
---
Well? Don‚Äôt leave us hangin!
---
Like do I need to know the marine leg plan to repair it??? That's about the only thing I can think of, if so, the game should really show that as the requirement. 
---
Yessir, I‚Äôve caught a few of them. Usually they use spam accounts and paper bags but I figured they were trying to be sneaky (if they even were dupe items) 
---
It's definitely in the music - head to any vendor station and listen for about 20-30 seconds. You'll hear a (highly modified) dog barking layered in. Took me about three or four trips to realize that's what was setting her off. ;\^)
---
If you listen closely to any of the ambient music, you'll hear subtle animal sounds (growls, wings flapping, etc.). It really sets the desolate, dangerous tone incredibly well. Sneaking through the "uninhabited" wilderness builds tension amazingly well.
---
Pick on the mechanics all you want, but Fallout 76 has an *incredibly* realized world!
---
How.... DARE YOU
---
oh, ok I didn't know they're were used for that.I guess you could also just build radio towers in your Camp
---
I agree on duping. I still have a power armor frame with 100+ cores in it. When this was patched I expected them to vanish but they're still there.
---
Or at least use the very obviously still functional bicycles.....
---
I understand why you say that but don‚Äôt forget that just traveling to your camp will usually spawn more enemies
---
Honestly i have no idea. I wanna say i got them from a toolbox in silo Charlie but i really cant recall sry
---
it's okay, but thank you for the info!
---
Alas, nothing. I‚Äôm keeping basically all of it for when I get to those levels and I sold the remainder (mainly just anti-animal melee weapons and anti-human armor (I‚Äôm a pacifist moder))
---
Combat Armor come is Basic, Sturdy, and Heavy types. And you can not change the Armor out of it's original type
---
I just start blowing it up these days. I go to their stash drop my junk and then tear it down. I will also blow their door off the hinges to get into the stash before I get a stupid big bounty. 
---
Spawning enemies isn't the problem though the turrets are what lags the server.
---
You found multiples of every item in this trash can?
---
Must've been one hell of a squirrel if you could loot that out of him.
---
Would give the game a Tarkov feel as you stockpile good gear or run around naked hoping to catch a geared person off guard. 
---
Yup, I‚Äôm already aware of this. 
---
If you think that 600% constant damage is beat by an occasional 320% ish damage followed by normal to 160% damage then I have to question your sanity. All variables considered equal, (guns, mods and build) TSE wins hands down no contest. The fact that you think otherwise tells me you've fucked up somewhere. Probably a shit build. I'm sorry if you can't digest the facts, but that doesn't change them.
---
I need to build a character solely for this purpose

---
How exactly do you think you made a duper upset by taking their garbage?
---
Anything I say on here is based on my in game experience.  I was being receptive to explanations other than cheating.   Based on the sheer length and tone of your response maybe you should spend less time here.
---
For single player short term i would say fallout 4. Long term though 76 might be something even for single player.
---
But if you like f4 I would recommend f76 even if you just do a single player runt through the story and sidequests + you should explore the world, it is a lot cooler than f4 world (minus human npc‚Äôs).
---
I have around 350 hours in f76 and a lot more in fallout 4...
---
TLDR; if you like F4 you should give F76 a run regardless of single/multi. 
---
Make sure you have 2 things before you go in:
---
3 hacking perk cards so you can turn off the turrets.
---
An extra key card or two. If you type the code wrong the machine eats your card, so you‚Äôll need a another to try again.
---
No, one of each item. I‚Äôm definitely entertaining the possibility they were just junk items like people are saying, I‚Äôm still in my 30s so idk how high levels act haha
---
Im sensing from what devs have said that Fo76 will be ever evolving. just unfortunate a terrible launch has slowed them down. Pretty confident we'll see some sort of NPC even if its just raiders, as several note imply a bunch of raiders survived and left because they ran out of targets/the plague. I mean if I was those raiders and I heard a bunch of vault dwellers secured Appalachia and have overloaded stashes i'd be visiting. 
---
F
---
It‚Äôs not a duper if it‚Äôs just garbage dude‚Ä¶ Jeez read lmao. 
---
The reward is a 10mm submachine gun that sets the enemy on fire. The quest item is also level scaled to you. So, if you are level 42, you get a level 40 Perfect Storm. I still use it and I'm level 82. My Perfect Storm is level 50. With the proper perk cards, tbat gun is actually pretty awesome. 
---
One small thing: in my experience power armor breaks really slow. So I only use power patcher in my camp when I eventually have to repair my armor. So thats 3 points that I would use on other perks. Not too sure on which perks though. Tenderizer maybe.
---
I think he'd enjoy doing doing the job aswell
---
I like that the inventory doesn't pause anymore, gotta be a little more tactical with using it. But yeah I hardly use it for aid anyway, food drink and stuff is all on hoykeys for me

I would be inclined to agree with that.

That bug has been there since beta, don't know how many times we've warned about it. One guy in the beta had his pipboy eaten.
---
Why not, wood armor has it's own unique stealth mod of all things. 
---
&gt; Most of the hardcore gamers in my gang wants the fresh start as they believe it will let them dominate even more.
---
Told ya there is nothing to dominate, it ain't rust/ark/conan/fonline, you guys will hold a workshop for few hrs then log off, if you piss people off they will server hop, that is all.
---
&gt;I will believe opinions of those who spent dozens of hours researching the game, not those who complain they got one-shot by a shotgun. 
---
Well IDK bout your "haRdCoRe GaNg" but I have trouble following their logic "going from 100 to 0 to dominate more", by starting fresh as I said previously it will be way harder to go back from 0 to 100 without dupe everywhere, only small tiny bit of the playerbase will own such weapons/armors.
---
&gt; I myself favor a scenario by which legendary gear would be completely inexistent in survival mode, which I doubt is gonna happen.  
---
Actually me too! I think it would be a massive step forward for PvP servers.
---
&gt; I just have enough gaming experience, and enough F76 experience, to be completely sure that if such move, as to separate the characters, would be benchmarked against making the game less proHardcore, it would score negative amount of points. 
---
I stated in my previous comment why you're wrong on this, I don't care about your "gaming experience" , character transfer will not benefit at all the average players/casuals  and more than anything will spread duplicated items, instead of being quarantined only inside "PvE" servers.
---
&gt;If you think you need legendary gear to survive few shots from a TSE weapon, which like 99% people think
---
I know how to smack some dense mods, thx.
---
&gt;then you are proving my point as per how the research is the greatest advantage of hardcore gamers, not the gear.
---
Yeah then you're proving my point that it would not benefit casuals at all to let people transfer over to PvP servers because "hardcore gamers" (gotta stop with hardcore BS it gets old and it is not cool) keep every of their god gears + their precious knowledge &amp; degrees from the hardcore gamers academy while average joes own shite gears and have no knowledge what so ever because they don't fucking care of studying some video game, gotcha.
---
There are 4 power armor spawn locations in watoga that you can hop for.  A lot of the time it's t-51 or t-60.
---
Stop blaming players for programming faults
---
Mood...
---
That‚Äôs because in the beta people were farming power armor frames and armor pieces for fiber optics and plastics and steel so they severely reduced the junk you get from scrapping it. 
---
Then they weren't duplicates...
---
I thought about including this encounter as well, but it is fairly common and easy to find if you don‚Äôt have them on at the time.
---
I thought she was killed by a Mole Miner. 
---
I remember the Scouser wine house one,,, ay me wine house 
---
I would kill for a legendary Quad Syringer. I assume the bleed still stacks like in FO4.
---
They aren‚Äôt very rare it‚Äôs just that the servers aren‚Äôt refreshed very commonly so the plans don‚Äôt respawn very often. I find 3-4 plans every time I get on and I only play for about 2-3 hours a day 
---
Love mine - got it farming Ghouls in Whitesprings.  258 a bullet x2 base.  
---
With some perks and chems I had it up over 300!  Happened to get stuck by myself amongst a bunch of ghouls in the basement of the clubhouse and I saw the 3 star.  Axe is great for taking out ghouls (+30% damage to Ghouls) as it‚Äôs funny when you have a bunch or armless guys just standing around waiting to be slain doing zero damage.
---
One that I know of can *almost always* be found in Watoga, in the cranberry bog. I think you can find parts of a set in Garrahan Mining HQ, where you build the Excavator Power Armour.

I can half agree with that. It is Bethesda who created this unbalanced mess but until they fix it players are responsible for breaking it. It‚Äôs like saying it‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs fault someone duped a million stimpacks and sold them for real world money. Yes they created the game but no one is guilt free for partaking in it
---
I'm old and grumpy so I tend to play mic-less, but I do remember an insanely fun evening shortly after the XBox 360 was released. There wasn't much to do (the launch lineup was a bit weak) so I was played a ton of "Uno" online. Played for two or three hours with this guy in Australia and his two Pomeranians.
---
EVERY SINGLE TIME the game said "Uno!" the dogs would go insane for... about 30 seconds. It was 2am for me but early evening for him. I was over-tired and giggled like a bastard every time they started up. ;\^)

It's still as buggy as ever, there's evidence that they're adding pay-to-win lootboxes to the ATOM store, and they're about to launch a Fortnight-esqu PvP mode.

Is there even proof of that our just words?
---
Was it nuke zone? Happens to me there a lot.  Who knows with the current state of game, could be many separate bugs.
---
As long as it is not near the club, it's fine, the general green grass part of the course is fine, lots build near the pond which is pretty far away and no real enemies spawn, but I agree.
---
There needs to be a no build zone around the club.
---
I agree about the problems with rng loot stuff, esp on legendaries. Loot gambling and rng in games has always been something I have had problems with anyway. I find it lazy as ways of devising treadmills for ppl to get hooked into.  I also have problems with how some of the game is set up and the disconnect it brings me with game mechanics vs lore and story set up, but I am willing to swallow those things as a personal thing.
---
What I don't like is the categorizing and generational simplification. I don't agree with that. Such things and players and instant gratification ppl and glitch abusers have existed since games began. It's v. divisive jabs that try making us vs them kind of mentalities for scapegoating or blaming and I don't like that. Just like I don't like the threads crowing about how the atom shop is selling "the wrong things" and we need more macho, violent, military, grizzly war celebratory stuff in order for it to be valid and "true fallout." The insinuations that these items are Sims-like and "girly" and therefore not true gamer enough. Whether ppl intend those things or not, that's what messages it sends us and those of us that are women or enjoy things like princess castle beds and prettier floors to build nice camps AND kill scorchbeasts with our super sledges in painted PA.  
---
Real fallout and "true fallout" are terms I have heard so much the past couple weeks on here... it's prtty exhausting. Ppl haven't really played fallout and been fans of the franchise if they think the humor and silliness and lampooning satire goofiness hasn't been there from the start. Just like ppl really haven't played fallout if they don't understand the original games were criticizing America politics and war machining and jingoism and capitalism. 
---
Is the 7% worth it on a slow weapon? Also does it recharge with every hit?
---
I super hoped it was an easter egg. The only clues I could see were the union hat, and the "Asylum worker hat Forrest" on the graves. I tried using the hat to make a full uniform, and bringing the remains of the soldier from that Daily in Philippi cemetery..
---
 but no dice. Other things I can think of are two people one dressed as an asylum nurse and the other dressed as a union soldier, then both simultaneously pressing 'activate'? Or nuking it ü§î also in the cave directly below theres a holotape that explains it used to be the burial site of native americans, but the remains seem to have been disturbed? Idk, just feel like there's more to it.
---
I‚Äôm not too worried about the loot. Other post say it‚Äôs just random junk. I just really hate missing quests, especially ones with companions who have interesting dialogue.
---
I wish my life allowed for things like this being a big problem 
---
They do not.
---
Also try an addictol. Addictions don't show on the effects screen
---
Survival Mode is basically what we wanted from in the beginning. Now, they are giving it to us but under the conditions that our current characters are transferred over. I don't agree with this. I vote new characters as this would make thinga fresh and new. 
---
No. There are only so many vendor items as is. There is not need to increase this. 
---
I've wanted to quote this is other subs, but couldn't remember where I read it. Cheers
---
They wouldn't need to, players would start DJing.  Good ones would have people looking for their stations.
---
You got yourself banned
---
Agree. 
---
I do not have much to spend caps on anymore so i gladly spend it on blowing up those camps. That is actually the only thing in game that makes me attack directly.
---
I could just change servers but why should I leave when i can make a statement.
---
I hate people griefing on low levels though so i do not wish to be misstaken for one of those.
---
You should blow one up though just for the feeling of saying NO. Not that expensive. Do not fortet the perk for extra building damage üòÅ
---
I found the guy on a looking for post, gt was majorpackersfan
---
I was doing the power up mission alone. Half hour in, I finished repairing all the parts, the only thing left was to turn it on in the terminal.
---
*Disconnected fron server
---
Sounds good to me, kinda what I'm hoping for. I'm sure it will be  pretty hostile environment tho, one can dream!
---
The Overseer's dead. She was stabbed by a Mole Miner.
---
I agree. In fact Whitesprings makes for some of the best looking camp locations. But it could either be no camps or Bethesda will pop in and reduce or even remove legendaries at Whitesprings. Now which would people prefer?
---
This would be to sell your items to accrue more caps... caps to be used for trading.
---
The whole thing is that their sister company had more experience with this type of thing yet no advice transferred over for fallout 76 so I personally blame Bethesda. To me that‚Äôs chucked up to incompetence. This is just my opinion because I did play elder scrolls online and that was carried out very well and was more massive than fallout 76. The TOS still doesn‚Äôt change that they could have delayed the game and could have had a better start than their initial release. None of us I don‚Äôt think would blame them. Especially seeing to what it lead to currently. I know no one can tell the future but this should have honestly been in beta up to this point until the patch was released and then push out full release and have player inventory wiped. That would have been better suited for their current situation. Again not saying Bethesda is to blame for the people who consciously made the choice to dupe but ultimately could have been avoided which is where I would say the avoided part is on them and ultimately should commit to a full resolution like a character clean out where we would have our characters shells. If you want to stop all the moaning and complaining that‚Äôs what the company should do. Otherwise everyone should just stop complaining now. You get what I mean? It‚Äôs either they fix it or they don‚Äôt and the best way to fix it is just wipe everyone‚Äôs inventory. People would be salty at first but it will fade faster than the duper‚Äôs items.

Placing Power armour down will get you out of any stuck spot like this. 
---
Ironically a modded out sub machine ways alot more than ppl think.
---
Heavy weapons are all over the map and rediculous when considering ammo.
---
Power armor is hilariously low considering each piece is so heavy.
---
Really it would be extending your proximity mic to anyone that tuned into your radio station on the pipboy. I can just imagine how often broadcasters would get their camp attacked if you had to interact with the Ham radio. And how many people would come help the DJ. New endgame: major skirmishes at the Ham radio XD

Given that his father bought them a place in a vault and was closely tied to the government, I assumed they were in the Enclave bunker. In other words, their skeletons are in the dumpsters behind the Whitespring.
---
I picked up god eatter 2 and combo border lands 2 and pre sequel. They were 20$. 
---
Best place to get power armor mods and plans is the whitespring bunker at the armory vendor.

No but I can be in like 20 min if you can't get on later tonight
---
Yes, it happens, I feel like there is a post about this every day.
---
3rd option most reasonable....no build zone
---
The fireproof buff removed the only weakness of explosive. It's like Bethesda is enjoying this.
---
I don‚Äôt know... there‚Äôs a lot of ways to compare the situation. For me personally, I don‚Äôt really mind what happens as long as I have backup to kill the scorch queen or I‚Äôm having fun. 
---
I think people dupe because they can. I wouldn‚Äôt think they would decide not to play the game if there wasn‚Äôt a dupe... I feel like people are drawn toward the easiest way to succeed. 
---
I give props to those with integrity to play a game in a way that‚Äôs more challenging for them. 
---
Bottom line is, if I‚Äôm playing with you and you‚Äôre helping me kill things, I like you. That‚Äôs it.

There are buildable ladders in this game?? I'm having this problem with a very simple three floor build involving only the metal stairs, floor panels, and a single foundation piece. I'd love if the game could made to highlight whatever was allegedly floating....blerg
---
Okay
---
OP: "You should be arrested"
---
A weightless 1h melee weighs .2 lbs. You'd use this to be courteous.
---
That all?

Oh I get what your saying. It'll do as a quick fix for now thx.

You missed a holo tape

Ya I'm only level 32

I'd love to, except Beth won't let me use PTT while also using a controller on PC.  
---
What‚Äôs your psn?
---
So what if a lvl 6 took sum of ur weapons dont launch the nuke if u dont want people to go into the blast zone
---
Well and other legendaries
---
You gonna give me one for free? Otherwise no thanks, not gonna waste my time looking for one
---
I‚Äôve also been doing research, and I luckily got my shielded plans last night. Be sure to know treated, resistant and protective linings for the BOS UA. Then keep turning in the technical data and hope for the best. I got my luck up to 14 when I was finally awarded it. 
---
I get to admire more sights carrying all 900 of this stuff! 
---
What? 
---
I  know the feels. Some dude kept killing me in a nuke zone and I messaged him "what the ****, just leave me alone"  then I got banned. Lesson is to not drop F bombs in the xbox messager system. 
---
They are at watoga and harpers ferry pretty often my man
---
No. Everyone is dead. Hell, chances are even the three closed Vaults are just hermetically sealed graveyards. Bethesda's made it clear that they don't want NPCs in this game. So no, there are no survivors. 
---
Problem with your store analogy is that in a digital medium nothing is actually stolen, more like copied. 
---
U just seem realy angry for no reason
---
He's just saying you got baited by the dude, which is messed up. 
---
Do some research on junkie before you hate it
---
Yes it does. It allows me to maximize how much I can earn per day. This is exactly why it was in FO4 as a perk.  A 1200 (or whatever) vendor cap limit per day is too low, especially when you need to purchase plans, mods etc.
---
That is your summary of beta start until now? Oh dear üòÇ
---
Have fun. We'll keep playing this one. Hell, some of us may even play all of the above. Point is, do you how you please and the rest of us will do us how we please.

Not meaning future DLCs will include a GECK, meaning the forest immediately surrounding Vault 76 (how common were *living green trees* in other Fallout titles?) is likely the result of a successful GECK deployment.

Heavy Studded Leather has the highest at 414. BoS Combat only has 266 energy resist. According to a spreadsheet I'm looking at. Also Heavy Polished Metal and Heavy Buttressed Raider have higher physical resist.

I thought they were level capped too, but I'm lvl 61 and I DEFINITELY saw them yesterday. I had that thought rolling thru my head as I saw them

On a side note I cant wait for borderlands 3
---
Sorry, I don't read this subreddit 24/7
---
That makes some sense but to me there is a big diffrrence between justifying stealing to just buying a game and playing it, albeit while taking advantage of some exploits that harm the gaming experience for the other players and make things more difficult for those that have to fix the game.
---
and refusing even consider playing "nice" with others is stupid ;)

I love fallout truly but f76 is wearing on me. The same people that bash it defend it. Im tired and weary from my lonely road.
---
THIS!  Sounds like hella fun; perhaps faster reloading as well, way too slow atm.
---
I enjoy these round ups. One thing I can say about invisible team mates glitches is it can be worked around by unequipping one piece of armor and re-equipping it. I find it useful that they stay invisible in tight quarters because they are able to be shot through. If I was a dirty bastard I could use this to my advantage and have invisible friends tank for me in PvP and blast through them.
---
I didn't see it mentioned, but I still have issues with herd mentality unsharing perk cards, making it a mutation to avoid. I have now reset all my mutations twice to get rid of this bugged mutation. This needs to be fixed already.

How is killing things not playing nice? Who made up this fantasy rule that your every need had to be catered to? Jesus christ you snowflakes are so ridiculous. You wanna get the loot or exp for killing something? Kill it first, so dry your tears cupcake

4. After completing the final Rose series of missions ( Key to the Past )  collecting the broken uplink from the stash room and beginning the "Early Warnings" quest line, I made my way to Abbies Bunker. After collecting the fan motors and upgrading them at my CAMP work station I logged off. Upon logging back in I have 0 upgraded motors, 3 heating coils and the uplink. Quest marker indicates that I need to go to Abbies Bunker to craft the upgraded fan motors which I can not do because there are no more fan motors to be found. I went back to all the spots where the fan motors were originally located, logged in &amp; out and even teamed up with a player doing that quest with the hopes it'd kick start my quest. No dice
---
Under no circumstances can that be allowed. We must invent a new controversy immediately!! Contact the YouTubers.
---
Umm... HOW?
---
Oh shut up, you moron. Dupers make a problematic game even worse. It's not hard.
---
It is a fact, the same mod exists for every other power armor and it's purpose is to revert back to the original light. That's what it did it FO4 and no one has found another use for it in that game or this game. Yes the mod is pointless on the excavator,but I'm saying that's why they have the original light as a mod you can get. Because you can also get it on the others and since they do have the other light mods that is what it is for.
---
So.. you think it's funny to upset people?

Phoenix in watoga. I had day tripper and a bobblehead. But it‚Äôs RNG. Tech data is easiest found the whitespring bunker in military wing among the desks.

I see you build the object in your camp that when you interacted with it added your chat to a ‚Äúparty line‚Äù where everyone else using their ham radio (or listen only on pip-boy radio) would then be in the same audio line, just like team audio now.

This could lead to some cool emergent gameplay, if not just another place people can spout crap that we can turn off.

It took you 2 hours and a load of stims to beat the silo, and your failure is something to do with other people?
---
Well I'd rather play it in its current state than have to wait another 6 month/year or however long more for the game to be released. Despite all it's "problems" I'm still enjoying travelling around the map and visiting all the factories/cities, reading the notes/listening to tapes etc. 
---
Or just buy mutation recipes from me. I currently can craft any and have recipes for all.  But they go fast 3-8k per recipe. Less then 3k per serrum dont pay 10k... Kenjin06 is selling duped recipes for 750c a pop so find him if thats how u roll
---
No he‚Äôs telling the truth... 
---
Please just let me break down legendaries I don't want in order to get crafting mats that let me build the legendaries I want.

This would at least give a purpose to every legendary.

2. Counters. Maybe in the table section? Just counters. They had them in FO4.  
---
3. Floor decor that is all of the decorative items in the game. Desk fan? sure. Teddy Bear? Toy Car. Military Circuit board. All of them. the ingredient should be the item it looks like.

What you are failing to realize is that the poster is not angry that a lvl 6 was there in the first, but the fact that he showed up with a bunch of guys and said group of guys proceeded to stand there and not help with the event and expected to get free loot out of it. That is cause enough to be angry at them.

There was some crappy rum bottles sold IRL right. Probably off topic for the questions but as long as it shits on f76 right?

The sight of squirrels in the game spoils a major part of Fallout (the original game) because of where you discover squirrel bits coming from. When I first saw them in game I just sighed at yet another piece of the story being torn up / ignored.

Holy crap I never even thought about the language compatibility issue, very valid point.
---
It is a universal issue - even the metal security doors aren't perfectly aligned, they just don't show that awful gap that the wooden ones do.
---
No one stole weapons.. it has everything to do with the difficulty scaling due to the amount of players in the zone. A level 6 will never contribute to a SBQ and thus is simply a leech.
---
The OP has every right to be unhappy at the situation.
---
How does a level 6 even effect the launch? AFAIK the only thing that changes the spawned creature levels is the person launching the nuke. Him being there made no difference to you. 
---
There is no purpose therefore useless, therefore shouldn't be in it. No one will ever need this as there is no other headlamp mod. No argument can get over that fact, the only fact there is in this argument.
---
 The other are not this one, they have multiple colours this does not. Cmon man, surely you can see where your logic falters. No use having something to revert back to when you can't change it anyway.
---
 Also this isn't FO4, every armor is different. This mod is unnecessary, completely useless and serves no purpose. Your 'facts' be damned son. 
---
I do not believe that someone was just racist towards you, with how big that kind of thing is right now (anti racism) then you could easily get that person fired and get compensation as well out of the company. 
---
The special stats are just for passive bonuses of each stat. Perk points are fixed so it still requires you to manually put 3x points in charisma for every perk shared.
---
 I stopped playing about 6 weeks ago and for me the building was the one aspect of the game that would have kept me around outside of new quests, creatures and new locations content.  Almost every single build looks the same, the items in the Atomic Shop were getting sillier and had little to do with the Fallout 'world', the cost of items are beyond unreasonable.  I would actually throw $10 - $20 down here and there if I thought I was getting some value out of the items.  Bethesda really blew a chance at creating a great game with a healthy population by not taking the time to think some decisions through.
---
second comment, but bear with me...
---
There is a bug associated with the chainsaw and super sledge. Both items, regardless of mods, break stealth when equipped. Similar weapons (hand buzz saw blade, grognak axe) do not follow this trend. 
---
Also, it must be a bug that rippers do not exceed level 40. I'm also not sure if it's a bug or intentional that wood armor can only be obtained as 1 star legendary drops. Maybe this is intended, or maybe it's broken.
---
Then how much is it cus haven‚Äôt gotten a price yet

He has it right there. He sent the guy a curse word so that is why he was banned.

I think the vaults will be one of the first ones released. They already have the insides built and modeled some of them even have enemies. Terminals aren‚Äôt fleshed out. There are some interesting YouTube videos of people glitching in there. 
---
Another one that will prob come is the expansion of the white springs bunker and more storyline with modus since there are blocked off rooms with doors and gates on them.
---
I made a post on this sub back before launch about this and the general consensus was that it'd be a copyright nightmare. Still tho, it'd be a neat feature to see in-game. 
---
I found an instigating harpoon gun someone sold to a vendor at Whitespring. I couldn't not buy it. I need to see what I can do with it. I think it might be pretty good.

There's nothing wrong with writing suggestions and requesting stuff you want to see added ALSO. That's great. I'd also like to see a lot of this so-called "not silly" stuff ppl are asking for. But I just wish they'd ask for it without slamming everyone else that is liking this stuff, and not acting like "this is not true fallout" gurus when in reality super silly things, casual things, gag items and characters, have been a part of this franchise since the first.  
---
I've often done it. It does hang for a bit alright. The easiest way to tell your back 100% is to walk. If you don't glide, you're back.
---
? just having them equipped?  
---
I have wood armor listed :(
---
Lol!  Hoping to get back online after a bit to check the damages.  I‚Äôll report back!
---
I have a hard time not one shotting them work melee.
---
I rather they spend more time fixing the crashes first like how may nukes do I need to miss because server dies
---
I had 2 low level players follow me around the bog /mire once, putting a shot on everything I killed, they followed for around 2 hours and tbh I enjoyed it, I looked on them as my pets even dropping stuff for em.
---
But yea I've had people try and steal my nuke before, popping in when I'm near the end. Personally if I see someone at a silo I switch servers but some people have no manners.
---
And 2 hours to do a silo solo...daym. invest in hacker and lockpicking and it'll go a lot smoother.
---
The legend goes: "That there dang ol squirrel over yonder done stoled muh gun!"
---
Fire proof + dense mod negates your explosive damage.
---
Sentinels/assassins negates the rest.
---
To be completely honest, it sounds like you came in with a lot of unrealistic expectations. Logistically, the character shaping the story by making decisions wasn't gonna happen. They were very clear about there not being NCP's so that expectation shouldn't have even existed. 
---
People duping is a direct result of people cheating in the game. End. Of. I 100% guarantee you they'd absolutely still dup even if the game was your vision of perfection. It's what people do. You say you're seeing them everywhere but I highly doubt that. My husband constantly gets accused of being a duper and using a TSE when he's literally never had a TSE weapon. He just took the time to make a proper build/spec and wrecks things with his humble, non-explosive, sniper rifle. 
---
You can find all kinds of very useful weapons for your build if your definition of useful isn't a TSE. 
---
I, for one, would love to see dances and emotes. I've been playing Fallout since the beginning too. Hell I started playing online games with Ultima Online. Your "pedigree" doesn't make anything that you say more meaningful that someone that's been playing for five minutes. 
---
At the end of the day, nothing that you've mentioned should be anything that would ruin the game for you. Don't look in the Atom shop if you don't like it. Ignore what other players have and enjoy working on your own character. You can absolutely be successful with or without armor, and with just about any weapon out there. Unless you're trying to min/max there shouldn't be a problem. 
---
Blaming everything on "young people" sounds like an excuse. If the game isn't for you then that's fine. Don't place what you wanted the game to be, despite them being pretty damn clear about what it was from the start, on everyone else. You sound like the kind of person that's not happy unless everyone plays the game the way they want to. I base this on the fact that almost your entire comment belittles other play styles or calls for things to be nerfed simply because you don't like them. 
---
Try trading it to other players.
---
Im on right now if u wana trade.
---
Don't call them raiders. That's giving legitimacy to a griefing playstyle.
---
I have a friend of a friend who does that kind of crap. He's not a raider. He just likes to blow stuff up and pick fights. He's too much of a little bitch to like the idea of the upcoming survival servers.
---
Well RifleGaming is doing a video series of nuking new places. Maybe we could drop a bug in his ear and save ourselves a little trouble. 
---
i meant it more as in, i doubt it will actually be a DLC that will give us a way to actually USE geck, i doubt it will be a big dlc too, in fact, i fear it will not even be a real impact to the game as it is, bethesda seems to be making sure the atom store gets filled with pathetic trash and thats about it, not giving me good hopes so far anyway
---
if youre talking about the part i think you are (soylent green reference) isnt that iguana bits in FO1? Also, its just one guy and a stand, not likely to be the same across all of the country
---
Not since the buff to fireproof. It's like Bethesda enjoys making us suffer.
---
Yea, Bethesda "fixed" it a while ago by removing it's heavy tag. 
---
It's uncommon but also useless. 
---
I have two friends that are min-max builds that have had issues with being detected while equipping them. Outside of these weapons, enemies normally push through them to get to me. 
---
Yea but that's only like 5.56 and some other types. I wanna be able to do something with the 2000 cells, .38 and missiles I got instead of just throwing it away. 
---
Xbox *specifically* looks for "inappropriate language" (read: swears, derogatory slurs, etc) and will issue temporary chat/account bans (usually between 1 day and 7 days) if you get reported for sending them in voice or text messages
---
Yep.....I got 4 mutations once, as I couldn't spawn anywhere except where the nuke was. I did get my loot though! On the 4th try I loaded in and sprinted inside, where I died at the inside door. 5th time I made it and got my junk.
---
Sick of fighting SBQ, nothing else to do so waiting for more content to play again. 
---
People already dupe guns, if they were able to dupe specific legend mods (even if one time use) then the game would be pointless. 
---
Yes I will be home about 9:45 PM est. I will send you a message then
---
You're not wrong. My crashes took a nose dive after avoiding that place.
---
I was down to two pieces of armor left to create and an upper level guy befriended me and made those pieces for me! The mole miner killing grind in Welsh was gettin OLD. lol. 
---
If stealing a car didn't remove the original car from the person who owned it, I would steal all the cars. The only reason for anyone to care is because they're trying to keep cars artificially scarce to leverage them for economic power.
---
I got one today, for the first time, at level 41. I've had four Gatling Lasers tho, and a Plasma Gatling for about 20 levels (level 50 locked). Also have been hoarding crossbow bolts since I came across them
---
And then we can say ‚ÄúWUG‚Äù 
---
I miss diablo 2
---
It's like a glitched version of the last thing you were looking at.
---
You don‚Äôt know wtf you are talking about.
---
I don't know why we can't just have the Fallout 3/NV trading system back, where you can trade multiple items for items or caps, and you'd have to finalize the transaction, instead of trading things one at a time for caps only
---
impractical and completely counter productive 
---
I certainly agree on Diablo style seasons. I also think Diablo 3 finally realized how bad their loot system was broken (much like the post above mentions in FO76.) Playing for 100 hours and never finding a legendary weapon you \*want\* to use is a serious problem. The fact that you and I are willing to try shows how much we love the franchise. On the same subject, legendary effects that trivialize 99% of the game is also broken. Unless they implement Diablo/Division style tiers then these weapons have no place in this game. In my opinion, this is a 'normal' difficulty game. I'd love to see a 'very hard' or 'survival' difficulty (using FO4's standards).
---
Really? I never see PA plans there. I only ever see gatling laser and gauss rifle plans
---
What?
---
Then the mode will become a ghost town like every other game that has punishment like that.
---
Remember that first moment in town when the shit hits the fan and Tycho whips out his shotgun?  All of a sudden you were in the middle of it and had to pick a side.  
---
This dude remembers.
---
That's absolutely nuts.
---
I nuked myself just to get it open areas on the map with my base just on the out skirt for FT
---
 Then ran in to center  20 secs to reach the center it was like racing a nascar to get to the center lol
---
Duping isn't stealing.
---
I completely agree with the last part. I mean okay, you grind and you get the best gear now it takes 1 shot to kill enemies instead of 3, so you keep grinding the hardest mob to decrease your ttk on said mobs in a never ending cycle? I never understood that. I've killed the sbq and that's it, I've no more interest in killing her again. I am perfectly fine having to shoot more than once at an enemy with the weapon that I made and modified from scratch.
---
Every single pve based mmo I've played, I quit after reaching "end game" content because I saw no point in grinding the end game raid so I can grind the raid more efficiently next time. I guess if some of the people that are competitive in it (like going for fastest times etc. I'd see why they'd do it) but otherwise I just don't see any fun in it. Or if you like the atmosphere of the game (like I do with fallout or borderlands), but you don't need to be op to 99% of the games content to enjoy it in my eyes. 
---
Yeah I was tweaked out my first time that happened. Thought it was some sort of glitch. But on this note, Has anyone every seen nuked whitesprings literally leveled? like pieces of the land/buidlings appearing to not have loaded in. found it really odd.
---
I‚Äôve been getting frustrated with this bug(?) as well but the comment before you made me think; maybe it‚Äôs because the people around you detect you, even if the threat doesn‚Äôt.
---
Ability to mail things to alt characters so they can hold weapons you're not using right now or so you can give them weapons better suited to the alts build. 
---
Yeah still not showing up so still in the market
---
Sounds like you're mixed up and wrong. I believe you're thinking of iguana bits, and it is pretty clear 'iguana bits' only refers to human flesh in that context, because the same establishes iguanas do actually exist as a separate food item (skewered on a stick whole), so not all iguana bits are a euphemism for human flesh/strange meat in subsequent games.
---
Squirrels on the other hand are a new thing starting from Fallout 3  if I'm not mistaken. It's just we haven't seen a clear source the animal in any game until now.
---
I already said the mod was useless on the excavator, but just because something doesn't work on one thing doesn't mean it doesn't have a purpose for others. That kind of logic can't be applied it'd be like saying toothpaste has no purpose because some people don't have teeth. I was telling the op the purpose of the mod in general not whether or not it does anything for the excavator I never brought up the excavator until my original comment only the mod and what can be done with it.
---
Only 3 people on my server at minute
---
You're defending dupers by agreeing it's Bethesda's fault these people are cheating and disconnecting us constantly. They need banning. Not given excuses.
---
It's ridiculous logic anyway. GTAO has been out for years and people work really, really hard finding dupe methods. There are websites devoted to sharing potential dupe methods and for sharing new dupe methods (plus it's massive business on youtube). That's not rockstar's fault and I've never seen anybody suggest it is. This is only done here because of the strange Bethesda hate stick everybody has up their back side. The only criticism I'll level is that rockstar patches those dupes in hours or days. Bethesda took too long to patch them and needs to catch up big time. Criticising them for dupers duping though? That's bizarre.
---
It‚Äôs definitely a Bethesda issue.  I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs just server side, though.  This client has HUGE issues retaining a connection to the servers.  It‚Äôs far worse for me than any of my friends, but none of them (none that are still playing anyway) have an Xbox one x.  I‚Äôm thinking their client doesn‚Äôt play well with some of the hardware/software unique to the One X. 
---
In any case, Bethesda truly fucked up here.  I won‚Äôt be playing this game much longer. 
---
I love that thread by the way. I love how you took the statistics seriously instead of just going with confirmation bias. Excellent work.
---
&gt; So you‚Äôd commit a felony 
---
Helping slaves escape was once a felony.  Just because its really, really, really, against the law doesn't make it immoral.
---
The War on Drugs should have taught you that.
---
Happens to me too. If I am not there when the thing starts I don't get anything.
---
Darn it. I have that happen every now and again and that usually does the trick.
---
 if you want a solo fallout go back to.any of the released fallouts lol. 
---
On our way!!!
---
I'll see what I can do in a bit. If I find em I'll let ya know
---
the scorched sometime ramble on jiberish especially if the lose you, could be it 
---
 Not me, I have no PA paint. ;(
---
üòâ
---
Yes because this game has no problems.
---
Fucking idiot
---
same issue but mine is causing clipping with power rendering my outside switch for my garage door useless
---
I have played since Fallout (1, OG Vault-dweller) and have never used a console command or cheat.
---
It's happened to me too, maybe like a week ago. I've moved a few times since and haven't paid attention
---
It's a heavy though. It makes me really sad cause it's the only weapon I carry now that weighs more than 5 lbs
---
No, you're just too fucking dumb to make it work. Everyone else has logged a shit ton of hours in it and here is your dumb ass. 
---
So I was just lucky. (Probably)
---
I have a question. My C.A.M.P. is at Whitespring. Not to farm anything but rather a trading post, it's just at the end of the little river towards the west side. I have 2 missile turrets and that's all. Nothing is in the range of these turrets, would you count this C.A.M.P. as a problem?
---
You appear offline
---
Once I noticed it, I shuffled my base 2 more times (after logging out and back in to a different server) to test. Both times, quoted 40 but charged 160.
---
Personally I don't even want an explosive gun. I want a gun that does \*something\* that fits my build. I don't want the 30th light armor +damage vs. bugs level 25 item. While I've done it, I don't want to have to farm Whitesprings. I want areas that are fun and challenging that offer appropriate rewards.
---
It means your over your bugdet on storage/build blueprint  i have tested this ( glitching base items over the limited amout) and only ever get 160 cap.move it i was over the limit. 
---
My problem is the doors that you place with brick walls. They dont line up with the frame.
---
Nice, I've tried the past two weekends to get him. I'm on my way...
---
I just did that random encounter, I dont even think I got anything but 250 xp.
---
Run the game .exe from the installation directory.
---
Light sight and acog 
---
I run a small 35 player community on ps4. Everyone has mics. 18+. Lots of fun. 
---
any luck since then?
---
Well done!! Must have been moving like Usain Bolt to get that! 
---
No. Although the turrets can have quite the reach it‚Äôs more about the large amounts of bodies that get spawned at that specific location. The bodies each have to be accounted for and if you don‚Äôt tag it but the turret does it will remain there unmoved for a very long time
---
Having reduced damage means NO damage at all?
---
If they can use it to generate more sales, it would be a good business decision.   Expanding the current game isn't going to generate more sales as most FO fans already feel ripped off by it. 
---
How the hell do you have clean walls??
---
Ok
---
I don't get it. Duping doesn't deprive anyone else of anything. It isn't similar to theft of physical goods at all.
---
It's more like running a sci-fi "cornucopia machine" (if you aren't familiar, think like the replicators from Star Trek that can create most normal items out of cheap energy) in a society that has banned them to preserve scarcity of goods so that social hierarchy can be maintained for the benefit of the upper classes.
---
Yes. If you have two accounts you can run both at the same time though how well depends on your PC.
---
Here is what works for me:
---
1) login to launcher with account #1
---
2) start the game with the launcher
---
3) logout of the launcher and login to account #2
---
4) create a shortcut on your desktop to fallout.exe and run it. Login to the second account and start the game.
---
You may not have to do #3 but it worked better for me this way.
---
Iirc the brotherhood of steel was started by people who quit the enclave, but in new Vegas there was also the outcasts who were a group of people who left the brotherhood either by being kicked out or leaving voluntarily
---
Huh, you'd think you'd *have* to crouch right at landing in order to get it in the first place.
---
Well I know the turret doesn't tag anything, it won't even tag the radstags that roam there.
---
Seems to the be worst with the brick walls that have the metal frame. 
---
On that one, it's just completely floating.
---
My last three queen fights glitched beyond being able to finish. 
---
She stops taking damage...
---
Last time, a \*\*Legendary wolf was invisible and attacking me for 10 minutes until I convinced the crowd to spam it whenever they could lock on.  I think it was stuck under the map, and could basically one-shot me if it found an opening.  The model was stretch necking and occasionally appeared stuck to me. 
---
I leave it on when other people have tse. It‚Äôs a fight for the legendaries and if they aren‚Äôt going to wait for other players, I won‚Äôt wait for them.
---
So he can take zero damage?
---
I can understand ultra reduced but none at all?
---
guess I should go back to where 99% of the FO fanbase is lol
---
I've killed 2 at Whitesprings during my time playing. One at the South gate and another at the West gate. I died once during the South gate one, but it was from the other mutants with him. Once they were all dead, he was easy.
---
Op directly referenced Excavator. 
---
Store the components in your stash, or hold them all in your inventory. For some reason the game won't pull from both spots at the same time when crafting/repairing sometimes.
---
level 45 auto with no perks like 36 damage only, but it's perfect around low level areas. 
---
Thank you!
---
Neat little mod from Nexus, it's called "Clean Plaster Walls". 
---
Thats better than the last weapon I got from the queen, a nocturnal pole hook 1*.
---
Happened to me a few times 
---
Lol, that‚Äôs not how it works, people would be constantly raging if that were the case.
---
That could be. Whatever it is, it's frustrating in a sniper build. If other players detecting you or threats detecting them ruins sneak attacks, you're forced to play lone wolf, and even then a player stumbling into your kill zone means you might as well let them kill everything. 
---
What did they say/do that was racist?
---
Server crashes, the canvas bag false advertising, Nuka Dark false advertising, release of private info to the public via help tickets, XP exploits, caps exploits, carry weight exploits, duping exploits, bugged quests, bugged weapons, bugged enemies, access to the developers room, I mean I can keep going. All of these must equal that strange hate stick you‚Äôre talking about.  I find it hard to believe that you don‚Äôt see why anyone would be criticizing Bethesda here. 
---
I dupe all the time and give stuff to my friend so that they can actually enjoy the game.  If this is how people are enjoying this broken game then who are you to tell people how to enjoy a game they paid for? Imagine buying something with your own money and then having someone you don‚Äôt even know telling you how to use what you‚Äôve bought and if you use it any other way then you‚Äôre in the wrong. Lol
---
I always find some inside Mount Blair Trainyard and a little bit northwest of it.
---
That takes 30 minutes though?  Sounds like just a bad glitch.
---
People keep saying it's his armor but I don't get taking zero damage at all
---
Exactly everything says 40 till the point it deducts from your balance. There's also some errors at vendors too, seems like a rounding error. Sometimes I sell something like 40 of something for 50 caps/ea and it pays out 40 caps short. Bethesda no do mathing good
---
Message me on live I will invite you, I'm set to online no idea what prob is
---
Are you really going to do this on all the posts? I answered on my most recent post. Anyone who cares to know the answer can find it there
---
Hate to never this but I am experiencing the exact same thing. Full repair on Poseidon just metal armor. Done 7 times now to 100% repair. Did you get it eventually?
---
If your items are split between your inventory and your stash, that can cause issues. put it all in one. relog if it still doesnt work.  
---
If you have the exact items, that can cause issues. get more and relog if it doesnt fix.  
---
Do you have any required cards equipped?
---
if none of those help I am out of ideas.
---
Pull your head out of your ass, dipshit, and read.  Everyone has problems with this piece of shit game.  Even you, you‚Äôre just too scared to admit you made a bad purchase.  It‚Äôs ok, admit it and move on to a game that‚Äôs actually good.
---
Or keep playing this terrible game forever.  Not my problem. 
---
My only guess is it got used up excessively in the war 
---
I didn't notice it was you posting all of these. My apologies. I just wanted some different opinions from people.
---
No worries. Since I started playing Fallout 76, I knew asshats were gonna show up.
---
I‚Äôm curious as to how this survival mode thing will play out though.
---
A pecking order of asshats, becoming established. Lolz
---
Max the perks..like night/day
---
CHUMP
---
Are a filthy casual or tryhards grinder?
---
 I just did it and got plans between level 15 and level 20. None before and none since on two chars. 
---
 Its certainly possible but as far as I'm aware, you are the only one who has ever seen this. 
---
They want you to craft it.
---
No, you should definitely do that
---
There's also dodgy the agi perk.
---
If you can sustain fire long enough he'll run out of ap and take some damage but most fights are over faster
---
Mods fixed it years ago. There's no official fix. 
---
Duping in itself isn‚Äôt directly harmful to anyone else, no, it‚Äôs the fact that you can dupe stuff like bobbleheads where the effects stack that is a problem. You don‚Äôt want to pvp cause you don‚Äôt know if the other person has duped 500 strength bobbleheads and will one-hit you
---
I can‚Äôt find your gamer tag
---
Pretty much.  Fallout 4 was almost sandbox like. But with guns and zombies...
---
I just wish they'd get rid of the stash limits. So many of us enjoyed Fallout 4 because we could be mad little hoarders!
---
I know I was. I'd build stacks and stacks and stacks of the same sort of weapon/armor just to go on a modding spree and re-equip my whole settlement.
---
Damn.. now I wanna go play F4 some more..
---
I didn't understand it either but I think they're asking for Karma because they found the Charleston Vendor for people.
---
Wood armor, shrouded mod plan can be found in Raleigh's bunker in the mire, you need the password from Abbie's bunker to get in, the plan is sitting on a table in the workshop/supply room.
---
It gives the same bonus as shadowed, but also gives bonus move speed when sneaking, 
---
Tagging isn‚Äôt about what it shoots at. It‚Äôs about instanced loot. The fact that you can loot an enemy you killed but if I‚Äôm not in the team or didn‚Äôt hit it I won‚Äôt get anything. Team instanced loot is based on a distance of maybe about 10 meters give or take. Anything outside that radius will not drop loot for you. It‚Äôs why when enemies kill enemies you can‚Äôt pick up their loot
---
So he learned a lesson that  the trading system is flawed?
---
Were they sleeping?

Lore means nothing to them anymore. If they want, they'll just retcon and shoehorn in whatever nonsense serves their immediate purpose. 
---
Jesus lmao that's shitty
---
I don't grief with my TSE, but I do run Fireproof 3 and Dense.  Jump in front all you want, won't kill me.
---
He talked about how he found it for the excavator, but then said his question was why. So I was telling them why the mod exists, he never said why does it exist for the excavator so I took it as they were asking why does this mod exist in general.
---
No because bethesda Austin has nothing to do with fo4
---
i live next to a vendor. i love him so much&lt;3 i feel like deacon when he talks to takahashi. :') bffs
---
My question is why can I produce 100-180 .50 rounds at a time but I can only make, like, thirty-something 5.56 rounds.
---
And were did you get your numbers youtube 
---
That always makes me giggle!
---
It's right there in the game.
---
Thanks mate!
---
You're saying the despite the garbage RNG - only those with the time to grind are those worthy of getting what they want?
---
Private servers and mods would make everyone happy. I don't want to share a server with someone who can one-shot 99% of the game. That's not fun to me. Have a level 212 take the workshop from my level 22 just for the joy of griefing a newb is annoying af. You know they don't need the screws and gears.  
---
I've loved every Fallout game (with the exception of the mediocre to bad Fallout BoS for the OG Xbox). I love the FO87 lore including the efforts they made to keep BoS, supermutants, etc. at least moderately lore compliant.
---
Let's discuss this. What's your opinion on this subject?
---
When I bought them I was 41 I believe
---
Not until you can drain his AP or stagger him, grenades with radiation damage work well also use a gun with a high rate of fire, or if it‚Äôs a wanted player just don‚Äôt attack until they are moving 
---
I love it when a robot calls me chump.
---
It's still the same fix tho, why not just implement it in the next creation club update or something
---
Oh god... not another Break it Early Test Application... no.... god not again!!
---
LOL this is great!
---
So you had stuff you knew was duped and not legit.  Caught with stolen goods, basically.  Sucks to be you, but you were greedy.
---
I dropped 7 nukes this weekend on the queen and got the plan 9 times (Two regular SB dropped it too.)  I want some damn serum recipes!
---
Yeah, I dont think it would ever become many people's main gameplay mode. Maybe it shouldn't ever become a main fixture of the game. It could be temporary challenge servers with exclusive rewards that carry over to the main game after conclusion. 
---
Say, reach level 50 on this temporary 2 week server and you get a pack of exclusive skins, or a customised legendary. 
---
Come to think of it, I'm now pretty much describing path of exile and their short duration competition servers.

Bethesda should be banned for scamming! ü§£

Yes and this is why I don't stock extra sets any more.

That did the trick. Thanks!

You can place crops inside fireplaces.

They're farming newbies, of course.

Well, ranching them, I guess.  Grief ranchers.

I give up! Congratulations.

In Abbie‚Äôs quest lore, the wood armor is supposed to protect you from the strangler vines, and monsters of the mire.
---
Fwiw, if you think I‚Äôm wrapping myself in what looks like tree bark against monsters 25 to 30 lvls above me, 
---
You‚Äôre nuts.
---
You said a swear and it auto bans you. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck‚Äù from ANY ONE or too any one will result in a auto ban like you have if the person you sent it to reports you for ‚Äúharassment‚Äù 
---
They certainly know what everyone has in inventory.  Or else how would you have anything at login?
---
hehe fucking cute! ive been wanting a legendary pipe pistol. imma look for this squirrely
---
the fact that you are making a post about the game crashing 4 months after release is maybe a sign to put the game down
---
Because the game is an unpolished, unthought-through, mess even months after release. What other answer do you expect. The amount of incredibly obvious oversights in this game, the fact that singular modders have been able to fix major parts of the game that Bethesda still seems to be unable to do, proves they don't care. Just move on.

4. Description of the issue: Walls/Roofs and floors in CAMPS get misplaced/glitched out when you relog, the effects of this can be seen in the video. This issue has persisted since the BETA.

5. Bethesda Customer Support Ticket Number: No Bethesda Customer Support Ticket: There's no option to select any issue's you might experience with your CAMP.

If you encounter someone like you, you wouldn't be able to make any trade.
---
That particular Scorched might have been a Tolkien geek ü§ì 
---
no I wouldn't - but lets face it most would that is pretty much why most crime happens - that is why we make laws to make it more difficult and have police because the less easy it becomes the fewer people do it 
---
If you want to bash a behemoth there are known spawn locations for the bastads on Google, you can even nuke them for a chance to fight a 3 star legendary version
---
Hmm this could be kind of tough to test Ina. Controlled fashion, as there are a bunch of other variables, but I'll add it to the growing list ;)
---
I don't think so, so long and it isn't a voice message. 
---
Yeah but if they can make a zone around WhiteSprings, they can make it around the golf club just as easily, since it is a nuke zone, not sure why people build there any more, I moved away a long time ago. I am ok either, but what I am saying is at least make the top half of WhiteSpring a no build zone, it is even separated by a wall, so shouldn't be too difficult .. I noticed they already nerfed the enemy spawns, much fewer enemies seem to spawn now and even if new people who up, doesn't seem to trigger new enemies, but I may be wrong ..
---
500 caps to a level 39/40 player to save them some time collecting. 
---
People cheating in multiplayer games is the reason why I usually play single player games
---
did the same thing about an hour ago... no power armor on exciting to say the least 
---
They made greenhouses, why couldn‚Äôt we have those plans..
---
I believe this is the correct answer everybody else trying to shit on bethesda but being over the camp b budget would make sense 
---
The ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get any ideas... chump‚Äù gets me every time
---
Also more than one type of stairs for interiors
---
Yep. My games always load wicked slow. The audibles are there but the visuals are not. 
---
yeah no thanks.
---
Thanks! 
---
Theres a map somewhere on this sub, the different vendors are
---
Watoga station
---
Phoenix (super duper mart watoga)
---
Harpers ferry
---
Raiders (pretty much all of the train stations in the savage divide, and I think sutton station.)
---
Responders (all in the forest, west ash heap, toxic valley)
---
Whitespring resort
---
Enclave bunker
---
It bothers me so bad. I love the brick so I dont want to change it. 
---
If I only had a TSE to have to put away...
---
I alternate between 76 and 4. I love them both but they play so differently. As for the stash limit. Bethesda cant make it unlimited as yet as they are try to keep increasing it without harming server  performance 
---
Agreed, but never exit the game in a nuke zone area at least the primary two areas, lesson learned, happened to me as well and some bugger made off with all my junk .. don't get me started about people stealing your loot when they didn't kill you either ..
---
Add it to the list of things that should never have got through testing. 
---
"Super size me!"
---
You can join GT Chowtime247. We haven‚Äôt launched yet. 
---
I think you can get assassins and sentinels legendary effects together. He probably bought a set from some duper. 5 pieces of assassins will give you 40% reduction in player damage and 5 pieces of sentinel will give you 75% damage reduction.
---
I fought someone a few times who was likely using stuff like this. He had 900 or so cap bounty. He got me the first time, but I came back and tagged him while he was mid jump. You need to stagger these people in order to kill them. If they stagger, they lose that 75% reduction. A fully automatic rifle with tank killer perk card does the trick. Just don't stop shooting. The guy eventually started behaving after claiming his second bounty.
---
I would like to see some testing of a gamma gun verses these people though. I wonder if the radiation damage would ignore his damage reduction.
---
Thanks!  
---
I almost have enough treasure maps to do another controlled test to try and prove the server seed + player seed!  
---
Btw there are some weapons that seem to have similarly odd patterns, every 3* railway rifle I've looted, traded for, or seen in a vendor has +50% limb DMG for example.   
---
I had 8 Mr. handy buz blades with reflect DMG.. Not saying they can't have other effects, they just seem to lean heavily toward some 
---
I see nukes being dropped all the time. every server I play in for more then 20 minutes usually.
---
I'm so tired of wooden armor 
---
Would love to be apart if you don‚Äôt mind sending me the link!
---
This will likely be an unpopular opinion;
---
While I agree that 76 has it's share of retconning, I think they've achieved it in such a way where it makes sense for the most part. Yes, I think we could have done with the BOS, but I don't think having a small splinter faction of them really impacts all too much on the lore. It was actually quite nice to hear [Roger Maxson's voice for the first time, and the beginning of the BOS.](/spoiler)
---
There is going to come a time soon enough where Bethesda will have had the franchise longer than the creators. It's theirs to tweak how they like. 
---
Thank you!  This worked!  So annoying, but the bugs are part of the charm -- I guess.
---
Thank you :) 
---
But should this be happening if I'm *under* my camp budget? (by about 20%.)
---
I am sure they can query the database, but I very much doubt that a CS person has the tools or permissions to just grant stuff to players or research their full inventory history.
---
If they think it‚Äôs important to run queries for giant stacks of junk or batches of the same TSE weapon, they will get their DBA to do it.  They won‚Äôt do that for a random person complaining about a gun they might have just dropped by accident.  They‚Äôd be overwhelmed if they gave every ticket that kind of attention.
---
Most online games won‚Äôt go through all that for item claims, or they do it as a one-time courtesy.
---

Transcript:
---
&gt;!I had a directive from Vault-Tec: secure the region's three nuclear missile silos. I... WE... had to make sure they didn't fall into the wrong hands. I knew I couldn't do it alone, so I asked you -- my Vault 76 family -- for help. And what did you do? My God... Why? How could you do this? We were supposed to take control of the nukes. Not engage in an Appalachian arms race! Please, stop this madness. The cycle of destruction has to stop. I... I haven't lost faith in you. I know you are GOOD people, and will do the right thing. If anything I've... lost my faith in Vault-Tec. They gave me a mission I could never accomplish on my own. They must have known I'd need your help. Did they also know what you'd do? It's just so hard not* to feel... manipulated!&lt;
---
+1 on the Tesla ... it‚Äôs great for events!
---
I found advanced connection or wiring plan a few days ago.  It has a few connectors that go through walls.
---
How did you get the normal floor to place on ground level?
---
Sorry was te ying to spread word on like 5.platforms while defending the bot from.griefers
---
Oh look, it‚Äôs got 49% on metacritic:
---
https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/fallout-76
---
How the fuck is it STILL going down over 2 months later?  Because it‚Äôs bad. 
---
But no, you‚Äôre right.  It‚Äôs my fault this game is terrible and doesn‚Äôt work properly.
---
What a fucking tool. 
---
Awesome thanks, very much appreciated..! üëçüèª
---
I know right, and laser ammo is so hard to come by in the US, why is it so prevalent in the game.  J/K thanks to divergence you'll never rationalize the difference 
---
Okay, what IS the generally acceptable lvl to join? I‚Äôm mid 50s, and feel fairly certain I‚Äôd be unwelcome.
---
He's dead now, currently hunting again. Ill.update when find new
---
This. Addictol is the solution to phantom -1 stats.
---
Honestly I was thinking that was a possibility but the ZERO damage part still surprises me. I‚Äôd expect just a little at least
---
Beth uses Fallout to test ideas for Elder Scrolls, much in the same way a step-mother hates the adopted child and favours their own.
---
He was wanted and moving before I started shooting him
---
 Thx for the info 
---
yeah you have basically no armor so max damage 
---
Ooh. So manly with your big bad gamering. Mmm. 
---
These items don‚Äôt have security tags though. There‚Äôs not even anyone watching the store. Sure it‚Äôs not good, but it is a bit too easy.
---
Yeah, it's pretty shitty. There's a whole bunch of bugs that the unofficial patch fixes that BGS never addressed. But we have modders to thank. Thankfully with 76 being a full service online game, they *have* to try to swat most of the bugs. 
---
Oh see I always had a bunch but recently (since I've been trying to collect flux for the shower) I've seen one. May just be bad luck
---
Wait wat ? Why the downvotes I don't get it
---
Agreed, it's very much enjoyed like a nightmare, but you're partially awake and know it's fake.
---
I‚Äôve never seen someone whiteknight a fucking gaming company chill out fucking crybaby 
---
It's obvious what the larger Fallout fanbase wants.   Hint: it's single player.    
---
I think a great addition would be literally anything that was in the settlement building process of fallout four but no we‚Äôre probably just going to have to end up paying for that instead.
---
well first of all the first part sounds like a lie about the fat man. Because you do not get the notification telling you on screen what legendary it is until you loot it. So the story about you seeing it come up and not getting it seems a little fishy. Also why is the guy a douche for using a weapon in the game. I mean its not really his fault the gun one shots everything. Also Gatling lasers don't use fusion cores they use plasma cores.
---
sorry you had a bad time though dude hate when the bodies go flying.
---
Power armour of all kinds, except raider, spawns on a rooftop in Point Pleasant and the Nuka Cola factory. A google search will provide exact locations.
---
Got the deep pocketed combat armor chest plans from the always vigilant event 
---
For reals. At least until they support mods
---
Don't see this happening. As much as I want some good dlc I highly doubt it at this point 
---
I'm built there as well. Only I didn't put anything on top and hid all my stuff inside.
---
It's really easy to test. Find someone with 15 base agility, all three ranks of sneak, 1 rank of escape artist. Even in broad daylight a few feet from enemies they're fine and can peck guys off one at a time without having to re-stealth to evade full detection. Switch to those two weapons (super sledge or chainsaw) and they're guaranteed to be fully detected and killed. It's nearly 100% of the time. 
---
Fallout exists in an alternative timeline, one where certain technologies we know and love weren't created and some that we don't have do. As such the history of the US is different than in our reality. So just because you guys have lots of 5.56 doesn't mean the reality of fallouts world did. Not only that but the bombs drop 50ish years from now. What kind of changes have happened to ammunition in the last 50 or 60 years?. Why would you think 5.56 won't have some changes in either technological refinement or in widescale usage
---
I still have yet to see a chicken

Here's the video
---
Are you having a stroke? 
---
Lol. Is that shit story going around? Amazing üòÇ
---
No idea when ive tested it. It was only when i was over 100% storage or blueprint it would charge    on a different thought it could be depending on location it may charge more as i kept and tested mine south east bottem end of map out the way of everyone. 
---
I wouldn't, your CAMP is probably fine. Turrets need to be right in front of something to aggro and yours are probably far enough away not to kill steal. 
---
It's people who put their turret farm right by the back window who are the shits. 
---
Is Austin doing the patches right now? I thought it was still BGS right now and Austin was taking over long term support.
---
Get off my lawn!
---
I‚Äôve seen the small and large version at Harpers Ferry. I got mine from an event.
---
legendaries is what make this game good. lol I for one would quit instantly if they removed them so would thousands and thousands of others i bet.
---
The outcasts were in fallout 3. When Elder Lyons went away from the typical Brotherhood beleifs and decided to help the people against the super mutants, those who chose to focus on the original goal of gathering technology left, branding themselves Brotherhood Outcasts.
---
When Lyons died and Arthur Maxson took over, he welcomed back the Outcasts into the main Brotherhood.
---
If people misuse the downvote feature...
---
I don't see it happening either.   It could be a fun mod/fan project to work on since Bethesda said mod support is suppose to be coming in the future. 
---
I know someone with that set of perks/stats, I'll give it a go, thanks
---
I mean the assets are there, pathing is set for AI enemies, I just don't see how financially they're going to tell this grand story over a few years without diverting all the money to a new game. If 76 is all free DLC, maybe you can justify that this isn't a half finished product, and it's going to make sense later. But for now, it doesn't inspire confidence.
---
Today I learned a lot I didn't know. üëç
---
I'll take a jetpack tommorow. GT statesidellama
---
Away From Keyboard.
---
I don't know what you Googled, but it wasn't AFK. Virtually all the results were the correct answer.
---
Honestly, it sounds like they need to rework how items are stored. If Wood X 1000000 affects performance more then Wood x 10, they are doing something weirrrddddd. Its almost like they're storing each individual pieces information.. which is the stupidest idea ever. No wonder their servers are unstable.
---
I‚Äôm tired of trying to get thru the Silos to do the nuke.  To date I‚Äôve attempted it 7 times.  Of that 1 time I did it all by myself to the end - very satisfying.  4 of them I crashed the game (including twice post latest patch), and of the remaining 2, one I died mid run with another player and he finished it so I got the credit for helping.  The last time I tried, i got stuck in the ceiling using the fire axe to VATS on a turret and it teleports you to above the turret in the ceiling and I eventually got stuck up there.  At that point I teleported outside and since I had only just started I just gave up and realized I was short on stimpacks to really make it all the way thru.
---
Bethesda literally told everyone before launch that the game was going to be buggy as hell, because this is new shit for them. I have no pity for anyone who bought the game and then was butthurt that the game was exactly as advertised.
---
As to "being told how to use what you've bought" you know license agreements are a thing right? Bethesda can and does reserve the right to revoke your license to play their game, without refunding you, when you violate those terms. 
---
I saw one there two. Had a few normal bucket heads with him too. 
---
no i‚Äôm actually being serious, i‚Äôve been looking for a reason to end it all and this seems like the perfect candidate
---
simple. if the vault 96 shit doesn‚Äôt get explored more in the story, i will blow my head off
---
mic is enabled, but then it gives me all the options for which apps have access to it, bethesda and bethesday launcher aren't even shown in the list
---
Are you on PC? I‚Äôve been looking for plans for ultracite power armor. Have any extras? ( or for trade )?
---
Im with you. The first contents release is in Feb and is over a few weeks. Hopefully it's worth the wait.
---
I mean that was how the original isometric Fallouts (1, 2, Tactics) worked. So it's not even a stretch to imagine it in the Falloutverse.
---
awww so cute. my bf and i live together so we usually fight about whos turn it is lol we are seriously considering getting a second ps4 just so we can play together&lt;3 SOON. we broke af lol
---
FO4 got a lot more playtime out of me.  More quests, more to build, and of course more actual characters.
---
FO76 was great to play and I got a couple hundred hours out of it, but I can‚Äôt mod it and it‚Äôs too easy.
---
FO4 is better.  FO76 is a good addition to the series, but once you explore the world it fizzles out.
---
Play both.
---
I found BOS Combat Plans from Camden Park as well as Grafton Station and Watoga Shopping Plaza.
---
I keep my TSE weapon out, but I will bash the legendary and lead it to the others and allow them to tag it before I send the legendary to meet its gods. 
---
No, that's pretty much exactly it. Roger Maxson wanted to gsther technology not only to keep it out of the wrong hands- like the politicians he lost faith in- but also so it could be used to help people when the time came to rebuild society. but his successors misinterpreted his intentions and did it because "nobody can be trusted with this advanced tech."
---
I'm glad we got to actually hear from Roger Maxson in this game, even if it's in the form of a holotape recording of a satellite radio broadcast. Helps us actually know who he was. In hindsight, he'd probably be rolling in his grave after seeing how his decendand Arthur ran things.
---
&gt; tiring and unrewarding grind from this poor game design
---
finally someone who calls it out as it is,its amazing how much fucking RNG is in this game ,find 3 star legendary kill said 3 star legendary (1st rng proc to find the 3 star legendary) hope they drop the weapon you want (2nd proc of rng) hope they give you a primary affix that doesnt suck (3rd proc of rng) and hope thye give you a secondary affix that doesnt suck (4th proc of rng)  literally a slot machine
---
How is that even remotely an equivalent situation? Bethesda explicitly told people that using exploits was a bannable offense, and included language reflecting that in their terms of service. 
---
I had some drop mines all around the cars at the bottom of Flatwoods and continue sticking me and a friend with a spear. This went on for a good 5 minutes or more. Enough of that, exploding the cars an the mines Slapped to the hell out of me and killed me. It happens
---
No?
---
By claiming a workshop you should be fully prepared for PvP as a result. If the other person got mad or "salty" then that's on them, not you.
---
How can they see who has done it? Like, i have 3000lbs of weapons, armour and stable flux on a mule. Every weapon/armour piece is different, as they are all the legendary items i have accumulated, that do not wish to get rid of for future sales. I would not want to be caught in the purge, if weight is how they would siphon out hackers etc.
---
It was not. 
---
Holy shoot! I met Kent in Fallout 4 but I never saw this connection!
---
Just from the weekly events and the survival mode. I just don't see anything good coming from any dlc 
---
To the victor, go the spoils.
---
I don‚Äôt think a cap should be imposed. Think of it this way..
---
You‚Äôre in survival mode, 
---
You get mugged by someone else in 1v1 pvp.
---
You die and respawn, while the bad guy is rummaging through your pockets.
---
If no weight limit imposed then, he‚Äôs overburdened carrying both gear.
---
Greed is predictable.
---
When you respawn you and a pal, mug him, 2v1 pvp, and loot his pockets.
---
You AND YOUR PAL get to split the gear unhindered.
---
Note I fully expect roving bands of asshats to mug and kill, each other in survival mode.
---
The victors will be, who quickly can adapt and counter their fighting style based on their opponents 
---
Melee vs ranged vs..dps..
---
don't forget PA mods that don't work ,optimized bracers servos etc all bugged since launch
---
I wouldn‚Äôt pay a cap for it.  PA is not rare.
---
I want DLC for the Lucky Hole mine.
---
Every character in game has a "log" that the developers can see and filter. They are just being lazy. 
---
That's a terrible analogy. 
---
cry me a river!
---
As others have said it's for "rolling back" your headlamp mods. I went to bright and when they made the headlamp changes a patch or so back it was Way to bright. So I found a regular one and changed back to the original headlamp.
---
That isn't how any of this works...wasn't even a very good attempt to justify your shenanigans.
---
MARSUPIAL AND BIRD BONES MUTATIONS MOTHER FUCKER
---
I couldn't move at all unfortunately.
---
it's more like," it's jack daniels fault i'm drunk,drove a car and smashed into a house. don't be mad at me be mad at jack.
---
3d printers, more than a car is worth in raw printing materials and (hopefully) existing extensive mechanical knowledge.
---
Fire breather paint for 10mm pistol
---
I thought the auto grenade used explosives perk, not heavy weapons
---
Ahh I see, were the outcasts in new Vegas as well or were they not the people in the rusted power armor?
---
Use the 2* magnetic personality perk when you are with a team, that will allow you to share higher level perks. (If im solo, I have 1* lone wanderer equipped which requires two points to use, when I team up, I swap that out with magnetic )
---
I could be wrong, but when I have my unyielding armor on, I can share a 3* perk (which would require 9 chr.) I have a base chr of only 5
---
Maybe try the trade sub and don‚Äôt clutter up this sub.
---
I had both squirrels and chickens at various points at my camp today.  My camp attracts all sorts of wildlife it seems...cats, mongrels, opossums, deer, squirrels, rad toads (those little mutant frogs, not the big guys), chickens have all been seen there
---
Duping destroyed the player economy, and is likely producing server instability.
---
Duping deprives other players of experiencing the game as it had been meant to. 
---
Diseased robots? Lolz
---
Thats definitely one solution. 
---
Thanks. I agree, those turret farm players are shits and I always shit on them if I see that they have a turret farm.
---
Ooooh hahaha, I see what's happening here. You're a neckbeard faggot from r/fallout that got lost. Nobody wants to hear your shit, loser.
---
Bye bye cunt, you're blocked :-)
---
This would make a good weekly or monthly event!!! I would an event like this but I can almost guarantee that it would be nuked quickly for the plant growth. I still think this would amazing event to have in the game!!!
---
The one time i've run into a duper online, I got talking to them about why they were doing it. 
---
They said that the only reason they were duping (mostly TSE weapons) was to make their money back after they were refused a refund. 
---
Apparently they had ended up making well over the ¬£65 odd that Bethesda refused to refund. 
---
As someone who was also refused a refund (though am now trying to get back into it with current patches) I just congratulated them and went along my way. 
---
Ah right, i figired the way they would do it would be to do like "filter everyone out that has 3000lbs+ on one of their mules.... ban them"
---
same. was able to respawn nearby to get my loot but someone took it before i could even get close ;-; rip.
---
Yeah, when I load in it's normally just basic nature, and noise. Then my base loads in, and after that the enemies. 
---
I've been doing that lately, its pretty fun. I'll stock up on low level stuff I've found or a bunch of meds or food and I'll go up to a random low level and drop some goodies and then just run off haha. 
---
I have a shotgun that I use with enforcer perk to cripple them, then when they land I go to town with melee
---
I tried playing yesterday and it did this. I tried everything for 10 min then went to a different game. 
---
This game is giving me reasons to not play it. 
---
They're already nerfing the weapons at the end of the month, they will be much less insane.
---
3d printing a car harms no one. It's not even illegal to 3d print your own Ferrari (for personal use) because of the precedent of body kits.
---
Duping actually hurts others though because all the methods cause servers to lag or crash.
---
I dont think they will ban anyone who has excessive items that they've looted from a duper but rather erase those items from your inventory. Even dupers are getting warnings and just their inventories wiped instead of bans. 
---
It works for me *shrugs*
---
Okay now that sounds like something I can do, I plan on using shotguns as my secondary weapon type so I should probably get that perk. 
---
Saw some of what you describe on xb1.   And an odd occurrence where two sub 30 level people were at the whitesprings golf club and it was not full of gouls.  It was full of level 50 non whitesprings protectrons.  ... and they were all legendary.   
---
Things that make you go hmmm....
---
so making a copy of someone's credit card isn't stealing because they used a digital scanner?
---
So they can ban me and everyone else duping, oh well I guess? *shrugs*
---
Over the past few days I've been frequently crashing past few days and getting the server not responding messaging. (on PC)
---
I had a mod that added iguanas to FO3 :)
---
There were no outcasts in New Vegas. Just the Mojave branch of the Brotherhood of Steel. However the NCR was able to salvage some suits of power armor, and they were altered to not need power armor training to use. That may be what you remember as "rusted power armor" since they did have a brown ncr bear on the chest.
---
2k caps
---
I was pure melee for a while.  Honestly you wait for them to land then chop them 3 times and be on your way.  Also, take it for what worit's worth, but I found using explosive bait helps your cause.  I have no data to support this claim.. except me saying i think it helps.
---
People whining about being downvoted usually invite more downvotes.
---
I thought you were talking about lizards from fallout 4.
---
It depends on a few things I would say. It's nice you didn't take their junk. I leave the junk usually, except if I look and see springs I can't help myself, but if they seek revenge and I kill them again then I'm taking the junk. It depends on levels, if you are a lot higher level, or if you have some OP TSE and they don't, then I see that as kind of unfair and being an asshole, when you could have just server hopped and take an empty one. Not everyone wants to pvp. 
---
I will usually check the map and see if I see the workshop owner. If they are lower level I won't bother with it. If I don't see them on the map for a while after checking repeatedly to see what level they are, maybe they are stealth somewhere, I might take it. 
---
I don't really feel good about taking somebody elses workshop, unless it looks like they have abandoned it. It's not worth ruining somebody elses experience over, unless they are the one trying to take my workshop, then they are choosing that experience. Some people just want to play the pve game and don't want to pvp and I'm considerate and understanding of that and wouldn't want to force it on them.
---
I'd rather invest for better inventory lol. Maybe with content updates we'll end up with another faction with another faction vendor. More caps to farm will just make caps worth less and make it more work to gather them.
---
But..
---
What if you couldn‚Äôt pvp in adventure mode? Lolz
---
The screenshots for the beta say, you get2 options 
---
Adventure and survival.
---
What if you chose adventure hoping to pvp, but got sent to survival, over something stupid
---
Like slap damage?
---
THATS, how it should be done.ü§¨
---
No ifs ands or but..
---
Enforcer 100%, along with a double barrel for accuracy, or an automatic combat shotgun for quick hits. It will land very quickly.
---
That makes more sense. None of my items were looted from dupers, just whitesprings grinding etc. Never want to grt rid of anything, as i was a hoarder on fo4 and cannot change my ways. Actually lost 500lbs of stuff earlier from getting dc'd as well as my mate, whilst changing from main to mule. It is the risk we take eh.
---
That could be it, I just remembered different power armor and my brain put it with the ones I remembered
---
Yes!! My cave base needs these walls! 
---
Thanks for your perspective.
---
I was using photomode!
---
Not at all.  You're informed when you claim it you may be engaged in PvP 
---
Appreciate your viewpoint.
---
I have seen this with my friends kid, 1 kid will goad the other into cursing in a message then report the them.
---
I'll give that a try as well thanks.

My perfect storm is level 40

Alright cool, thanks.

Seems like monster mash spawns a legendary or two also ... still to my knowledge it doesn‚Äôt get much better than White Springs after it‚Äôs been nuked

This game is heavy on pve from the perspective of Reddit. 
---
Oof
---
I've been seeing it done for a while now. Thankfully I have encountered it very little and have my own TSE to counter them with. I typically gun bash the legendary or shoot it with my trusty gatling gun once then lead it to the others before killing it.
---
I just did a wider kind of balcony on a new one I'll have it up tomorrow most likely!
---
Well full sentinel assassin armor means 75% dam res from sentinel, 40% from assassin, 30% from lone wanderer, then could have dodgy or serendipity. So that ends up being like 145% - 205% damage resist, if it adds.
---
If not still let's say it takes 75% then 40% of what's left is like 15% then 30% drops to 10% damage. Then add in serendipity and dodgy (if he is at low hp) and he has a good chance to completely avoid that last 10% possible. 
---
So yeah no way to kill this build.
---
Looks a lot better too
---
Wait until you level 50 before going for the All Rise or doing Major for a Day quest.
---
I personally got a lamp pa plan there. I‚Äôve gotten the jet pack mod there as well. I did have to server hop but that‚Äôs where I got them at. 
---
Not sure why you didn't get anything, but I have a L 50 Perfect Storm from waiting
---
Yeah. Everyone spending the caps to take a workshop is told it can be contested and fought over via pvp.
---
He probably couldn‚Äôt get back fast enough to fight you for it because he was taking other workshops..lolz
---
It depends how you fight.  I don't like wearing power armor so,  blocking,  ironclad,  fireproof,  barbarian, evasive are a good place to start. 
---
There's nothing to say that comes after the Mountainside tape, though.
---
Mines 50
---
Well actually now that i remember it, new vegas had both T-45 and T-51, unlike 3 which only had 45, with the exception of two special 51 suits. So in 3 all Brotherhood armor looked the same, while in NV the brotherhood had two kinds of suits. Could be you just assumed one of the BoS' armors was an Outcasts suit.
---
 As I said, as far as I know, you are the only person this has happened to.
---
That's awesome!  Someone found a good use for that pose.  I like the Tesla coil sparking onstage
---
It didn't auto ban, he said a swear, got reported, then got temp banned. Zero tolerance is zero tolerance.
---
I tried to get into white springs after it was nuked. I‚Äôm a lowbie but it won‚Äôt let me.
---
Had to walk it in.
---
I‚Äôm on PC
---
This is also why I am not super excited for the pvp mode. 
---
"What the fuck?" is bullying now, ok. 
---
Yeah mine too level 40, brought mine from a vendor someone had sold.
---
Do you mind clarifying if I am or am not the asshole? Thanks!
---
I had a behemoth and and a lvl 40 Grafton monster team up on a white spring sentry bot 
---
It does. I have 12, but regularly share level 5 perks with various buffs. Herd mentality and unyielding effects don't allow perk sharing. You can click share, but it will unshare itself as soon as you take your cursor off the card.
---
Chems will let you share, but only until the chem expires or you take your cursor off the card.
---
+1 armor pieces create a stable share, unless you get in power armor.
---
The magnetic personality perk also creates a stable share unless the number of people on your team fluctuates.
---
I commented above, but your phantom -1 is from an addiction. They don't show on the status screen . Stay safe traveler.
---
This is one of those "fantasy" vs "reality" moments in which you need to be careful what you wish for.
---
At least lockpicks aren‚Äôt a tenth of a pound anymore.
---
Belching Betty mine in the Firebreather quest chain
---
Fair enough! I'll have to double check every piece of legendary wood armor I come across from now on 
---
Don't get me wrong, I like the game. Why else would I be here? All I'm saying is, enjoy it while you can; one way or another, the future looks bleak. 
---
Mines 45
---
It‚Äôs not that the second effects get cut in half, the math is as follows:
---
Let‚Äôs take your example with 80 DR. Due to the AA effect, the enemy loses 50% DR, leaving him with 40. From THIS value, the percentage of the second effect will get subtracted. (In your example 45%) 40 DR - 45% DR = 22 DR
---
Meaning: the first effect will be taken into account on the whole DR of the enemy, the second effect will be taken into account on the result of the first reduction due to the first effect and so on. 
---
 whitespring nukezones prenerf. made lvling very easy.
---
I've actually figured it would be great if they did what Runescape does when you're in the Wilderness; if you do not attack an enemy first and die you will keep 3 of your most valued items, but the person attacking first will drop everything as punishment for engaging first.
---
Definition of a Pacifist is someone who doesn't believe in War and Violence. That doesn't mean you can't be killed or things destroyed. Not saying that is right. They should let the first six to a dozen shots do nothing and then unleash an orbital drop on themselves for their trouble. Call it the Rubber Adhesive Rule. Ka-Boom!
---
I had this happen to me once, it‚Äôs Modus and you‚Äôll meet him later. 
---
Why did you comment twice
---
You think a person clicked ban or a script looked for key words? Auto banned. 
---
Nope I'm going WAY back to Fallout 2 days.
---
You were huntiing for the GECK as part of the plot of Fallout 2.
---
Definitely a STASH increase.
---
New Nuke bosses for sure
---
Static boxes: to pass on to others that pass by and to add stealable STASHs for raider roleplay
---
Freezer and similar items also part of static boxes
---
Another purchasable C.A.M.P. (dont really care for room renting, i like to construct)
---
Forgot about it.  Started a second play through with a friend and just got it again on that character.  I instantly thought it would make a great end game weapon if I waited until after 50 on another character.  Everything I've found online, however, said it was locked at level 10.  Good to know that's not the case.
---
I woulda let the douchebaggery die, and loot his corpse..lolz
---
I swear the amount of times this Bot has stopped moving
---
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy this game, a lot. I think the story is the best in FO so far. It's half the player base that derive their fun from exploiting stuff that make me roll my eyes.
---
I did that event in the Cranberry Bog. It was ridiculous. üòÇ
---
No I get, I'm not arguing with you or anything but from others I've seen on here, they have said they are only available from level 15-45
---
The best times are when you know you're almost there and it decides to get stuck on something
---
Quality mechanics üëå
---
Was that for x01?
---
That's also possible I haven't played new Vegas in quite a while but i remember seeing patrols that looked different
